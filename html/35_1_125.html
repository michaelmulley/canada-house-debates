statutory programs.
<P>
<B>(1010 ) </B>
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce my private 
member's bill, the short title of which is the Statutory Program 
Evaluation Act. This bill will establish a process whereby all 
statutory program spending is reviewed by Parliament on a 
cyclical basis.
<P>
	In his 1993 report, the Auditor General stated that some 70 per 
cent of all government spending is now statutory spending. 
Spending is not reviewed or even voted on by Parliament once 
the original bill is enacted. It has been many a long year since 
Parliament voted on some statutory programs, spending 
millions of dollars annually.
<P>
	I believe this bill has significance in that it will turn the tide of 
authority which has been flowing from Parliament to 
government and cabinet back to the elected representatives and 
Parliament.
<P>
	Spending without review or analysis is clearly unacceptable 
in these times of burgeoning debt. The Statutory Program 
Evaluation Act would cause the examination of all program 
spending based on the following objective criteria. First, is the 
program still required, is it relevant, or are we just spending 
money by virtue of habit? Second, is the program effective in 
meeting its objectives or are we spending money with the 
greatest of intentions but missing the mark? Third, is the 
program being delivered efficiently knowing that our resources 
are limited and that our taxpayers deserve good management? 
Fourth, can the purposes of the program be better achieved 
through different means?
<P>
	The Auditor General stated that the program evaluation act 
has great potential to save millions of dollars and I call on my 
colleagues to support the bill.

assistance of a physician.
<P>
	Therefore the petitioners call upon Parliament to amend the 
code to ensure the right of all Canadians to die with dignity by 
allowing people with terminal or irreversible and debilitating 
illness the right to the assistance of a physician in ending their 
lives at a time of their choice subject to strict safeguards to 
prevent abuse and to ensure that the decision is free, informed, 
competent and voluntary.

	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (for the Leader of the Government 
in the House of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, 
Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-58, an act to to amend the Public 
Service Staff Relations Act and the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police Act, be read the second time and referred to committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, on March 10, 1994 the Federal Court of 
Appeal decided on its judgment on the Queen v. Yvon R.H. 
Gingras that RCMP members were entitled to the bilingual 
bonus now paid to eligible federal public servants.
<P>
	The court ruled in this case that the bilingual bonus had to be 
paid because the RCMP was listed as one of the agencies for 
which Treasury Board is the employer under part 1 of schedule 1 
of the Public Service Staff Relations Act.
<P>
	According to the ruling RCMP members, both uniformed and 
civilian, are part of the public service. This government is 
taking appropriate steps to respect the court decision and to live 
up to its obligation to pay the bonus to current and former 
members of the RCMP who are entitled to it.
<P>
	Strictly speaking, the court's decision dealt only with the 
bilingual bonuses issue. It therefore did not address issues of 
labour relations or issues of health and safety. In this sense, the 
legislation confirms that the existing arrangements should 
continue.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to stress the fact that within the RCMP, in 
accordance with the divisional work relations system in place, 
management meets with representatives who are elected by the 
members. I can assure you that the RCMP occupational safety 
and health measures are totally in line with the requirements of 
the Canada Labour Code.
<P>
	The bill we are bringing in today will clarify the status of the 
RCMP by amending several provisions of the Public Service 
Staff Relations Act and of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police 
Act.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	The proposed amendments do not change the status of the 
RCMP. They only confirm the status it had before the Federal 
Court ruling.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As such, the amendments merely remedy ambiguities in the 
legislation not intended by Parliament. I ask the support of this 
House for this bill.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, upon first glance Bill C-58 appears to be a 
rather innocuous bill. It is only two pages long with four 
amendments. It seems to be just a housecleaning measure.
<P>
	The changes in this bill put into statute what has been in 
practice for years. Police officers within the RCMP have never 
viewed themselves as members of the public service within the 
meaning of the Public Service Staff Relations Act. They have a 
separate superannuation plan. They have a separate means of 
employee representation. They have a different body to review 
grievances and they have always considered themselves to be 
outside the regular public service.
<P>
	Now we have a bill before us that puts this into statute. It is no 
big deal. It is really just confirming what is already a reality in 
one sense perhaps. However, one must look at what prompted 
the introduction of this bill.
<P>
	It is not stated anywhere in the bill but acknowledged by the 
speaker before me, the hon. secretary of state. The motivation of 
this bill is a Federal Court appeal decision from March 10, 1994. 
In rendering its decision in Gingras v. the Queen in the right of 
Canada, the court concluded that the RCMP was included in the 
definition of the Public Service Staff Relations Act.
<P>
	As such, it was required to pay the bilingual bonus that has 
been paid to the public service for years but had not been paid 
within the RCMP. Not only did the RCMP suddenly find itself 
having to pay the bilingual bonus, it was also required to pay a 
significant accumulation of bilingual back pay. This amount 
will run into millions of dollars.
<P>
	Last year the RCMP spent $5.1 million on official languages, 
not including these retroactive bilingual bonus commitments.
<P>
	Under the Gingras decision, the force will be required to pay 
all members who occupy positions that were designated as 
bilingual. In recent years the RCMP has not designated specific 
positions as being bilingual. Instead it has utilized the unit 
bilingual complement system.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7897"> 7897 </A></B>
<P>
	Ironically, in its main estimates this year the RCMP stated 
that it was reinstating the bilingual position designation system 
in all bilingual divisions. These bilingual divisions include 
headquarters as well as A division, which is the national capital 
region, C division which is Quebec, J division in New 
Brunswick and O division in Ontario.
<P>
	The force stated that it was required to reinstate the bilingual 
position designation to meet its obligations under the Official 
Languages Act, particularly as it relates to supervisory 
positions. The force does not mention how many of its positions 
are designated as bilingual but if it were to be 10 per cent of the 
non-civilian positions this would result in an additional 
expenditure of $1.3 million. If 25 per cent of the positions were 
to be designated as bilingual that would mean another $3.2 
million.
<P>
	Faced with this unexpected expenditure, the RCMP and 
government are looking for a way to get out of these payments. 
They had to look no further than the Gingras decision to find a 
way to get out of these payments.
<P>
	It turned out that Mr. Gingras was a member of the RCMP 
security service in 1984. When that organization became the 
Canadian Security Intelligence Service he was transferred to 
CSIS. When it was created, CSIS was designated a separate 
employer. This means that CSIS employees do not have the 
Treasury Board as their employer and that the bilingualism 
bonus plan does not automatically apply to them. On August 7, 
1984 Mr. Gingras' counsel asked the director of CSIS, Ted Finn, 
to recognize that Mr. Gingras was entitled to the bilingual 
bonus.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	In a response dated March 5, 1985 Mr. Finn replied that he had 
decided to provide the bilingual bonus to employees in the 
administrative support category only and excluded the 
professional level position, including the one occupied by Mr. 
Gingras.
<P>
	Mr. Finn justified his position by stating that Mr. Gingras did 
not qualify for the bilingual bonus in his previous position in the 
RCMP and he would not change that now that he was in CSIS.
<P>
	In the Federal Court of Appeal ruling the justices found that 
the RCMP should have been paying the bonus all along. The 
court ruled that RCMP members were indeed public servants 
and that the RCMP was represented by the Treasury Board and 
thus the force was compelled to pay the bilingual bonus.
<P>
	The RCMP was required to pay Mr. Gingras the bilingual 
bonus from November 28, 1980 when he first raised the issue 
until he transferred to CSIS on July 16, 1984. CSIS was required 
to pay Mr. Gingras the bilingual bonus from July 16, 1984 until 
March 5, 1985. Why March 5, 1985? Because that is the date that 
the director of CSIS decided that the bilingual bonus plan would 
only apply to CSIS employees in the administrative support 
category.
<P>
	The court ruled that as a separate employer CSIS had the legal 
right not to pay the bilingual bonus. Once the director decreed 
that the service would not pay it to professional categories they 
legally could avoid paying it.
<P>
	The court ruled that there were two required elements to avoid 
paying the bonus. First, the government agency must be a 
separate employer. Second, the agency must decide not to pay 
the bonus. Thus CSIS qualified on both points not to pay the 
bonus but the RCMP did not. Yet the RCMP decided that it 
would not pay the bonus.
<P>
	Back in 1977 then Commissioner Bob Simmonds decreed that 
the bonus did not apply to the RCMP. While this comment was 
subsequently deemed to be an error in law, his reasoning for not 
seeking authority to pay the bonus was sound.
<P>
	Commissioner Simmonds decided that the RCMP should not 
pay the bilingualism bonus on two grounds. First, other police 
forces in Canada did not pay bilingualism bonuses even in 
bilingual cities or provinces, and since the RCMP determined its 
benefit package in relation to the police universe it was not 
prepared to be the only police force to pay such bonuses.
<P>
	Second, the commissioner went on to state that the payment of 
such a bonus would become a divisive element as it would create 
situations in which members of equal rank and responsibility 
working side by side could receive differing remuneration 
because one or several of them had either the good fortune to 
grow up in a milieu favourable to learning a second official 
language or have the equally good fortune to learn it at public 
expense.
<P>
	This was sound logic in 1977 and it is still sound logic today. 
Why should the RCMP spend taxpayers' money to train some of 
its members in Canada's other official language and then turn 
around and financially reward them for having a second 
language? Then again, why should any government department 
spend taxpayers' money to train some of its employees in 
Canada's other official language and then reward them with 
$800 a year bonus?
<P>
	The RCMP main estimates show that there are other rewards 
for being bilingual. As I mentioned earlier the RCMP stated that 
it is reinstating the bilingual position designation in all bilingual 
regions in order to meet its obligations under the Official 
Languages Act, particularly as it relates to supervisory 
positions. Since bilingualism is a required element to obtain a 
promotion to a supervisory position in a bilingual region then 
maybe that is sufficient reward for bilingualism.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7898"> 7898 </A></B>
<P>
	Whatever the reason, the RCMP and the government have 
decided that they should not be paying the bilingualism bonus 
plan to its police officers. That is why today we are debating Bill 
C-58. The bill will give the RCMP the second requirement to 
avoid paying the bonus. By removing the RCMP from the Public 
Service Staff Relations Act the force will therefore be a separate 
employer. All it will have to do is have Commissioner Murray 
announce that it will not be paying the bonus and it will be 
legally exempt from doing so.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	Well, almost. The force has decided not to remove its civilian 
employees from the Public Service Staff Relations Act. For 
whatever reason, the RCMP has decided that civilian 
employees, appointed or employed in accordance with section 
10 of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act, will still be 
covered by the PSSRA. There may be other reasons for treating 
them separately from the police officers within the RCMP, but it 
is clear the force will have to continue paying the bilingual 
bonus to these employees.
<P>
	Current management seems to have forgotten the words of 
former Commissioner Simmonds who stated that payment of 
such a bonus would have a divisive effect on employees. Some 
may argue that the bonus is justified for civilian members 
because they are generally lower paid support staff. In the 
RCMP the 1,919 civilian employees of the force had an average 
salary of $46,178 per year. While Commissioner Simmonds' 
comment may have been made in reference to police officers 
within the force, the same divisive effect could occur among 
civilian employees.
<P>
	Why should a civilian employee of the RCMP in a position 
that is designated as bilingual receive $800 more than an 
employee who is doing exactly the same job in a position that is 
not designated as bilingual? Why should we limit this to just 
bilingualism in the RCMP?
<P>
	Consider the following comment: ``This year approximately 
$50 million was once again spent without any assurance that the 
payment of such a sum was necessary to ensure Canadians of the 
availability of quality service in the official language of their 
choice. Given the present economic circumstances we are more 
than ever convinced that the bilingualism bonus should be 
eliminated gradually by negotiating with the parties concerned. 
In the interests of public finances as much as that of the official 
languages program, it is high time for the government to take the 
problem in hand''.
<P>
	If those words sound familiar, they are. They were spoken by 
the Commissioner of Official Languages in March of this year 
when he presented his annual report for 1993. While I take some 
exception with the commissioner's comments about eliminating 
the plan gradually, I fully agree with his recommendation that 
the government should turn its attention to this problem without 
delay.
<P>
	The government should not have to resort to such sleight of 
hand legislation as Bill C-58. The RCMP should not be paying 
out millions of dollars in bilingual bonuses to regular members 
and special constables. Nor should the RCMP be paying the 
bilingual bonus to its civilian employees. Nor should any 
government department, agency or crown corporation be paying 
any of its employees the bonus. The government must come to 
terms with reality. That bonus must be dropped. When even the 
Commissioner of Official Languages is calling for its 
elimination it is time to drop the payments.
<P>
	Bill C-58 seems like an innocuous bill. I am sure it was 
intended to be. The government certainly does not want to be 
seen as attacking any portion of the official languages program, 
but it intends to use the bill to circumvent it.
<P>
	The time has come for the government to be straight with the 
Canadian public. It is time to scrap the entire bilingual bonus 
plan. We will support the bill because it takes a step toward 
eliminating the bonus, even if it has to take ten steps sideways to 
take one step forward.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. FranÃ§ois Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
speaking on behalf of the Official Opposition, I wish to express 
my objections to Bill C-58 at the second reading stage. We are 
not alone, since the Canadian Police Association, including 
associations of RCMP officers, did so yesterday. I would like to 
quote from the minutes of a meeting held at their headquarters 
here in Ottawa on November 14 and 15, on the subject of Bill 
C-58.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	AndrÃ© Girard submitted copies of Bill C-58 introduced for 
first reading on November 4 and scheduled for second reading 
on November 17, 1994. If the bill is passed it will give separate 
employer status to the RCMP commissioner and leave the 
members vulnerable on all issues of pay and benefits.
<P>
	It was decided to treat Bill C-58 as CPA priority and direct 
Scott Newark to take all necessary action to make sure the bill 
was sent to a parliamentary committee, vigorously debated and 
defeated.
<P>
	It was moved by AndrÃ© Nadon, seconded by Jim Davidson:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the RCMP C and O Division Members' Associations have full support 
of the Canadian Police Association and that the CPA take all necessary steps to 
fight Bill C-58 on their behalf.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It was carried unanimously.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, our objections to Bill C-58 are two-fold. First, 
this ostensibly routine legislation is, in fact, aimed at 
invalidating the effect of the judgment handed down by the 
Federal Court Appeal Division in the Gingras case on March 19, 
1994. I intend to focus particularly on this aspect.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7899"> 7899 </A></B>
<P>
	Second, Bill C-58 constitutes an additional obstacle to union 
membership for members of the RCMP, as well as interference 
by the legislative with the judiciary, since a case is still pending 
before the Quebec Court of Appeal. I am referring to Delisle vs 
the Deputy Solicitor General of Canada and the Solicitor 
General of Canada, file 500-09-001747-898 of the Montreal 
appeal district.
<P>
	I will now discuss my first point. Two of my colleagues in the 
Official Opposition rose in the House to address this particular 
matter. The first time was on March 11, 1994, when the hon. 
member for Laval-Centre, in a question directed to the Solicitor 
General, asked as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Solicitor General. Yesterday, the Federal 
Court of Appeal ordered the federal government to pay bilingualism bonuses of 
$800 a year to qualified officers of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. It is 
estimated that the government now owes up to $4,000 to more than 3,000 
officers, as well as to retired officers of the RCMP. Does the Solicitor General 
intend to abide by the unanimous decision of the Federal Court of Appeal and 
pay the bilingualism bonus to qualified officers of the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	And the Solicitor General's reply:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Speaker, that decision raises some very complex issues. It is presently 
under review, and I will have more information about that in the near future.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The ``near future'' came two months later. On May 10, the 
hon. member for Richelieu rose in the House to make a 
statement under Standing Order 31. He said as follows, and I 
quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Speaker, the Bloc Quebecois applauds the government's decision to 
finally comply with the Federal Court of Appeal judgment and pay a 
bilingualism bonus to RCMP members who occupy bilingual positions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This puts an end to a lengthy dispute between RCMP members and their 
employer who, must it be reminded, had decided not to provide this bonus, 
supposedly ``to preserve cohesion within the forces''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If it is serious about bilingualism, the government must continue to pay 
bilingual bonuses inasmuch as it provides true incentive and compensation for 
the added complexity of bilingual positions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Considering there is much room for improvement in the federal Public 
Service, particularly with regard to the use of French, the government must 
make sure this bonus is awarded for language skills of the highest level to 
provide services of the highest quality.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	That was the end of the statement under Standing Order 31 
made by the hon. member for Richelieu.
<P>
	The government did not appeal the decision of the Appeal 
Division of the Federal Court. The case did not go to the 
Supreme Court, although in March, the minister maintained that 
some very important principles were at stake. We now know 
why. The minister had decided to take a difficult approach. 
Instead of asking the Supreme Court for a definitive opinion on 
the legal aspects of this case, the government decided to 
legislate, and that legislation is Bill C-58 before the House 
today.  The government decided to go after its own justice, not 
by appealing to the Supreme Court, but instead by presenting to 
the House a bill which, to all intents and purposes, is aimed at 
rendering null and void the court's decision in the Gingras case.
<P>
	Indeed, Bill C-58 seeks to overturn the decision handed down 
by the Appeal Division of the Federal Court, on May 10, 1994, in 
the Gingras case, which concerned the more or less 17,500 
members of the RCMP. It should be pointed out that there are 
three distinct categories of employees working for the RCMP. 
The numbers I have were updated November 15, 1994, the day 
before yesterday.
<P>
	Regular members and special RCMP constables number 
15,551, whereas 1,983 civilians and 3,440 civil servants work 
for the RCMP.
<P>
	The 15,500 regular members are, in fact, police officers. They 
are not unionized. The 2,000 civilians are support staff working 
in laboratories, as technicians or specialists; an unspecified 
number of them belong to the administrative support category. 
They are not unionized either.
<P>
	The 3,500 civil servants are either administrative or support 
staff such as clerks, secretaries, stenographers, guards, 
caretakers and the like. They are all hired by the Public Service 
Commission or transferred from other departments. They 
belong to unions such as the Public Service Alliance of Canada.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, Bill C-58 seeks to overturn the 
Federal Court of Appeal's decision. In the Gingras case, the 
court came to the conclusion that members of the RCMP belong 
to the Public Service and, as such, must abide by the rules set by 
the Treasury Board and that they are entitled to the $800-a-year 
bilingual bonus.
<P>
	In May 1994, the government announced that it did not intend 
to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada and that it 
was going to pay the bilingual bonus to RCMP members, 
including retroactive payments for some of the years it had 
illegally denied RCMP members this bonus. All in all, 
retroactive payments could amount to $30 million.
<P>
	It seems that the Gingras decision disturbs the RCMP top 
brass because it means that, in certain cases, other Treasury 
Board regulations may apply to the RCMP and its police 
officers. Such regulations deal in particular with employment 
equity, the enforcement of the Official Languages Act, and 
working conditions. The right to unionize is being debated as 
part of the Delisle case, which I will deal with later.
<P>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="7900"> 7900 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	Schedule I of the Public Service Staff Relations Act contains a 
list of departments and other agencies having the Treasury 
Board as employer, that is to say that are part of the Public 
Service, and a list of agencies which are separate employers. 
The RCMP is listed in Part I of Schedule I, and that makes it a 
part of the Public Service.
<P>
	Bill C-58 would remove the RCMP from the Public Service, 
and therefore the Treasury Board would cease to be its 
employer. Consequently, the RCMP would be subject to 
legislation applicable to public servants only if it were 
specifically referred to in such legislation. Treasury Board 
policies would no longer apply to the RCMP, except if the 
RCMP itself decided to follow them, but that would be on a 
strictly voluntary basis.
<P>
	Since December 1992, the Financial Administration Act has 
been the legal basis of the Employment Equity Program set up 
by Treasury Board in the mid 80s. All departments and agencies 
having the Treasury Board as their employer are subject to the 
Employment Equity Act because they are part of the Public 
Service.
<P>
	Until recently, because the Commissioner had so decided, the 
RCMP was not subject to Treasury Board policies despite the 
fact that the force is listed in Part I, Schedule I of the Public 
Service Staff Relations Act. However, we should stress that the 
RCMP differs in some ways from the rest of the Public Service, 
and that has allowed the commissioner to pretend that the policy 
on bilingual bonuses did not apply to the RCMP.
<P>
	The decision of the Appeal Division of the Federal Court, 
made March 10, 1994, in the Gingras case, puts an end to such 
pretence. From now on, said the tree presiding judges 
unanimously, the RCMP is part of the Public Service. Therefore, 
since March 1994, the RCMP has had to apply all Treasury 
Board policies to its 17,500 employees. Bill C-58 puts an end to 
that. We must note that civilian employees of the RCMP, 
numbering approximately 3,440, were always fully subject to 
Treasury Board policies on employment equity and bilingualism 
because they were recruited by the Public Service Commission.
<P>
	The RCMP submits an annual report to the Treasury Board 
and is included in the Treasury Board's equity statistics. 
However, the RCMP decided a long time ago to implement the 
federal policy on employment equity for its 17,500 employees, 
which include 15,500 peace officers and 2,000 civilians. Instead 
of submitting an annual report to the Treasury Board and being 
subject to its rules, the RCMP decided to create its own system 
of co-operation with the Canadian Human Rights Commission, 
to which it submits an annual report.
<P>
	However you look at it, the system is an ad hoc one and, in 
principle, inefficient. By in effect reversing the March 1994 
decision, the government is seeking to exempt the RCMP from 
the Treasury Board's authority regarding labour relations and 
conditions of employment. Although the RCMP implements 
certain policies on a  voluntary basis, its goodwill is 
questionable, given that, for 19 years, it denied its members the 
bilingual bonus, thereby saving approximately $50 million, or 
$2.8 million annually.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	If one of the purposes of Bill C-58 is to stop the payment of 
bilingual bonuses to members of the RCMP, we can conclude 
that the government is adopting the Reform position. Do the 
Liberals intend to eliminate the bilingual bonus throughout the 
public service? If the government announces that it intends to 
pay the bonus to members occupying bilingual positions or if the 
RCMP commissioner decides to continue the bonus voluntarily, 
we can still say that the bill undermines the bilingual bonus 
policy, because the commissioner can terminate the bonus at any 
time.
<P>
	It seems that the Official Languages Act applies differently to 
the RCMP: service in both languages, equitable hiring, language 
of administration, language of instruction at the Regina school 
and other similar provisions.
<P>
	The member for Nanaimo-Cowichan believes that the 
Federal Court's decision in the Gingras case means that military 
personnel would also be entitled to the bilingual bonus. 
Unfortunately, under the act, military personnel are not 
considered part of the public service.
<P>
	The Public Service Staff Relations Act specifically excludes 
members of the RCMP. They cannot, therefore, apply for 
certification to the Public Service Staff Relations Board, 
although the Delisle case I mentioned earlier may change this. 
While Her Majesty in Right of Canada, represented by the 
Treasury Board, is ultimately their employer, members of the 
RCMP are excluded from the definition of ``employee'' for the 
purposes of the Public Service Staff Relations Act.
<P>
	At any rate, since RCMP members are presently part of the 
public service, this means that the RCMP remains subject to 
Treasury Board policies and standards. Only organizations with 
separate employer status are not subject to TB policies. Separate 
employers are paid a lump-sum each year, but are not required 
to comply with general policies regarding official languages or 
employment equity for example. Bill C-58 excludes the RCMP 
from the application of TB policies.
<P>
	The Financial Administration Act under which the Treasury 
Board was established sets several standards regarding the 
public service and government finance administration, except as 
specifically provided in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act 
and any other act that applies to the RCMP, such as the Official 
Languages Act.
<P>
	Bill C-58 provides for Treasury Board policies to no longer 
apply to members of the RCMP. Paragraph 7(1)(<I>e</I>) of the 
Financial Administration Act states clearly that the Treasury 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7901"> 7901 </A></B>
<P>
Board may act on matters relating to, and I quote: ``personnel 
management in the public  service of Canada, including the 
determination of the terms and conditions of employment''.
<P>
	Bill C-58 would add to the RCMP Act a provision by which 
paragraph 7(1)(<I>e</I>) would not apply to the RCMP. Therefore, 
terms and conditions of employment would be determined by 
the commissioner of the RCMP and the RCMP Act. This act 
does provide that staff may appeal to the RCMP external review 
committee.
<P>
	Without Bill C-58, the RCMP would presumably have had to 
gradually comply with Treasury Board occupational standards. I 
do not have the full list of TB standards and cannot compare 
them to those in effect within the RCMP under the RCMP Act, 
but I note that the Treasury Board has powers in the following 
areas: first, administration of the Employment Equity Act; 
second, administration of the Official Languages Act; third, 
financial management; fourth, annual expenditure plans; and 
fifth, personnel management and determination of terms and 
conditions of employment.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	As far as personnel management is concerned, it is interesting 
to note that, under Section 11(2) of the Financial Administration 
Act, the Public Service Commission is partly responsible for 
personnel management in other departments. In the case of 
RCMP members, however, it is the Treasury Board which plays 
this role.
<P>
	I note that the RCMP Act and some other acts make an 
exception for the RCMP given the nature of its work. Therefore, 
at this time, RCMP members' terms and conditions of 
employment are not identical to those of other public service 
employees. Among other things, RCMP members are excluded 
from the definition of ``public servant'' in the Public Service 
Staff Relations Act and cannot form a union.
<P>
	So we can ask ourselves why the government is not proposing 
at the same time to grant civilian employees of the 
RCMP-about 2,000 office and support workers-the same 
rights and privileges as their 3,400 colleagues who are already 
part of the public service. After all, neither group is composed of 
law enforcement officers.
<P>
	There is also an RCMP External Review Committee, whose 
mandate is ``to provide an independent review of grievances, 
formal discipline, and discharge and demotion appeals filed by 
members of the RCMP''. But, as the external committee points 
out in its annual reports, no document clearly spells out its 
jurisdiction. A member of the RCMP can ask the RCMP 
Commissioner to review a demotion or discharge. The 
Commissioner then asks the external committee to review the 
decision before settling the matter himself. The Commissioner 
is not required to follow the recommendations of the external 
committee.
<P>
	The external committee also notes in its annual report that the 
decisions of the RCMP arbitration committee cannot be 
appealed to the external committee. Again, everything rests on 
the good will of the RCMP Commissioner, who ultimately 
becomes both a judge and a party in the disputes that may arise 
within the RCMP. How can we leave the terms and conditions of 
employment up to the good will of the RCMP Commissioner?
<P>
	The external committee also stresses in its annual report that 
the grievance procedure is even more complex. In some cases, 
the Commissioner himself determines what kind of grievances 
can be submitted to the external committee.
<P>
	Let us now talk about the RCMP as a separate or almost 
separate employer. The Treasury Board is the employer of the 
Public Service and all public servants, according to the list in 
Part I of Schedule I to the Public Service Staff Relations Act. 
The RCMP is now listed in Part I of Schedule I and Bill C-58 
would replace the expression ``RCMP'' in this list with 
``civilian employees appointed or employed in accordance with 
section 10 of the RCMP Act'', who number 2,000. It would 
exclude the peace officers in the RCMP, who number 15,500. 
This same law presents a second list, in Part II of Schedule I, of 
sectors of the federal public service that are distinct employers.
<P>
	Note that the expression ``federal government employees'' 
takes in all government employees, including those who work 
for Crown corporations and the military. In all, there are 
550,000. The Public Service does not count employees of Crown 
corporations, the military and personnel of separate employers, 
who number about 235,000 in all.
<P>
	In particular, the separate employers in Part II of Schedule I 
include the Communications Security Establishment, CSE, and 
the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, CSIS.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-58 does not add the RCMP to the list in Part II of 
Schedule I, neither does it add the 15,500 members of the RCMP 
who are peace officers to this list. Therefore, the 15,500 
members of the RCMP who are peace officers will have the same 
status as members of the Canadian Forces; that is, they do not 
even appear in Part II of the schedule.
<P>
	In fact, only the personnel not paid with public funds, namely 
the employees of bars, restaurants and other service 
establishments on military bases, are listed there. However, the 
Commissioner of the RCMP would have the status of a separate 
employer. I think that not putting the 15,500 members of the 
RCMP who are peace officers in Part II of Schedule I would give 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7902"> 7902 </A></B>
<P>
the commissioner even more absolute control over his staff. 
Why? For what purpose? That is the hidden agenda in this bill.
<P>
	I now come to my second point, very briefly, because to a 
large extent it is now before the courts. Bill C-58 further 
infringes on the unionization of members of the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police and is unacceptable interference of the 
legislative authority in judicial matters, since a case on this 
issue is pending before the Quebec Court of Appeal. It is the 
case which I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, Delisle <I>v</I>. 
the Deputy Attorney General of Canada and the Solicitor 
General of Canada, which is to be heard by the Montreal District 
Court of Appeal in the coming months.
<P>
	In this legal proceeding, the plaintiff, GaÃ©tan Delisle, a 
member of the RCMP and member of the Quebec provincial 
association of the RCMP, is asking the courts of this country to 
declare unconstitutional all the provisions which prevent the 
Canadian Labour Board from issuing a certificate of 
accreditation for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and 
especially for its employees who are peace officers.
<P>
	The officers who are the plaintiffs in these proceedings are 
basing their argument on section 2 of the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms which provides for freedom of 
association. These plaintiffs argue that the freedom of 
association gives them the collective bargaining right, hence the 
right to unionize. This is an issue the Court of Appeal will have 
to settle, and I do not think that we, as legislators, should hinder 
the Court of Appeal and influence any interpretation it might 
give.
<P>
	The plaintiffs before the Quebec Court of Appeal, the police 
officers of the Quebec section of the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police, also refer to the equality rights enshrined in section 15 of 
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Why is it that in 
every Canadian jurisdiction, and especially in provincial 
jurisdictions, police officers can join a union, but that the 
federal legislation prevents members and police officers of the 
Royal Canadian Mounted Police from unionizing? Can we talk 
about inequality pursuant to section 15 of the Canadian Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms? This is another issue upon which the 
Quebec Court of Appeal will have to decide.
<P>
	Would it not be wiser to postpone this bill for six months or 
even longer until the court rules on the rights of the police 
officers and other bargainable employees of the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police, should they be successful with their court 
challenge?
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	For all these reasons, we will vote against Bill C-58 at the 
second reading stage.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are addressing Bill C-58, a bill to amend the Public 
Service Staff Relations Act and the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police Act. At first blush it appears to be just an innocuous 
housekeeping bill. However, this morning it became evident that 
the purpose of the bill is solely to avoid paying bilingual 
bonuses to the RCMP which resulted from the Federal Court of 
Appeal ruling in the Gingras case.
<P>
	At the time of the court decision the government said it had no 
choice but to pay the bilingual bonus. Not only is this untrue as it 
could have appealed to the Supreme Court but it is also 
misleading to Canadians as the government has now brought in 
this legislation as an attempt to quietly circumvent the court 
system.
<P>
	I give the bill the label of good news, bad news. It is good 
news in what it will do with regard to bilingual bonuses. It is bad 
news in the manner in which it is being brought into being and 
things that have been quietly put aside in the past.
<P>
	The Liberals were aware of the potential problems this case 
could create back in 1990. The Commissioner of Official 
Languages in the 1990 annual report wrote: ``The distribution of 
this bonus was also brought into question in 1990 when the 
Federal Court ruled that an RCMP officer was as much entitled 
to it as a public servant. If the appeal court decision does not 
reverse this judgment we may see other federal employees in the 
armed forces or in some crown corporations claiming the 
bilingual bonus, all the more reason to reform this rickety 
structure, especially in a period of budget cuts''.
<P>
	The Liberals were also well aware of the reasons for the 
judgment in that 1990 Federal Court ruling. At that time the 
court stated: ``The exclusion of the staff of these two agencies 
which are covered by the Public Service Staff Relations Act 
constituted illegal discrimination under the rules of 
administrative law''. That is the court talking. The Liberals 
knew this. They were sitting in this House, but they waited more 
than a year after coming to power a year ago to act on this 
problem.
<P>
	In April of this year in this House I asked the Prime Minister 
to heed the strong recommendation of the Commissioner of 
Official Languages and eliminate the bilingual bonus. At that 
time the Prime Minister stated: ``I do not think the 
commissioner has made a strong recommendation''. That is 
what he said, there is no strong recommendation, therefore we 
do not have to do anything about it.
<P>
	Before I quote the present Commissioner of Official 
Languages from his last report I would like to quote previous 
commissioners on this very issue.
<P>
	In 1983 the commissioner at that time stated: ``Six years and 
let us say almost a quarter of a billion dollars into the game, any 
question of the real contribution that the bilingualism bonus 
might be making to federal  language programs has pretty much 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7903"> 7903 </A></B>
<P>
been lost from view''. There is now nothing to prevent the cost 
climbing to $50 million or more except that a short, sharp 
government decision to stop this nonsense now before it does 
any more harm''. How prescient the commissioner was in 1983 
saying that because that is precisely the cost, $50 million a year, 
of bilingual bonuses today other than those of the RCMP.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	To go on with comments of other official language 
commissioners, in 1986 the commissioner wrote: ``There was at 
one point in 1985 a hint that Treasury Board was looking for 
ways to curtail whatever part of bonus spending might frankly 
be considered superfluous such as payments to middle and upper 
managers whose bilingualism is adequately compensated in 
other ways. It may be that the board is still looking and we 
encourage it to do so''.
<P>
	Let us move on to 1987 when the commissioner's report 
contained the following statement, and the Liberals sitting in 
this House were privy to all of this: ``The bilingualism bonus as 
an instrument to encourage more active work related 
bilingualism among public servants is not well attuned to 
present needs. It falls like heaven's rain indiscriminately on the 
just and unjust alike which is not how bonus incentives are 
supposed to work''.
<P>
	Similarly at the risk of being boring in 1988 the commissioner 
stated: ``Since the bonus no longer has the incentive effect that 
justified its creation, we can only repeat our recommendation 
that Treasury Board review the value of the bilingualism 
bonus''.
<P>
	That brings us to 1989 when the commissioner wrote: ``The 
awarding of a bilingualism bonus may originally have been a 
positive measure but over time it has proven to be more of an 
obstacle to a fair linguistic designation of positions and a source 
of inequities within the public service''.
<P>
	I have already stated the concerns of the commissioner in his 
1990 report so we will fast forward to 1991. That year the 
commissioner applauded the updating of the bilingualism bonus 
confirmation process but added: ``This updating clearly cannot 
be called a reform of the bonus system, a system whose 
disappearance we, like many others, continue to hope for. This 
bonus which originated in 1966 as a 7 per cent supplement to the 
salary paid to secretaries truly has nine lives''.
<P>
	The commissioner's 1992 report states: ``We are far from sure 
that this bonus paid to 59,900 public servants constitutes a 
necessary encouragement to the effective use of both languages. 
We can only reiterate the recommendation we have made so 
often that the bilingualism bonus be gradually eliminated''.
<P>
	Finally, everyone will be pleased to know the commissioner's 
comment from last year: ``Unfortunately, with regard to the 
issue of the bilingualism bonus, it is obvious that the 
commissioner's  repeated recommendations still have not been 
followed. This year approximately $50 million was once again 
spent without any assurance that the payment of such a sum was 
necessary to ensure Canadians of the availability of quality 
service in the official language of their choice. Given the present 
economic circumstances, we are more than ever convinced that 
the bilingualism bonus should be eliminated in the interest of 
the public finances as well as that of the official languages 
program. It is high time for the government to take this problem 
in hand''.
<P>
<B>(1120 ) </B>
<P>
	That is the recommendation of the commissioner that the 
Prime Minister said was not a strong recommendation. I do not 
know how much stronger he could make it based on years of 
precedent recommendations by other language commissioners.
<P>
	It is interesting that while publicly the Prime Minister has 
shrugged off these recommendations, his government today 
quietly tries to slip through this innocuous legislation which 
will at least partially achieve what so many commissioners have 
strongly advocated for more than 10 years.
<P>
	Let us have a quick look at what the rationale was regarding 
this bonus within the RCMP in years gone by. Back in 1977 R. H. 
Simmonds who was the Commissioner of the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police gave as his rationale for not paying the bilingual 
bonus that members of the police universe who are compared to 
the RCMP in the amount of pay and benefits received do not 
receive the bonus and the equations between these groups 
should remain the same as much as possible.
<P>
	The Commissioner of the RCMP also said in that year: ``The 
payment of a bonus was seen as a divisive element in a cohesive 
organization as situations would be created whereby members 
of equal rank and responsibility working side by side could 
receive differing remuneration because of different advantages 
toward learning a second language, perhaps even at public 
expense''.
<P>
	This was the evidence, part of it, that has been picked up on by 
various language commissioners over the years.
<P>
	From my own experience in the Canadian forces I am well 
aware that members who are bilingual, and this applies to the 
RCMP as well, already have an enhanced opportunity of 
promotion with the accompanying increases in remuneration. 
The bilingual bonus therefore is in effect an additional payment. 
I might add as well that most members are bilingual because of 
language training at public expense.
<P>
	So I ask, in view of all of this background, in view of the 
evidence presented, why is the government not proudly 
proclaiming its attempt to cut wasteful spending? Could it be 
that it is afraid of publicly slaying the sacred cow, which is 
official languages, no matter how small a knife the government 
wields?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7904"> 7904 </A></B>
<P>
	I congratulate the government on its attempt to right a wrong, 
but I condemn the government for wrapping this initiative in a 
cloak of secrecy. Why not tell people the truth? The Federal 
Court of Appeal ruling in the Gingras case means taxpayers will 
have to shell out roughly $30 million in retroactive bilingual 
bonus payments.
<P>
	The government should say: ``We do not agree with this 
decision. Therefore we are enacting this legislation to prevent 
further annual payments of nearly $3 million.'' This is the truth 
of the legislation and the people of Canada deserve nothing less 
than the truth, especially from a government that claims honesty 
and integrity as its guiding principles.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard St-Laurent (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Bill C-58 aims at reversing the decision of the Federal Court of 
Appeal in the Gingras case, on March 10, 1994. As you may 
remember, the Court of Appeal then concluded that members of 
the RCMP, most of whom are of course police officers, are part 
of the public service and must adhere to Treasury Board rules, 
and that these members are also entitled to the bilingualism 
bonus of $800 per year. This is a brief summary of the decision.
<P>
	In May of 1994, the government announced that it had no 
intention of appealing the decision and that it would pay the 
bonus to RCMP members, including for part of the years during 
which the government had illegally refused to grant such bonus. 
In all, retroactive payments should amount to $30 million.
<P>
	The decision of the Federal Court of Appeal seems to bother 
RCMP authorities since, according to some, it means that the 
RCMP and its police officers will be subjected to the other 
Treasury Board rules. These rules deal, among other things, with 
employment equity, the implementation of the Official 
Languages Act and the rules governing working conditions, 
with the exception however of the right to set up a union. This is 
a very important aspect which must not be overlooked.
<P>
	Before going any further, we have to look at the issue from a 
temporal perspective, but also in the context of that specific 
group.
<P>
	What is the RCMP? We must first make an important 
distinction between three different groups of employees within 
that organization. In total, there are 15,500 police officers in the 
RCMP; there are also 1,983 civilian members, as well as 3,440 
public service employees. Again, 15,551 regular members are in 
fact police officers and are not unionized. The 2,000 civilian 
members, or 1,983 to be precise, are in support positions and 
include laboratory and general technicians, experts in various 
fields, aircraft pilots, as well as an indeterminate number of 
employees from the administrative support category. Those 
people are not unionized either.
<P>
	The some 3,500 public service employees hold administrative 
and support jobs and include clerks, secretaries, stenographers, 
nurses, janitors, etc. These employees were all recruited by the 
Public Service Commission or transferred from other 
departments. They belong to unions such as the Public Service 
Alliance of Canada.
<P>
	What is troublesome with Bill C-58 is that it is an 
underhanded way of doing what is prohibited by the law. As can 
be seen in Bill C-58, what bothers the authorities is that for 
many years some RCMP members have been trying to unionize. 
Three times already, their attempts have failed. In 1994, 
unionization should no longer be considered a barbaric action 
that needs to be countered. For a group, it is the freedom to 
express its will to protect itself against its employer.
<P>
	So, the purpose of Bill C-58 is to reverse the Gingras case of 
March 10, 1994. Bill C-58 would exclude RCMP members from 
the Public Service, taking away their capacity to unionize, but 
would give them the bilingualism bonus. Such an opportunity to 
depict the bilingualism bonus as a favour will certainly not be 
missed when, in reality, it was originally established to promote 
bilingualism within the Public Service of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	Now, let us set aside the union aspect for a moment-I will 
come back to it later-to focus on the bilingualism bonus. I just 
want to make a few comments to show the unwillingness of the 
administration to acknowledge some data concerning the RCMP 
and the bilingualism bonus.
<P>
	The bilingualism bonus program for public servants who meet 
the standards of proficiency for bilingual positions was 
established on November 15, 1976. Its purpose is to promote 
bilingualism within the Public Service, working as an incentive 
for civil servants to become bilingual. In 1993-94, the 
government will again have spent approximately $30 million in 
bilingualism bonuses, which represents $800 a year for each 
beneficiary.
<P>
	As I was saying earlier, in its March 10 ruling on the Gingras 
case, the Federal Court of Appeal has declared that members of 
the RCMP are entitled to the bilingualism bonus. However, as 
far as the government or, should I say, RCMP administrators are 
concerned, two problems persist. Firstly, the government is 
repudiating the ruling handed down by the court by refusing to 
make retroactive payments as far back as the court ordered. 
Secondly, we have now learned that payment of the bonus has 
since been granted.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7905"> 7905 </A></B>
<P>
	RCMP senior management has reduced by half the number of 
employees entitled to the bonus. According to the president of 
the RCMP Employees' Association, this drastic change in the 
application of the Official Languages Act is based on the fact 
that the great majority of RCMP members entitled to the 
bilingualism bonus are francophones. What a coincidence, Mr. 
Speaker! The President of the Treasury Board must make a 
commitment, as he is being asked to do by RCMP members, to 
intervene as soon as possible in order to redress this flagrant 
injustice. That is what we hear.
<P>
	Today, this bonus is considered a source of inequity within the 
public service rather than a real compensation for the added 
difficulties related to working in both languages. The same 
amount is paid to every employee, whatever the level of 
competence, the salary or the frequency of use of the second 
language. The bonus is granted to public servants, but not to 
government employees.
<P>
	According to the Commissioner of Official Languages, it is 
far from certain that this bonus is an incentive to effectively use 
both languages whenever it is required by law. If the government 
really believes in the importance of bilingualism in federal 
institutions, the bilingualism bonus can be considered a major 
asset when it provides an incentive for public servants to learn a 
second language and use it effectively.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois does not, however, agree with those who 
argue that the cost of bilingualism is too high. We must see 
things in perspective. As long as the federal government 
maintains its official bilingualism policy, which is entirely 
reasonable, it will have to allocate the requisite funding. I 
suggest that when the annual report of the Commissioner of 
Official Languages is tabled, the debate should not be about 
costs but should focus on the government's failure to act in this 
area and on the long way it still has to go before the federal 
public service is truly able to offer quality services in both 
official languages. That was in connection with the bilingualism 
bonus.
<P>
	I will now consider the aspect of union membership, to which 
I referred earlier. I said that Bill C-58 was an attempt to isolate 
members of the RCMP by targeting the organization's regular 
members, in other words, the police. The bill creates two groups 
but only one group will belong to the RCMP, and I am referring 
to the police officers. In other words, civilian employees and 
other technicians will no longer be members of the RCMP. Bill 
C-58 no longer wants to include public servants, the so-called 
civilians. The people of the RCMP are being isolated.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	The question people are asking and I am asking is this: Why 
are they trying to isolate police officers in the RCMP? There are 
several theories, of course, and I will tell you mine.
<P>
	The Quebec government recently set up a rather interesting 
program in its public service, aimed at encouraging input from 
public servants who want to discuss, as a matter of economic and 
social concern, anything that might look like terrible waste and 
abuse of public funds, in a straightforward attempt to reduce 
operating costs without, of course, affecting the quality of 
service to the public. Today, for instance, it would be the quality 
of service provided by members of the RCMP to Canadian 
taxpayers.
<P>
	Clearly, Bill C-58 will prevent these people from making an 
honest attempt to show up any abuse that might occur within 
their organization. Bill C-58 confirms that it will turn these 
people into robots at the beck and call of a small group of 
individuals who are only intent on controlling situations and 
thus keeping a certain power over events and the people who are 
supposed to manufacture those events.
<P>
	For instance, suppose an RCMP officer were to notice that 
equipment, to give a simple example, was being used 
wrongfully by his superiors for their own use. Can anyone in this 
House imagine just for a second this officer going to his 
superiors and telling them: ``You are misusing public funds, and 
you are doing so for your personnal benefit''? Not on your life. 
Even if the alleged incident is illegal or close to breaking the 
law, he cannot do it because he has no protection. These people 
are muzzled.
<P>
	Trade unionism is not a weapon, it is a working tool in a 
democratic social system, which gives more power to those who 
use it, no matter where, even in those areas where it is the most 
difficult to unionize workers, as is the case at the Ogilvie flour 
mill, in Montreal. Even though the workers there belong to a 
union, they are now faced with the lack of anti-scab legislation 
in the Labour Code of Canada. Therefore, they are very close to 
being under some kind of a dictatorial regime since they have to 
sit idle while scabs come in to take their place. Negotiations 
then become meaningless. This creates a dangerous social 
climate.
<P>
	Last spring, we had the very same situation, for three months 
at Q.N.S. &amp; L. in Sept-Ãles, in my riding of Manicouagan. Scabs 
were allowed inside to take the jobs of workers who, in all good 
faith, wanted to negotiate with their employer. Once again, there 
was provocation. There is nothing illegal in being unionized, it 
is perfectly legal.
<P>
	The SÃ»retÃ© du QuÃ©bec is unionized. Its members belong to a 
group that is there to protect them. The CommunautÃ© urbaine de 
MontrÃ©al, otherwise known as the CUM, is made up of police 
officers. They are not animals or equipment, they are 
individuals, human beings. They are entitled to some security in 
their life. The same goes for the CommunautÃ© urbaine de 
QuÃ©bec. But the RCMP said no.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7906"> 7906 </A></B>
<P>
	The rumour has it that the employees tried to unionize on 
three occasions, but each time, their attempts were 
unsuccessful. Such tactics, you can imagine, go against the 
Charter of Rights. But these hypocritical tactics are concealed 
so well in Bill C-58 that it is impossible to make an official 
complaint under the Charter of Rights, arguing that the Liberal 
government does not want RCMP employees to form a union or 
is trying to prevent them from doing so.
<P>
	This prompts me to make a connection with the situation of 
CSIS, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. I think that 
there is a strategy, that Bill C-58 is an element of a very simple 
strategy.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	First, you prevent the members of the RCMP from unionizing. 
On three separate occasions already, attempts to do so failed, but 
pressure to unionize most have been growing and getting quite 
strong recently, last spring. This gave fuel to the case, the 
Gingras case, which was brought before the Federal Court of 
Appeal on March 10.
<P>
	This case castigates the Liberal government, so it reacted by 
introducing Bill C-58. Here is the line of thought: because this 
is a small separate group within forces responsible for national 
security, unable to unionize and therefore unable to make itself 
heard and to protect its members against abuse of power on the 
part of management, before this Parliament is over, a bill will 
probably be tabled before us to renew the RCMP, perhaps even 
under a new name! Why not? This group will need a special 
budget and, as it turns out, no one will be allowed to know what 
exactly this money is used for. This is where I see a similarity 
with the Canadian Security Intelligence Service.
<P>
	Let us take a brief look back at the Canadian Security 
Intelligence Service,so as to clearly put the problem facing us in 
its proper context. In 1946, given the increased workload of the 
RCMP resulting from this added jurisdiction, the staff assigned 
to this particular function was made into a separate group for the 
first time. In 1956, the Special ``I'' Branch became a directorate 
within the RCMP. I am going quickly. In 1969, the royal 
commission of inquiry on security recommended creating a 
civilian security agency. From 1971 to 1974, especially but not 
exclusively in Quebec, the security service mounted a series of 
operations, many of which were apparently illegal, to neutralize 
radical groups, who happen to be separatists, once again.
<P>
	On March 27, 1975, the federal Cabinet developed a directive 
for the security service's activities. This directive remained 
secret until 1978. In 1976, Corporal Samson, who was tried for 
an incident unrelated to this affair, revealed his participation in 
Operation Bricole in 1972, which involved breaking and 
entering and stealing files, as we recall.
<P>
	Various events occurred over the years, but let us go to 
November 29, when the members of the Security  Intelligence 
Review Committee were appointed; the chairman was a former 
Conservative Cabinet minister. In February 1985, CSIS's 
operating budget was $115 million. This was less than the $200 
million it is today, and neither Canadian taxpayers, nor the 
House of Commons, are allowed to review it. Something is 
wrong! It is a terrible outfit which not even the House of 
Commons is able to control any more.
<P>
	So, to sum up, one, we want to talk about unionization, to 
move the process along. We intend to talk about unionizing 
members of the RCMP because the people in that force can find 
out about the abuses going on in various branches.
<P>
	Second, they table a bill aimed at isolating the only people 
with access to compromising documents. Third, I am convinced 
that, before the end of this parliamentary session, they will pass 
a bill putting the RCMP in the same class as CSIS, that is, with 
millions of dollars to spend but without ordinary taxpayers 
being allowed to look into how this money is spent.
<P>
	In conclusion,it is my firm belief that it is high time that 
Quebec achieve sovereignty. Bill C-58 will not make Quebecers 
change their minds and convince them that it might be beneficial 
to keep federalism in good shape.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	In fact, we do not have to worry about federalism or trying to 
destroy it. Federalism is destroying itself through bills like 
C-58.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, members 
recognize that this bill is very straightforward and very 
important. Not only does it deal with a circumstance that was 
created by a court decision, it deals with a matter that could be 
very costly to the government and to Canadians. On that basis 
the matter is very timely.
<P>
	I find two issues of interest in this legislative change. First is 
the matter of the bilingual bonuses which are the base purpose of 
the bill. Second is the autonomy of the RCMP. That both these 
purposes can be achieved is to be commended.
<P>
	I would like to give some background which I believe we all 
recognize is important to our discussion. Certainly the purpose 
of the bill should be discussed. As I understand it, the bill 
removes RCMP officers from the definition of employee and in 
so doing it removes them from the public service as defined 
under the Public Service Staff Relations Act.
<P>
	How will they be governed? They will now be governed under 
the RCMP act. That is where the item of autonomy is discussed. 
It all seems very simple at first glance.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7907"> 7907 </A></B>
<P>
	However when the background of the bill is examined some 
significant consequences are shown. First, let us talk about the 
matter of bilingualism. RCMP officers would be able to opt out 
of bilingualism. Reform Party policy states very clearly that it 
supports the removal of bilingual bonuses to civil servants as a 
federal cost reduction measure. We support individual 
bilingualism but oppose institutional bilingualism as dictated 
by the Official Languages Act. We feel the bill is in line with 
that policy.
<P>
	Why do we believe there are reasons for the RCMP to be able 
to opt out of bilingual bonuses? First, we can talk about the very 
basic matter of fiscal constraints. We all recognize that the 
decision of March 10, 1994 with regard to Gingras v. The Queen 
in right of Canada that bonuses that were not paid in the past can 
now be collected by the RCMP. It will cost millions and millions 
of dollars. The question is whether a person should legitimately 
have it or not. I say he or she should not.
<P>
	It was the policy of government under the Public Service Staff 
Relations Act that was wrong in the first place. We should be 
able to stick to that very basic principle which we hear often, 
that of equal pay for equal work. Not only should that happen in 
the public service but it should happen in the private sector. It is 
very important, as I examine this matter.
<P>
	I refer to a comment by R. H. Simmonds who was the 
commissioner of the RCMP in 1977. He was at that time putting 
together a rationale for not paying the bilingual bonus. He came 
to the conclusion that the payment of the bonus was seen as a 
divisive element in a cohesive organization, as situations would 
be created whereby members of equal rank and responsibility, 
working side by side, could receive differing remunerations 
because of different advantages toward learning a second 
language, perhaps even at public expense. That was a major 
concern and on that basis there was a resistance to paying the 
bilingual bonus.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	That principle is very important to the RCMP, which as an 
organization and as individuals, whether male or female, must 
be very objective and fair in how the law is applied in a variety 
of situations. In no way can there be discrimination that is based 
on either linguistic, racial, religious or any other characteristic 
of the RCMP officer when the law is applied.
<P>
	In certain circumstances there may be a need for a limited 
number of bilingual positions. We need bilingual members of 
the force. Those people already receive certain rewards. 
However, it should not be the reward of a special pay bonus. 
They receive a reward because they can take advantage of 
certain promotions within the public service. They can receive 
assignments which require special skills in providing service to 
the public in law enforcement.
<P>
	When looking at this matter of an extra bonus because one has 
special skills in a language, I can think of a variety of analogies 
which are appropriate. For example, if a person comes to the 
RCMP with a Bachelor of Arts or a Bachelor of Science degree, 
should a clause in the bill say that person should receive an extra 
bonus to perform a duty? Should they receive a bonus? I do not 
think so.
<P>
	I look at another analogy of Elizabeth Manley, for example, a 
professional figure skater, who if she became an RCMP officer 
would bring that special skill, a very special skill that we in 
Canada certainly admire and respect. Should there be an extra 
bonus because this person is physically fit, able to do the job and 
may be a little bit more nimble in applying the law in a variety of 
circumstances? I do not think so.
<P>
	The <I>Globe and Mail</I> this morning made a statement with 
regard to the abilities of males versus females. It stated that 
studies show that females have better verbal skills to bring to the 
job market. Does that mean we should pay an extra bonus? 
Should we really do that or not? Do those skills assist the person 
to get a job or to compete in the marketplace? Yes, I think it 
does. Does it mean that females should get paid more than males 
under those circumstances? I do not think so.
<P>
	We have to look at the responsibilities of that job. We hire 
based on qualifications to meet the requirements of the job. We 
maintain the basic principle that there is equal pay for equal 
work in whatever job confronts the individual whether male or 
female. That is the only logical way we can look at a 
circumstance such as this.
<P>
	The second consequence of the bill is the matter of more 
autonomy for the RCMP. It takes members of the RCMP and 
places them under the RCMP act. That is the way it should be. 
They should have more autonomy and more control with regard 
to their members and employment. As Reform policy we state 
very clearly in our manual that the Reform Party supports the 
traditional role of the RCMP as a police force, representative of 
and responsive to the population it serves in Canada's regions. It 
means it has to have its own autonomy and its own ability to 
apply the law equally to all citizens in the country, without some 
RCMP officers having special pay with regard to applying those 
services whatever they may be.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	I believe that bringing the other members of the RCMP under 
the RCMP act will make it possible for them to be more 
responsible to the public rather than being responsible to the 
broad federal bureaucracy under the Public Service Staff 
Relations Act. It is important that this law enforcement 
organization maintain its independence.
<P>
	I conclude my remarks by saying it is good that the RCMP 
have the opportunity to opt out of the bilingual bonus program. I 
certainly would urge them to do so when we finalize this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7908"> 7908 </A></B>
<P>
legislation. Second, greater  autonomy for that organization is 
good and it is most important.
<P>
	If I had to say anything negative with regard to the 
government's bill and its presentation here, I would say that it 
has not gone quite far enough. If we examine the bill we will see 
that something is missing. The civilian personnel working for 
the RCMP, as I understand it, can still claim the bilingual bonus. 
The bilingual bonus should be eliminated across the board and 
we should deal with the whole public service in the same way. 
We should have a complete change rather than this somewhat 
piecemeal change, even though it is good as presented.
<P>
	The government is playing a bit of catch-up. I know some of 
these policies and legislative changes are brought in by 
governments under different circumstances. We have to 
recognize that circumstances have changed, not only fiscally but 
in the attitudes of Canadians. They are saying: ``We are all 
Canadians no matter where we live. We should have equal 
opportunity, not only in the job place but equal opportunity in 
terms of cultural and other social aspirations''.
<P>
	This law as it was put in place some time ago created 
inequality not equality. I believe it is good that we are trying to 
tackle that problem.
<P>
	I certainly support my colleague from Nanaimo-Cowichan 
who said we should tackle this problem in a very comprehensive 
way. As Reformers we are certainly united on that front.
<P>
	We support this bill. We feel it is a small step in the right 
direction. We certainly urge the government to continue this 
pursuit and make sure that equality is brought to the public 
service.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. RenÃ© Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister 
introduced Bill C-58 this morning by telling us that, for all 
intents and purposes, these were mere technical provisions, that 
they were of little consequence, and that they only aimed at 
bringing back the status quo which prevailed before the Gingras 
decision. As everyone now knows, the Court of Appeal ruled 
that some RCMP employees were part of the public service and 
not excluded from it.
<P>
	We wonder if this issue is so simple. Indeed, if it is so 
ordinary, why is the government acting in this fashion?
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	It does not seem to be a matter of avoiding additional costs, 
since the court decision has already been implemented and the 
bilingualism bonus paid to those RCMP members who are 
entitled to it. Consequently, it does not look as though this bill 
will help the government make significant savings in the 
immediate future.
<P>
	We wonder why the government wants to act so quickly in this 
particular case, considering that it still has not done anything in 
other cases involving a lot more money, such as the now famous 
Gulf Oil case. In 1974, the government legislated to allow 
certain tax deductions for oil companies, thereby reducing their 
tax burden.
<P>
	Oil companies took advantage of those provisions to the point 
that after a while the government must have concluded that 
some were going too far. However, the government merely 
watched: It did not take any action. Yet, there is a lot of money 
involved. Since 1974, these companies have avoided-and I am 
not saying they acted illegally, because the law entitles them to 
do so-the payment of $1.2 billion in taxes. In fact, every day 
the government loses $260,000 because of those tax provisions. 
In this case, however, 20 years later, the government has still not 
seen fit to change the law, even if it seems to do the exact 
opposite of what the government intended to achieve, which was 
to allow companies to increase their research and development 
activities in the natural resources area.
<P>
	There are billions of dollars at stake. For 20 years now, we 
have been studying the legislation and wondering if we should 
act now, or wait a little longer to see if the law has any impact on 
other companies. If a bill had been passed right away and if we 
had said after a few years: ``Since the law does not seem to say 
what we meant to say, we will correct it and change it right 
now'', we would have saved billions of tax dollars.
<P>
	So, here we are 20 years later and nothing has been done yet. 
However, the government is in a hurry to pass Bill C-58. The 
ruling of the Court of Appeal only dates back to March 1994, but 
already the members of the RCMP who were hopeful to see their 
situation be legitimized realize that the government had decided 
to act right away and to say: ``Since the court's ruling is at 
variance with our intent, we will act now and pass an act to 
clarify the situation and make the act say what we want it to say, 
which is to stipulate that employees of the RCMP are not part of 
the public service''.
<P>
	There are some 15,500 regular members and special 
constables, and, as was said earlier, 2,000 civilian employees in 
the RCMP. There are also about 3,400 civil servants, currently 
the only ones who have the right to join a union. Of course, this 
bill in itself represents a step in the right direction, since it 
allows civilian employees of the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police to unionize, which they could not do before.
<P>
	So, we should commend this part of the bill, thanks to which 
2,000 and more employees will be able to exercise their 
democratic rights.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	That is a nice gesture on the part of the government, but it 
does not go far enough, since it still deprives the vast majority of 
RCMP employees, and I am referring to regular members and 
special constables, of the right to enjoy the same privilege, 
which is the right to organize,  to form a union, a right that has 
been recognized by all other groups in society, all other occupa-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7909"> 7909 </A></B>
<P>
tions and professions, and even by other police forces across 
Canada. Other police forces have this basic, democratic right 
which respects the right of individuals to organize freely and to 
be able to negotiate the terms and conditions of their 
employment. In Bill C-58, RCMP officers are denied that right.
<P>
	Why should these people not enjoy the same advantages as 
their colleagues in the provincial police forces or the rest of 
society? What is the government's real agenda? Does the 
government expect to control this police force more readily by 
removing it from the supervision of Treasury Board, thus 
turning it into an agency that is not an agency defined by law as 
another activity sector, that is not covered by a specific 
department and, in fact, seems to come under the sole 
supervision of the commissioner, who has a lot of power. Bill 
C-58 more or less confirms, although it does not say so 
explicitly, that the big boss, the big decision-maker, is the 
Commissioner of the RCMP. Occasionally, he gets some help 
from an outside committee, but mostly he accepts the 
committee's recommendations to protect his image, while he 
ultimately has the right to reject those recommendations.
<P>
	What we want is transparency in the way the government is 
run, which should include the way police forces are run as well. 
To exclude them from the public service boils down to treating 
them like members of the military, who for security reasons, are 
excluded from this kind of control and have their own justice 
system and their own courts. However, we do not think it is 
appropriate to run a police force along those lines.
<P>
	Would the government want to exempt these 15,000 RCMP 
members from the policy on bilingualism in the future? We 
wonder. We can feel that government has the support of another 
opposition party in this matter. That party has been very clear: 
the government's approach is not the proper one in this case. 
Bilingualism should mean two languages in Quebec and only 
one language in the rest of Canada. That is bilingualism 
according to the Reform Party. Is the government prepared to 
adopt that Reform Party policy on bilingualism for Canada? 
Does the government intend to cut the bonus for RCMP 
members? We wonder.
<P>
	What are the intentions of the government in terms of 
employment equity? Since the courts have ruled that, by virtue 
of the present legislation, the RCMP should come under the 
jurisdiction of the Treasury Board, why would the government 
not accept that RCMP members be treated according to the same 
standards as those applied to all other civil servants, that is the 
standards laid down by the Treasury Board?
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	Why not take this opportunity to give RCMP members the 
same privileges as those granted all other employees of the 
public service?
<P>
	The Public Service Commission is responsible for personnel 
management in several other departments. As part of the 
monitoring process, it must make sure that everybody abides by 
standards and regulations. In the case of the RCMP, the Treasury 
Board, not the Public Service Commission, had that 
responsibility. The Treasury Board authorities would ensure a 
better control of the RCMP.
<P>
	But Bill C-58 would take that responsibility away from the 
Treasury Board. Is this another way for the RCMP to avoid 
having its activities scrutinized by a public body whose role is to 
ensure transparency and answer taxpayers' questions? What is 
so secret that Treasury Board should not have authority over the 
RCMP?
<P>
	Is there a hidden agenda? Is the government planning again to 
have the RCMP carry out duties in a covert way, protecting it 
from inquisitive taxpayers wanting to know why the RCMP is 
behaving this way or that? Does the government have ulterior 
motives?
<P>
	It is hard to say, but it seems rather strange for the government 
to take advantage of an Appeal Court decision not only to give 
back to the RCMP Commissioner the same powers he had 
before, but also, in reality, to reinforce the authority he has now 
since, to all intents and purposes, he does not seem to be 
accountable to anybody in particular in the government.
<P>
	We cannot condone this policy because this bill lacks 
transparency and does not go far enough. Why is it that 
something good for 5,000 RCMP employees should not be good 
also for the remaining 15,000? As the saying goes, what is sauce 
for the goose is sauce for the gander.
<P>
	Why would what is supposed to be good for support and 
administrative staff and all other RCMP employees not be good 
for special constables and regular members of the RCMP? Why 
should they not benefit from it also?
<P>
	We will vote against this bill at second reading, and we hope 
that the government will do an about-turn and abide by its civil 
service renewal policy, which was supposed to give more 
decision-making powers to lower levels of government, and not 
to exclude certain agencies from the decision-making process.
<P>
	If this is the kind of civil service renewal the government had 
in mind, we misunderstood its intentions and we must denounce 
them here and now. Letting authority move from top to bottom, 
means allowing the decisions to be taken as close as possible to 
the place where the problems occur.
<P>
	This is not what the government is doing with Bill C-58. What 
the government is doing is exclude the RCMP from the 
jurisdiction of Treasury Board. By making the RCMP come 
under a single person it enables it to act on the sly, without any 
openness and in a way unacceptable to taxpayers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7910"> 7910 </A></B>
<P>
	Once again, we think that the government should backtrack 
and respect the spirit of the program of public service renewal, 
the so-called Public Service 2000, that it does not seem to hold 
in high regard and has not really considered up to now. We have 
a feeling that it has been relegated to the highest shelf and that 
the government is in no hurry to follow-up on its electoral 
promises in this regard.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, thank you for your attention. I am ready to 
answer questions if there are any.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Questions or comments. Normally, I 
would give the floor to a member from another party, but since 
no member for another party wishes to speak, I recognize the 
hon. member for Berthier-Montcalm.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first of all, I wish to congratulate my Bloc colleague 
from the riding of Joliette because I think he grasped the full 
significance of this bill. Since he is the critic on public service 
renewal, there should be at least one person in this House who 
defends the public servants working for the system. RCMP 
members are directly affected by what is done or not done in this 
House.
<P>
	I must tell you at the outset that although we seem to defend 
the RCMP, we, in the Bloc Quebecois, would have good reasons 
not to oppose a bill which paints the RCMP into a corner and 
puts them in a separate class. You have certainly heard members 
of this House talk about incidents involving the RCMP back in 
the 1970s. As you know, sovereignists and independentists are 
not great friends of the system, of the RCMP, but I think that as 
the Official Opposition we must denounce such bills. This is 
what I am doing today by denouncing Bill C-58.
<P>
	Our first reaction after looking at a bill like this is to see it as a 
harmless piece of legislation. There are not many sections. It 
does not seem very consequential at the jurisdictional level. 
Nevertheless, I think we should ask ourselves why Bill C-58, 
now, in November, singles out RCMP members by putting them 
in a separate class. Because C-58 does put RCMP members in a 
separate class.
<P>
	Looking at the bill, we realize that it touches on staff relations 
and wonder why the Federal Court of Appeal made a certain 
ruling under the law as it stood when the court addressed the 
issue. It handed down a very fair, very well-researched ruling, 
so that the Liberal federal government-I will come back to this 
a little later-does not want to appeal it.
<P>
	Why C-58? As my colleague said earlier, I think that the 
Gingras case spurred the Liberal government into introducing 
legislation in this area. For the benefit of those who are not 
familiar with the Gingras case, a brief review of this case may be 
useful, for the sake of understanding the general dynamics of 
Bill C-58.
<P>
	You all know that the federal government instituted a 
bilingualism bonus plan in the seventies, on the 15 of November 
to be exact. Yesterday was the anniversary, not only of the first 
term of office of the Parti Quebecois, but also of the creation of 
the bilingual bonus. This plan was for employees hired by 
Treasury Board, that is to say the government of Canada, who 
held a bilingual position, a position recognized as such, which 
required the use of both official languages. The bonus was $800 
a year.
<P>
	The purpose of this bonus, and I do not wish to discuss the 
purpose of the bonus again, was to promote bilingualism. It was 
designed as an incentive for public servants to learn the other 
official language to serve the people of Canada, and the people 
of Quebec in particular.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	Well, Mr. Gingras had been a member of the RCMP since 
1962. In fact, he worked for the RCMP until 1984. But between 
1976, when the bilingualism bonus plan was put in place, and 
1984, when Mr. Gingras retired from the RCMP, despite the fact 
his position was designated as bilingual, he never received the 
$800 bilingual bonus, while all other public service employees 
working on the Hill or elsewhere did.
<P>
	Naturally, pursuant to the RCMP regulations, Mr. Gingras 
asked his superiors to look into the matter and, unsatisfied with 
their decision, brought the whole matter before the Federal 
Court. The case even went to the Federal Court of Appeal, which 
ruled very clearly on March 10, 1994 that Mr. Gingras and all 
members of the RCMP were entitled to this bonus.
<P>
	Although I do not want to read much of the ruling of the 
Federal Court of Appeal, we see that the reason for this ruling is 
that all members of the RCMP are public servants who must 
comply with the rules adopted by Treasury Board and are 
entitled to the bilingual bonus if they occupy a position 
recognized as bilingual and requiring bilingualism.
<P>
	Given such a ruling, we must conclude that Bill C-58 seeks to 
overturn the Federal Court of Appeal's decision-it is as simple 
as that.
<P>
	I come back to the question I raised at the beginning. Is this a 
harmless bill? I think not. I think that it is a dangerous, sneaky 
bill for a society that claims to recognize the rights of equality 
and association. I repeat those two terms.
<P>
	Why did I say that it is a sneaky bill? Because after this ruling 
was rendered in March 1994, the government, through its 
minister, said that it was reviewing the matter to see whether it 
could appeal. It wanted to analyze the consequences of this 
judgement. However, in May 1994, the government announced 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7911"> 7911 </A></B>
<P>
that it did not intend to appeal the Supreme Court's decision and 
therefore it would pay the bonus to members of the RCMP, 
including the bonuses for part of the years when the government 
illegally refused to pay the members of the RCMP.
<P>
	It is true that the Liberal government did not appeal this 
decision. However, what the government does not do openly by 
appealing this ruling to the Supreme Court of Canada, it does 
indirectly to arrive more or less at the same result. By asking the 
House to pass Bill C-58, the government is using a sneaky 
approach. It led us to believe that it was going to live with the 
ruling of the Federal Court of Appeal, but then it turned around 
and drafted Bill C-58, which is now before us.
<P>
	This is sneaky because even those directly concerned by this 
legislation, namely RCMP members, did not know about it until 
the Official Opposition approached them to find out what they 
thought of Bill C-58. These people were not even aware of that 
legislation. You cannot help but wonder about the internal 
consultation process. This is why I find it sneaky. This is not a 
bill about which all concerned were clearly informed. It was 
drafted, and the government is now trying to have the House 
pass it rather quickly. I doubt many Liberal members will 
discuss it. The government is trying to proceed quickly. Yet, this 
legislation will have very significant consequences.
<P>
	I also think this is a dangerous bill for a society which claims 
to be respectful of union membership and equality rights.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	By introducing a bill which has the effect of overruling a 
Federal Court of Appeal decision, the government does not 
necessarily solve an issue related to bilingualism: It is trying to 
do a lot more than that. And this is what can be very dangerous 
for RCMP members. Let us not forget that the ruling of the 
Federal Court of Appeal has an impact on many other very 
important issues. For example, the court was unanimous in 
saying that RCMP members are Treasury Board employees and 
must be considered as such. Consequently, it court ruled that the 
RCMP and its peace officers should be subjected to all other 
Treasury Board rules. These rules govern such things as 
employment equity, enforcement of the Official Languages Act 
and the rules concerning labour conditions, with of course one 
exception relating to the right to unionize.
<P>
	Once the Federal Court of Appeal made its ruling, we heard 
that the mandarins at the RCMP were concerned about the legal 
implications of this ruling. Which brings me to another 
question: Who is affected by this ruling? Why does it bother 
people so much, why does it bother the mandarins of the RCMP 
who seem to call all the shots within their agency?
<P>
	According to inquiries made yesterday, the Gingras case 
affects some 17,500 members of the RCMP. Of these 17,500 
members, about 15,500 are regular members and special 
constables and about 2,000 are civilian employees. These were 
the people working for the RCMP who were affected by the 
Gingras ruling. To these figures you can add about 3,500 
employees of the public service, who are not however affected 
by Bill C-58 or the Gingras case, because they are already 
considered to be public servants.
<P>
	We are forced to realize that an injustice was done and we 
have to understand the rationale behind the ruling of the Federal 
Court of Appeal, because we had a situation where people 
working at the same place, for the same employer, were subject 
to different labour conditions, where the rules were not the same 
for everyone, and that did not make sense. This is why the ruling 
of the Federal Court of Appeal set things straight. However, 
unhappy with this decision, the government now introduces Bill 
C-58 which negates the ruling of the Federal Court.
<P>
	As I said earlier, and as my colleagues already said, the first 
objective of Bill C-58 is to exclude RCMP employees from the 
Public Service, employees who, at the present time, come under 
the control of Treasury Board like the rest of the Public Service. 
If this bill passes under its present form, the RCMP will be 
covered by legislation governing public service only if it is 
specifically mentioned in such legislation.
<P>
	The basic rule under the bill is that Treasury Board policies no 
longer apply. They applied ever since the court decision. Under 
Bill C-58 these policies will no longer apply, unless RCMP 
management decides they do. Therefore, we give mandarins, 
who worried about the consequences of the Federal Court of 
Appeal decision, the option to follow or not the rules set out by 
Treasury Board.
<P>
	I am no longer as naive as I was on election day, and I know 
full well that they are not ever going to accept those rules since 
they were the ones who pushed for Bill C-58. So, even from that 
point of view this is a sneaky piece of legislation.
<P>
	If I were a member of the RCMP, I would be furious. I do not 
know what they are going to do, but if I were in their place I 
would try to make it known that I am unhappy. I am going to give 
you some examples. In the area of employment equity: In 
December 1992, the Financial Administration Act gave the 
Public Service Employment Equity Program, launched by 
Treasury Board in the mid-1980s, its real legal basis.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	All departments and agencies, including Treasury Board and 
the employer, that is the public service, are subject to the 
Employment Equity Act, because they are part of the public 
service. Until quite recently, the RCMP commissioner had 
decided that the RCMP was not subject to Treasury Board 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7912"> 7912 </A></B>
<P>
policies, although the RCMP is listed in Part I of Schedule I of 
the Public Service Staff Relations Act.
<P>
	It should, however, be mentioned that the RCMP's status is 
not quite the same as the rest of the public service, which 
allowed the commissioner to claim that the bilingual bonus 
policy did not apply. The Federal Court of Appeal decision did 
not back him up. In the Gingras decision handed down on March 
10, 1994, the court ruled unanimously that the RCMP would in 
future be considered part of the public service. Since then, the 
RCMP has been obliged to apply Treasury Board policies to all 
17,500 of its members affected by the decision.
<P>
	Bill C-58 is an attempt to put an end to this process of equity. 
After all, the approximately 3,500 RCMP employees in the third 
category I referred to earlier were recruited by the Public 
Service Commission and have therefore always been fully 
subject to the Treasury Board policies on equity and 
bilingualism.
<P>
	As you can see, Mr. Speaker, under Bill C-58, members of the 
RCMP who are police officers or special constables are being 
treated as a separate class within the RCMP itself. They are 
being put in a class quite distinct from secretaries, clerks, 
caretakers and so on.
<P>
	And it is the same with the official languages policy. The 
decision to implement this policy in the RCMP as an 
organization will rest with the big boss himself, the RCMP 
commissioner. It is extremely dangerous to leave this power in 
the hands of one person alone.
<P>
	As for the labour relations and unionization aspects, I think 
that my hon. colleague from Joliette has covered them well. 
Since I am rising immediately after him, there is no need for me 
to argue the unionization issue all over again, except to say that 
Bill C-58 confirms in no uncertain terms that RCMP employees 
who may, at one time or another, have contemplated forming a 
brotherhood or a union can forget it for good.
<P>
	If there was room for interpretation before, it is all very clear 
now. As you probably know, Mr. Speaker, applications were 
made by RCMP employees wishing to unionize. Actually, some 
are still pending, but Bill C-58 clearly puts an end to any 
attempt to unionize. Bill C-58, if passed, will make it 
impossible.
<P>
	To sum up, seeing that I have one minute or so remaining, the 
most dangerous thing about Bill C-58 is the tendency to put 
almost everything in the hands of the commissioner of the 
RCMP. Mr. Speaker, I think that you for one would understand 
the situation, because you are sensitive to these issues. If we 
look at what is happening with the Communications Security 
Establishment and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, 
which are truly considered as separate employers by the 
government in Ottawa, the same thing will happen, indirectly, to 
the RCMP people, but that is not spelled out clearly, as it was in 
the other two cases.
<P>
	Indirectly, the commissioner of the RCMP will have the final 
say on certain aspects of the application of RCMP regulations. 
That is what is extremely dangerous in a country that claims to 
be democratic and open to the right to organize, to official 
languages and so on.
<P>
	This is a bill that centralizes many jurisdictions under a single 
person, and that is very harmful. You will understand that, for all 
the aforementioned reasons, like all my colleagues from the 
Bloc Quebecois, I will vote against Bill C-58.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Roger Simmons (Burin-St. George's, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on the 
following motion of the Minister of Human Resources 
Development:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House take note of the progress made to date on the government's 
forthcoming reform of social security programs and of the views expressed by 
Canadians with regard to this reform.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I believe the discussion paper on improving social security in 
Canada, tabled by the minister some weeks ago in the House, is a 
very welcome and courageous document. As with all initiatives 
that involve courage there is the potential for controversy and 
for misrepresentation. Certainly we have seen a fair amount of 
both since the issuance of the discussion paper.
<P>
	I am not surprised by that. Indeed I would be disappointed if 
there were not such controversy and I would certainly be 
surprised if there were not some misrepresentation. It is the 
nature of our system of government that for every point of view 
there is a counter point of view. It is the nature of the way things 
get done in the Chamber that very often people who choose to 
take an opposing point of view are not hampered by the facts in 
some cases. They tend to do a bit of fearmongering and create a 
whole lot of what if scenarios: Does the government mean to do 
this or does it mean to do that?
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	I am not surprised by the misrepresentation and indeed I 
welcome the controversy. The minister and the government have 
wanted a full scale discussion on this issue and that presumes a 
discussion of the facts in play.
<P>
	What I like about the discussion paper is that it raises a series 
of questions. Do we want this? Do we want that? They are 
questions. The standing committee is now travelling around the 
country to canvass the views of Canadians and to invite 
Canadians who cannot appear before the committee by reason of 
distance, time or whatever to send their views. I repeat the 
invitation to send their views to the committee and to their 
respective members of Parliament but particularly to the 
committee. As sure as night follows day there will be changes in 
the social security package as we know it in Canada. There has 
to be changes.
<P>
	One of the reasons there has to be changes is that the present 
system was put in place so long ago that in the intervening time 
there have been new demands and new realities. Another reason 
change is needed is that no matter how tightly the rules are 
written there is always potential for abuse. I could indicate, as 
could many members of Parliament, many specific examples of 
where a particular package within the social security network 
has been abused.
<P>
	That must never be an argument for throwing out the baby 
with the bath water. Unemployment insurance is a good system. 
It has served us well. Have there been abuses? My friend from 
Elk Island is probably in the category to which I just made 
reference. He would  probably be leading the charge. He would 
be the pied piper of throwing out the baby with the bath water. 
Judging by his reaction in the House at this moment, he would be 
the kind of person who would want to get rid of the whole 
system. I am not one of those. That is where he and I differ.
<P>
	There have been abuses in the UI system; I can document 
many hundreds of them. The abuses need to be corrected but the 
basic premise remains. The basic premise is that there are 
people who need to be assisted financially from one work 
opportunity to the next one. That is the basic premise of the UI 
system and we cannot lose sight of that. Nor can we lose sight of 
the abuses. That is one of the reasons this discussion paper is 
before us right now.
<P>
	I could refer to other programs. There are abuses of any 
program embraced by the social security net, but for each of 
those programs there is a basic premise. For example, are there 
people who need an old age supplement? Yes, there are and I can 
give a list of many tens of thousands of them who need it.
<P>
	With reference to what my friend from Gander-Grand Falls 
was saying a few days ago, was it ever intended that the old age 
security program should help people who already net several 
million dollars a year to get some more millions, some more 
dollars? No. Was it ever intended that 2,340 millionaires in this 
country should be able to draw unemployment insurance and 
benefit therefrom in tax terms? No, but that is happening. Now 
what is the solution?
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	There are two possible solutions, I suppose, theoretically. 
There is a sure way of guaranteeing that not one of these 2,340 
people draw UI ever again. Wipe out the system. Wipe the 
system out completely and you will have guaranteed that none of 
them ever draw it because it will not be there to draw on. But 
what will you have done in the meantime? You will have ignored 
the basic premise of the program, the basic reason for the 
program in the first place: To help those who genuinely have 
financial need to get from one work opportunity to the next work 
opportunity.
<P>
	With respect to unemployment insurance, old age security, 
medicare, university tuition, transfer payments, let us not lose 
sight of what their basic raison d'Ãªtre was in the first place, the 
basic reason for putting them in place.
<P>
	There is going to be and there is already a very wide debate. 
We saw an aspect of it yesterday here in front of the Parliament 
Buildings when many thousands of university students came to 
the Hill. I for one was glad to see them there. It is part of the 
debate that must go on. It must be an informed debate. I hear and 
I read in the papers a lot of information, a lot of misinformation, 
a lot of fear mongering. No matter what you attempt to do as a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7914"> 7914 </A></B>
<P>
public policy maker or as government, the NIMBY  factor 
immediately comes into play. NIMBY, not in my back yard.
<P>
	Any Canadian, any taxpayer anywhere in the world will 
respond to the following set of questions in the following way: 
Do you want to improve roads? Yes. Do you want to pay for 
them? No. It is the nature of how politics is done in democracies 
around the world. Do you want change? Yes. Do you want it to 
cost you? No. NIMBY. Do it by all means, politicians, please do 
it, but do not do it in my backyard. Do not affect me adversely.
<P>
	Well budgeting in government is like a zero sum. Again, as 
soon as you spend it somewhere you have to take it from 
somewhere else.
<P>
	So I say to university students, I say to unemployment 
insurance recipients, I say to old age pensioners, I say to 
recipients of medicare, I say to all of them out there including 
those of them who are my constituents: If you want change you 
are going to have to accept a basic fact of life. Change will mean 
improvements in some areas from your perspective but a less 
adequate measure in other areas from your perspective. 
Everybody sees it from his or her own perspective.
<P>
	If you want the status quo, we can just tear up this little green 
book and we can allow the abuses to go on, allow the 
millionaires to continue receiving their unemployment 
insurance. We can allow that to go on, but that would be 
unthinkable. Therefore we have taken the other route as a 
government of which I am a supporter of saying that changes are 
needed but before we trigger those changes let us see what kind 
of changes you have in mind.
<P>
	That is why we are having quite a far reaching consultation 
with the Canadian people. I have been encouraged by the kinds 
of letters I get, the kinds of spontaneous dialogue I encounter in 
airports and elsewhere around this country. I have been quite 
encouraged. But do not for a moment make the assumption that 
the vested interests are going to allow that dialogue to continue 
unfettered. There are vested interests.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	If for example the government contemplates a change in a 
funding formula for various organizations around this country, 
the paid staff in that organization immediately says: ``What does 
this mean for my job? If the subsidy from government is less or 
wiped out altogether, what does it mean for my job?''
<P>
	Understand that we are talking about a discussion paper. 
Nobody has said that we are going to do this, this and this. The 
government through the Minister of Human Resources 
Development has said: ``Here are some questions about what 
could be done. Canadians, what do you think?''
<P>
	Let us go back to the organization I was talking about. The guy 
or the girl sitting behind a desk in a job that is funded by a 
government subsidy says: ``Is it not possible that if they change 
the system there might be less money flowing to this 
organization? Therefore, my welfare, my livelihood, my pay, 
my job might be at stake''. It does not take a nuclear scientist to 
figure out that the next thought that person may well have is: 
``How can I stop that from happening? I could mobilize a great 
rally. I could mobilize some letter writing''.
<P>
	Why has he or she done it in that example? Is it because he or 
she does not think there is a need for change? No. It has been 
done for the NIMBY reason: Not in my backyard; do not 
adversely affect me; however good your intentions, however 
good this program will serve the country, do not do it because it 
might affect my pocketbook.
<P>
	Is there controversy? Oh yes, there is lots of controversy. Will 
there be more? Yes, I certainly hope there will be a lot more. 
Because at the end of the day when the smoke has cleared, 
everyone will see that this government will bring in a social 
security reform package which reflects the concerns of 
Canadians from coast to coast. Will everybody be happy? I 
doubt that very much. However I sincerely believe that most of 
them will be happy if they honestly engage in the process along 
the way, if they ignore the fear mongers, read the document 
themselves and respond to the document themselves.
<P>
	I have some concerns about the process. I hope this does not 
fall into the category of the fear mongering I have just 
castigated. I subscribe to the view that what is in this document 
is basically a series of questions. However you would need to be 
deaf, dumb, blind and everything else not to realize there are 
some implied policy directions in this document.
<P>
	One relates to the issue of university tuition. The government 
has not said it is going to do it, but it certainly has wondered out 
loud as to whether that is the route to go. Whether it goes that 
route or not depends on what Canadians say about the issue in 
the next few weeks.
<P>
	The government has wondered out loud about seasonal 
workers versus workers who only have occasion to tap into 
unemployment insurance benefits spasmodically and 
infrequently. I have a very decided view on that issue.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	Let us take an example of two brothers or sisters who are 
doing the same job. They are both carpenters driving nails and 
building the same office building in Toronto or St. John's. They 
both work for 18 or 19 weeks and both get laid off. Then UI says 
to one: ``You came straight to this job from another job out in 
Cold Lake, Alberta where you worked for six years. You have no 
record of being unemployed over the last six or eight years so 
you are going to get a certain rate of remuneration or benefit 
while you are looking for work''. However UI says to the other 
brother: ``Before your 18 weeks, you were out of  work for two 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7915"> 7915 </A></B>
<P>
or three months. It was through no fault of your own mind you. It 
was not because you are lazy because you are not, but because 
you could not find work. However we are going to pay you a 
lesser rate''.
<P>
	Forget Liberalism, forget Reformism, forget Blocism. Let us 
talk another theology called fairness. Let us talk about basic 
fairness and another theology called basic common sense. The 
two brothers having worked the same amount of time driving the 
same kind of nails and getting the same rate of pay receive 
different UI payments. Who can buy the more groceries? That is 
the issue.
<P>
	Remember that UI was put in place in the first instance to help 
tide a person over from one work opportunity to the next work 
opportunity. If in the process we say to a person who through no 
fault of his own has had fewer work opportunities that we are 
going to give him less money to buy the groceries to get him to 
the next work opportunity, that comes down to not a matter of 
political ideology, but to a basic matter of fairness. It is blatantly 
unfair to contemplate that approach. That is the kind of feedback 
I am getting and I expect others are getting too.
<P>
	If it is a matter of deficit reduction, if it is a matter of having 
the UI fund live within its means, there is another way to fix that. 
The way to do it is not through unfairness. Instead of paying that 
fellow that rate and that other person another rate let us just 
equalize it. We may have to pay one fellow a bit less and the 
other fellow a bit more. It is not a matter of dollars here. We are 
not talking overall costs. We are talking another issue. We are 
talking about whether we believe as parliamentarians in a 
system that is fair. I can tell this House that I do and I will 
oppose any suggestion that would treat Canadians unfairly.
<P>
	I have just given one quick example of where my eyes are 
open in case the need arises to have them open on that issue. Lest 
some colleagues who just joined us got bogged down in my 
examples, let me remind all concerned, including the people 
outside the House who may be watching, that the Minister of 
Human Resources Development put down a motion that the 
House take note of the progress made to date on the 
government's forthcoming reform of social security programs 
and take note of the views expressed by Canadians.
<P>
	I spent most of my time on the latter issue. I believe the 
success of this process or its failure will be determined largely 
by the degree to which we give Canadians an opportunity to say 
what they think of the proposals, say what their answers are to 
the questions and the degree to which we listen to that feedback.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I always enjoy 
interventions by the member for Burin-St. George's. Actually, 
without any disrespect to him, he did remind me of a friend I 
have who used to talk endlessly and used many words. When I 
challenged him on it one time he said: ``I am a mathematician. I 
just use statistics. By the law of averages if I speak long enough 
and fast enough sooner or later I will say something important''. 
Without putting the member down, there were many words but 
not terribly many solid ideas in his speech.
<P>
	One place I was invoked to make a little comment was when 
he was speaking about unemployment insurance. I have said 
unemployment insurance is exactly what its name implies. It 
ensures that we have unemployment, and so it has been. I could 
give many examples but that is not my purpose right now.
<P>
	The fundamental difference between the Liberal philosophy 
on social programs and the Reform philosophy, which is more a 
philosophy of self-determination or looking after oneself, is 
that the Liberals make the assumption that unless the 
government does it, it will not be done. This is particularly true 
in the area of unemployment insurance and in many of our other 
social security programs. They somehow feel the government 
has to be doing it. We believe it is a function of the people, the 
taxpayers.
<P>
	I made an observation while the hon. member was speaking. I 
have the advantage of being old enough to remember enough 
years and see changes over time. A way back we were very well 
off. I remember we had lots of jobs. Unemployment was very 
low. There were very few needy people in real need. Their needs 
were all met. Yet we did not have these government programs.
<P>
	Now with all the government programs and the huge rate of 
taxation we find a dampening of the economy. The government 
sucks everything out of us. We know that marginal tax rates are 
50 per cent or more. There is very little money left for the people 
to look after themselves and to help their neighbours.
<P>
	I make a connection. I say that increased government 
involvement in these things has added significantly to our lack 
of efficiency, the downturn in the economy and the resulting 
hard times many of us face.
<P>
	I would like to hear the member's response to my statement 
that we differ in philosophy. Would he perhaps consider 
admitting at least partially that the government is also part of the 
problem as opposed to thinking that it has not done enough to 
find a solution?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Mr. Speaker, my friend from Elk Island is one 
of the courageous people I was talking about earlier. Let me 
show his last effort at courage. Having said I said nothing in 20 
minutes, he now has the courage to dare to ask if I can say 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7916"> 7916 </A></B>
<P>
something substantive in 30 seconds. I am glad he was not trying 
to put me down. I  am sensitive these days but I take his 
assurance at his word.
<P>
	He tried to indicate the difference between Reformers and 
Liberals. I will put it more graphically for him. We do not think 
we should let poor people die because they are poor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Neither do we.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> You could have fooled me.
<P>
	There is a need for those programs. Despite the fact that by the 
member's own admission he may be old, decrepit and so on, he 
misinforms the House. He can remember when there were 
programs. When was he born? Of course there was UI in his 
youth; of course there was social security. He should not mislead 
the House. These programs were not brought in by this 
administration or the previous one. These programs have been 
there for decades upon decades. The unemployment program 
goes back nearly half a century.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> More than that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Slightly more. In reaching to make a point I 
say to him-he is my senior so I should not be trying to coach 
him in public like this-that he does not need to reach for 
falsehoods to prove his thesis. For him to stand in the House and 
say these programs have lately arrived is a falsehood; it is just 
not true. These programs were there when he was a baby.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Burin-St. 
George's described another member of the House as being old 
and decrepit. I may have missed it, but was he quoting the 
member who had just spoken in using those words? If he was not 
quoting, I hope the member did not wish to describe any member 
in the House as being old and decrepit.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was taking some poetic licence 
just to make a point in referring to one of the more virile and 
youthful members of the Chamber.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Mr. Speaker, with respect to the reference to my 
age, mature and wise would be better than old and decrepit. In 
response to what the member has just said, surely I am not so old 
that I lived before these programs were in place. I guess they did 
come into place about the time I was in my youth. Certainly they 
were not nearly as invasive and pervasive as they are now. That 
is the difference.
<P>
	We used to have a very modest program for unemployment 
insurance and everybody was employed. Now we have a 
pervasive program of unemployment insurance and we have a 12 
per cent or 10 per cent rate of unemployment.
<P>
	That is what I was talking about. There has been such an 
increase in government programs and such an increase in 
taxation as a result that the economic balance has been seriously 
tilted.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have two points in response. 
First, I agree with my friend from Elk Island that government is 
much too pervasive. It is and I agree completely. The second 
point which I piggyback on the first one is that too often in the 
House we fall into the trap we are in again today. He felt obliged 
to rise and say ``the member has said nothing; he talked ad 
nauseam'' and so on. With respect, I said several things I think 
the member on reflection would agree are substantive.
<P>
	I talked about the basic premise for UI and the basic premise 
for OAS. He may not agree with these premises, but he cannot 
say they are all verbiage. They are statements. Whether he 
agrees with them or not is another issue. He falls into the trap, 
and I did to a degree in response, of always being obliged to 
knock what the other guy said.
<P>
	I tried to give as considerate a statement as I could during my 
20 minutes in which I said where I am coming from on the issue 
of social reform. I measured beforehand its success or failure in 
terms of to what degree the government listens and how much 
the government canvasses opinion.
<P>
	What I have said in short, and probably could have said more 
briefly, is that the jury is out on this one. I am not up here saying 
this is the best thing since sliced bread because I cannot see it 
yet. I do not know what it is. We should not fall into the trap of 
just knocking the other guy because he sits on the other side of 
the House. I happen to agree with the member for Elk Island that 
the government is too pervasive. One of the goals of the reform 
package ought to be to get government out of some people's hair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I enjoyed the speech of the hon. member for 
Burin-St. George's. It is always interesting listening to him 
speak.
<P>
	He mentioned the UI program. I would agree there have to be 
some changes for the UI program to continue. Of course the 
Reform Party has been talking about making the program 
actuarially sound. I would like his comments on that.
<P>
	The member also raised an example of a UI situation. I would 
also like to bring to the attention of the House a situation in my 
own riding of Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt which 
happened recently. We had a terrible forest fire in the Penticton 
region that devastated the area for quite some time over the 
holidays, our peak tourism season. God bless the people who 
came out to fight the forest fire. They were there to ensure the 
fire did not spread much farther than it did. We lost in the 
neighbourhood of a dozen homes; it could have been a lot worse.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7917"> 7917 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	Recently a company that does a controlled burn each year on a 
contract basis in the Merritt region went to the unemployment 
insurance people and said it needed some people to help with the 
controlled burn. Strangely enough the same people who fought 
the forest fire in Penticton were the people that year after year 
participated in the controlled burn. This year he could not get 
those people to come out. The UIC said that these people had 
been asked and they said: ``No, we have had it with fires and 
working in the forests. We can do much better if we stay on UI 
for this period of time''. This is an excellent example of abuse in 
the system.
<P>
	What would the member do? What would be his suggestion to 
alleviate this situation?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Mr. Speaker, on his question about whether I 
believe it ought to be actuarially sound, the answer is yes. I gave 
that answer in other words during my speech. I think I used the 
phrase that the fund ought to live within its means. I believe that. 
On his example, I can give him several like it. It is another 
example of how the UI scheme has been a disincentive to work.
<P>
	I remember when I was a school superintendent in 
Newfoundland that I used to have people coming into my office 
on a number of occasions and saying: ``You are the 
superintendent''. ``Yes''. ``How do you spell that?'' ``Yeah''. 
``Have you got a job for me here?'' ``No''. ``You are also the 
president of the Green Bay Economic Development 
Association?'' ``Yeah''. ``How do you spell that?'' ``Yeah''. 
``You have got another job up there, have you?'' ``No, no''. 
``Now you are also involved with that park up on the highway''. 
``Yeah''. ``How do you spell that?'' ``Yeah''. They had just 
applied to three employers for employment. They could go back 
now and fill in their forms that they had approached three 
employers and they could not find work.
<P>
	I also remember the day that a dear young former student of 
mine refused a job as a secretary. I knew why she was refusing it 
and I reported her. One of the reasons we have abuse has to do 
with the abusers. Another reason is the aiders and abettors, the 
employers who will not report the abuses.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will address 
the House on social program review today in a slightly different 
manner than is usual.
<P>
	I will direct my comments to the pages in the Chamber for a 
couple of reasons. I think the pages might well listen to me. I 
find it sometimes frustrating to stand in the House and I do not 
think I am necessarily being listened to. I should like to address 
these young, enthusiastic, keen students who have come to 
Parliament. They are smart. They are a good example of what 
Canada should reflect upon.
<P>
	They are fluently bilingual. They are from all over the 
country. I notice a few of them gathering in the wings here. They 
are paying attention. They are listening to the fact that 
somebody wants to talk to them.
<P>
	I know they are smart because they remember all our faces. 
They can call us by name. They are kind to me when I speak to 
them in French as I try to improve my French. They speak very 
slowly so I can comprehend what they say. I am speaking to 
them because what we are undertaking in this social program 
review will affect them a lot more than anyone else in the 
Chamber.
<P>
	I will be dead and gone when the effects of the social program 
review are truly on the table. I speak to the pages and only to the 
pages. If others in the Chamber want to close their ears, look 
down at their papers and do other things, I give them my 
complete concurrence; I am not going to be upset if they do so. I 
do not think the pages will heckle me either. Maybe that is 
another benefit in talking to the pages.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	Why are we undergoing a social program review in Canada 
today? During the election campaign a significant number of 
individuals got after me for the social program review thoughts 
that I had. I laid them out on the table pretty plainly. I did not 
find social program review to be a large part of the programs 
from some of the candidates who ran against me.
<P>
	I read a very interesting article in <I>Maclean's</I> magazine just 
before the election. That article had a headline ``Social 
Programs: The Cuts to Come''. It described a process whereby 
we were going to undergo social program review no matter who 
was in power. It said it would not matter if it were the NDP, it 
would not matter if it were the Tories, it would not matter if it 
was the communist party from somewhere else, whether 
Reformers were in power or whether the Liberals were in power, 
there was going to be social program review.
<P>
	I said there is no way that some of the parties that conducted 
this campaign could have a major social program review. I read 
the platform carefully. I said there is no way that the Liberals 
could have social program review. And here we are today with a 
major social program review.
<P>
	I said to myself: Why are we now undergoing this social 
program review? Of course, the reason is staring us in the face. 
The reason is our debt. The debt leaves us with unsustainable 
social programs. As the article said, it would not matter who was 
sitting in the government benches, we would have that review.
<P>
	I have had trouble in understanding the debt. All my life I 
have heard this spoken about. I am a car nut, a phrase that I bear 
proudly. I love old cars. I have a hobby of old cars. I finally 
figured out how I could explain the debt to the high school 
students. To the pages, here is what the debt means.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7918"> 7918 </A></B>
<P>
	Each one of you young people in this chamber today owes to 
the federal government a brand new Camaro. It is a basic 
Camaro, not a fancy one. It has plain wheels. It does not have 
radial tires, it has plain tires. It is an automatic. It does not have 
electric windows, it has wind-up windows. It has a heater and it 
has a good motor. It will get you from home to the Parliament 
Buildings or from university to the Parliament Buildings every 
day. It is brand new. That is your debt to the federal government.
<P>
	Do you know what the kids in the high schools said to me? 
They said: ``Grant, where is my Camaro?''
<P>
	If the current mandate of this government takes place and 
everything that they promise us unfolds, I say to the pages that 
they will owe the federal government a Z-28 Camaro. This 
Camaro will have alloy rims and an AM-FM stereo. It will not 
have a CD player. We are not quite that broke yet. It will have the 
big motor. Now, this motor is a hot motor, a 300 horsepower 
motor, zero to 60 in about 5.4 seconds. It has electric windows. 
It has nice thick upholstery in it. It is not the plain Jane model at 
all. That is their debt to this federal government.
<P>
	When I told that to the high school students they really were 
upset because every one of them wants the Z-28 Camaro. They 
are beautiful cars, every kid's ideal. They said to me: ``Where is 
my Z-28?''
<P>
	The answer is: Your Z-28 you will pay for and it is in the 
hands of our federal government. Every single individual in 
Canada owes to the federal government that Camaro; every 
single infant, every single grandparent, every single member of 
these chambers. That is the reason that we are undergoing social 
program review.
<P>
	The interest on the debt that we are paying is just paying for 
the borrowing each year. What a legacy to the pages. What a 
legacy my generation presents to you. Many of you, if you think 
carefully of this, will say: ``Thanks a lot for the debt; thanks a lot 
for that legacy.''
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	Will they look back with fond memories at their time here in 
these chambers? Will they look back and say: ``I learned a lot as 
I was studying in university and was present and part of the 
history of these chambers?'' I believe they will. Will they feel a 
part of Canadian history? We have a new Parliament. We have an 
opportunity with many new backbenchers who have never been 
tied to the old government ways, many individuals with bright 
thoughts, on both sides of the House ready to undertake new 
ideas, ready to reform the way government operates. Rookies. 
They know about the dissatisfaction of the public. They went to 
the doorsteps and heard the problems. Yet I see what I consider 
to be a slow slide back into some of the old ways of the old 
government.
<P>
	I had an opportunity to sit with the HRD committee and talk 
about the consultation process it has undertaken. I am fully in 
agreement with the consultation process. Canadians need to 
know what the government is doing, need to have input, need to 
have the opportunity to reflect upon and express their viewpoint 
on the consultation process.
<P>
	I am very critical of 15 members of Parliament flapping 
around the country like a wounded goose, going from major city 
to major city looking for public input. I am profoundly critical 
of the numbers of individuals who can reach them. I am 
profoundly critical of the cost of that exercise. I read that even 
though they have a somewhat crippled goose to fly around on, it 
will cost $800,000.
<P>
	There is another mechanism for this government to consult 
the public on something like social program review. The 
mechanism is straightforward. The HRD minister presents a 
package that is very straightforward so that everyone has the 
same information. I look upon the best package as being a video. 
It would spread the HRD minister all over the country. I thought 
he would like that idea, with his smiling face in every townhall 
meeting.
<P>
	Every single member of Parliament would take that video 
along with the background information and have townhall 
meetings throughout their constituencies; for the senior citizens 
in homes who do not get to have a consultation with the Minister 
of Human Resources Development and for those individuals in 
the small communities who are too busy to travel to the main 
cities. The cost would be very small. The taxpayers are already 
paying the member of Parliament's salary and already paying 
their way home. Who knows the constituency better?
<P>
	That information would be gathered by the members of 
Parliament. They would come back and present that information 
to the committee which would look at all the input, profound 
input, close input, tight input, input that I think would be much 
more typical than special interest groups being paid for by the 
government to step forward.
<P>
	I saw those individuals come to the committee before, one 
after another. I heard NIMBY, every single one of them with a 
NIMBY. At the second round of consultations the same people 
came back.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Not in my backyard.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> I had an opportunity to say to them: 
``Who's paying you to come here?'' I found that the government 
was financing not only their way here but the studies they were 
undertaking. One group had $40,000 for the brief that it came to 
the committee with.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7919"> 7919 </A></B>
<P>
	We as individuals are paying not only for their trips but the 
briefs. Surely interested Canadians do not need $40,000 to tell 
the minister that there are specific things that they want him to 
conduct in social program review.
<P>
	When I was an intern I once went mountaineering. Your 
pages, Mr. Speaker, are still young enough to be mountaineers. 
Let me tell a mountaineering story. I wanted to climb Mount 
Assiniboine, 11,870 feet, one of the really high peaks in the 
Rockies, a famous peak. It looks like the Matterhorn. It is a 
significant height to get to. I had a big back pack. I went with one 
of my buddies.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	As we got into Assiniboia we met up with a fellow from 
California, a powerful looking young man with all the fancy 
equipment. I have never seen more mountaineering equipment 
in my life. It was the most modern, the best. He had ropes that 
were beyond our means. We had pretty inexpensive ropes and all 
our climbing equipment was used, tattered I suppose you would 
say.
<P>
	We were going to climb Assiniboine and he asked to join us. 
Well, a pretty impressive group, but mountaineering is 
somewhat dangerous. We asked what his experience was. He had 
climbed all over, almost everywhere. He had climbed this peak, 
that peak, and had all this equipment so we said he should join 
us. He did.
<P>
	We climbed early in the morning. You have to cross 
underneath the glacier in this particular spot. If you cross early 
enough in the morning the sun does not melt the ice and snow 
and there is very little risk. We crossed underneath the glacier at 
three in the morning, before the sun was up. We got to the place 
where the climb started to get a little bit risky, so we roped up. 
My buddy was on one end of the rope, the stranger in the middle, 
and myself on the end. We started to climb one at a time. The 
rope was simply for security.
<P>
	We reached a point where there was a gravel slope with a very 
steep cliff at the end. The young man in the middle fell. He 
skidded down the gravel slope and went over the cliff. Of course 
the rope was designed so that we could arrest him. As I tried to 
get good footing, I also skidded down on the gravel, lost my 
footing completely and I was going over the cliff. This was 
1,500 feet straight down. Gonzo, over the cliff. Luckily, because 
he was higher up on a better more secure spot, my buddy was 
able to arrest us both.
<P>
	What lesson do I bring from this mountaineering story on 
Assiniboine to the pages? There is a huge risk in our society and 
the risk is that we will ignore our debt. The debt is going to pull 
us over the cliff and there will be no arresting us if we go over. 
The social programs will be gone if we go over that cliff.
<P>
	We talk about review of the social programs. Forget the social 
programs if we go over the cliff of the debt. There are ample 
examples of this in other countries, New Zealand being the best 
one. The field I am so keen on is  health care. I look at what 
happened to their health care system when they slammed into 
the debt wall. They went from a socialized health care system to 
one where every single visit to the doctor costs. Cough up, shell 
out. Do we want that in Canada? Do we need that in Canada? We 
do not. Social program review is necessary. Social program 
review is mandatory. You pages should have a part in social 
program review. I ask you, I beg you, I implore you to be 
involved. Speak up. Tell my generation what matters to you in 
social program review and, to the pages, thank you for listening 
to me.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think we should remind 
the viewers of what motion we are debating. It is Motion No. 15 
which says that this House take note of the progress made to date 
on the government's forthcoming reform of social security 
programs and of the views expressed by Canadians with regard 
to this reform.
<P>
	Last week when the House was not sitting I had a townhall 
meeting with an excellent attendance. I would like to share some 
of the views from my constituents in Toronto.
<P>
	At that townhall meeting almost everyone in the audience 
agreed that a strong economy is the essence of a strong society. 
They also agreed with the government's two priorities, jobs and 
economic growth. The Government of Canada will meet those 
priorities by building a healthy fiscal climate, by getting the 
federal deficit down and eventually eliminating the public debt 
as some people have already stressed in this debate.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	It will strengthen Canada's economic performance through 
investment, innovation and trade; review government programs 
and priorities, making sure that as a government we are 
concentrating our energy on the right things in the most 
effective way possible. Finally, it has the priority of reforming 
social security.
<P>
	Why is reforming social security part of this agenda for 
growth? Because good social programs will put people and jobs 
together. The programs we have now do not do that well enough. 
It is time to rebuild and modernize our social security programs 
to build a system that will help people get back to work, help 
people get off welfare and build a better life for their families.
<P>
	In education, prior to being a politician, I met families that 
were second and third generation on welfare. This has to stop. 
Our system will have to look squarely at the problem of child 
poverty and do something about it.
<P>
	It is up to all Canadians to decide how we can build a system 
that works, that is fair, affordable and effective, with programs 
that open doors, not close them, to opportunity for people across 
our great country. The federal government has presented 
Canadians with some options for discussion. Now it is inviting 
all Canadians to consider how we can build such a system. How 
must our social programs change to stay in touch with the needs  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7920"> 7920 </A></B>
<P>
people face today? What kind of programs make sense as 
Canada prepares for the 21st century?
<P>
	At the town hall meeting I was asked why do we need reform? 
Because our social programs have not kept pace with the needs 
of Canadians. For too many people the system does not work any 
more. At this town hall meeting there was a qualified doctor who 
is on welfare. Because he got his training in another country he 
cannot work in Canada.
<P>
	Canadian taxpayers are spending more than $38 billion a year 
on employment programs, UI, welfare, post-secondary 
education, child tax benefits and programs for disabled persons. 
Yet too many people are unemployed or find themselves caught 
in a revolving door going from UI to short term jobs and back to 
UI.
<P>
	Too many children are living in poverty. Too many people are 
stuck on social assistance. They want to work, but under our 
present system they cannot afford to go to work. They are better 
off financially staying on social assistance.
<P>
	Too many young people cannot get started in a career. It 
breaks my heart when I get a PhD graduate or a Master's 
graduate coming to my constituency office begging: ``Mr. Flis, 
can you help me find work?''
<P>
	In many ways the system keeps people on a treadmill instead 
of helping to solve their problems. Too many Canadians fall 
through the cracks. Too many Canadians find the rules stacked 
against them when they try to build better lives for themselves 
and for their children.
<P>
	People here in Ontario know firsthand how urgent the need for 
reform is. Ontario today is at a crossroads. The recession and the 
effects of international competition have taken jobs we thought 
were secure. It has helped push unprecedented numbers of 
people on to unemployment insurance and social assistance 
rolls. Now that things are beginning to improve, our social 
programs do not do enough to help people to get back into the 
workforce.
<P>
	We have been forced to recognize that our social programs 
were designed in an era that has passed into the history books. In 
1993 the average unemployed worker in Ontario between the 
ages of 45 and 64 had been looking for work for 34 weeks. That 
figure masks the number who were facing much longer 
unemployment because of their limited skills and as a result of 
industrial change. For too many of them a plant shutdown meant 
a career shutdown. We can no longer afford that.
<P>
	Ontario recognizes the need for reform as do all governments. 
Now is the time to work together. We need a system that works 
for people, that brings hope, that rewards initiative, that 
supports efforts to regain independence and the dignity of work. 
We need a system that Canadians can afford. All governments 
have to get spending under control if we are to take control of the 
future.
<P>
	In my region we contend with four levels of government: 
federal, provincial, metro Toronto, Toronto and a lot of 
unnecessary duplication. We must do a better job in putting 
people and jobs together. Employment programs, things like job 
counselling, training, labour market information, work 
experience projects are a good investment if they help people 
get off UI or welfare and back to work. But existing programs do 
not work well enough.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	We need to invest more in people, focusing on better tools to 
help people get jobs and better management to make sure those 
tools get results.
<P>
	The green paper suggests a healthy debate around possible 
directions for reform, making progress more accessible to those 
who need help, especially people on social assistance and 
persons with disabilities. We must pay more attention to 
individual needs, with more assessment and counselling to help 
each person develop a practical action plan for getting a job.
<P>
	People come to my constituency office complaining that they 
have to wait six months before they can see a counsellor, and as a 
result miss many opportunities.
<P>
	We should consider giving communities, local business, 
labour, education and service groups more control over what 
kinds of programs are used and how they are used.
<P>
	Another possible direction suggested in the green paper is 
encouraging more employers to provide training on the job. 
Why not? We can ensure that institutional training is relevant 
and effective. We can help people get work experience, for 
example by offering to supplement their wages if they are hired, 
or finding opportunities for community work, something we 
have not stressed enough. We can reduce duplication and waste 
in programs, with better co-ordination between the federal, 
provincial and local governments. We must pay more attention 
to results and help people get jobs and less attention to following 
rigid bureaucratic rules.
<P>
	I mentioned as an example someone who came to my office 
wanting a course which was to begin in a couple of weeks. That 
course would have led to full time employment. So I said, great, 
why don't you take it, why don't you apply? He could not 
because he had to see a counsellor first. I asked him why don't 
you see the counsellor? The counsellor cannot see this person 
for six months because of the workload. Another opportunity is 
lost where someone could have taken a course which would have 
led to full time employment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7921"> 7921 </A></B>
<P>
	We must have unemployment insurance that makes sense. For 
too many people the UI program does not work any more. It does 
not help them get the skills they need for new jobs. It does not 
help people solve their employment problems. Too often it just 
makes those problems worse because there is no incentive or 
support for people to change. Canadians want a better UI 
program, one that is fair and affordable and helps unemployed 
people get good long term jobs.
<P>
	Another constituent complained because she has been 
working for six years with the same company but it has always 
been on a part time basis. The employer saves all of the fringe 
benefits, et cetera. This has to stop.
<P>
	One way to adjust the system is to make people work longer to 
qualify for UI or reduce the amount they receive. Or we could 
shorten the time people could collect UI. That might help but we 
need more than that. We should look at an entirely new 
employment insurance program, one that really helps people 
deal with employment problems. The hon. member mentions a 
newly-formed party in the past that led to unemployment 
instead of employment.
<P>
	The discussion paper outlines one possible approach, a 
program that targets special help to people who have trouble 
getting a job. It would have two components; basic insurance 
and adjustment insurance. Occasional UI claimants, people who 
face temporary, occasional unemployment would get basic 
insurance benefits. This would give them income support while 
they looked for work, much as at the present time. The frequent 
UI claimants, people who keep having employment problems, 
would get adjustment insurance benefits. They would get much 
better help finding a job than they do now through things like 
better job counselling, training, or opportunities for community 
work.
<P>
	Adjustment insurance benefits could depend on a person's 
willingness to take part in programs that would help them find 
work. Reformed programs will open more doors through 
learning. More than ever before the key to security for 
Canadians is learning. Education, training, skills are the only 
ticket to a good job.
<P>
	More Canadians need opportunities for training and education 
throughout their lives. We all know now that learning is a 
lifetime process. While the provinces are responsible for 
education, the federal government plays an important role. But 
education and training cost money. How can we make sure that 
individual Canadians can afford the learning they need?
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	Some options outlined in the green paper include: making 
more loans and grants available for students; exploring a new 
form of income contingent repayment of student loans. These 
loans would be repayable only after a student graduates and 
enters the workforce. At that point a repayment schedule would 
be based on the borrower's ability to repay, given his or her 
income levels.
<P>
	I am sure many of the members here receive students at their 
offices who are at a breaking point mentally because the 
previous government sent out collection agencies to collect the 
loans that they did not repay. How can they repay the loans if 
they cannot get a job? That has to change.
<P>
	Another option is allowing more flexibility in registered 
retirement savings plans so that people could draw on those 
savings for lifelong learning. Our goal must be to preserve and 
broaden access to post-secondary education. A reformed 
program must provide a fair chance for all Canadians. This is a 
basic commitment at the heart of our social security reform, to 
protect those most in need. It is the same policy that we have in 
our foreign policy, to help those most in need.
<P>
	That commitment will remain firm but we have got to do a 
better job. The system is not working despite the fact that 
spending on welfare and social services has jumped from $2.6 
billion to more than $8 billion annually since 1981. Too many 
Canadian children live in poverty, more children 
proportionately than any other industrialized country except the 
U.S.A. Too many parents of those children spend years on 
welfare even though with the right kind of help they could find 
work. The problem is we do not give them the help they need.
<P>
	The source of the problem is the outdated rules of the Canada 
assistance plan know as CAP. The rules place strict limits on 
how federal funding through CAP can be used. We have got to 
start looking at new ideas to help all Canadians get a better 
chance in life.
<P>
	For example, how can we make the rules more flexible and put 
people first, giving the provinces more leeway to design 
programs that work? How can we start focusing more of our 
attention on long term solutions like preventing child poverty 
instead of just tinkering around with short term cures? Should 
we take some of the money we spend now and use it for special 
priorities like increasing the child tax benefit for low income 
families, or giving people on welfare more training and more 
help finding jobs, or providing more opportunities for people 
with disabilities so we do not have the incidents such as we saw 
yesterday on the news?
<P>
	Many of the ideas behind social security reform are already 
being put into action here in Ontario through creative 
partnership agreements between the Ontario and federal 
governments.
<P>
	The first of these will create a series of local labour force 
development boards across the province. The boards will give 
communities a real voice in training and employment 
development priority setting. It will give them the chance to put 
federal and provincial dollars to work on the needs they see 
around them. Real grassroots planning and action will mean that 
money is spent where it has the best chance to create results.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7922"> 7922 </A></B>
<P>
	Another joint project, Joblink Ontario, will create about a 
dozen resource centres in communities across the province on a 
pilot basis. The $25 million that the federal government will 
contribute this year will match Ontario's contribution. These 
resource centres will help people on social assistance prepare 
for and find jobs. It will give them one-stop shopping for 
training and employment programs for all levels of government 
and community agencies. It will offer real support to people who 
can work and who want to work. Through counselling, labour 
market information and Canada employment centre job listings 
these people will gain the self-sufficiency they need to escape 
the welfare trap.
<P>
	By working together the ideas behind social security reform 
are already becoming a reality in Ontario, but we cannot stop 
here. In the past generations of Canadians have risen to the 
challenge of building a society that cares, that has compassion 
for the disadvantaged, that supports those in need. This is a 
challenge each generation must face in turn.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	It is now our turn, and I include every member in this 
Chamber. It is our turn to shape a system that works here on the 
eve of a new century. We should face this challenge with 
confidence. We can face this challenge knowing that as a nation 
our prospects for the future are good.
<P>
	The federal government is putting in place a comprehensive 
agenda for economic growth and jobs for Canadians. We can 
make social security reform an integral part of that agenda. As 
demonstrated in my town hall meeting of last week Canadians 
want a better system. By working together we will build a better 
system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, our debt is 
rising at a fantastic rate since this government came into power. 
Admittedly, some of it would have been the fulfilling of 
obligations from the previous government. We do not know the 
number but most likely we have slipped another $40 billion into 
debt.
<P>
	I have a question with respect to the speed with which this is 
coming about. After a year we finally have a discussion paper 
which we are now supposed to start talking about. Canadians 
were already talking about it before the last election. By now I 
would have liked to have seen a good system of cost analysis 
with options on these different programs so that we could begin 
making choices and start making the necessary cuts in order to 
prevent us from sliding into debt so deeply that we will never get 
out.
<P>
	I would like the member's comment on the whole question of 
speed and urgency with respect to this debate that is going on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Flis:</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome that question. I get the same 
question from many constituents: Why is it taking so long? Why 
not do it tomorrow?
<P>
	If you want a true consultative process, if you honestly want 
to get input from the grassroots Canadians it will be a slower 
process. By listening to Canadians you have to determine what 
programs are of highest priority, what programs are of the least 
priority. Then as a government jointly with all parties in 
opposition we have to decide which programs we must continue 
funding and which programs can be dropped. Then we have to 
see what kind of resources, how many public service personnel 
we need to match those programs and what kind of financial 
resources we need to match those programs.
<P>
	We lead the public astray when we complain we are not 
moving fast enough. We are moving very quickly when you 
consider the kind of input that the minister, the parliamentary 
secretary, and individual members from all three parties are 
getting through town hall meetings. I think we are moving fairly 
quickly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a follow up comment and question to try to determine the 
member's motivation for the social policy review.
<P>
	He mentions in his opening remarks the reason the review is 
necessary is that the programs are not working properly for 
Canadians any more. Other people would argue that a financial 
motivation is actually driving it. The agenda is being driven 
because we must change because we cannot foot the bills.
<P>
	In his opinion which is the case? Is it the case that we must 
change because we are going to go over the waterfall that 
another member mentioned earlier today? Or is it because they 
are not just working well? I am wondering which is the priority.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Flis:</B> Mr. Speaker, we ran on a platform of putting our 
own house in order first. When I say we, I include all of us. To 
get our house in order we have to look at the programs and which 
ones we can afford.
<P>
	We give out $38 billion for programs and services but we 
spend more than that in paying the interest on the public debt. I 
know we agree on that. We see eye to eye. We are going to have 
to reduce the annual deficit and bring down the public debt. I do 
not think we can wait for one and then the other. All of this has to 
go hand in hand.
<P>
<B>(1350 ) </B>
<P>
	I know the Reform Party would like to reduce the annual 
deficit in one year and wipe out the public debt in one or two 
years. If we did that we would put so many people out of work 
that we would really bankrupt this country because it is jobs that 
create the resources and funding that we need to carry on.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7923"> 7923 </A></B>
<P>
	Let us not forget that even with all of our deficit and public 
debt, et cetera the United Nations still named Canada as the 
number one country on this planet in which to live. Therefore, 
we must be doing something right. We are not perfect and we 
never said we were, but we must be doing something right for a 
United Nations organization to put Canada that high on the map 
measured against certain social protection.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (LotbiniÃ¨re, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will share 
my time with my colleagues in this House by splitting it into 
10-minute periods.
<P>
	The least that can be said is that the Liberal government has 
finally achieved unanimity. In every province, a mass 
movement is taking shape against the proposed reform of social 
programs. I predicted-and I was not the only one-that the 
people would rise up against this reform whose prime objective 
is very clear: to meet the finance minister's budget requirements 
by slashing social programs. Yesterday, it was thousands of 
angry students, as the minister's dry cleaner can attest to. 
Tomorrow, it will be all the others who have nothing but whom 
the government is still going after. The only objective is to cut 
social programs.
<P>
	The government plans to announce additional measures in its 
1995 Budget, as it states on page 23 of its discussion paper. We 
know that the government has prepared a secret document 
specifying that the $7.5 billion in cuts announced in the last 
Budget will be supplemented by another $7.5 billion in cuts over 
five years.
<P>
	I will now deal with the minister's proposal to address the 
current unemployment problem. His favoured option will 
introduce a second class of unemployed, that of workers with 
precarious jobs. Women and young people, who hold the 
majority of these jobs, will be the main victims of this reform. 
With this proposal, the minister creates cheap labour. In 
addition to compulsory employability measures, these 
unemployed people will be required to participate in community 
work. They also want these second-class people to pay higher 
premiums in return for lower benefits. Indeed, the government 
feels that some citizens are just lazy bums who lose their jobs on 
purpose. It wants to treat the unemployed like thieves sentenced 
to community work.
<P>
	The federal government has always stressed that 
unemployment insurance was a generous system aimed at 
redistributing the wealth across the country. Yet, the minister's 
paper states that it may-repeat, may-become necessary to put 
in place special programs for seasonal workers to offset the 
negative impact of reform on regions with very high 
unemployment rates. If the government does not give that 
assurance in its document, this is cause for serious concern.
<P>
	Earlier this week, a cartoon in a Quebec daily depicted a 
producer selling his corn for 75 cents a dozen, at -30 degrees. 
This is what the government wants seasonal workers to do.
<P>
	As regards manpower training, the federal government 
continues to dismiss Quebec's claims. It wants to maintain 
national standards to bypass provincial initiatives and let local 
communities decide which programs they want to implement. 
The government is again trying to impose its famous 
single-window concept, which perpetuates overlapping and 
duplication, this time under the same roof. Talk about 
improvement! While all every stakeholder in Quebec agrees on 
the need for an integrated provincial policy on manpower 
development, the federal government persists in wanting to 
control everything. Ironically, the proposal made by the 
government in its report is the same one which was rejected last 
summer by the former Quebec Liberal government.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	By persisting in maintaining and even increasing their 
involvement in manpower training, the Liberals only contribute 
to the administrative mess they know exists. In Quebec, $500 
million were wasted within two years.
<P>
	As we all saw, many students came here yesterday to 
demonstrate. Several women called me and said: ``Can you tell 
me, sir, what will happen to me with the new social program 
reform? My husband earns $50,000 and I earn much less 
compared to him, but I do pay unemployment insurance 
premiums''.
<P>
	I told this woman: ``Look, in all honesty, I think that you 
should get the service for which you pay''. But this is not what 
the reform will do. The reform will ensure that you pay, but that 
you do not get the service.
<P>
	I should tell you that one group of workers I helped at the 
union level went to court because they had paid for a service 
they never received. These people, who may be paying 
unemployment insurance premiums, will now be able to say: ``I 
contribute to the unemployment insurance fund, and my 
husband earns so much money. I will no longer pay 
unemployment insurance premiums, since I will not be entitled 
to benefits''.
<P>
	It only makes sense not to pay for a service you will not get. 
We should not focus only on the negative aspects of the reform. 
At one point, I asked why a reform of the unemployment 
insurance program was undertaken. I was told that too many 
people cheat the system. I said fine, can you tell me the 
percentage these people represent. The answer was 1 per cent. 
One per cent are cheaters, and because of that one percent, the 99 
per cent who are honest, who have not done anything wrong, will 
be penalized.
<P>
	That is totally unacceptable. I entirely agree that reform is 
necessary, but we should not penalize the most vulnerable in our 
society and we should not penalize all women in Quebec and 
<P>

<B><A NAME="7924"> 7924 </A></B>
<P>
Canada by withholding  unemployment insurance benefits 
because of a tax bracket that is beyond a certain level.
<P>
	There are alternatives, and I can suggest a few simple ones. I 
agree that reform and cuts are necessary, but leave the most 
vulnerable members of our society alone, once and for all. Go 
after the multinationals that make millions of dollars in profits 
and do not pay taxes.
<P>
	I have had enough. I can no longer go along with this system. 
There is something I have to tell you, Mr. Speaker. You saw 
those young people demonstrating on Parliament Hill. I would 
urge the unions, I would urge all workers to get up and come to 
Ottawa to demonstrate against these measures which are 
intolerable, and I can tell you I will be there on Parliament Hill 
with those groups, with the most vulnerable members of our 
society.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I believe there are five minutes remaining in 
the period for questions and comments. We will continue after 
Question Period.
<P>
	It being 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 30(5) the House 
will now proceed to statements by members pursuant to 
Standing Order 31.

	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, among Canada's senior citizens there is a strong desire 
to remain autonomous and stay in their homes as long as 
possible.
<P>
	Home adaptations and safer consumer products can play an 
important role. Increasing the level of awareness among health, 
housing and support service professionals and seniors 
themselves about home adaptation resources and opportunities, 
as well as information about safety in the home can help seniors 
maintain their independence and remain in their homes with 
greater comfort and security.
<P>
	Health Canada, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation 
and the Canadian Association of Occupational Therapists all 
support the Canada Safety Council's 1994 National Seniors 
Safety Week campaign, November 12 to 18. Together we can 
work to meet the safety and housing needs of this important

	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (ChÃ¢teauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
week Quebec emphasizes the vital contribution made to our 
society by members of our cultural communities.
<P>
	At a time when Quebec is preparing to choose the country it 
wants, this intercultural week should not be seen as another 
forum for dialogue but as an opportunity for co-operation and 
for actively promoting membership in a common culture while 
respecting one another's differences.
<P>
	Since Monday, the unions, schools and municipalities, to 
name a few, have been organizing numerous activities that 
demonstrate how open Quebec is to its citizens from other 
countries and other cultures. For instance, we have the 
Association des droits des minoritÃ©s du grand ChÃ¢teauguay, 
which will hold a seminar called <I>Contact 1994</I>, an opportunity 
to celebrate these much needed intercultural ties.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the bedrock of the 
Canadian legal system is the British common law.
<P>
	It is unnerving to know that our justice minister, Canada's top 
lawyer, has so little regard for the common law that on May 4 in 
the House he stated that the possession of personal arms is not a 
right but a privilege granted by the state.
<P>
	He should reread his Blackstone. This greatest of all British 
jurists pointed out in his commentaries that without the 
auxiliary right to have arms, the absolute rights to life, security 
of person, liberty and property are illusory.
<P>
	There is already more than enough regulation of firearms in 
Canada. Do we really want to continue sliding inch by inch into 
the Mexican model where firearms are restricted to criminals 
and agents of the state?

	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Fundy-Royal, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise

of hearing anti-Atlantic Canadian comments coming from 
members of the Reform Party. Not only are they attacking 
Atlantic Canada but they are using untruths and distortions in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7925"> 7925 </A></B>
<P>
their partisan attempts to pit region against region. This is 
unacceptable.
<P>
	One of the worst offenders is the member for Fraser Valley 
West who has been slandering the hard working scientists and 
researchers at the University of Moncton's food research centre.
<P>
	Out of respect for the truth, the ACOA contribution was not to 
make jam as the member suggested. It assisted in research and 
development for the small fruit industry. This R and D 
contributes to the development of new markets for products 
from soft drinks to jellies. This is no small industry to take a 
knock at. For example, the blueberry industry alone provides 
10,000 direct jobs for Atlantic Canadians and generates $35 
million in revenues.
<P>
	The Reform Party members should tread lightly when they 
attempt to slander the business efforts of hard working Atlantic 
Canadians. They will never be a national party-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would encourage members to use words such 
as slander and untruths judiciously. We are walking a very tight 
rope in using these words. I would ask all hon. members to truly

Speaker, last Saturday, November 12, was the third anniversary 
of the Dili massacre in East Timor.
<P>
	Since the Indonesian armed forces invaded East Timor in 
1975, one-third of the nation's population has been killed, 
resulting in the worst genocide on a per capita basis since the 
holocaust.
<P>
	Despite two UN Security Council resolutions condemning 
this invasion and requesting the withdrawal of Indonesian 
troops, no action has been taken by Indonesia to withdraw or the 
UN to enforce.
<P>
	Since our Prime Minister in opposition said that he would take 
action to support the UN resolutions, I urge the Prime Minister 
to follow through on his commitment to raise this issue at the 
United Nations and elsewhere and to stop all arms sales to 
Indonesia.

attention to the continued imprisonment of Ms. Suu Kyi, the 
leader who was democratically elected by the majority of the 
Burmese people. Ms. Suu Kyi has been under house arrest since 
1989.
<P>

<P>
	Burma's military regime did meet with Ms. Suu Kyi on 
September 20. However, during this meeting they did not give a 
commitment or a time frame as to when they plan to release her.
<P>
	I urge all my colleagues here today to remain vocal on the 
subject of Burma. I ask all my colleagues from both sides of the 
House to support a motion urging the United Nations General 
Assembly to condemn the current Burmese military regime and 
restore democracy to Burma.

Mr. Speaker, there are reports in the newspapers today that a 
CRTC analyst did believe that the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
was lending his support to the licence application submitted by 
one of his constituents, and he did so long before the minister 
argued publicly that he never intended to influence the decision 
of the CRTC. The analyst even advised the CRTC committee 
reviewing the licence application in question accordingly.
<P>
	So, this was much more than simple carelessness, as the Prime 
Minister claimed it was. These recent revelations show that the 
minister in fact interfered with the operations of the CRTC, a 
quasi-judicial organization operating at arm's length from the 
government. This new information confirms that the minister 
has lost all credibility by now.

consultations on the future of light stations.
<P>
	The mandate and terms of reference were granted long before

	An ad hoc parliamentary committee on light stations, jointly 
chaired by Senator Pat Carney and myself, was struck today. It

of Canadians who have paid the ultimate price for our country. 
Again this year one could hear at the Brantford cenotaph the 
music of the Telephone City Musical Society. In fact, the band 
has played every November 11 in Brantford except two since 
1919.
<P>
	This year the band celebrates 75 years of providing music for 
parades, concerts and ceremonies in Brant. During these years 
highlights from the band include playing for the royal visit to 
Brantford in 1939 and playing on the same stage as the Boston 
Pops Orchestra in 1978.
<P>
	Congratulations and many thanks must be extended to all 
members of the band, past and present, for their contribution to 
the quality of life in Brant. Special congratulations go out to Mr. 
Bert Locke and Mr. Fred Nicholas who are celebrating 57 and 48

today to express my concern over the disturbing increase in 
anti-Atlantic Canadian sentiment coming from members of the 
Reform Party.
<P>
	The Reform Party does not speak for westerners on this issue. 
First it was the Reform member from Capilano-Howe Sound 
who made insulting comments about westerners being tired of 
hearing Atlantic Canadians whine for more subsidies. Now in 
the same vein the member for Fraser Valley West has attacked 
entrepreneurial spirit in that region, stating that westerners are 
more money wise and work harder than their Atlantic 
counterparts. When will this stop?
<P>
	All Canadians have benefited at some time or another from 
government support, even British Columbians. As a British 
Columbian I am personally ashamed of this tactic. Rather than 
slander our fellow Canadians on the Atlantic coast for political 
gain, we in the Pacific should be more understanding.

witness the inspirational concerts given to packed houses by the 
Folk of the Sea.
<P>
<B>(1410 ) </B>
<P>
	Folk of the Sea consists of 110 fisherpersons from 
Newfoundland and Labrador who have come together to prepare 
their gift of song and story and to proudly present this heritage to 
the people of Canada. Everything that has been of consequence 
to Newfoundlanders invariably centres on the necessity that 
grafted us to the salt water trade. Our speech, our song, our 
common memories that shape and temper what has come to be 
recognized as characteristically Newfoundland was portrayed in 
a powerful and moving manner.
<P>
	When we in Newfoundland and Labrador face the greatest 
challenge of our 500-year history in the fishery, which has been 
our sustenance, our occupation and our craft, it has never been 
more important to share our bounty of music and narrative with 
other Canadians.
<P>
	I ask this House to join me in extending heartiest 
congratulations to this talented group of ordinary 
Newfoundlanders achieving extraordinary results as Folk of the

contemplating as part of his social reform plan.
<P>
	The Quebec government announced yesterday that the 
minister's cutback frenzy will force another 45,000 or so 
Quebec households onto welfare. This translates into tax 
increases of over $340 million for Quebec taxpayers.
<P>
	That is real impact of the minister's plan cynically dubbed 
``from unemployment insurance to employment insurance''. 
The minister will no doubt argue that you cannot make an 
omelette without breaking eggs, but he will have to come to the 
realization that his reform will create unbearable poverty in 
several regions. Again, this government is cutting where it hurts

is clear in its intention to move Canada toward a two-tier health

	The Reform Party wants to end the national system of health

opposition the government will do nothing to enforce the 
Canada Health Care Act.
<P>
	While the Reform and Liberal parties bicker, the province of

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, Major Barry Armstrong, senior medical officer of 
the unit in which several members were accused of murdering 
and torturing Somali civilians, said that he was ordered by 
superior officers to destroy photographs showing Somali 
patients who were tortured, so that these photographs would not 
be used as evidence against other Canadian servicemen.
<P>
	Yesterday in this House, the defence minister tried to 
minimize the serious allegations of Major Armstrong, who says 
that he kept some photographs, despite the order to destroy 
them.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Defence. How can the 
minister continue to trust the military investigation, when 
senior army officers ordered the destruction of photographs that 
could be used as evidence against servicemen accused of torture 
and murder?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
contrary to what the hon. Leader of the Opposition has stated, I 
did not and I do not try to minimize the awful events that 
occurred in 1993 in Somalia with members of the Canadian 
forces serving under the UN banner.
<P>
	However the hon. member must realize that a number of 
charges were laid as a result of investigations conducted 
concerning members of the armed forces. Those charges are 
being adjudicated at present. In fact an appeal which the crown 
has initiated-I believe the crown has initiated appeals on most 
of the verdicts so far-will commence next Tuesday. The last of 
the original charges will be heard next January or February.
<P>
	Whatever I say or do and whatever the hon. member says and 
does should not impinge on the rights of the accused for a fair 
trial.
<P>
	That having been said, the allegations that were raised 
yesterday by Major Armstrong were indeed quite troubling to 
me as the minister. As a result I have decided under the auspices 
of the National Defence Act to have an inquiry that will continue 
either after the original courts martial or after the court martial 
appeals are heard. I am seeking legal advice on that. This inquiry 
will be totally public. It will be totally civilian. The chair will be 
a civilian. The members of the original inquiry will be invited to 
participate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the minister told us that the case for which a 
conviction was obtained, involving only a private, has been 
appealed. I ask him if he thinks that the appeal can be effective, 
since it must be based on the evidence already accumulated, 
without existing photographs in the possession of Major 
Armstrong and other photographs that were destroyed?
<P>
	So I ask him whether, in these circumstances, he can go on 
trusting military justice for the case under consideration. Should 
he not ask himself the troubling question as to whether the 
destruction of some photographs has made it possible for other 
military people to escape justice?

<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National

it is a basic premise of jurisprudence that a person in my position 
cannot comment on the facts when a trial is ongoing.
<P>
	I would like to address the question of military justice. 
Military justice has a long, noble tradition in this country. It has 
been upheld as being constitutional by the Supreme Court of 
Canada. However, once the courts martial are completed then 
the crown and individuals if they are dissatisfied with the 
verdict have a right to appeal.
<P>
	The court martial appeals court is headed by a member of the 
Federal Court of Canada. Next Tuesday the acting head of the 
court martial appeals court or the justice of the Federal Court, 
perhaps himself or one of his colleagues, or with one of his 
colleagues, and perhaps with members of the supreme courts of 
the various provinces, perhaps even the province of Quebec, 
will hear the first appeal.
<P>
	I want to emphasize that what we have here is the military 
justice system which has been ongoing. However the appeals 
when they are deemed to be appropriate are being heard by 
civilian authorities.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, given the fact that additional photographic 
evidence exists in the matter of the torture of Somali civilians by 
Canadian soldiers, how can the minister claim that justice has 
been rendered?
<P>
	What steps will he take to make sure that the evidence relating 
to the pending case, now in appeal, will be enriched with 
existing conviction documents which are in the hands of Major 
Armstrong?

Defence.
<P>
	As I said yesterday, if Major Armstrong or any other person in 
the Canadian Armed Forces has any evidence that may be

	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.
<P>
	The mayor of Saint-Jean has made public the elements of his 
proposal to allow a gradual transition for the military college in 
Saint-Jean, which would become a university-level civilian 
institution. He thinks that there should be a gradual transfer of 
all officer cadets to Kingston and that the closure should not be 
brutal but civilized.
<P>
	Now that he has in his possession the proposal made by the 
mayor of Saint-Jean, which is supported by the Quebec 
government, does the minister still intend to reopen the 
discussions on the closure of the college in Saint-Jean, 
especially since the Kingston barracks cannot accommodate the 
officer cadets from Saint-Jean?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel MassÃ© (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, the proposal made by the mayor of Saint-Jean 
contains two elements we agree with. First, it is essential to 
demilitarize the college in Saint-Jean and turn it into a co-ed 
institution. Second, we need a transition period.
<P>
	We now have an agreement providing for a five-year 
transition period, a military presence of between 100 and 200 
students who will take language training during the five-year 
period and $5 million a year for a total of $25 million over the 
five-year transition period.
<P>
	We therefore believe that, although some of the arguments put 
forward by the mayor of Saint-Jean are valid, the agreement 
signed on July 19 by the governments of Quebec and Canada 
provides for a more appropriate transition period and better 
meets the needs  of the Saint-Jean community and of keeping 
the college open.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister said several times that the transition would occur 
without problems. How can the minister continue to claim that 
transferring the operations of the Royal Military College in 
Saint-Jean to Kingston will occur without problems, when only 
20 of the 250 employees of the college in Saint-Jean have 
agreed to move to Kingston?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel MassÃ© (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member seems to forget that there are 
already bilingual classes as well as francophone teachers and 
students in Kingston. In fact, 17 per cent of Kingston's student 
population is French-speaking, all courses will be offered in 
both official languages this year, and all teachers will be 
bilingual within a few years. As a result, there is no problem in 
transferring military activities to Kingston with respect to 
bilingualism and the accommodation capacity.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, over the last few weeks there have been allegations of 
infighting, bullying, corruption and influence peddling at the 
Immigration and Refugee Board. The most damning allegations 
now come from William Bauer, former ambassador and 
champion of human rights who resigned from the board in 
disgust in March of this year.
<P>
	According to this distinguished Canadian, the independence 
and effectiveness of the IRB are being undermined by constant 
pressure from the legal lobby and advocacy groups, in other 
words by those who stand to profit from the system.
<P>
	Does the minister accept the truth of Mr. Bauer's analysis? 
What is the minister's position on allowing advocacy and lobby 
groups, the legal lobby, to unduly influence and profit from the 
activities of the IRB?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I responded to the leader of 
the Reform Party yesterday by saying that if he or any other 
member of his party have any evidence about any influence 
peddling, whether it be at the IRB or anywhere else, it is a matter 
for the Criminal Code. Rather than simply lobbying, he should 
provide evidence.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7930"> 7930 </A></B>
<P>
	Second, the 211 members of the Immigration and Refugee 
Board are there to adjudicate refugee asylum cases. It is not for 
the minister or for members of Parliament or for NGO groups or 
for lawyers to unduly influence any member. They are there to 
do a job. They have an important mandate. It is an institution 
that works. It is a model that is respected internationally.
<P>
	Rather than tearing down the system, we should be seeking 
reforms and modifications on how to make the system better and 
how to build up this federal institution.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Mr. Bauer does not think it works. Obviously someone 
is profiting from the IRB process. Most immigration lawyers 
can earn two to three thousand dollars at least per refugee claim.
<P>
	In the past the minister has appointed over 50 immigration 
lawyers to the IRB. Coincidentally, the acceptance rate for 
refugees has jumped from 55 per cent last year to approximately 
80 per cent in recent months.
<P>
	Will the minister tell the House whether the currently high 
acceptance rate of 80 per cent is a reflection of his government's 
policy, or is it evidence that the IRB has been captured by those 
interests that stand to profit from excessively high acceptance 
rates?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand the narrow, 
vested interest of his questions and his party.
<P>
	What we have to do is stand up in the public interest. In so far 
as the public interest is concerned, he owes the House and the 
public interest the evidence of those charges of profiteering and 
influence peddling. It is simply not good enough that he lob over 
these very serious accusations without backing them up.
<P>
	Second, there is no policy of the Government of Canada or a 
minister of the crown or members on the government side with 
respect to what is an acceptable or non-acceptable threshold. 
That is not the business of government or a member of 
Parliament or the minister.
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
	The individuals adjudicating who is and who is not a refugee 
are the members of the refugee board. That is why they are 
quasi-judicial and at arm's length. It is to protect it from such 
scurrilous allegations as we see today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister's excuses, denials and half baked 
measures do nothing to restore confidence in the IRB. It has 
gone too far for that. The allegations are too serious and too 
many. They range from influence peddling at the board to fraud 
charges being laid, even to RCMP investigations.
<P>
	The minister has it within his power to order a judicial inquiry 
into the IRB members. Given the allegations that have come to 
life over the last few weeks, will the minister stop making 
excuses for inexcusable behaviour and order a judicial inquiry 
into the IRB?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member continues to 
make inexcusable, unfounded, serious allegations.
<P>
	What do we have before us? We have before us a board 
chairman's report and a response from the deputy chair which 
will be considered. I mentioned to the leader of that party during 
this week that the decision will be made before the week's end. I 
know it does not bring him any satisfaction, but in this country 
we do things according to facts and due process, not jungle 
justice a la Reform Party.

was shocked to read in the papers this morning that immigration 
authorities are about to deport a woman from the Seychelles 
Islands and her two children.
<P>
	Immigration Canada refuses to take into consideration the 
letter of threat written by the woman's husband, who was sent 
back to his country, in which he says that he will kill her when 
she returns to the Seychelles.
<P>
	Considering that the minister has released gender guidelines 
to protect refugee women who are victims of spousal abuse, 
does he not think that the death threat made to Mrs. Sabadin 
warrants his immediate intervention to prevent that woman and 
her two children from being deported to the Seychelles

evidence of wrongdoing in Somalia said, and I am quoting from 
<I>Hansard</I>: ``They have taken a very courageous stand because 
they saw something they thought was wrong. They deserve an 
open inquiry''. I understand the Minister of National Defence is 
moving toward that position.
<P>
	Will the minister not agree that the actions of Major 
Armstrong and others who may possess information and may be 
reluctant to give it to the present system are fully justified when 
they know that system has not acted upon information and when 
that system asks for the destruction of the very evidence they 
possess?
<P>
<B>(1435 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I do not share the assumptions upon which the question was 
based.
<P>
	I did announce a few minutes ago that there will be an inquiry 
under the auspices of the National Defence Act. It will be public 
and will be headed by a civilian. It will be available for people 
such as Major Armstrong and all others to come forward with 
any information and any charges. Hopefully, they will be totally 
satisfied.
<P>
	I want to make it plain that this government has nothing to 
hide. These are events that occurred before the 1993 election. 
The Minister of Human Resources Development when he was in 
opposition was fully justified in making those comments and 
calling for an open inquiry. We have done that.
<P>
	What I am concerned with is to act in a way that would not 
prejudice the course of justice. I hope the hon. member will 
understand that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the minister indicated there are two ongoing police 
investigations in addition to one suspended investigation. Yet 
two months ago the department's public information officers 
indicated there were no ongoing investigations into the Somali 
affair.
<P>
	Why are these investigations occurring 18 months after the 
fact? Why is this kind of information not made public until it is 
raised in the House or appears in the media? Why will the 
minister not provide right away an open inquiry for information 
on this to be presented to the public?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the statement to which the hon. member referred made by public 
affairs officials at national defence some time ago were at that 
time true. Investigations have been closed, but because there 
had been allegations of cover-up the military police reopened 
one investigation. Subsequently there were charges made about 
photographs being concealed and another investigation was 
opened up to deal with that matter.
<P>
	I should raise another point. I have tried to act as 
expeditiously as possible given the fact that we do want to 
protect the course of justice. I would have made this 
announcement yesterday, but out of courtesy to the Prime 
Minister who was only informed of this matter this morning, I 
felt I should not act until I had his agreement.

for the Minister of Human Resources Development. The 
minister's answers to questions from the Official Opposition 
and to claims from students, who held a demonstration 
yesterday on Parliament Hill, only confirmed our greatest fear, 
namely that he will increase the burden of students through 
additional loans of $10 billion, over a ten-year period. That 
money will be available because of cuts in transfer payments to 
provinces for post-secondary education.
<P>
	Will the minister admit that the statement he made yesterday 
confirms his intention to transfer $10 billion from the federal 
debt to the students?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> No, Mr. Speaker, because that is not 
what I said.
<P>
	First I have pointed out to opposition members on several 
occasions that the government does not intend on going back to 
its February budget statement to cut the transfers to the 
provinces. The transfer of over $6 billion is to be maintained 
based upon our fixed 1993-94 level. I will repeat that there are 
no cuts to the transfers to the provinces. The provinces will 
receive exactly the same amount of money, over $6 billion of 
transfers.
<P>
	What we did suggest is that the cash portion of that which is 
receding at the same time the revenue of the provinces is going 
up to the tax revenue could be used to help lever an additional $2 
billion. If you took $500 million of that savings you could 
almost get a four or five to one addition. We would also have a 
grants program to help students in need.
<P>
	Rather than a $10 billion debt load it would mean we would be 
able to add $10 billion to the existing system's contribution to 
higher education for better laboratories, more classrooms, more

	<B>Mr. Antoine DubÃ© (LÃ©vis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the more 
explaining the minister does, the more complicated it gets! The 
bottom line is that the minister is only offering students the 
possibility of incurring an additional $10 billion debt. Period.
<P>
	Will the minister admit that this option, which consists in 
getting more into debt, is the only solution he could find to make 
students absorb the increase in tuition fees which will result 
from his reform?

the hon. member has dealing with conflict problems. He only 
has simple solutions to those problems.
<P>
	I would suggest to him that the best way to deal with the 
problems is to sit down and have a discussion. Do not go to the 
barricades, do not have angry protest, but sit down and share 
information and deal with the various options and choices. Look 
at the ways as a country we can bring governments together at 
the federal and provincial levels, we can bring members of the 
university community together. We can work together to find an 
answer, not to try to create confrontation, not to try to create 
disputation, but in fact to create agreement. That is the kind of 
process we want to provide.

majority report on foreign policy, Liberal members and senators 
refer to Canada's principal trading partner as a problem. After 
being opposed to the free trade agreement with the United States 
and ultimately rallying behind NAFTA, they now wonder 
whether it would not be advisable to simply abolish all trade 
commissioner posts in the United States and Mexico.
<P>
	Does the government intend to reject the Liberal majority's 
recommendation to abolish the posts of trade commissioners, 
since it knows perfectly well that this might deprive Quebec and 
Canadian businesses of major benefits arising from the free 
trade agreement with the United States and Mexico?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the committee's

<P>
	<B>Mr. StÃ©phane Bergeron (VerchÃ¨res, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
their report, the Liberal members and senators, as I said before, 
see trade relations with the United States as a problem. Would it 
be possible to find out from someone in this government 
whether they endorse this view and whether they agree that 
abolishing trade commissioner posts is hardly the way to help 
small businesses break into the U.S. market?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

trade between Canada and the United States is worth about $280 
billion in both directions. We are bound to have problems from 
time to time in some areas. That is not unusual. But it is 
incorrect to say that relations between Canada and the United 
States are poor, which is what the Bloc Quebecois is saying.

	As part of the program review exercise, DFO is looking at cost 
recovery measures. I can say to the member that no decisions 
have been taken at this stage of the game. There will be no 
change in the licence fee structure for 1995, but we are asking 
ourselves whether it is appropriate that somebody who makes on

fisheries should pay the same fee for a licence as somebody who

<P>
	The cases in the Supreme Court of Canada in recent years, 
including Daviault as recently as a month ago and Bernard in

intoxication, depending on the degree, goes to the ability of the 
accused person to form the intent which is an integral part of the 
offence as the law is written at present.
<P>

	<B>Mr. RÃ©al MÃ©nard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Liberal government has undertaken to ban 
discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. The Minister of 
Justice himself promised to change the Canadian Human Rights 
Act accordingly, no later than this fall. But we are now told that 
60 Liberal members are against any legislative change to ensure 
that sexual orientation is considered as a prohibited ground of 
discrimination.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Justice. In light of the 
opposition generated within government ranks, does the 
minister still plan to table by Christmas a bill to amend the 
Canadian Human Rights Act so that sexual orientation is 
recognized as a prohibited ground of discrimination?

Mr. Speaker, I want to respond on a point of order expressing

State for Parliamentary Affairs.
<P>
	We are rather concerned that there have been a very limited 
number of bills that have been eligible to go on the Order Paper. 
We substituted that opportunity to debate legislation with take 
note debates. I certainly do not want to express the view that we 
are against take note debates. But it seems like they are being 
placed in substitution for actual bills to debate.
<P>
	There are only three bills to my understanding that could be 
placed on the Order Paper this week. The minister did not 
announce the introduction of any new bills.
<P>
	Our concern is what is happening with the starvation of 
legislation in the House is causing bills to be rammed through 
committee stage much more quickly than members of those 
committees have an opportunity to deal with those bills in a 
substantial way.
<P>
	In light of the indication we got earlier that committees would 
have time to do their job and would receive new importance in 
this House in dealing with legislation, I would urge the 
government to provide more legislation for us to deal with in 
this House so that bills may not be rammed through at 
committee stage, but have proper time for discussion, 
amendments and witnesses to appear.

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hon. member for

comments. The hon. member for LÃ©vis.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine DubÃ© (LÃ©vis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
attentively to the speech given by the hon. member for 
LotbiniÃ¨re before Question Period. He addressed two issues, or 
two client groups, of particular interest to me in the context of 
this social security reform. He talked about young people and 
the tuition fee problem. I would like him to clarify his position 
on this.
<P>
	I would also ask him, if we have enough time, to elaborate on 
unemployment insurance proposals concerning women.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (LotbiniÃ¨re, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to answer my colleague and also to inform all members 
of this House. A secret document published in the <I>Toronto Star</I> 
shows that with this reform, students will pay twice as much 
tuition.
<P>
	When the minister asks these students to put their shoulder to 
the wheel, I think that is rather hard to do, since some students 
will leave university with a $50,000 debt.
<P>
	I would also like to answer the question about women. With 
this new reform, women in Quebec and Canada, even if they 
have paid into UI all their lives, will not be entitled to benefits if 
their income is over a certain amount. I think it is unfortunate to 
pick on women in that way.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	I must also say that the reform of social programs will cost 
$170 million just in Quebec and force 40,000 households onto 
welfare. We must look deeper into the reform of social 
programs.
<P>
	Take a family in which the father loses his job for some reason 
or other or has an insecure job and winds up on welfare. Imagine 
what it costs the government. First, it often causes problems like 
depression, medical problems; he has to see psychologists and 
psychiatrists. We must analyze the whole situation. We must not 
have a reform just for the sake of having a reform. We must also 
analyze the whole situation.
<P>
	I often say that we must do prevention. We know that there is 
$6.4 billion in unpaid taxes to collect, $6.4 billion for the 
government's finances. It is out there, but it must be collected. 
That is all. When we opposition members tell you about the $6.4 
billion, we are not here just to make trouble. Not at all! We are 
here to find solutions with the government, not just to criticize.
<P>
	As politicians, we must deal with this situation. Unions have 
noticed that today employers hire more and more people on 
three- or four-month contracts. That is what happens more and 
more. Some employment agencies do just that. They hire people 
and tell them: You are hired for four or five months. 
Consequently, you can expect these people to come back every 
year. This is a problem.
<P>
	In my region, unemployment runs very high and there are 
many seasonal workers. The social program reform will be 
applied uniformly everywhere, whether a province is 
prosperous or not, and that creates an injustice. So, let us take a 
closer look at these issues, which affect the workers and the 
unemployed. Whether or not you are unionized, the problem 
will surface some day. I tell unions that, at some point, the 
problem will come up.
<P>
	Problems will surface and some say we will perhaps need a 
better immigration policy. If a reform is necessary, we should go 
that far. I am not saying we should not let anybody in. What I am 
saying is we have to create jobs. Thanks to modern technology, a 
machine can do the work of 100 workers. But what happens to 
these people? They find themselves out of work. This is what 
happens. I have nothing against progress, but it is a matter of 
balancing the positive against the negative. And this is what my 
comments are all about.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to rise this afternoon to speak to the motion of the 
Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	In his social security reform package, the minister proposes to 
deal with social problems and unemployment, at the expense of 
the unemployed and the poorest people in this country. The 
government is asking the unemployed to pay more for a solution 
to their problems and asks the poor to be even poorer, if they 
would enjoy the benefits of this reform which, as I said before, 
will take more money from the unemployed and the poor.
<P>
	Instead of looking at the underlying cause of unemployment, 
instead of looking at the causes of social problems, the minister 
and his experts are telling the unemployed they will have to pay 
the bill. As if the unemployed and the poor were responsible for 
unemployment rates and the large percentage of people living on 
welfare, especially in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	That is why this afternoon, I would prefer to discuss what 
causes unemployment and the reasons for welfare. The federal 
Liberals have not been very helpful in this respect. After 
working for about ten years here in the House of Commons and 
seeing how the government runs its affairs, I could give you a 
few examples to prove that the federal government causes 
unemployment, not the unemployed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7938"> 7938 </A></B>
<P>
	My first example concerns interest rates. In 1990, the 
Governor of the Bank of Canada decided to raise interest rates, 
saying that there were inflationary tendencies in Canada and 
that we absolutely had to raise interest rates to reduce economic 
growth, although he knew perfectly well that these inflationary 
tendencies were restricted to a few specific locations in Canada 
and that their causes were well-known.
<P>
	Inflation tended to be concentrated in the Toronto area. Why? 
Because the federal government had invested too much money 
in federal-provincial shared-cost programs. In 1981, 1982 and 
1983, the Liberal government had set up special programs to 
fight the recession. At the time, inflation was really high and 
you may remember that the government had raised interest rates 
up to 21 per cent. It also had to set up programs, precisely to 
ensure that people on unemployment or welfare rolls would not 
suffer unduly from the situation.
<P>
	However, the Conservative Party, which was in office then 
and of which I was a member, did not have the courage to reduce 
the budgets of those programs and continued to spend more or 
less the same amounts in joint cost-shared federal-provincial 
programs. There was a 50-50 split.
<P>
	The result of this was that Quebec, which had less money than 
some other provinces and which was spending less on its joint 
programs, received less money. This is why the inflation rate in 
Quebec was somewhat more reasonable or acceptable. The 
situation was just the opposite in Toronto, which was going full 
speed ahead with the federal programs. Indeed, through these 
50-50 programs, the federal government was spending a lot of 
money, with the result that the economy of that region 
overheated, thus generating more inflation.
<P>
	It was obvious that the inflation was the direct result of this 
overheating generated by the federal government. The 
government of the time never wanted to use the means at its 
disposal to lower inflation. Instead, it left the Governor of the 
Bank of Canada on his own. And the governor had no choice but 
to increase interest rates. Vancouver is the other place where 
inflation was high. A lot of money was being invested by people 
from Hong Kong and Far East Pacific Rim countries. The 
inflation there was also very much a local phenomenon.
<P>
	And what did the federal government do? Nothing. It let 
interest rates go up, with the result that Quebec's small and 
medium-sized businesses, which had worked tremendously 
hard to survive, went bankrupt one after the other. 
Unemployment went up, since workers were being laid off. All 
this because the federal government did not take its 
responsibility. I personally told the Governor of the Bank of 
Canada then that he was creating a recession we would have 
great difficulty pulling out of.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	We have been in a recession for four years, yet did not manage 
to bring it under control. That is terrible. So, when I hear that the 
unemployed should be the ones to pay for the problems, I find it 
absolutely ridiculous. That is all the Minister of Human 
Resources Development talks about in his plan.
<P>
	The other event that took place was the signing, in 1989, of the 
Free Trade Agreement with the United States. Quebec investors 
in particular, and I am still one of them, were told: ``Invest in 
your business because this is a golden opportunity to gain access 
to a unique market, the US market''. We were told: ``Invest in 
your businesses and life will be great. In the years to come, you 
will make good money, do good business and create jobs. It is 
going to be just great''.
<P>
	A short time afterwards, interest rates went up, curbing 
growth and killing the very businesses that had just been put in a 
vulnerable position by investing in infrastructure and 
equipment. They were crushed with higher interests rates, 
reduced growth and reduced production capacity, at a time when 
they are very vulnerable. Many had to shut down. That is 
outrageous! And that is what is going on right now.
<P>
	That is why, Mr. Speaker, I suggest that, if we want to address 
the UI and social welfare issue, instead of making a big fuss, 
publishing nice green books and talking about UI and social 
reform, we should start by creating favourable conditions for 
our businesses. Jobs do not appear suddenly, out of thin air; they 
are created by businesses and our businesses need favourable 
conditions to do so. They must not be required to do what they 
are currently doing on behalf of governments, namely handling 
enormous amounts of money collected left and right. Let me 
name a few of the tasks imposed upon our businesses.
<P>
	First, they have to pay CSST premiums, UI premiums, federal 
and provincial sales taxes as well as federal and provincial 
income tax. They must deal with two sets of taxes: Quebec's and 
Ottawa's. I could give other examples.
<P>
	Each time that a business is unable, or fails, to satisfy all these 
requests, which come in daily, there are additional penalties to 
pay.
<P>
	Our small and medium-sized businesses in Quebec have to 
live in this negative environment. We think that it is terrible, 
unacceptable and discouraging for those who want to go into 
business, to succeed, to create, to invent and to export to have to 
look after all this administration for the two levels of 
government.
<P>
	When I say that support to businesses must be more flexible, I 
am not talking about money, but rather, at the very least, an 
environment that would facilitate their growth.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7939"> 7939 </A></B>
<P>
	The government's insistence on centralizing, on trying to 
control everything from here, on creating terrible 
confrontations between the two levels of government, leaves our 
businesses vulnerable in this sort of environment.
<P>
	This is just another example. I think that the Minister of 
Human Resources Development hit on it himself when he said 
that there are many difficulties and problems associated with 
unemployment insurance and other social programs. There are 
many problems to resolve. But having read the document, I can 
tell you that there are not many solutions, because he did not 
really understand the cause of the problem.
<P>
	We have here proof, once again, that federalism does not 
work. When a government can no longer meet the basic needs of 
its citizens, it is clear that federalism is not working. The debt is 
now $550 billion.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	Our deficit will again be close to $40 billion. What more proof 
do we need that federalism does not work?
<P>
	So what is the answer? As the Premier of Quebec told the 
Chamber of Commerce last Tuesday, although the federal 
government siphons off our money and, as a result, our 
resources are diminished, Quebecers manage to do a better job 
than the federal government as far as economic development 
and job creation are concerned. My view is that as far as we are 
concerned, this reform is redundant. The federal government 
should simply transfer full responsibility to Quebec, since it has 
given us ample proof it cannot make a go of it. I can assure you 
that Quebecers with their dynamic outlook will do a much better 
job. I am positive about that.
<P>
	That is why I look forward to the challenge of a sovereign 
Quebec, where Quebecers will be able to develop their potential 
and get a really good start by investing all their resources and 
skills and productivity. They will be able to create jobs, reduce 
unemployment and reduce the number of welfare recipients so 
that this nation can live with honour and enthusiasm.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the chance to comment on the member's remarks and 
on the whole social program review debate.
<P>
	I wonder how seriously the government takes this whole 
program. When we look back at the chronology of events 
leading up to today and some of the recent statements by the 
human resources development minister, it makes us wonder how 
devoted the government really is to tackling the problem of 
social programs, the debt in general and how to make 
government run much more efficiently.
<P>
	When I think back to the election campaign I remember 
distinctly how our party talked quite a bit about social programs 
and how they needed to be reformed. I remember Kim 
Campbell, the then Prime Minister, talking about social program 
reforms in  so far as she said they were too important to be 
discussed during an election.
<P>
	I also remember the deafening silence of the Liberal Party on 
this whole issue. If one looks at the government's red book it is 
almost without mention of social program reform. That was one 
year ago. I guess the Liberals must have been holding this close 
to their vests because shortly after they became government 
they started to make noises about the need to change social 
programs.
<P>
	What happened is they came face to face with the reality, at 
that time, of about a $500 billion debt. Today it is just about 
$540 billion. They realized that they were going to have to do 
something to deal with the deficit and debt so they looked at 
social program reform.
<P>
	During the throne speech and in the days shortly thereafter 
they said they would launch a task force and have an action plan 
on the reform of Canada's social programs. A motion was made 
to that effect at the end of January of this year if memory serves 
me.
<P>
	Over the course of days after that, we found that it was going 
to be the same old thing, the same old way of doing politics. 
First we found out that this group was going to be hearing not 
from regular Canadians but instead from special interest groups 
who, in most cases, were funded by the government. In fact I sat 
on that committee as an associate member.
<P>
	I remember as a newly minted MP how disappointed I was to 
find out we were not going to hear from some of the Canadians 
who have a vested interest, as taxpayers, in seeing social 
programs work well. We were pretty disappointed that this was 
not happening.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	I must also comment that over the course of events we saw 
that the task force the minister was going to refer to was in many 
cases a bunch of hand picked patronage appointments, people 
who had strong ties to the Liberal government. Over the course 
of the summer we found that it lost its impetus and now the 
action plan has become a discussion paper. Over the course of 
events we have found that the government has failed to really 
pursue this with the necessary vigour considering this country's 
huge debt. Now taxpayers are running, afraid that the fat greedy 
fingers of government are going to get them.
<P>
	So far this government has been unable to bring forward a real 
action plan. I encourage the government to move with dispatch. 
Get a handle on this serious problem by dealing with the social 
program review forthwith. Bring forward a real action plan that 
will bring the deficit and debt to heel.
<P>

<P>

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Given the general nature 
of the overall comments of the hon. member, I still want to give 
the member for Longueuil the opportunity to rebut.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Mr. Speaker, there was so little in 
the way of questions in the hon. member's comments that I 
thought he had started on a speech.
<P>
	Initially, he asked whether the government was serious about 
its reform proposals. I doubt it, because if you consider that 
there is nothing in this document about demands Quebec has 
been repeating for 30 years, I think we can hardly say that this is 
a serious document, when they keep wanting to centralize and 
create confrontational situations.
<P>
	Another point I wanted to mention earlier, which may answer 
part of his question, is that just this week, Softimage, a software 
company that invested several million dollars in Quebec, was 
looking for 70 computer experts but failed to find any. This 
means that manpower training is not adapted to the needs of 
companies. Once again, this manpower training mess is 
aggravating the unemployment problem but the minister does 
not seem to mention that in his report. There is a serious problem 
with manpower training and as a result, a number of companies 
cannot find the qualified employees they need, although we 
have a high unemployment rate.
<P>
	We also have scientists who are doing very advanced 
research, but we do not have the companies that can 
manufacture these new products. This means there is a lack of 
consistency, so that a lot of time and money is wasted and we are 
not as efficient as we could be. We have trouble producing a 
low-cost, quality product, and at the same time we are trying to 
break into international markets. These incredible 
inconsistencies cost a lot of money and make us inefficient.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I am afraid my time is up. I could have gone on 
for much longer because there is so much to say about this. 
Thank you for giving me this opportunity.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I thank the hon. member 
for Longueuil for his co-operation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria-Haliburton, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I almost hate to break up this Bloc-Reform love-in on 
a government motion which puts forth provisions for a 
discussion paper and discussion on something that is very 
important to the country.
<P>
	The changing nature of employment over the past several 
years has had considerable impact on the unemployment 
insurance program. Since UI is the key component in social 
security, it is essential that we revitalize the program to meet the 
needs of all Canadians in all provinces in the 1990s and beyond.
<P>
	Originally UI was intended to provide temporary financial 
assistance for workers between jobs. Today people use UI for 
long term support and many use the programs repeatedly. Last 
year 13 per cent of unemployed Canadians had been out of work 
for a year or more. Compared to 1976 that is three times the level 
of long term unemployment.
<P>
	Almost 40 per cent of UI recipients have claimed benefits at 
least three times during the previous five years. The number of 
frequent claimants has almost doubled in 13 years.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	The problem with UI is not the claimants. The problem is the 
program. It works well for people who require short term help 
while looking for a job, but it does help workers who need to 
adjust to the changing economic structure.
<P>
	Many individuals alternate short periods of work with periods 
of receiving UI benefits. It becomes a way of life. These UI 
recipients need more than basic support. Their problem is more 
complex. They may need skills training, even basic academic 
upgrading or some counselling to get started in a new, more 
stable occupation.
<P>
	A recent study by StatsCanada suggests that some employers 
take unfair advantage of the program. They do so by organizing 
schedules around the required number of weeks people need to 
qualify for UI benefits. Employers plan layoffs to coincide with 
UI qualification periods and plan recalls when worker benefits 
come to an end.
<P>
	The business community complains that increases in UI 
premiums discourage job creation. Since premiums often 
increase during the latter part of a recession, we are taxing jobs 
at the worst possible time. Also, due to the changes in the labour 
market many more workers are not covered by UI. This is 
especially true for women and young Canadians.
<P>
	What we need is an effective, sustainable insurance program 
that recognizes an individual's responsibility to become 
self-reliant. At the same time the program must ensure an 
income support system for those who truly need it.
<P>
	To that end, we are recommending for discussion two 
possibilities for revitalizing UI. One approach calls for a new 
employment insurance program that closely integrates 
assistance with employment development services, or we could 
adjust the existing UI program to discourage abuse and better 
serve those who genuinely need it. Some elements overlap in 
both approaches. A new employment insurance program could 
divide benefits into two kinds: basic insurance and adjustment 
insurance.
<P>
	Under basic insurance occasional users of UI could receive 
help returning to work much as they do now. These claimants 
could receive UI benefits and training employment programs 
more or less as they do now. Basic  insurance would include the 
special benefits available in the current system. This insurance 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7941"> 7941 </A></B>
<P>
would be for those who are caught between two jobs or who may 
need some assistance on a temporary basis.
<P>
	Adjustment insurance could be available to frequent 
claimants. Who is a frequent claimant would have to be 
determined. For discussion we are using the example of a person 
who files three or more claims in five years. As well, adjustment 
insurance would consider regional differences in the workforce.
<P>
	Other questions under adjustment insurance include: How 
long should a claimant draw these benefits? Should adjustment 
benefits be income tested? Should adjustment benefits depend 
upon a claimant's willingness to participate in adjustment 
programs? In considering the answers to these questions it will 
be important to recognize the significance of the UI system to 
many parts of the economy and in many parts of the country.
<P>
	A fair approach which allows people to respond and adjust 
will be important. That is one approach, a new employment 
insurance program. A second approach, adjusting the current UI 
program, would not distinguish between occasional and 
frequent claimants.
<P>
	We can increase the time a person had to work to qualify for 
UI, or we could reduce benefits by shortening duration and/or 
lowering the level of benefits. This approach would free up 
significant resources for reinvestment in employment 
programs, but it would not identify claimants who require the 
most help in staying employed. Those most in need of income 
support will not receive adequate assistance. Nonetheless this 
approach might be taken in conjunction with the first to create 
an equitable and balanced reform strategy.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	As well, UI reform must address the needs of the workers in 
non-standard employment: part timers, self-employed, 
temporary workers, and people with multiple jobs. Last year 
more than 60 per cent of all new jobs were part time. Many of 
these workers are not fully covered or not covered at all.
<P>
	We also have to determine the best way to fund the renewed 
insurance program. Employers and workers are concerned about 
how UI premium rates are set. Higher premiums are killing jobs. 
We need to think about how the burden of premiums is shared.
<P>
	Options for improving funding include: building a surplus in 
the insurance account during strong economic growth; requiring 
employers to pay premiums on their total payroll; expanding 
earnings subject to premiums; increasing premium rates for 
those who use the program the most; and reducing premiums for 
employers who support training.
<P>
	Funds saved from a revitalized UI program could be used to 
reduce premiums or to make employment development services 
more effective. The two must work hand in hand.
<P>
	Employment development services help the chronically 
unemployed by offering them job counselling, training, labour 
market information and work experience. When people move 
from welfare to work, employment development services are a 
good investment. Unfortunately they do not do that often 
enough.
<P>
	Employment development services need to be flexible, to be 
tailored to individual needs and community opportunities. We 
must give more UI claimants personalized job counselling that 
directs them toward the specific help they require. Up to date 
relevant information about job opportunities would help people 
make better informed decisions about jobs, training and 
education.
<P>
	Millions of adults require additional training in reading, 
writing and arithmetic, the basic skills essential for almost all 
employment. The federal government sends UI recipients to 
classroom courses but again training must fit individual needs. 
Workplace training provided by employers is often the most 
effective approach. To encourage this we could offer employers 
tax credits, levies for training and paid educational leave.
<P>
	Another consideration is to supplement wages for 
unemployed workers facing specific barriers to employment 
such as persons with disabilities or long term unemployed 
workers who may need an extra bit of support to break into the 
labour market.
<P>
	Much of the success of employment development services 
depends upon good management. Success should be measured 
by results, not by bureaucratic enforcement of the program's 
rules. We should consider setting broad goals and then inviting 
local communities to decide which programs will best achieve 
those goals.
<P>
	Once again effective EDS will require effective partnerships. 
We have invited the provinces and territories to plan many 
employment development services and to manage the purchase 
of institutional training. The province could manage single 
window offices to bring federal-provincial programs under one 
roof. This would make access easier for both UI recipients and 
those on social assistance who should also have access to EDS.
<P>
	We must do more to help people with disabilities overcome 
barriers and become fully integrated into Canadian society. 
Constructive partnerships could lead to more accessible 
workplaces, flexible working conditions, appropriate training 
and better management practices for persons with disabilities.
<P>
	I know hon. members appreciate the complexity and 
magnitude of reforming UI and adjusting employment 
development 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7942"> 7942 </A></B>
<P>
services. I trust the ideas I have presented will help them prepare 
input for the government's  discussion paper. I look forward to 
hearing the responses of my hon. colleagues.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine DubÃ© (LÃ©vis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as you know, I 
am on the Standing Committee on Human Resources 
Development now holding consultations on social programs. 
The speech by the hon. member for Victoria-Haliburton made 
me shudder because it seems to overlook reality. It is based on 
the widely-held belief-too widely held in my opinion-that 
many unemployed workers lose their jobs on purpose. His talk 
of abuse almost implies that the unemployed are guilty of fraud. 
There may be abusers but I will start by asking him-I will have 
more questions later-if he can tell me what percentage of the 
unemployed are guilty of fraud?
<P>
	His arguments sound funny when we look, for instance, at the 
miserly unemployment insurance fund. The human resources 
committee I am on heard a forecast from the minister but when 
we recently asked a senior official, he anticipated a surplus in 
the order of $2 billion in the UI fund for the year.
<P>
	Now, why is there a surplus? Because UI was cut this year. 
The three series of cuts that he mentioned were implemented, 
and the hon. member seems to say that we should go even 
further. Let me refresh members' memories.
<P>
	First, the amount of benefits was cut from 57 per cent to 55 per 
cent of salary; then, the benefit period was reduced to a 
maximum of 32 weeks.
<P>
	I know that in the riding of LÃ©vis, for example, the workers 
laid off by the shipyard are not unemployed voluntarily. After 
collecting benefits for 32 weeks, they will have no choice but to 
turn to their provincial government, even though the federal 
government picks up 50 per cent of social assistance costs, but it 
is still shifting responsibilities to the provincial government. 
The federal government is talking about making it even more 
difficult to collect unemployment insurance.
<P>
	Yesterday, I met with students who, after completing their 
studies, may not be able to collect UI benefits because it would 
be even more difficult for someone who has not yet managed to 
join the labour force, as is now the case when after finally 
landing an insecure job a person is allowed to enrol in retraining 
programs.
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member or another government member 
a little later to give us the exact percentage of voluntary 
unemployed who abuse the system.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Reilly:</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to 
respond to the hon. member. He and I share something in 
common. We are both concerned about the unemployment and 
retraining situation in Canada. That is the reason the hon. 
minister brought forward this paper for discussion. We welcome 
discussion and the  exchange of ideas hopefully for the benefit 
of all people in Canada.
<P>
	I am aware of ongoing retraining programs. I attended a 
retraining program in my riding of Victoria-Haliburton the 
other night. The Victoria County Training Council graduated 
295 people and 75 per cent of 1,717 people it has retrained over 
the last four years are actively involved in the workplace. That is 
a record to be very proud of. That type of retraining program has 
set the example for others to follow.
<P>
	The member says that maybe I do not understand 
unemployment insurance. My father was unemployed in the 
fifties so I am well aware of what it is like to have 
unemployment in one's family, to suffer because of it and not to 
have proper funding until another job is found.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	Earlier today the member for Elk Island talked about some 
dream world wherein no one here knew about the programs. All 
the programs were brought in and he never had to partake of 
them. He had a great time getting along in some fairyland like 
<I>Alice in Wonderland</I>. I went through the fifties with an 
unemployed father. I know what it is like to have to go through 
programs when there is no work or nothing for the person who 
has trained all his or her life and is all of a sudden out on the 
street with nothing to do and a family to raise. I understand that 
part of being unemployed. That is why I am anxious to be 
involved in this program, add to the discussion and bring to the 
forefront the fact that people have to retrain.
<P>
	I spoke to the graduates the other night and said: ``You have 
come through a training program; don't stop training''. We 
talked to the pages this afternoon about always spending time 
training and retraining. The days of walking into a place and 
being there until one retires with a pension are over. We must 
retrain. We must have a workforce that is effective in the 
nineties and beyond. Retraining, unemployment and financial 
assistance to people temporarily out of work are very important 
to me. I want to see the ideas of all members brought forward to 
make it a better program, an improved program for the people 
who most need it.
<P>
	There are too many single parents suffering in poverty in 
Canada. They did not ask for that. They did not ask to be poor. 
They do not want to be poor. They do not want handouts. They 
want to be part of a productive society. That is what the 
government is committed to doing. It wants to make this a more 
productive society, a society that trains and retrains and looks 
after the job market that becomes available, a highly technical 
market in some cases.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7943"> 7943 </A></B>
<P>
	However 2,400 jobs went out of my riding over the free trade 
agreement. Some of those people qualified within 15 or 20 
weeks of not qualifying for certain programs of assistance. 
Some compassion has to be given to a person who does not 
qualify for POWA because there are not enough people working 
in the factory and people are laid off. That has to be looked at 
and refined so that it gives a benefit to everyone who needs it.
<P>
	The member asked whether people cheated the system. I think 
it is a very small percentage. I know some parties work on that 
very small percentage for political gain, but I think most people 
are honest. Most people are on these programs because they 
need it, not because they want it. It is a program with 
refinements that can work to the benefit of Canadian taxpayers 
and retrain our workforce for the 1990s and into the year 2000.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
specific question for the hon. member who just spoke. I would 
appreciate if I could get a direct answer to a specific question.
<P>
	Does the hon. member believe that there should be unified 
qualifying rules across the country such as, for example, with 
regard to the period of work before qualifying for 
unemployment insurance? Or, would the hon. member prefer 
special treatment for certain parts of the country?
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Reilly:</B> Mr. Speaker, a specific answer would be that 
all economic regions of the country are not the same. Whether 
one is in GaspÃ©, Vegreville or Haliburton, there is a difference in 
the areas, a difference in the needs and a difference in the 
qualifications required. Some have to work in seasonal jobs in a 
seasonal market in a certain area. I can go into Haliburton in my 
area and find 30 per cent unemployment in the winter because it 
is a seasonal, tourist oriented job market. It is improving. Winter 
sports are coming on. There are some good ski hills. There are 
cross-country trails. Things happen there in the winter that are 
drawing more people in.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	I do not think we can compare that with the city of Toronto, 
Vegreville, Elk Island, or any other area. The area has to be 
taken into consideration on its needs. The program has to suit 
the area, not the area suit the program. I hope that answers the 
hon. member's question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thought I was 
going to be able to further interrogate the member for 
Victoria-Haliburton, but I guess it is my turn now.
<P>
	I would like to begin by declaring something we probably all 
know. Members on this side of the House certainly are aware of 
it. Members on the other side are becoming aware. We are very 
happy to notice that in recent days even the Minister of Finance 
has made public pronouncements admitting that our national 
debt and ongoing annual deficit are problems and something we 
must address.
<P>
	As a matter of fact it is very important for us to remember in 
all this debate when we are talking about revamping our social 
programs the objective and one of the very large motivations for 
us being here is that we need to reconsider the financial picture 
of the country. We are in trouble. It is a matter of simple realism 
to recognize that if we do not do something about it external 
forces will take over and we will have it done for us. If we can do 
something about it while we still have control that is much to be 
desired and the highest of several different options.
<P>
	In keeping with a well known couplet which probably 
everyone in the House knows, the borrower is a slave to the 
lender. Our debt with its required interest payments has made us 
slaves in the sense that we have now lost our freedom to do the 
things we want to do.
<P>
	I really think it would be wonderful if we could just simply 
pick up everyone who does not have a job. I think it would be 
wonderful if everybody in the whole world could come to 
Canada to get medical procedures done because we have a 
wonderful free medicare system for everyone regardless of their 
ability to pay. I think it would be wonderful if we could offer 
free education to everyone, young and old alike. I think it would 
be great if we could say to people who are unemployed: ``Don't 
worry. We will pick up your cost of living. We will pay for your 
tuition to get retrained. We will help you to get re-established in 
another workplace''. Would that not be great? No one would 
ever suffer at all. That would be great.
<P>
	However we do not have that option because of our fiscal 
situation. Right now for every $4 the government spends $1 is 
borrowed. We only have income of $3 for every expenditure of 
$4. A lot of that growth is not even in our control. Just adding the 
interest payment this year of $40 billion, if we do nothing, will 
add another $5 billion of interest payments next year because of 
the interest due on the interest we paid this year and had to 
borrow the money for. Unless we get a hold of it and get a hold of 
it fast, we are not going to have the option.
<P>
	Members opposite love to make wonderful promises. I do too. 
I cannot help but use an analogy. I have a couple of sons. They 
are now thankfully grown up or close to it anyway. One of them 
is still at home because he needs my subsidy to go to school and 
that is fine. We love him and it is great having him there. I 
thought I would be considered the world's most wonderful dad if 
I could say to my boys: ``Hey guys, I will buy you each a 
Corvette''. They would just love it. Very frankly they would go 
around bragging. They would say: ``I have the greatest dad in the 
world. He is going to buy us each a Corvette''. It is an empty 
promise because I do not have financial backing. I do not have 
the money in the bank to buy two Corvettes to give to my boys. 
My promise is empty.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7944"> 7944 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	It is time the Canadian people woke up to the fact that despite 
the best promises that governments of the past have made and 
the present government is making, unless we maintain the fiscal 
backing that enables us to fulfil the promises, they become 
empty promises. That is why we must discuss all of our spending 
realistically, including social spending because it is such a large 
portion of our total budget.
<P>
	In the body of my speech I would like to concentrate on the 
question of education. Since I graduated from university I have 
been an educator. All of us here have been educated to some 
degree or another and we have all benefited from receiving an 
education.
<P>
	It would not be stretching it at all to recognize that our 
standard of living is based on education. Our democratic system 
is based on education. If we did not have a generally educated 
public we could forget about having votes and debates in public. 
We could not present things for people to read. If they were not 
educated and not literate we could only talk to them. We could 
not appeal to their ability to compute matters to see whether we 
are reasonable in our projections on the budget and government 
spending. Our very democracy depends on a generally educated 
public.
<P>
	However, I would go beyond that. Without in any way 
minimizing or marginalizing those people who do get past high 
school, we also need to acknowledge that our standard of living 
is greatly dependent on what happens in educational institutions 
past high school.
<P>
	I am not in any way minimizing or marginalizing those who 
for whatever reason do not go beyond high school. I know a 
number of people in that category and most of them do very well 
but our standard of living, as I am going to show now, is 
dependent on what happens afterward.
<P>
	Think of the basis of much of our standard of living. Think of 
the things that we enjoy. I guess because of my particular field of 
study I would first of all thank the mathematicians, since 
mathematics is the foundation of almost all science, all research 
and all engineering. Without mathematics and a solid 
mathematic, analytic ability we really would not have any of the 
wonderful things that we enjoy in the western world. I extend 
that to studies in engineering, to research scientists, to medical 
practitioners, medical researchers. All of these people 
contribute to what we almost take for granted in our country as a 
standard of living.
<P>
	We take it for granted that if we are ill we can go to the 
hospital for treatment. It goes beyond just having the hospital 
facility. Unless there are trained doctors and nurses, hospital 
and medical technicians, respiratory people and all the other 
specialities and all of the lab technicians, going to the hospital is 
as useful as going out to the wood shed when you are sick. We 
have to have qualified, trained people.
<P>
	It is important for us to make sure that we have not only 
quality education but quantity education. We need to provide a 
high degree of quality control in our education right through the 
years so that when our students graduate whether they are doing 
surgery on us or are designing our aeroplanes, bridges, or 
buildings, they will provide a highly reliable, dependable 
service.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	It also has a spin-off in our economic competition in the rest 
of the world. It is only when we do very well in those areas that 
we can maintain our standards. We are dependent on people who 
invent, who design, who plan, who build, who produce, who 
organize, who maintain and operate equipment, who build and 
maintain structures and systems. We need people who invent 
combinations of chemicals and materials to help our agriculture 
and forestry industries, to help us fight diseases with medicines. 
We need all of those different aspects, which are the result of 
education, if we are going to have our standard of living.
<P>
	We need to have electrical engineers and others, who are 
capable of learning, developing and inventing new ways of 
communicating with each other via telecommunications 
systems, computers and things like that. We need to constantly 
be on the move forward.
<P>
	So much for building the case for the need of education. 
Should we as people collectively, through our tax system fund 
education? I have said it in the House before. I say it again by 
way of emphasizing something that has been greatly 
misunderstood. Many times misinformation has gone out, 
especially from members opposite, regarding our party. They 
keep talking about us wanting to cut and slash and do away with 
everything.
<P>
	We said during the campaign and we are as deeply committed 
now as ever to bringing our fiscal House into order so that we 
can maintain a universal Canada-wide health care system. It is 
in our policy. We have said it from the beginning. We have 
always said it, notwithstanding that others have tried to 
minimize our message.
<P>
	Based on our very careful analysis of questionnaires of 
members in our party, which we think is a very good 
cross-section of the Canadian citizenry, those people have said 
that health is first and education is second. Here we have two 
programs. The review that the government has embarked on 
does not even talk about health care, old age security and some 
of the things that are so important to Canadians, but we have 
talked about it.
<P>
	Those are the items which are of very high priority for 
Canadians. We are here to do what we can to make it more than 
an empty promise. I would like to say that investment in 
education is exactly that. I have already indicated that we 
benefit as a society and as individuals from the positive 
spin-offs of having an educated population. I would also like to 
add that it is a very positive fiscal investment. We can invest our 
money and actually get a monetary return.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7945"> 7945 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to go way beyond what the minister has suggested. In 
fact it has already been done, as we know, in some previous 
parliamentary work the government has embarked on and that is 
to increase the loans to students. I do not think that is the way to 
go at all. We need to give some positive support to education so 
that education is within the means of students in their present 
level of earnings however they earn their money in the summer 
months when they are on vacation from their studies.
<P>
	We need to look at it as an investment. Let me give some 
numbers. I happen to love mathematics. I did a few calculations. 
It is totally realistic to assume that a person with a university 
degree, a college degree or a technical institute diploma could 
earn in some cases $1,000 or more per month as a result of that 
education.
<P>
	I am going to take a very modest number. I used to use the 
word conservative, but that word has now come into disrepute 
around the country, so I no longer say that. I am going to use a 
modest number of $400 per month. Let us say that graduate can 
earn $400 per month more as a result of receiving an education. 
Let us say that he graduates at age 22 and works to age 62, which 
is a good 40-year life span of work.
<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	During that time the $400 per month gives him an additional 
$192,000 of earnings. We all know that in our tax system the 
marginal rate of taxation is around 50 per cent. Governments 
right now are clawing back 50 per cent of the result of that added 
earning. Over the 40-year period that is $96,000. Just educating 
a student gives back $96,000.
<P>
	I want to be realistic. Let us think of this as an investment. 
What is the present value of that, using an 8 per cent interest 
rate, which is what I used to compute it. Amazingly the present 
value of every educated student in terms of returned increase 
income tax collected is $57,238. That is an amazing number. We 
are quibbling about whether or not we should lend these students 
$4,800 so that they can go to school and then graduate with a 
huge personal debt load as well as the collective government 
debt load we have laid on their shoulders. That is atrocious.
<P>
	We ought to be looking at more creative ways of funding 
education. It is a tremendous investment not only for our 
standard of living but even from a straight fiscal point of view. 
In the matter of direct income tax collected, it is a tremendous 
benefit for us all in the economic activity in the country. The 
more people we have who are educated the greater the economic 
activity in our country and the greater our exports. We benefit 
myriads more than just the income tax collected. That is but a 
very small portion of that investment.
<P>
	The question that comes next is how do we do this? How do we 
provide an education system for our students so that it is 
affordable and we can have all of our students going to school? I 
agree with the goal that students should not be prevented from 
going to school because of personal economic hindrances, just 
as I agree that people should not be prevented from going to a 
hospital for needed medical care because they do not have the 
money to pay for it.
<P>
	It is a downright shame if young people from poor families 
cannot go to school because they cannot afford it. It is time that 
we wake up to the fact that we have a responsibility to make sure 
that education is affordable. That can only be done if we put our 
fiscal house into order and stop all of the wastage in those many 
other areas.
<P>
	I have some suggestions. In the elementary and secondary 
schools we practise the idea that education should be free. 
Students generally do not pay tuition. There are some 
exceptions. Unfortunately in parts of our country some people 
who choose to send their children to private schools for various 
personal reasons end up paying extra. They pay tuition. Others, 
if they attend the public school system or, in some cases, there is 
a legitimate separate school system in the province, do not pay. 
That is paid for by the taxpayer.
<P>
	I have a question. Why would we use that principle up to grade 
12, or in Ontario grade 13, and then abandon it for education past 
that? The only thing I can think of as a legitimate reason would 
be that past grade 12 further education is a marked financial 
advantage to the student as well. Not only do we benefit as a 
society by being able to collect more income tax from them, but 
they are paying more income tax because they are making more 
money.
<P>
	Therefore, it is fair to say that the students should pay for at 
least a portion of their post-high school education, as it has been 
for quite some time. However, I do not believe that we should 
put the whole load, the whole burden of that education on these 
students, particularly because we know that over the years they 
will end up paying it back into the system anyway.
<P>
	Therefore I would like to propose that we give very serious 
consideration to a system whereby the students would look after 
their own housing. That is more or less acceptable unless they 
have to travel to a place away from home. The family should be 
able to provide for housing. In most instances they can live at 
home. Where they cannot of course we need to look at ways of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7946"> 7946 </A></B>
<P>
funding that at a reasonable rate, perhaps as part of the 
particular educational institution.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	Second, there are books and supplies. These too I think for the 
most part could be funded by students through their summer 
earnings, particularly if we had a good strong economy which 
would demand that a lot of students be hired in the summer 
months when they are away from their studies.
<P>
	My last and most important suggestion is that we would go to 
a system of vouchers for students which would essentially pay 
their tuition. I would like to see the student upon graduation 
from high school get a little certificate as part of his graduation 
package that says the certificate may be presented to any 
post-secondary institution in Canada of his choice and it will 
provide for a payment of 90 per cent of the tuition at that 
particular institution. I did think of putting in a fixed number. 
That is another option, but we do recognize that some 
institutions, some universities and some colleges have different 
costs because of the kinds of programs they offer.
<P>
	We know for example that in some of the engineering and 
some of the physics programs the cost of the equipment is way 
greater than in some other areas where the costs are mostly in 
books and libraries. I think to recognize that different programs 
have a slightly differentiated tuition system that certificate 
could be used.
<P>
	It would be a wonderful encouragement to our students to say: 
``We believe in you. We don't care whether you have rich 
parents. We are going to see that you have an opportunity for a 
good education and we are with you all the way. Here is a 
certificate from us, the taxpayers. We know that you will pay us 
back. But we put our faith and our trust in you. We want to see 
you be successful''.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, my time has come to an end. I really would like 
to encourage the people on the government side to give serious 
consideration when they are looking at this aspect of a social 
program review to do it and, for the sake of our young people 
and our children, do it well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to the comments of the 
hon. member across the way. I must say that I am certainly 
pleased to hear a member speak from the point of view of 
consultation. That is what the green paper tabled by the minister 
is really all about.
<P>
	During the most recent break I had the opportunity to have 
several public forums in my riding. I must admit there were 
several suggestions on this particular point regarding education 
and, from the federal perspective, how it might or should be 
funded in the future.
<P>
	The point that the hon. member made was one of those 
comments about a voucher type of system. Another was the fact 
that instead of taking this fund that currently I believe is $2.6 
billion, put it in a special fund for students only, earmark it that 
way and transfer it to the provinces, but with the specific outline 
that it is for  post-secondary education only to ensure that is 
where it goes.
<P>
	Having heard the hon. member and his comments regarding 
the voucher system, would he agree that there probably are 
several options available which could and possibly should be 
looked at in addition to the one that was in the green paper as one 
alternative.
<P>
	I do appreciate the fact that finally the member and his party 
realize that this is a consultation paper, that nothing has been 
carved in stone, that we want this input not only from members 
of Parliament but from Canadians from coast to coast so that we 
can come up with a consensus that will be good for Canada, our 
students, our youth not only today but indeed as we work toward 
the 21st century and try to be a benefit to all post-secondary 
students and those coming on in the next number of years.
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member to comment on that.
<P>
<B>(1620 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his kind 
comments. Actually, I should be worried if I say things that 
please members on the other side. Maybe I have not done a good 
job.
<P>
	With respect to the question of vouchers, I think it would be 
better for us to take the federal government money that is now 
allocated for post-secondary education, allocate it entirely 
through the voucher system and allow the universities to build a 
tuition system that reflects to a fair degree the cost of educating 
a student in the program.
<P>
	The provinces would individually be required to provide the 
funding for the facilities and for any special developments there 
since it is a provincial requirement. This way the students would 
be the ones who would produce a level of good, healthy 
academic competition between various institutions. They would 
then have to attract students because of their good record and 
good quality control program. Their graduates would be able to 
get the top notch jobs. Through that natural competitiveness 
those institutions would I think develop a better level of 
research and a better level of teaching.
<P>
	The provinces could go ahead and use their money as they are 
now in their component in the provinces. The voucher system 
would help to give students a great deal more flexibility in the 
choice of which institution they attend because of the fact that 
very often there are universities which specialize in their area.
<P>
	For example today I was talking to a person who happens to be 
a member of the chiropractic profession. There are no programs 
for that particular discipline in all universities. But there are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7947"> 7947 </A></B>
<P>
those that could provide that service and that student would not 
have to face a great economic disadvantage because it may be 
out of province.
<P>
	Those are just some of my comments on that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have enjoyed the analysis by the member for Elk Island.
<P>
	I have just a couple of things in relation to education in 
Canada and his idea that the economy is what should determine 
how we relate to costs of education in elementary where it is 
free, secondary where it is free and then in university where it 
suddenly costs money.
<P>
	In Canada education is a bargain if you compare it with any 
country in the world. The one to which we are most likely to 
compare it of course would be our neighbours to the south where 
even the basic university courses cost roughly twice what they 
do in Canada. I am talking about the state universities that 
receive a government subsidy. I am not talking about private 
universities. They are beyond reach unless you are quite 
affluent. Private universities in the United States are very, very 
expensive.
<P>
	What is wrong with a student borrowing some money? Just 
the exercise itself is a good one for a young person. He takes on 
the responsibility of borrowing some money and having it made 
available and taking that opportunity to advance himself, 
investing in himself. That is not a bad exercise for a young 
person to have. It would be better of course if you could graduate 
and say: ``I do not owe anybody anything''.
<P>
	Really, carrying a little debt within reason is a pretty good 
exercise for later life. All of us I am sure have carried some debt. 
The idea is to take on some responsibility, address that 
responsibility seriously and repay that debt. I sometimes get 
very annoyed when people take the liberty of borrowing or 
taking advantage of money when it is available, but they do not 
follow up with the responsibility that accompanies that, to pay it 
back on time providing they are in a position to do that. I think 
provision is being made now to gear the repayment plan to the 
income you are getting. That seems to make sense to me. How 
else would you pay it back.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	I wonder if the member would see some very worth while 
benefit to a student through those years accepting the 
responsibility of borrowing and of course the responsibility that 
follows the borrowing, to see that it is repaid. It is really 
taxpayers' money, my money, your money, and that of the rest of 
us. It is our money. We want it back because we loaned it to 
somebody. I think it is their responsibility to address that at the 
appropriate time when they can of course.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to address 
that question because that is actually one of the aspects of this 
proposal that bothers me the most.
<P>
	I know it is good to learn when you are young that when you 
borrow something you repay it. I remember growing up as a 
youngster on a farm in Saskatchewan my dad taught me that 
whenever we borrowed something from a neighbour we always 
returned it in a condition as good as or better than we borrowed 
it. That is a good principle but I do not believe it is a good 
principle to set things up so that young people on graduation 
have a millstone of debt hanging around their necks.
<P>
	For example, a young person who has gone through a dental 
program wants to open a dentist office. He now has to borrow 
money in order to put up his office, get his equipment. That is 
true for many different professions, even in my profession of 
teaching. We need to have computer equipment and things like 
that, depending on what area we are in.
<P>
	Some of us on graduation get married. We set up a home. We 
need to borrow money for the home. We need to borrow money 
for the downpayment for the car and for the furniture. The first 
thing you know, you are up to your ears in debt just like this 
government is up to its ears in debt and you are totally 
debilitated by it.
<P>
	I really think it would be much healthier for our whole society 
if our students could graduate debt free. That really is the very 
best. It is not that one is a nine and the other is an eight. I really 
think that one is a 10 and the other is a zero in this as far as my 
feeling is concerned.
<P>
	I know that is idealistic but I think it can happen. In a healthy 
society where students can get a good summer job and are able to 
live frugally, I believe they should be able to save enough to pay 
their living expenses. If we as a society, as taxpayers, pay their 
tuition directly and have them pay it back through their taxes 
that would be a superior method.
<P>
	I want to avoid handing them a millstone of debt with their 
graduation certificate from university.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in 
such a historic debate in this House, one that I think is of great 
importance to all Canadians because we are talking not only 
about the social security network that supports us all in times of 
trouble but also about a very significant portion of the federal 
government's budget.
<P>
	The green paper recently released by the Minister of Human 
Resources Development contains a number of interesting 
proposals that have already been the subject of considerable 
discussion and will continue to be the focus of that discussion in 
the weeks ahead.
<P>
	The government's objective in regard to the improvement of 
Canada's social security programs was outlined very briefly by 
the Prime Minister in a speech he gave to the Canadian Chamber 
of Commerce in Quebec in September. I quote him: ``Our 
objective at the end of the process is a reform system of social 
security that protects the most vulnerable while enabling all 
Canadians  to obtain a fair and equal opportunity to exploit their 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7948"> 7948 </A></B>
<P>
talents, lead fulfilling lives and experience the dignity of 
work''.
<P>
	Those are words that would reflect the views of a series of 
Prime Ministers of this country from Laurier to King, St. 
Laurent, Pearson, Turner, Trudeau, and of course the present 
Prime Minister who said the words.
<P>
	They are words that come from the leader of a party that has 
introduced virtually every social program this country enjoys 
today. It is not a party that is in any way anxious to tear away the 
fabric of the social programs that we have built for Canadians. It 
is not our intent in producing this green paper to destroy in any 
way or rip apart the social safety net that we as a party at various 
times in government in Canada have worked to build.
<P>
<B>(1630 ) </B>
<P>
	On the other hand, there is a pressing need for social security 
reform. I can only look at the figures. I have quoted them in 
public meetings in my riding before and I do so again. The green 
paper concerns federal expenditure of $39 billion or about 24 
per cent of total federal expenditures. It does not include 
pensions. It does not include expenditures in government 
departments related to transport, foreign affairs, corrections and 
national defence.
<P>
	In other words, a huge range of federal government programs 
are excluded from the $39 billion figure that is the subject of 
discussion in the green paper on social security reform. It is the 
only other single government expenditure that is as large as the 
interest on the public debt which is at $40 billion. Some say: 
``You can reduce the debt figure and that will solve your 
problem''. That is complete nonsense, utter hogwash.
<P>
	The government does not control interest rates in the country. 
It can affect them. It can influence them. It cannot control them. 
In the end Canada's interest rate, the national rate charged by 
our central bank, will have to reflect world trends. It will have to 
reflect those for the very simple reason that the value of our 
dollar is tied to interest rates in the country. That is an 
unfortunate fact of life, but Canada cannot simply go about 
setting its own interest rate ignorant of world events, world 
trading patterns and currency movements. We recognize that we 
can influence the rate; we cannot control it.
<P>
	Since the government has taken office it has influenced the 
rate. Whether it was done directly or not I cannot say; I do not 
know. The rate has gone down, the Canadian dollar has dropped 
and Canadian exports have increased since, leading to increased 
prosperity in the country. That may be one of the factors leading 
to prosperity. There are others but that is a principal one. The 
changes that have come about in our world economy have no 
doubt improved the economic situation of Canadians, but it has 
not improved to the extent that we can ignore the fiscal realities 
the Minister of Finance has been discussing.
<P>
	We have a particularly competent Minister of Finance who 
has gone before the Standing Committee on Finance and made 
what I can only describe as a brilliant exposition, describing the 
state of the Canadian economy today and inviting Canadians to 
address that committee to express their concerns and views 
concerning tax changes in the country and how we can improve 
the tax system to make it fairer and better.
<P>
	He has also asked Canadians to comment on what they would 
do if they were minister and were drafting a budget. Where 
would they cut? Where would they increase taxes? Where would 
they seek to increase revenue, and so on? Those questions are 
extremely important. We have engaged in a great national 
debate on this subject and we read about it daily in the media.
<P>
	Unfortunately much of what we see are ideas that if we simply 
cut interest rates everything will turn up roses. I do not accept 
that for a moment. I do not believe it is true. I think the people 
that are saying it know it is false. They are simply putting the 
message out in order to distort the view of Canadians that things 
can be improved in this easy way without some painful changes 
in our systems.
<P>
	What did the Minister of Finance say in his brilliant 
exposition before the Standing Committee On Finance? First, he 
indicated that the world economy has become far more 
integrated than it was 40 or 50 years ago when many of the social 
programs were put in place. It has become more integrated and 
global and trade barriers have disappeared. We have brought 
down trade barriers both through GATT and through the North 
American Free Trade Agreement. Those are being extended 
rapidly around the world.
<P>
	Second, people from what we once called the third world are 
joining the global economy. They are producing goods for sale 
in this country that are inexpensive and that Canadians are 
buying. We will continue to buy them in increasing numbers 
because they are less expensive. They are also quite well made 
in many cases. We are getting better and better products that are 
made abroad.
<P>
	Third, information technology is exploding. It is easily 
portable and we cannot stop it from changing across borders 
around the world. If we do not get on the bandwagon and 
produce goods and deliver services in a less expensive and more 
efficient way, we will be outpaced by others who can do it less 
expensively elsewhere. The technology that allows us to deliver 
the services more cheaply will move to the places where it is 
being delivered cheaper, reduce costs further and leave us high 
and dry. All this means is that competition is forcing companies, 
states and individuals to change their method of work, their 
method of dealing, and the way they interact one with the other.
<P>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="7949"> 7949 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	I quote the Minister of Finance again:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For three entire decades after the second world war all we knew was high job 
growth, high productivity growth, high income growth and low 
unemployment. We ignored the fact that our unemployment rate was rising 
relentlessly with every recession and staying up.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As he pointed out, the unemployment rate 25 years ago was 
usually at 5 per cent. During this past decade it has been steadily 
at 10 per cent. Unemployment has become more serious for 
Canadians and the costs of it have risen enormously.
<P>
	The Minister for Human Resources Development in his 
introductory address to the House when he produced the green 
paper and led off this debate pointed out that workers and 
employers finance unemployment insurance through their 
contributions. He said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is simply costing too much. In 1980 the program cost $4.4 billion. Last 
year it cost $19.7 billion. In other words, in about 13 years the costs 
quadrupled. We cannot allow this escalation in UI costs to continue.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The minister was right. For that reason we have to look at the 
unemployment system to see what can be done to improve it. It 
is very important that the green paper which has made some 
proposals be thoroughly discussed and I have aimed to do that.
<P>
	The minister outlined two basic proposals for change in UI. 
He is willing to receive others. He has made that very clear. That 
is what the public debate is about. He said we could have a new 
unemployment insurance program or we could tighten the rules 
of the existing UI program further.
<P>
	We have been tightening the rules ever since I got elected in 
1988. We watched the Conservative government tighten the 
rules right, left and centre, causing pain and anxiety to a lot of 
Canadians. In the last budget there was further tightening of 
those rules. I do not think that continuing to tighten them is 
really helping the unemployed. It is not.
<P>
	We need to find a new scheme that encourages people to work 
rather than encourage them to remain on unemployment 
insurance. The minister pointed out that because the program 
has been in place for so long and because it has some fairly 
generous rules here and there it is easily abused both by workers 
and by employers. They schedule work around UI instead of the 
other way around.
<P>
	We are not taking out unemployment insurance against the 
day we are unemployed. We are taking it out and receiving it 
because we know there will be a period of unemployment. It is 
planned for in employment contracts today. That is not what the 
system was designed for. Canadians are paying a great deal of 
money for this system through the charges that are put on them, 
especially if they are ones who are in places where they are 
regularly employed and paying the new higher premiums.
<P>
	The day after the tabling of the green paper I met with 
members of the construction industry in my community. They 
were very much concerned that unemployment insurance would 
be changed as we know it. They are not seasonal workers, but 
they are people employed in the construction industry who are 
unemployed from time to time, not at any particular time of year 
but whenever there is not work available for them. As they 
pointed out to me, many of them travel great distances to get 
work. They are quite prepared to travel to Windsor to work on a 
construction project there, or to New Brunswick to work on a 
construction project there if that is necessary. They will travel 
great distances to get work. However, if there is no work 
available, they depend on and need unemployment insurance.
<P>
	The indication to me was that they would pay higher 
premiums if they could continue to receive unemployment 
insurance. They did not mean higher premiums in terms of the 
employer's share. They meant in terms of the employees' share. 
The employees would pay more if they could keep UI in 
something like its existing format.
<P>
	I invited them to make a submission to the minister, send a 
letter to the minister or prepare some kind of brief through their 
union-and some union leaders were at the meeting-to let the 
minister know what they could do in their view to make the 
system work for them.
<P>
	I have stressed to the minister in my discussions with him the 
importance of UI to people in that particular job category. In the 
green paper there are suggestions that perhaps UI will have to be 
tailored to fit the needs of different areas of our workforce. That 
would be worthwhile. It is a sensible idea. I hope that there are 
suggestions forthcoming from members of the construction 
industry in Kingston and the Islands.
<P>
<B>(1640 ) </B>
<P>
	Another thing the Minister of Finance said that I think is 
important is that we missed the signals with these rising 
unemployment rates. I quote him again:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And as we were missing those signals what did we do? We borrowed to paper 
over the problem, borrowing first from ourselves, then from foreigners and 
always from the future.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The hon. member for Elk Island in his remarks referred to the 
fiscal crisis facing Canada today. Most members of the House 
acknowledge that is a serious problem facing us. For the years 
from 1988 to 1993 I sat here and watched while Brian Mulroney 
and Michael Wilson fiddled. They did absolutely nothing to 
solve the deficit problem in Canada. Indeed it got worse and 
worse the longer they were in office. They were elected in 1983 
with promises to fix this problem. They were going to bring the 
deficit under control within two or three years-I have forgotten 
the promise now-from 1984. We all know what Mr. Mulroney's 
promises were worth.
<P>

<B><A NAME="7950"> 7950 </A></B>
<P>
	We sat on the other side of the House, some of my colleagues 
for the full nine painful years, but me for only five, and watched 
the government do absolutely nothing to make the situation 
better. I know members of the Reform Party who are here missed 
this, but we heard budgets presented that indicated that within 
three years the deficit would be down to, I think the low figure 
we heard was $16 billion. It never got anywhere near $16 
billion. The projections were always wrong. They were revised 
in every budget and the promised pay off was always deferred 
another two or three years. It was really quite nauseating.
<P>
	The minister kept insisting with every budget every year that 
this time his projections were going to stick, that he had made 
the right decision, that everything was going to be fine in 
another two or three years, and that we should just hold on to our 
seats and wait and see what happened. They did not hold on to 
their seats, thank goodness. We have the remnants of the party 
sitting over there, all two of them. It was a string of broken 
promises that really deflated and disappointed Canadians.
<P>
	We have heard repeatedly from the Prime Minister and from 
the Minister of Finance the proposal he has put forward to 
reduce the deficit to 3 per cent of the gross national product by 
the end of the third year of our mandate. That gives us two years 
to reach that figure.
<P>
	It is not going to be the annus mirabilis when we get there, but 
it does signify that at least the Government of Canada is willing 
to make a commitment and stick to it. The Prime Minister has 
indicated his commitment to that figure repeatedly in the House 
and elsewhere. I believe it is important that the government 
achieve this.
<P>
	The critics of social reform, and I point specifically to the 
Bloc Quebecois, all sit and howl and scream and say: ``You are 
eliminating this; you are going to hurt everybody''. Yet they 
know perfectly well that the government is not seeking to reduce 
all its expenditures through this one package alone.
<P>
	I have no doubt in the ability of the Minister of Finance and in 
his sense of fairness that when he seeks to achieve that goal of 
reducing the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP in another two years, he 
will achieve it by making reductions across a very wide range of 
government services and government programs. It will not all be 
done through reductions in social programs, which is what the 
Reform Party would like us to do.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	On the one hand, the Bloc Quebecois wants everything to 
remain the same, unchanged, exactly as it is right now. 
Unfortunately, this is no longer an option. There is no way status 
quo can be allowed to continue. This is just impossible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	On the other hand, the Reform Party wants to cut all the social 
programs and let Canadians suffer on their own, abandoned by 
their government, abandoned by the social programs they have 
paid for with their taxes lo these many years.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> All from rich provinces.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> And as my colleague says: ``All from rich 
provinces''.
<P>
	I do not care where the money comes from. The fact is that 
Canadians expect there will be social programs in place. They 
may not be the same as they are today, but they want social 
programs and they want a voice in how those social programs 
will be shaped.
<P>
	That brings me to the significant and important thing about 
this discussion. The Minister of Human Resources Development 
has produced a plan for discussion. He has invited Canadians to 
participate in this national debate to express to him and to one 
another what they think the social programs of the country 
should be like.
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	We are not going to have unanimity on the point. I know the 
hon. members of the Bloc do not agree with anything the 
government has put forward. They fulfil the traditional role of 
an opposition and that is, oppose, oppose, oppose. I can 
understand that. I am not surprised by that. On the other hand I 
would hope they would engage in a dialogue with the 
government and put forward their ideas on how the social 
programs of this country could be improved.
<P>
	As for the Reform Party, it was refreshing to hear the hon. 
member for Elk Island. However I am sure that if his leader had 
heard all his remarks he would have been horrified by what he 
was saying. I know his leader would not have agreed with 
everything the hon. member for Elk Island said. I can only hope 
that the hon. member is here tomorrow. I am worried that he is 
going to be shut up and gagged.
<P>
	What he said about the importance of this program spending 
on students was correct. I am sure that in an ideal world it would 
be wonderful if students could come out of university debt free. 
I do not think that is the case for many students today and I do 
not believe it will be the case tomorrow. I think the situation can 
only get worse, not better, at least for a while.
<P>
	That is the fiscal reality we are going to have to face, 
notwithstanding the demonstration yesterday and 
notwithstanding the demagoguery of the hon. member for 
Roberval who was out there saying that students deserved free 
tuition and all that sort of nonsense. That was considered when I 
was a student in the sixties. It was not adopted by governments 
then and they had a lot more money to spend than governments 
have today. It is simply not a realistic approach to the tuition 
issue.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7951"> 7951 </A></B>
<P>
	I did not want to get into that. I am prepared today to deal with 
unemployment insurance and I will stick with that.
<P>
	The Reform Party must acknowledge that we cannot bring the 
deficit of the Government of Canada under control simply by 
eliminating social programs. If members of the Reform Party-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> A point of order, Mr. Speaker. The 
parliamentary secretary just made some allegations about a 
member who is not even present in the House regarding another 
member in our caucus. He talked about being gagged. I would 
appreciate it if the hon. parliamentary secretary would withdraw 
those comments. They were out of order.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I think the point raised by 
the hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminster is more a 
matter of debate than a point of order. Like himself I have 
followed the debate attentively. In fact I do not believe I can 
attribute the inference to the parliamentary secretary. I think 
there is a debate going on between the parliamentary secretary 
and the previous spokesperson from the Reform Party as to 
whether that member would be here tomorrow or not and no one 
else who is here or not here at the present time in the Chamber.
<P>
	I am prepared to return to debate. Unless the member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster wishes to add something else, I will 
return the debate to the parliamentary secretary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I hope that silly interruption will 
not be taken off my time. Even the hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster was huffing and puffing on that one.
<P>
	Members of the Reform Party would do well to reconsider 
their ill advised stance with respect to Canada's social programs 
and get on board with the government to make the social 
programs better instead of just chopping and cutting the way 
they want to do.
<P>
	I recall during the last election campaign I had many requests 
from electors as I went door to door asking what the Reform 
Party was really doing with its proposals to cut the deficit. Of 
course it had this great scheme for eliminating Canada's deficit 
by cutting $18 billion or $15 billion or something like that. We 
all know the deficit is $40 billion and so $18 billion was barely 
half of it. Yet that was the cut they were proposing during the 
election campaign. They were telling Canadians that was going 
to eliminate the deficit.
<P>
	Most people could see that was hogwash. The people in 
Kingston and the Islands certainly saw that it was hogwash. I 
hope the Reform Party members who were elected running on 
that bowl of hogwash will be able to realize that it is time to 
change their tune, get into dialogue with the government in 
respect of what social programs could and should be and try to 
work with the government to make them better.
<P>
	The hon. member for Elk Island in his very able speech spoke 
about one aspect of it. He did not tell us of any proposals from 
his party to improve the current proposals put forward by the 
government or suggest changes to the current system that would 
make the system one that we could afford or would be more 
workable or better for Canadians. That is the government's aim. 
That is what we would like to do.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	I encourage hon. members opposite to engage in that 
dialogue. Work with the members on this side of the House in 
committee and in this House to come up with proposals that will 
better Canadians' lot in life and provide the income security for 
all that we so earnestly desire in this country.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Questions or comments. I 
take note of the interest of a number of members who want to 
speak. I would ask that questions and replies be rather brief and I 
will get as many on the record as possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, of course there is always a great response from 
Reform MPs when they are being unfairly represented by 
members on the other side of the House.
<P>
	The hon. member for Kingston and the Islands talked a bit 
about discussing with his constituents the Reform position on 
social programs and on reducing the deficit. It is true that 
Reform has consulted extensively with Canadians. In fact while 
the hon. member was part of a party that was involved in rat 
packing and some very unproductive activities, Reformers were 
consulting.
<P>
	I might add our leader led the way in consulting with 
Canadians and hearing the views of everyone, not gagging 
anyone I might add, but being very considerate of all opinions 
expressed by Canadians. Reformers found a consensus that they 
took to the electorate last year. That consensus was that 
spending needed to be reduced to save social programs that were 
most needed by the Canadian public.
<P>
	The hon. member for Kingston and the Islands and his party 
did not undertake that consultation. We did not see that proposal 
in the red book. They did not have a plan. They still do not have a 
plan. They cannot even put out an action plan. They have a 
discussion paper.
<P>
	How does the hon. member have the audacity and the nerve to 
make these allegations in the House when in fact there is no 
political party in Canada that has consulted more with 
Canadians and knows more about the wishes of Canadians on the 
deficit and on the reform of social programs than the Reform 
Party of Canada?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7952"> 7952 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have no trouble answering that 
question. We just heard the answer from the hon. member for 
Elk Island. If the hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminster 
had been in the House he would have heard it.
<P>
	The hon. member for Elk Island said that yes, the leader of the 
Reform Party consulted with all the members of the Reform 
Party and that was a great cross-section of Canadians. What 
utter rubbish. If he thinks so, I wish he had gone to the meeting 
last night that the hon. leader of the Reform Party was at in 
Quebec. I understand all of 50 people showed up to hear him at 
Cowansville, Quebec, members of the Reform Party. That was a 
cross-section of Canadians? Be serious.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as we all know in this House from time to time there are 
those who take liberties with exactitude of what might have been 
said, otherwise known as nose stretchers. I think we have just 
heard one.
<P>
	As the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands knows full 
well, our presentation during the last election campaign was $18 
billion in spending reductions and $20 billion in growth. At that 
time the Liberals opposite were going all around the country like 
Johnny Appleseed saying: ``Do not worry, everything is just 
fine. Those terrible Reformers are going to have to cut spending 
but we are not. We have never done it in the past. We are not 
likely to do it in the future. Do not worry. Vote for us. Everything 
is going to be okay''. However, we are all in this boat together. 
They are finding that they have to do the very things that would 
not be done or we are going to destroy the country. All of a 
sudden, they are faced with the fact that they have to do it.
<P>
	Since the hon. member does not think the Reform Party has a 
plan, what is his plan for reducing the deficit to zero? That is not 
a low hurdle. We all know the member opposite is part of the 
Liberal olympic low hurdle team. If you make the hurdle low 
enough anybody can stumble over it. Before he hurts his shins 
getting over this 3 per cent hurdle let us hear how he is going to 
get to nothing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have not said, nor has the 
government said, that it is going to reduce the deficit to zero. 
What it did say is in the red book, and the hon. member says he 
did not see it. Of course I am sure he did not read the red book 
during the election campaign. He should have. He might have 
joined the Liberal Party instead and he would be much happier 
than he is today.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	The red book made it very clear that the government was 
committed to reducing the deficit to 3 per cent of gross national 
product by year three of its mandate. That is the promise the 
government is going to keep. That is the promise I was 
discussing earlier in my speech. I believe it is a reasonable 
promise. We have two more years to do that. By the end of the 
two years the government will have plans for reducing the 
deficit  further I have no doubt. I am optimistic that with the 
great policies the government is pursuing we will have 
phenomenal growth in this country throughout the period that 
will reduce it further.
<P>
	I invite the hon. member to wait for the budget. See what is in 
it and rejoice when it comes out.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is always an interesting discussion when the hon. member 
opposite begins to wax eloquent, especially if the wax is not 
fully hardened yet. I have particularly enjoyed some of his 
diatribe. It has been quite good.
<P>
	I would like to add to what one of our hon. members just 
mentioned. This mutatis mutandis attitude the Liberal 
government has: Do not worry, be happy, everything will be 
okay. I wonder if those watching have heard enough yet from the 
Liberal side of the House that they will somehow, hopefully with 
about a 6 or 7 per cent growth rate, be able to balance the budget. 
I suppose sometime into their grandchildren's funeral party they 
will somehow be able to bring together a government plan that 
will bring the deficit down to zero.
<P>
	Canadians are not fooled by the idea that if we set the 
boundary so low we can never be disappointed, if we just say 
that some illusive day we will be able to balance the budget. 
Canadians have had enough of this. That is why the green book, 
the red book, the mauve book, the pink book, the grey book, the 
flurry of studies this government has brought forward, not one 
of them has any idea that is ever going to solve this deficit 
problem. They are discussion papers. The latest one is another 
discussion paper. The Liberals put a nice title on it: ``Jobs and 
Growth''. It sounds good, but in the body of it there are no 
details, no goals, no dollar figures and no costing of the options.
<P>
	The people watching are not fooled by this. Certainly on this 
side of the House we are not fooled by government proposals 
that continue to leave the dollar figures off the bottom line. The 
Canadian people are not fooled. It is time for action. The 
Liberals have wasted and squirrelled away a year. It has been the 
best year to take advantage of economic growth.
<P>
	Why does this member and the government not move now 
while they have some political capital left to move and address 
this deficit problem? It is not going to get easier with the passing 
days. I encourage the member to grab the bull by the horns and 
come forward with some solid suggestions, not more discussion 
points.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Fraser 
Valley East has raised a number of points. I am delighted that he 
enjoyed my speech and feels that it provoked him to rise in the 
House and ask questions. I will try to make speeches more often 
to elucidate matters for him. I regret I cannot speak as often as I 
did when I was in opposition. I would have certainly enjoyed 
debates with him, although I suspect he would have been on the 
same side of the House just in one of the smaller parties.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7953"> 7953 </A></B>
<P>
	The hon. member suggested that Canadians were being fooled 
by government proposals. They are not being fooled by any 
proposals by this government. He said that Canadians are fed up 
with the things they are getting from this government. Well the 
polls do not indicate that. Seventy-three per cent was the latest 
figure I read of satisfaction with the government, the highest 
ever. No government since polling began has done such a great 
job as this government has done in the eyes of the Canadian 
electorate who voted us in.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> You have not done anything.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> The hon. member says we have not done one 
thing. The other day I listened to a litany of complaints from one 
of his colleagues about things the government had done that he 
disagreed with. We have done all kinds of things and Canadians 
appreciate what we have done. It shows up in the polls when a 
government can get a 73 per cent satisfaction rating. It must 
make the hon. member and his colleagues green with envy.
<P>
	I should also say that this party does not fool Canadians. We 
have not fooled Canadians in this debate. We have presented 
proposals. We have invited discussion. We have told Canadians 
what we are doing in an open and forthright manner. The only 
party that has fooled Canadians is the one headed by the hon. 
member for Calgary Southwest. I suspect he has fooled the 
members of his own party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leonard Hopkins (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to compliment the hon. member for 
Kingston and the Islands for certainly raising so much attention 
to this great issue. I also want to thank him for reminding the 
Reform members that the Canadian people voted for the Liberal 
Party and its policies in the red book. They did not vote in favour 
of Reform Party policies.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands, 
what would be the impact today if the Reform Party policies 
were actually in place? How would they differ from the actual 
policies that are going into place by the Liberal Party right here 
in this House of Commons? We never promised what the Reform 
Party is talking about, so we do not have to deliver that. What we 
have to deliver is what we promised.
<P>
	The hon. member for Kingston and the Islands has been very 
explicit in what he has said. He held up the books which 
contained the discussion papers. But the Reform Party is talking 
about figures. The hon. member for Kingston and the Islands 
knows very well that when you have a discussion paper you do 
not have bottom line figures. If you had bottom line figures to go 
on to begin with, why would you even have a discussion paper?
<P>
	I want to ask the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands 
what is the purpose of the discussion paper? Would he explain 
that. I know, but I want him to explain to these people across the 
way who seem to think that the Canadian public voted them into 
office instead of the Liberal Party of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I can understand why members 
opposite think they were voted into office instead of us. I used to 
think that too when we sat on the other side. Canadians now wish 
they had voted us in and they would not have gone through five 
years of anguish they did from 1988 to 1993. Unfortunately, 
they did not. They were cajoled into voting for Mr. Mulroney 
and his gang and we all suffered as a result. The members of the 
Reform Party all acknowledge that and they know it is true.
<P>
	In fact, because of the suffering imposed by that government 
many of the Reformers were elected in western Canada 
primarily. To my recollection they got one in Ontario and 
spoiled a perfect record for this party. But we did fine in Ontario 
and the hon. member knows that.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke 
for a very sensible question. The purpose of this particular series 
of proposals was ``Agenda, Jobs and Growth, Improving Social 
Security in Canada'' to elicit the views of Canadians on 
improving the social security system in Canada. It was intended 
as a discussion paper. It is being used as a discussion paper. I had 
a public meeting in my constituency where members of the 
public were invited to make presentations and submit their 
views and there was discussion.
<P>
	The hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human 
Resources Development was there as a special guest and he 
provided great illumination for all present. It was an excellent 
meeting. That is the purpose of the release of this paper.
<P>
	I see my time has expired. I apologize.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It is my duty pursuant to 
Standing Order 38 to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: The 
hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-GrÃ¢ce, VIA Rail; the hon. 
member for The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, Grain 
Transportation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are 
having fun here this afternoon.
<P>
	I rise in the House today to talk about a very important and I 
think a very serious subject that affects all Canadians. That of 
course is social program reform.
<P>
	I was in my constituency this past week. I attended several 
townhall meetings, coffee shop meetings, meetings with 
chambers of commerce and other meetings. It proved to be a 
very difficult week because I was continually preparing my 
constitu-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7954"> 7954 </A></B>
<P>
ents for very depressing news. I laid out and explained the 
situation  and the difficulties we face in the years to come in 
regard to dealing with reform of the social programs.
<P>
	It was tough talking to people about cutting spending to social 
programs. It was tough talking about the $10 billion of federal 
government cuts that must take place other than cuts to social 
program areas.
<P>
	It was difficult telling Canadians and having those people 
agree with me that we need to cut somewhere between $12 
billion and $16 billion from social program spending otherwise 
these programs will collapse and we will lose them entirely.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	In an attempt to lighten things in the evening and to make a 
very important point, I would start by relating a story about a 
neighbour of mine. This farmer was the frustrated type. He was 
the anxious type. To relieve the anxiety he would go out every 
Sunday morning on his road. He called it his road because he 
was the one who pushed to have it built and he was the one who 
pushed to have it paved. He would go out in his five speed car. 
He would go up the straightaway, get his car up to about 100 and 
go into a sharp curve and come out of the curve at 140. That 
made him feel good. That helped relieve his anxiety.
<P>
	One Sunday morning he drove out to the end of his driveway. 
He just started accelerating up the straightaway and he saw 
around the corner someone on his road. As the car moved closer 
he saw it swerve. He thought: ``My God, a drunk on my road on a 
Sunday morning''. As the car came even closer he saw that it 
was a lady driver. He thought: ``A lady driver on my road on 
Sunday morning, this is ridiculous''.
<P>
	He started accelerating but as he started to do that, the lady 
driver slowed her car down and quickly cranked the window 
open. He was not going to stop but he slowed down. As he went 
by he opened his window. And as the car passed he heard the 
lady shout: ``Pig''. He was really angry and really anxious. He 
accelerated down the straightaway, went into the corner at 120 
and slammed, right into the pig''.
<P>
	I use this story to demonstrate that people with an attitude 
problem, as this farmer clearly had, often miss the signals that 
would help them avoid problems that are in the road. Because 
this farmer missed the signals he hit the pig. Because of his 
attitude problem he hit the pig.
<P>
	I suggest that governments over the past 30 years have missed 
the signals. They have had attitude problems when it comes to 
cutting spending to preserve the social programs that people in 
this country value.
<P>
	I want to talk today about spending, in fact overspending. It is 
the biggest problem the government faces today. To start this 
topic off at the meetings over the past week I presented a quote 
by P.J. O'Rourke which states: ``Giving government money and 
power is like giving teenagers liquor and the keys to the car''. 
That quote really hit home with people. They really could  
identify with that quote. Giving government money and power is 
like giving teenagers liquor and the keys to the car.
<P>
	If we think about what has happened in the area of spending 
over this past 30 years or so with one government after 
another-Liberal, Conservative, Liberal, Conservative, 
Liberal-it has been the same problem, a problem that seems to 
be similar to giving teenagers liquor and the keys to the car.
<P>
	My constituents one after another at one meeting after another 
just simply could not believe how this government operates. By 
that I mean how it is constantly overspending. They like to relate 
the overspending of this government to what would happen if 
they overspent in their personal budgets in running their homes.
<P>
	The question came up again and again. How can they get away 
with spending more than they have? In my home if I was 
spending more than I have my family would eventually be 
without a home and they would be hungry. This was a common 
comment made by people in the constituency over this time.
<P>
	What these people did understand very well is that the deficit, 
which is the amount that government spends more than it takes 
in over any one year, last year about $36 billion, cannot 
continue. These people did understand very clearly that the 
federal government debt, which is about $534 billion now, 
increasing at about $110 million per day or about $1,500 a 
second, cannot be continued.
<P>
	I just want to put this debt and deficit into perspective by 
talking about how that relates to my family personally.
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	My wife, my five children, and myself own about $140,000 of 
this federal debt. We have to pay off about $140,000 of this 
federal debt. That is on top of my house mortgage and my farm 
debt, another $140,000 to pay off. Not only that but my family's 
share is being added to at a rate of about $10,000 per year. I am 
very concerned that it is going to be extremely difficult for my 
family as it is going to be very difficult for other Canadian 
families to pay their share of this debt.
<P>
	Where does the federal government get its money? Where 
does the money come from? First of all about $58 billion a year 
comes from personal income tax, about $8.3 billion from 
corporate tax, about $17.5 billion from unemployment 
insurance contributions, about $15 billion from the GST, $11 
billion from excise taxes, and about $11 billion from other 
spending.

<P>
Where does the other $40 billion to $41 billion come from? The 
sad truth is that the other $40 billion comes from borrowing.
<P>
	Who does this Canadian government borrow the money from? 
It used to be that a majority of the money borrowed came from 
Canadians. Now, and I think this makes our situation even more 
difficult, almost 45 per cent of new borrowing comes from 
outside Canada.
<P>
	Should the time come, and it almost certainly will if our 
government does not change its attitude so it can avoid this pig, 
it almost certainly will be cut off very soon. Lenders from 
outside the country will just stop lending. When that day comes 
we will face a situation that is every bit as serious as the 
situation that New Zealand has faced and the situation that Italy 
has faced, very difficult indeed.
<P>
	Some say it is easy to get more revenue. All we have to do is 
increase corporate taxes. We have certainly heard from the NDP 
and from members of the Liberal Party over the past years: just 
increase the corporate tax.
<P>
	I have a cartoon here that I think demonstrates very well the 
problem with that. It is a picture of people in a coffee shop who 
are saying ``Well, this new tax plan sounds pretty good. We get a 
cut of 9 per cent and business picks up the burden''. In the very 
next frame of this cartoon is a picture of their local grocery store 
and of course prices have gone up by 9 per cent. If corporate 
taxes are increased consumers pick up the full tab. There is no 
magic to it.
<P>
	There just is no more room for increasing revenues. This 
government and past governments have had a spending problem. 
I think to demonstrate this it is important to look at spending 
over the past years.
<P>
	I have a graph that shows spending from 1975 to the present. 
This graph shows in 1986 constant dollars, so inflation is taken 
out of the picture. Real spending has increased from $73 billion 
in 1975 to about $135 billion, again in 1986 dollars, in the most 
recent figures, an incredible increase in spending and it is not 
caused by inflation.
<P>
	Where does the federal government spend its money? The 
first part of spending, the discretionary part, the part that 
government can change, is in a variety of government services. 
It is about $43 billion of services to operate government and 
various programs other than social program spending.
<P>
	The social program spending makes up almost half of the total 
spending. The social program spending of about $80 billion per 
year along with other government services of about $43 billion 
per year make up all of the discretionary spending. The rest of 
the spending is interest payments, almost $40 billion a year in 
interest payments. To continue to carry the debt there is no 
discretion on spending in this area.
<P>
	Interest payments can only decrease if the debt decreases. 
This large chunk, almost a quarter of total spending made up of 
interest payments is making it extremely difficult to fund our 
social programs. If we are going to maintain these programs, 
clearly we are going to have to stop adding to the debt. We are 
going to have to  spend less on providing social programs in a 
way that is acceptable to Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	When I am talking about social programs I am talking mainly 
about old age security, the Canada pension plan, payments that 
go to compensate or to carry people through unemployment and 
the child tax benefits. These are called program payments to 
persons.
<P>
	The other portion of federal government spending is transfers 
to provinces. The transfers to provinces go to cover welfare. 
Established programs financing also covers health, advanced 
education and equalization payments.
<P>
	Just before I get into the area I want to talk most about, which 
is old age security, I would just like to talk a little bit about 
equalization payments.
<P>
	Equalization payments are meant to transfer money from the 
wealthy provinces, the so-called have provinces, to the have not 
provinces. How many have provinces are there in Canada? What 
would you guess, six or seven? No, there are three have 
provinces when it comes to calculating equalization payments. 
They are British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario. Ontario is 
getting very close to the line. In fact, two years ago part way 
through the year it appeared it had become a have not province 
under the calculations. Three provinces are paying and seven 
receiving. Who receives? All of the other seven receive. But the 
interesting thing is that Quebec, the fourth wealthiest province 
receives by far the largest portion of equalization payments.
<P>
	I would like to spend the rest of my time talking about old age 
security. Old age security is the universal pension program 
which is made up of three separate programs. First is the old age 
pension which makes up about $14 billion per year in federal 
government spending. The second area is guaranteed income 
supplement, about $4 billion per year. These figures are for 
1992-93. The third area is spousal allowance, which is half a 
billion dollars a year.
<P>
	When people saw these figures on the overheads I used during 
my presentations over the past week, they looked at that half a 
billion dollars as nothing compared to the rest. When they 
thought of it as $500 million they realized it was not 
insignificant. Spousal allowance made up that other half a 
billion dollars. The total on old age security spending is about 
$19 billion a year.
<P>
	Before I get into my presentation on old age security and other 
pensions, I would like to set the stage. A couple of points that I 
brought out really shocked people who were at these meetings. 
Again we are talking about the reality of the present situation in 
social program spending and what is going to happen as the 
population ages over the next years.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7956"> 7956 </A></B>
<P>
	As a percentage of Canada's population, the increase is from 
about 7 per cent in 1951 to an increase of almost 23 per cent by 
2030. I would like Canadians to think about this. Are there any 
of you who are on pensions? Or any of you who will be on 
pensions if we are around a few years down the road? I would 
like you to think about these funny looking kids with the baggy 
pants. You know the kind of pants, they hang halfway down. Do 
you want to depend on these funny looking kids to provide your 
pension in the future? That is exactly what we are counting on.
<P>
	On the other hand these funny looking kids are not stupid. Let 
us look at the other side. These funny looking kids are very 
intelligent. These are the kids who are going to have to pick up 
the huge debt we are continually building and laying at their 
feet. Do you think these funny looking kids in the baggy pants 
are going to be so stupid as to pay the debt down and as well 
continue the pension, especially considering the fact that in 
1951 there were about 14 working Canadians to pay for every 
person on a pension. By 2030 there will be only two working 
Canadians to pay for each person on pension. Do you think these 
kids with the funny looking pants are going to be willing to pay 
the full debt we have built and pay for our pensions? I would 
suggest not. These funny looking kids are smart and 
unfortunately we have laid an unfair burden at their feet.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	That was old age security. I will quickly lay out a few points in 
regard to the Canada pension plan. First, this plan is now funded 
by a 5 per cent payroll tax. The Canada pension plan pays about 
25 per cent of former salary up to about $8,000 per year. The 
Canada pension plan currently pays out about $13 billion per 
year.
<P>
	The sad thing is that right now the Canada pension plan fund is 
about $500 billion short. The accrued liability is about $500 
billion and this $500 billion does not show up in the government 
figures when it is talking about debt? This is another debt on top 
of the federal and provincial governments debts. This is an 
incredible amount and is going to be very difficult to deal with.
<P>
	To sustain the Canada pension plan, for which the funding is 
now about 5 per cent, year to year we would have to pay off the 
top about 13 per cent of earnings. Every Canadian would pay off 
the top about 13 per cent of earnings by the year 2040 just to 
sustain the plan.
<P>
	As I wind down today I would like to talk a little bit about the 
need to build incentive into our social program spending and the 
key role that reintroducing incentives will play in making these 
plans manageable and sustainable.
<P>
	I was at a farmer's place over this past week and he talked 
about how he offered a big part of a field which was cultivated to 
people who were on welfare in the town. He advertised it around 
town. He has done a lot of work with people on welfare and is 
very concerned about them. He offered this land to these people 
at no cost.  How many do you think came out and took advantage 
of his offer? None.
<P>
	He planted the garden, took care of it, and when it was harvest 
time he went to the people on welfare and told them they could 
go out and take what they wanted from the garden. How much 
produce do you think they took from the garden? The answer is 
absolutely zero.
<P>
	We need incentives. There has to be incentive in a system to 
make sure that people who are receiving money are only those 
who need the money.
<P>
	Look at what has happened with unemployment insurance 
over the past few years. The unemployment insurance rate has 
fluctuated but over time it has continued on an upward trend. 
The interesting thing is that when you look at unemployment 
insurance and you compare it to the consumer price index you 
will find that the consumer price index has not gone up nearly as 
fast as the unemployment insurance payments have.
<P>
	What is the incentive for people who are looking at pensions? 
For unemployment insurance, for welfare, we know what kind 
of incentives we can put in place. It was very encouraging that at 
these meetings people who are on pension said they knew that 
maybe it was fair that they should take a cut in pension if they 
could afford it. Philosophically, I have a problem with that. But 
these pensioners said they were willing to make that sacrifice. 
The people who made the point with me the best are those who 
were veterans. At the ceremony on November 11 and at the 50th 
anniversary ceremonies over the past year veterans have been 
the people who have impressed me with their sacrifice and their 
commitment.
<P>
	The wife of a veteran at one of our meetings said: ``You mean 
my husband fought to preserve this country and I sacrificed in 
the war effort to preserve the country and now, rather than the 
enemy from without destroying our country, the enemy from 
within will destroy our country?'' She was saddened by this and 
so was I.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Lincoln, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to make 
a few comments. I understand the member had meetings in his 
riding and that he said he had difficulty preparing his 
constituents for the massive cuts. He also mentioned that 
governments have developed an attitude problem.
<P>
	I suggest to the hon. member the present government's 
attitude is positive and inclusive. In fact the green paper really 
provides Canadians with an opportunity to participate in the 
reform of these social programs. The process itself has been to 
address the inefficiencies of the social security system so that 
we can protect those who are most vulnerable and provide every 
opportunity for Canadians to experience the dignity of work.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7957"> 7957 </A></B>
<P>
	The hon. member mentioned his farmer's offer. This is a good 
reason to look again at these social programs so we can look at 
the incentives and disincentives. I had a workshop this past 
Sunday where constituents in my riding of Lincoln pointed out 
some inefficiencies. One of them was that government must 
remove the disincentives to work.
<P>
	We need to stop duplicating training programs. We need to 
look at more effective ways to have different levels of 
government work together. The member's whole talk was about 
spending cuts. This whole process of social security reform is to 
look at aspects of that program that may not be working 
efficiently.
<P>
	Canadians have an opportunity to provide solutions and look 
at these inefficiencies. The member must agree with the process 
in having Canadians speak to these inefficiencies. It is only one 
aspect of government we are talking about here today. We 
certainly have an overall objective of meeting our target of 3 per 
cent of GDP. I would like to hear some comments. The member 
is talking about massive cuts. The purpose of this whole reform 
is to give Canadians an opportunity to speak to the inefficiencies 
of social security reform.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments and 
question from the hon. member. I would like to start with a little 
point of clarification. The hon. member said that I had difficulty 
preparing constituents for cuts. That is not the case at all. In fact 
they recognized the need for these cuts because they know that is 
the only way these social programs can be preserved. That was 
not the problem.
<P>
	It was not a problem but it was very difficult for me and 
painful for them to lay the situation out, having them realize 
there is no other place to make the cuts other than in social 
program spending and in other areas of federal government 
spending. In other areas $10 billion would be about the 
maximum. It would be very difficult to cut $10 billion from the 
$43 billion in other spending.
<P>
	That means there have to be spending cuts of between $12 
billion and $16 billion from social program spending. I was 
asking them as they went along: ``Does this make sense to you?'' 
They told me: ``Yes, we know this has to happen and your 
presentation has really made it that much more clear, especially 
in regard to the aging population and the number of people on 
pension''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine DubÃ© (LÃ©vis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened as the 
hon. member from the Reform Party outlined his party policy 
and we heard the government member's argument in reply. Of 
course, we have a position of our own, a third position. We agree 
in part with what was just said in reply about the need to proceed 
cautiously instead of cutting blindly.
<P>
	The hon. member says that we should think about the future of 
Canadian youth, so that they can find jobs and eventually 
contribute to the pension fund. I am in full  agreement with him 
on the objective, but I do not think that blind cuts are the right 
way to go about it. I think we should be looking at job 
development, joint action and regional development policies 
instead. To provide employment, that is what it boils down to in 
the end.
<P>
	Cuts are necessary, but I think that we should look to cut in 
other programs, not in social programs. As a member from the 
Reform Party indicated, you do not eliminate unemployment by 
eliminating unemployment insurance. Some solutions may be 
too drastic. As if the unemployed were responsible for their 
misfortune.
<P>
	So, I would like the hon. member to comment on my general 
remarks. As today's debate draws to an end, I wanted to raise a 
somewhat conflicting view.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, when the hon. opposition member 
talks about blind cuts, I agree with him. This is not the time for 
blind cuts. That is why as Reformers we have been going across 
our constituencies and across the country. We are presenting 
several different options.
<P>
	I also presented the government's discussion paper. People's 
comments on it were: ``Where are the options?'' We have one or 
two options in most areas at best and they are only to discuss. 
Reform presented a series of possible options.
<P>
	Blind cuts, no. We presented a real picture to the people in our 
constituencies. That is what I did in my constituency. Then we 
presented options and were saying: ``You tell us where you want 
the cuts to come from''. No blind cuts. I could not agree more.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 5.30 p.m. the 
House will now proceed to the consideration of Private 
Members' Business as listed on today's Order Paper.

	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the Parliament and crown agencies should 
be subject to scrutiny under the Access to Information Act.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise today 
to talk to my Motion No. 304 which argues that Parliament and 
crown agencies should be subject to scrutiny under the Access to 
Information Act.
<P>
	This topic is one which is of vital interest to Canadians and 
because of its importance Motion No. 304 was made a votable 
item. This will give members of Parliament a great opportunity 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7958"> 7958 </A></B>
<P>
to go on the public record to show that they care about opening 
up the political system and that they think our citizens should 
have the right to use the Access to Information Act in a more 
modern and inclusive way than is currently possible.
<P>
	The motion is not a partisan political football which Reform is 
bringing forward to make life tough for the government. In fact 
we very much hope the government and official opposition will 
see the motion as one which is constructive and in the greater 
interest of all Canadians.
<P>
	As we all know, under the nine-year Tory regime Canadians 
desperately wanted a more accountable and transparent 
government. The wishes of the people were dashed by the 
Mulroney and Campbell governments whose grossly 
unaccountable behaviour caused public cynicism to grow to an 
all time high.
<P>
	Compounding this frustration billions of tax dollars were 
funnelled through crown agencies such as the CBC, Canada Post 
and the Canadian Wheat Board which were even less 
accountable than the government. At least we could vote the 
Tories out of office but crown agencies are another matter 
altogether.
<P>
	As long as crown agencies are going to be run in the way they 
are, Canadians deserve to know what they are up to. Obviously 
sensitive information that is vital to their ability to compete in 
the marketplace would be exempt under the provisions of the 
Access to Information Act. More general information about 
their spending and business practices should be fair game. As 
crown agencies all Canadians have a stake in how they are run. 
Therefore they must be subject to public scrutiny.
<P>
	All this I say by way of introduction. I am saying that 
Canadians are facing a problem. It is summed up by a quote from 
the public policy forum of 1993 which stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Given the sustained and often angry criticism that has been widely expressed 
by the public in recent years, it is remarkable how little has been done by way 
of reform.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Of all the grounds on which successive governments, together with MPs, 
could be charged with being unresponsive, none is more striking than the lack 
of response to unmistakable expressions of public dislike of the manner in 
which Parliament goes about its business.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	I believe this statement is an accurate reflection of what 
Canadians are thinking. I also believe this line of logic can be 
extended to their perceptions about crown corporations. 
Therefore I have suggested that Motion No. 304 be adopted by 
the House to send a clear sign from Gander to Victoria that the 
Parliament of the Tories is gone and a truly new day has broken.
<P>
	Gone are the days when back room politics were acceptable. 
Gone are the days when Canadians would remain quiet as 
politicians and crown agencies acted unilaterally and without 
accountability. I hope that Motion No. 304 will give members of 
Parliament a clear opportunity to break with the old way of 
doing things and show they care about the wishes of the 
Canadian public.
<P>
	As we are well aware, Reformers were elected to open up the 
political process and seek out greater involvement from the 
Canadian grassroots. We want to bring about constructive 
change and ensure that our political institutions and crown 
agencies operate with honesty and integrity.
<P>
	I do not think we are alone, however, in calling for these 
changes. I am certainly aware that the Liberals found the same 
matters to be very important at least while they were in 
opposition. I would only hope to believe that their desire for 
openness, accountability and integrity is still intact.
<P>
	Let me remind our Liberal friends about the values which they 
claimed to believe in during the election campaign. To do this I 
think I will quote from the red book since it is often referred to 
by my friends in government on the other side. The following 
are a number of statements which make their position crystal 
clear. The first statement reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Canadians have always prided themselves on the quality of their democratic 
institutions-If government is to play a positive role in society, as it must, 
honesty and integrity in our political institutions must be restored.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The second statement reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The most important asset of government is the confidence it enjoys of the 
citizens to whom it is accountable. There is evidence today of considerable 
dissatisfaction with government and a steady erosion of confidence in the 
people and institutions of the public sector.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	These statements are all from the red book. The last statement 
reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A Liberal government will take a series of initiatives to restore confidence in 
the institutions of government. We will introduce reforms to Parliament-Open 
government will be the watchword of the Liberal program.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Clearly the Liberal position must approve of the spirit of this 
motion. Motion No. 304 is precisely the type of initiative that 
will restore the confidence of Canadians. I implore members of 
the Liberal caucus to consult with their House leader and whip to 
confirm that they should all stand behind the motion 100 per 
cent.
<P>
	Over the coming months I look forward to speaking 
personally with my colleagues on the government side and in the 
Bloc. I encourage any member to call my office to let me know 
so that we can work together on this proposal.
<P>
	Reform members of Parliament such as myself do not need to 
always find a fight. While we will never agree with members of 
the government on all accounts, on issues such as this one where 
there is a natural alliance I think we should co-operate. In fact if 
we take this co-operative approach it will go further still toward 
restoring the confidence of Canadians that Parliament is truly 
undergoing constructive change to make it more accountable, 
transparent and responsive to the wishes of the electorate.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7959"> 7959 </A></B>
<P>
	If I can move on to members of the BQ, while you do not have 
a red book to quote from I know that openness, integrity and 
accountability are important to you as well. As I have sat in the 
House for the past year I have witnessed your complaints about 
the secretive and unresponsive government on many occasions.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I hesitate to interrupt the 
member, but I would like to remind members of the House to 
direct their comments through the chair and not in such an 
informal and familiar way as to use ``you'' and ``your''.
<P>
<B>(1740 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would simply make 
them aware that they have talked about these crown corporations 
and crown agencies. I know they are concerned about the veil of 
secrecy that seems to enshroud them.
<P>
	The desire of the people of Quebec for open and accountable 
institutions is just as great as in Alberta, Ontario, the maritimes, 
or for that matter anywhere else. I would therefore ask members 
of the Bloc to join us in supporting Motion No. 304. I am sure it 
is one example where they will not get in trouble for voting with 
the Reform Party.
<P>
	Let me just quote briefly from the 1991-92 annual report of 
the information commissioner to further illustrate my point. The 
information commissioner wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The access law has attained a maturity of political whim. It is a law which 
cuts across and goes beyond party politics. It should appeal as much to the 
conservative as to the liberal or the social democrat. The Access to Information 
Act is ideologically neutral, without party coloration.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Conservatives who worry about the state growing too powerful should 
applaud the empowerment, that indispensable trendy word, of the individual by 
information rights; liberals and socialists in Parliament and elsewhere will 
welcome the sharing of the government's information better to challenge those 
in authority and effect changes in society.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In my speech I have tried to express the universal nature of the 
motion to expand the Access to Information Act. This is not a 
partisan bill. I firmly believe we can get all party support for the 
motion. If we get this support we will send a strong, positive 
message of change to the people of the country. The people of 
Canada are waiting. It is time for us to act.
<P>
	Now that the House has heard my speech on unity and the 
universality of the motion, I want to talk a bit about the Access 
to Information Act in case people have some concern that we are 
trying to open up everything and cause the system not to work 
any longer.
<P>
	To quote from the act, its purpose is to extend the ``laws of 
Canada to provide a right of access to information in records 
under the control of a government institution in accordance with 
the principles that government information should be available 
to the public''.
<P>
	For those of my colleagues who may worry about the 
consequences of extending the act to Parliament, I assure them 
this would not force members to open up their own private files 
on constituency business or matters relating to their positions in 
their respective parties.
<P>
	The motion would allow the opening of the business of the 
House to public scrutiny. This would include financial matters 
which are currently handled by our respected Speaker of the 
House, the expenditures of the Senate, the Sergeant-at-Arms 
and the Black Rod.
<P>
	For example, the House will be undergoing a 12-year 
renovation projected to cost over $250 million. This kind of 
expenditure is massive so the details surrounding the contracts 
and spending should be available to the public. Certainly 
reading some recently published books about government 
contracts being handed out will make that more of a 
consideration for the public.
<P>
	While I am certain the Speaker of the House will do 
everything in his power to make sure that the renovation goes 
properly, all Canadians will feel better about the project and 
those like it if they have access to documents. If citizens know 
they are getting the straight goods they may just begin to trust us 
a little more.
<P>
	For members concerned that extending the scope of the 
Access to Information Act will be too much of a good thing, I 
point out a comment of the information commissioner who 
wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Of course access to rights are not absolute. They are subject to specific and 
limited exemptions, balancing freedom of information against individual 
privacy, commercial confidentiality, national security and the frank 
communications needed for effective policy making''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This limitation would apply to Motion No. 304. Any members 
of this House who are concerned that they would somehow be 
opening up Pandora's box by voting for this motion should rest 
assured. In fact those who are particularly nervous about 
exposing themselves to an unreasonable amount of crime need 
only look through the Access to Information Act itself. They 
will find there are a full 16 pages of exemptions which will 
guarantee that their legitimate right will not be breached.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	Nonetheless Canadians need to know that they do have the 
right to ask certain questions. These questions are not only 
legitimate but they are essential to the proper working of our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7960"> 7960 </A></B>
<P>
democracy. Beyond this, if there is clarification which is 
required as to the exact implications of M-304, I am certain that 
the parliamentary justice committee which is responsible for 
this would do an excellent job.
<P>
	As members can see, there is no reason to be concerned about 
this motion and every reason to expect that it will be exactly the 
kind of initiative that the Canadian people have been waiting for 
from this Parliament.
<P>
	I would like to conclude by once again referring to the words 
of the information commissioner in the 1991-92 annual report 
who made an interesting point that I think all parliamentarians 
should listen to. He said: ``The Access to Information Act lacks 
visible champions of openness in Parliament. It matters not 
whether parliamentary access advocates come from either 
government or opposition benches. Preferably they should come 
from both sides of the House and, in particular, from the 
members of the justice and solicitor general committee. The 
information commissioner is a voice from the outside. 
Parliament should have some inside voices preaching for and 
defending the access to rights. A note to members of the next 
Parliament'', and that is us, ``anyone looking to be identified 
with a good issue should consider freedom of information. Any 
such champions will quickly receive attention''.
<P>
	I am asking all members here to get behind an act like this and 
a motion like this. This basically, above all, is going to send that 
message of openness, accountability, and transparency that all 
of us have been talking about and working toward.
<P>
	One other thing the hon. member gives me as an example, if I 
can just add one more piece to this as I think I do have another 
minute or so.
<P>
	Talking about access to information, I have just received 
information from the hon. member for Calgary Centre. Last 
night he was told about a meeting in Kingston and the Islands 
which 65 people attended. Five were media, 30 per cent were 
anglophones and 70 per cent were francophones. They were 
curious and interested in Reform. They were fed up with the 
over-government of the PCs and are now fed up with the 
under-government currently being offered by the Liberals.
<P>
	As a point of information, the first Reform meeting held by 
the member for Edmonton Southwest only had 11 people and 
today he is a member of Parliament.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (St. Paul's, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to address this motion. I am pleased the hon. member for 
Red Deer so vigorously supports the principles exemplified by 
the Access to Information Act that he wishes to see its coverage 
expanded. Such enthusiasm is to be commended.
<P>
	I am happy to say that this government remains firmly 
committed to the principles of openness contained in the Access 
to Information Act. Such openness assists in debate on national 
issues, provides background for the development of public 
policy and allows more in depth explanation of government 
processes and decision making.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This is why our government is always prepared to look at 
ways to improve public access to information held by these 
Crown agencies, this in order to promote government 
accountability. Currently, the legislation applies to government 
institutions listed in the schedule to the act. If a department, an 
agency or a board is not mentioned in the schedule, the 
legislation does not apply to it. It is that simple.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	At the time the act was passed in 1982 there was careful 
consideration given to which institutions should be included in 
the coverage of the act and which should not. There are ways in 
which the act could be updated to reflect the new information 
age. It may also be that the sorting of the institutions into the 
categories of those covered and those not covered could also be 
reviewed and updated. I do not believe that this is something 
which should be done in a casual or haphazard manner.
<P>
	In considering the suggestion that the Access to Information 
Act be expanded to cover Parliament and crown agencies, as 
with all proposals for amendment to the Access to Information 
Act, the government is guided by the need to ensure that all 
amendments to the act and to its schedule are in the public 
interest.
<P>
	While on the face of it providing access to government-held 
information may be seen as obviously in the public interest it is 
not necessarily the case. If it were the Access to Information Act 
would contain no exclusions or exemptions. We would just 
throw the information doors wide open.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	There are competing public interests which must be taken into 
consideration. In the same way that exceptions serve public 
interest by protecting personal information on taxpayers, or 
information received in confidence from our government, it 
may be in the public interest to protect some information held by 
Crown agencies or by Parliament.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We must consider these competing interests before making 
such a sweeping recommendation.
<P>
	When the motion refers to crown agencies it is unclear 
whether the term should be taken to refer to crown corporations 
or if it is intended to include a much broader range of 
institutions. After all many institutions which would normally 
fall under the heading of crown agencies are already covered by 
the act. CIDA, the Canadian International Development 
Agency, is already covered, as are national museums, the 
Federal Business Development Bank, the Space Agency, the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, and so on. On the other 
hand the act does 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7961"> 7961 </A></B>
<P>
not currently apply to Canada Post or the National Arts Centre 
Corporation. We cannot assume  that these were frivolous 
decisions as to who was included and who was excluded.
<P>
	When considering expanding the coverage of the Access to 
Information Act to crown corporations the concern for a long 
time now has been that making all crown corporations subject to 
the act could for some of them result in harm to their 
competitive position relative to their private sector counterparts 
which are of course subject to no comparative requirements for 
openness. The hon. member for Red Deer alluded to this.
<P>
	What might be required to mitigate such potential for harm 
would be additional amendments to the act which would provide 
crown corporations with an exemption tailor-made to protect 
information that if disclosed would result in injury to the 
competitive position of the crown corporation. The private 
sector corporations have such an exemption to protect 
commercially sensitive information in the financial information 
that they are presently required to file and no less protection 
should be provided to crown corporations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	While expanding the act to cover crown corporations is not a 
bad idea in itself, it must be examined in its proper context. In 
fact, the whole framework of the act must be examined from that 
perspective.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	If the motion is intended to cover a broader range of 
institutions then careful consideration must be given to the 
implications for each type and for each institution. There is not 
enough room for that in the motion.
<P>
	Much the same thing can be said concerning the suggestion 
that the act be expanded to cover Parliament. While in principle 
this is a laudable idea there are more than a few practical issues 
to consider. Just what coverage would the act have? When this 
issue was considered previously it was generally believed that it 
would be unwise to cover the personal offices of members of the 
House of Commons and senators but I think Canadians want to 
understand why that is.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The problems which could result from a decision to include 
the offices of MP's in the coverage of the act will have to be 
taken into consideration before such a measure can be taken. On 
the other hand, if members' offices are not to be covered by the 
act, then we will have to define very explicitly the precise scope 
of the act.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Where would responsibility for the application of the act by 
Parliament lie? Who would be considered to be the head of the 
institution for the purposes of the act with the authority to 
release requested information or deny access on the basis of 
exemptions contained in the act? If there was a complaint 
concerning the handling of a request made to Parliament under 
the act would it be a conflict of interest for the information 
commissioner as a parliamentary agent to investigate such a 
complaint?  Would Parliament report to itself on its own 
administration of the act? These are not simple questions.
<P>
<B>(1755 ) </B>
<P>
	When considering possible amendments to the Access to 
Information Act or its schedule of institutions, consideration 
would also normally be given to the Privacy Act and its schedule 
of institutions.
<P>
	Generally speaking, there are more government institutions 
covered by the Privacy Act than the Access to Information Act 
since the principle of providing individuals with access to their 
own personal information is seen as even more widely 
applicable than the principle of open access to general 
information.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	If we were to extend the application of the Privacy Act to 
Crown corporations, it seems that there would be less obvious 
risk of harming the institutions' competitive position.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the case of Parliament there remains the question of 
whether the Privacy Act would cover the personnel records 
contained in the offices of members and senators. It is clear that 
it would be beneficial for employees of the House and the 
Senate. Even in relation to the Privacy Act it is clear that 
expanding the coverage of the act must not be done in a 
haphazard manner but must be done in full consideration of the 
public interest in the possible outcome.
<P>
	To summarize, while the idea of expanding the coverage of 
the Access to Information Act to Parliament and to crown 
agencies is surely based on a concept of openness which this 
government wholeheartedly supports, the practical implications 
of such an expansion of coverage cannot be disregarded.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	For now, the most logical solution would be to keep these 
suggestions in reserve so that they can be considered as part of 
another process to amend the act for which the Minister of 
Justice and the President of the Treasury Board will initiate 
consultations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	At that point every member will have the opportunity to make 
suggestions for amendments to either the Access to Information 
Act or the Privacy Act or both. Possible amendments to these 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7962"> 7962 </A></B>
<P>
acts will be open to full debate as pieces of an amendment 
package instead of as a separate patchwork proposal.
<P>
	We do not wish to interfere in that process or to prejudge any 
of its outcome. We want the Canadian people to have input into 
this process.
<P>
	All this is to say that while I very much support the principle 
which I believe lies behind this motion, I cannot support the 
motion itself at this time.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
on behalf of the Official Opposition, I have the pleasure to speak 
on this motion from the member for Red Deer:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the Parliament and Crown Agencies 
should be subject to scrutiny under the Access to Information Act.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I must say to the member for Red Deer that in his speech, he of 
course mentioned that his objectives were similar to those of the 
Bloc and the Official Opposition. Yes, this is in line with our 
objectives of openness and clarity in the management of public 
affairs and it is also in line with the taxpayers' right to know, as 
it is called in a democracy.
<P>
	Remember that the Access to Information Act was passed in 
1982 and implemented the following year. This law gives a right 
to access federal government documents. Under it, government 
institutions must make their documents available. However, 
there are exceptions to access to information. For various 
reasons that I want to deal with in this speech today, several 
Crown corporations like farm product marketing boards, the 
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, government bodies like the 
House of Commons, the Senate, the Library of Parliament, 
office holders who report directly to Parliament such as the 
Chief Returning Officer, the Commissioner of Official 
Languages and the Auditor General are not subject to the Access 
to Information Act.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois deeply believes that in a democratic 
system, public affairs must be conducted as openly as possible. 
Nevertheless, the everyday reality of running the affairs of state 
shows us that any system of access to information must balance 
various divergent interests.
<P>
	On the one hand, the government must be accountable to the 
voters for what it does, as is the case in all western democracies, 
so that these voters can evaluate the government for its 
achievements, integrity and honesty. On the other hand, we 
agree that in reality some affairs of state must remain 
confidential.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	This confidentiality was recognized in the exceptions listed in 
the Privacy Act and the Access to Information Act. These laws 
protect information whose confidentiality is crucial to the 
security and integrity of territory under state jurisdiction.
<P>
	These laws also protect private interests related to personal 
and commercial information. A Crown corporation like the CBC 
should, in our opinion, be subject to the Access to Information 
Act, but there should be some exemptions because otherwise 
competitors could benefit, thus threatening this corporation's 
commercial balance.
<P>
	Atomic Energy of Canada is another glaring example. How 
could this agency be subject to scrutiny under the Access to 
Information Act, when the Canadian government stubbornly 
promotes the development of such a dangerous and polluting 
energy source? For the current government, certainly not. But it 
should be possible in the name of quality of life and the 
environment.
<P>
	As we can see, the problem underlying any system aimed at 
opening up public administration goes far beyond the motion 
tabled by the hon. member for Red Deer. It is not enough to say, 
as stated in the motion, that the Parliament and Crown Agencies 
should be subject to scrutiny under the Access to Information 
Act. As we have seen, the issue is twofold: how to improve the 
right to know while strengthening privacy measures.
<P>
	On the other hand, arguing that the Canadian Parliament 
should not be subject to the Access to Information Act, as this 
institution is a symbol of democracy in the Canadian federal 
system, would be questionable.
<P>
	Committed as it is to the principles of democracy and to 
promoting increased transparency in the present system, the 
Bloc Quebecois just has to support the report tabled in March 
1987 in which the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal 
Affairs recommended that the Access to Information Act apply 
to all federal institutions, including administrative tribunals, the 
Senate and the House of Commons. The Bloc lays particular 
emphasis on the need for much transparency, in the other place 
in particular, because, as I am on record as saying in this House, 
the public must be allowed to scrutinize the wild imaginings of a 
body that is undemocratic because non-elected.
<P>
	Incidentally, one wonders about the need for an organization 
like the Board of Internal Economy of the House of Commons 
-and this is another important example- to be subject to 
public scrutiny under the Access to Information Act, since such 
a provision promotes in no way better democratic process or 
greater transparency in this institution.
<P>
	To conclude, the Bloc Quebecois agrees with the essence of 
Motion 304 and is in favour of the Access to Information Act 
applying to every government institution funded from the public 
purse. The main goal, as far as we are concerned, is to promote 
accessibility and transparency throughout the Canadian federal 
administration, and given the political climate that has set in 
within the federation since the 1970s, when the Liberal Party of 
Canada was in power, we emphasize the  need to establish as a 
mater of urgency this openness, this transparency that the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7963"> 7963 </A></B>
<P>
Liberals themselves praise so much in quoting from their red 
book all the time.
<P>
	So, let us act and implement a real access to information 
legislation, a meaningful legislation that reflects a justice and 
truth-conscious democracy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure today to speak to this 
motion put forth by my Reform colleague, the hon. member for 
Red Deer.
<P>
	Since its introduction just over 10 years ago, the Access to 
Information Act has had a tremendous effect in opening up 
government. Government has been forced to be much more 
careful in the way it conducts business not only by the Access to 
Information Act but the Privacy Act as well. These two pieces of 
legislation have probably made for more open and honest 
government than any other government proclamation.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	Countless scandals have been uncovered through the Access 
to Information Act. Questionable contracts, leases and 
patronage appointments have all been uncovered through this 
legislation. The legislation has given substance to some 
accusations letting the whole country see what really transpired 
in some questionable deals.
<P>
	One might even suggest that the very make up of the House of 
Commons is due in part to the access legislation. Scandal after 
scandal in the previous government was uncovered or confirmed 
by this legislation. The public's contempt for the previous 
administration's lack of honesty and integrity was the main 
reason that party was reduced to only two seats in this House. It 
is a legacy that all members of this House have to live with. 
Respect for politicians is extremely low. It is up to the members 
of this Parliament to regain that respect.
<P>
	The one thing I constantly hear from my constituents is that I 
must strive to make government more accountable. We have to 
open up the political process and show Canadians that we really 
are working on their behalf. We do this by making government 
as transparent as possible. We must start with our own House.
<P>
	The mere fact that the operations of Parliament are exempt 
from the Access to Information Act gives the public the 
perception that we are trying to hide something. The 35th 
Parliament has taken some steps to be more open. The fact that 
the minutes of the meetings of the Board of Internal Economy 
are now being published is a move in the right direction.
<P>
	We have to ensure that Parliament is not only conducting its 
business in an appropriate manner, but that it is seen to be 
conducting itself in an appropriate manner. By making 
Parliament itself accountable to the Access to Information Act, 
the public would no longer have to speculate what we are hiding.
<P>
	Yes, taxpayers may be outraged about the extent that they are 
subsidizing the parliamentary dining room. If they are outraged, 
they would have every right to be. After all, it is their money. If 
we cannot justify the subsidy to the dining room, or any other 
perk that we receive, then perhaps we should not be receiving it. 
If, on the other hand, we believe the taxpayers are getting good 
value for their money then we should not be embarrassed to 
receive it. Either way we should not be denying the Canadian 
taxpayers the opportunity to learn how we are spending their 
money.
<P>
	Some may suggest that we as parliamentarians would be 
sacrificing the confidentiality of our constituents by making our 
information available under access to information. In fact, the 
confidentiality of our files would be protected as our files would 
be exempt. The Privacy Act provides a great deal of protection 
by ensuring that the access request cannot be used to obtain 
information about individuals. However the way we conduct our 
business should and must be made available to the public. It is 
the only way that we can try and regain some of the respect for 
our position.
<P>
	Another complaint I frequently receive from my constituents 
is about how their money is spent by crown corporations. Crown 
corporations claim that their competitiveness would be 
adversely affected if they were required to respond to access 
requests. Competitiveness is a legitimate concern.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board should not have to reveal in 
advance what it projects its buying and selling rates are going to 
be. This information would be of tremendous benefit to its 
competitors in foreign lands and would end up putting Canadian 
farmers at a severe disadvantage. The act calls for a specific 
exemption for information of a competitive nature and this data 
would not have to be released in any event.
<P>
	Let us look at a couple of different examples starting with 
Canada Post. A number of my constituents were concerned 
about their subsidizing the courier facility with revenue from 
their mail delivery. They believe that Canada Post would be able 
to undercut the rates charged by other courier companies 
because of this subsidy. Access to information would let 
Canadians know if this is what Canada Post would be doing. 
However, it is possible that Canada Post would be able to declare 
a competitiveness exemption. The question arises, should this 
be allowed? I think the question could best be answered by the 
access commissioner, and he should be able to respond to it. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7964"> 7964 </A></B>
<P>
However he needs the mandate and this motion would provide 
him exactly with that.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	In a similar situation, officials at CTV recently questioned the 
validity of CBC bidding on major events. Does the $1 billion 
taxpayer subsidy permit CBC to outbid private broadcasters for 
such events? Should CBC's competitors be allowed to utilize 
access legislation to look at CBC's books?
<P>
	Some questions about access to information requests as they 
pertain to crown corporations are easy to respond to. Canadians 
should have an unfettered right to determine if any government 
department, agency or crown corporation is wasting taxpayers' 
money.
<P>
	Should Canadians be able to decide if the CBC is spending too 
much of their money on a top heavy bureaucracy? Yes, no 
question. Should CBC be able to declare an exemption on the 
basis of competitiveness? Perhaps, but these types of requests 
can always be resolved by the independent access 
commissioner.
<P>
	If this Parliament is to recapture a measure of respect lost by 
past wrongdoings it must make every effort to provide 
accountability and transparency in government. This will only 
occur if we can convince Canadians that we have nothing to 
hide. Let us start with making our own house open to the people 
who pay the bills, the Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	I call upon all members of this House to support this motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to address this motion proposed by the 
hon. member for Red Deer.
<P>
	The objective of seeking ways to make government 
operations more open and accountable to Canadian citizens is a 
very good one. The hon. member is to be congratulated for 
bringing this motion before the House. This idea is something 
that should be pursued vigorously by all members of this House. 
As the previous speaker said, accountability is something we 
need more of and something the Canadian public wants more of.
<P>
	In fact the Liberal Party's policy as stated in ``Creating 
Opportunities'' otherwise known as the red book, is to promote 
more open and accountable government. This is a promise all 
members of government are taking very seriously and are 
striving to implement in various ways.
<P>
	As I have said, I agree with the objectives that motivated the 
member for Red Deer to propose this motion. However, I have 
three main concerns.
<P>
	The first is that I believe the Access to Information Act should 
be given a complete review. The best way to do this is to let the 
Minister of Justice proceed with his publicly stated plans to do 
this. Second, I am concerned that the motion suggests that this 
House thinks the most important reform that can be made is to 
make more institutions subject to the present act rather than 
changing the present act to create greater access to  information 
from institutions already subject to the act. The third area is that 
the motion is perhaps a little too vague in certain areas.
<P>
	I want to explain each one of the three areas because I think 
they are important. This subject matter is of very great 
importance. It is one all members should hold the government to 
be accountable for in this Parliament.
<P>
	Since this act was created in 1982 there have been two 
information commissioners who have made numerous 
recommendations for reforms to the act. There was a 1986 
parliamentary committee report entitled: ``Open and Shut'', a 
1987 response from the former government called: ``Steps 
Ahead'', many court cases and a lot of administrative 
experience with this act.
<P>
<B>(1815 ) </B>
<P>
	In addition, many institutions have adopted access legislation 
in recent years. The first was in Nova Scotia in 1977. Since then 
the federal government, as we have stated, the governments of 
Newfoundland, New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, 
Saskatchewan, British Columbia and the Yukon have all adopted 
access legislation. Alberta's access law is waiting to be 
proclaimed. Outside Canada, Australia and New Zealand have 
recently adopted access legislation and the United States 
amended its freedom of information act in 1986.
<P>
	In addition to various access laws being adopted, the federal 
government has issued a blueprint for improving government 
services with new technologies. There is an Information 
Highway Advisory Council. One of the advisory council's 
subcommittees is called access and social impacts. Access to 
information must be considered in light of past experience and 
the new technologies that are before us today.
<P>
	Given all of this activity on recent issues, it is important that 
we ensure full consideration is given to the various 
recommendations in recent years and experiences under the 
access laws.
<P>
	We also need to call on the collective experiences of federal 
government officials in determining the lessons to be learned 
from the first decade of experience with the act and from other 
jurisdictions.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice stated in a media interview last July 
that he believes the act is in need of an overhaul. He stated 
unequivocally that it reflects the state of the art of the 
mid-1970s rather than the 1990s. To me this is quite a 
commentary from the Minister of Justice on this act. He says 
there is a need to catch up with new technologies and a need for 
more openness.
<P>
	We should give the minister the time to do his job and to 
consider the various suggestions for reform carefully before 
pushing amendments into the House.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7965"> 7965 </A></B>
<P>
	The second reason for opposing this motion is that it suggests 
that the House thinks the most important reform to this act is to 
add institutions to be covered by the act rather than improving 
access to government information that is already subject to the 
act. More than 132 institutions at the present time are subject to 
this act. The most recent report of the information commissioner 
as well as the parliamentary committee report in 1986, ``Open 
and Shut'' made numerous recommendations for improving the 
act.
<P>
	A motion of the House to extend the application of this act to 
other institutions I think would detract from these other 
proposals. It could be argued that the main purpose of the Access 
to Information Act is to hold the government accountable. An 
amendment to extend the act to agencies that are independent of 
government is not likely to address the issue of the 
accountability of government.
<P>
	I agree that independent crown agencies need scrutiny and 
that scrutiny is provided in various ways. I am not saying that 
making more institutions subject to the act is a bad idea. 
However, I do not necessarily agree that we should be telling the 
Minister of Justice that the priority of the House is adding to the 
list of institutions covered by the act rather than improving 
access to the 90 per cent of government information already 
subject to the act.
<P>
	The third point relates to the motion stating that Parliament 
and crown agencies should be subject to the act. We know that 
more than 130 crown agencies are already subject to the act as I 
have stated. Presumably the motion calls for more crown 
agencies to be subject to it. It is important to be more definitive 
and to say which ones should be subject to the act.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	When we have something of this importance, with the good 
intentions of parliamentarians and the good intentions of the 
people of Canada, we have to be definitive. We have to show 
people that it works. We can best show people how it works by 
being definitive and straightforward in what we want to achieve.
<P>
	The motion states that the Access to Information Act should 
apply to crown agencies. This seems to suggest that the act 
should not list precisely which agencies are subject to the act but 
instead should provide a general definition of what is a crown 
agency. It is difficult to say if this is the intent of the motion but 
it is an ambiguity which may make it difficult for the minister to 
know how to respond to the motion if it passes.
<P>
	I want to cite just one example of where the general 
requirement that all crown corporations be subject to the access 
law may be too broad. I use an example in Ontario. Under the 
Ontario access law Ontario Hydro, the Ontario Liquor Control 
Board and the Ontario GO Transit Authority are subject to the 
act, while TV Ontario is not subject to it. This is because 
broadcasting, freedom of expression, confidential news sources 
and independence from government may raise different  issues 
than those affecting other types of crown corporations. A one 
size fits all approach is not necessarily the best way to go.
<P>
	There are two advantages to using what I would call a list 
approach rather than a general definition of crown assets 
approach. First, the list approach ensures we consider each 
agency on an institution by institution basis, taking into account 
any special circumstances that might apply to these institutions. 
There may be good reasons why one government agency should 
be subject to the act while another one is not.
<P>
	A second advantage to this list approach is that there is 
certainty over which crown agencies are subject to the act and 
which are not. If we simply create a broad general definition of 
crown agency some agencies are likely to interpret whatever 
words are used in that definition to say the definition does not 
include them.
<P>
	Undoubtedly this will lead to litigation with all the increased 
time and cost to request the government definition in question. 
This will use valuable court time in a system that is already 
overburdened.
<P>
	In summary I would want to say that it is important to talk 
about this issue. This is an important issue. I want to thank the 
hon. member for Red Deer for bringing it before the House. I 
support the hon. member's desire for increased openness and 
accountability in government. I want to say to him that I am 
confident the Minister of Justice will address this important 
issue during the life of the government. It is important that we as 
members of Parliament support him in the act of looking into 
this question and bringing forward a greater accountability.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
rise today in support of Motion M-304. The motion is put 
forward by my Reform colleague from Red Deer. I would like to 
congratulate him on it.
<P>
	The motion deals with extending the realm of the present 
Access to Information Act to include Parliament and crown 
corporations.
<P>
	I begin by paraphrasing the purpose of the act. The passage 
will help to outline the true essence and principles behind the 
creation of the act and how the present motion before the House 
will only enhance those principles. ``The purpose of this act is to 
extend the present laws of Canada to provide a right of access to 
information in records under the control of a government 
institution in accordance with the principles that government 
information should be available to the public''. This is an 
explanation of the act's intent to foster accountability within 
government and its institutions.

<P>
	The motion before the House embodies the same principles 
and expresses them in a form in which Canadian people deserve 
to have access to, namely Parliament and crown corporations. It 
serves to ensure that the business of government is and remains 
open to the public. It represents the public's desire for 
Parliament to be accountable for its actions. It embodies the 
need Canadians have to know that their government and its 
institutions are not hiding from them. If government has nothing 
to hide, and it should have nothing to hide, why not open up 
Parliament and crown corporations to public scrutiny?
<P>
	We in the Reform Party have been listening to the outraged 
cries of our fellow Canadians and understand their desire to hold 
Parliament accountable for its actions. This understanding was 
shown through our efforts to pass Bill C-210, the bill on recall. 
It was recently voted down by both the Liberal and Bloc parties. 
We are trying again.
<P>
	The motion will allow the public access to financial matters 
handled by the Speakers of the House and the Senate. However 
the motion will not sacrifice the confidentiality of MPs' files or 
cabinet documents. It will, though, for such crown agencies as 
the CBC and Canada Post, open up their files to public scrutiny.
<P>
	In this day of incredible national debt and financial strain on 
the taxpayer, such a motion grants true meaning to open 
government, something we have been hearing a lot about. After 
all, do Canadians not have a right to know where their money is 
being spent?
<P>
	The Liberal government states on page 91 of its red book 
which we hear so often quoted in the House: ``If government is 
to play a positive role in society, as it must, honesty and 
integrity in our political institutions must be restored''. The 
motion will help to ensure that both Parliament and crown 
corporations are accountable to the public and hence will be 
viewed as capturing the honesty and integrity it once had.
<P>
	On page 91 the Liberal book goes on to state: ``The most 
important asset of government is the confidence it enjoys of the 
citizens to whom it is accountable''.
<P>
	The motion stresses the need Canadians have for a more open 
process of government. They are tired of being told what to do 
by the government while not having a government that invokes a 
sense of trust or integrity among the people it governs.
<P>
	We hear all too often about more open and honest 
government, about integrity, about credibility. We hear the talk 
but we do not see the Liberals walking the walk. That is what this 
motion is all about. We hear speakers on the other side telling us 
that they support the motion in principle but that it is too broad 
in scope and that perhaps there is going to be some Pandora's 
box opened as a result of the motion passing.
<P>
	I suggest that what we ought to be doing is making the access 
to information law as broad as possible with limitations set in 
areas where appropriate rather than the other way around. What 
we are hearing from members opposite is exactly that. They 
want to limit. They are so concerned about having information 
out there in the general public they want to make sure they have 
as many limitations as possible in place. That is counter to the 
whole theme of access to information.
<P>
	An example of closed, elitist and top down government is the 
land claim negotiations currently going on in my riding of 
Skeena. These negotiations are the epitome of backroom, closed 
to the public input, government deals. These negotiations 
between the federal and provincial governments and native 
groups in my province are completely performed behind closed 
doors without any direct public input whatsoever.
<P>
	Is this not the kind of process the Liberal government 
condemns in its red book on page 91? It states: ``The people are 
irritated with governments that do not consult them or that 
disregard their views or that try to conduct key parts of the 
public business behind closed doors''.
<P>
	I suggest that is what the government is doing and it can 
change by supporting Motion M-304. I would call settling a 
major land claim affecting a large piece of land and a great 
number of people public business. It is definitely irritating my 
constituents.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	Bring back integrity and trust to this Parliament and its 
agencies. Allow Canadians to feel proud as they once did of their 
parliamentary institution. Give Parliament back to the people. 
Allow them the access they deserve and put confidence in 
government back in the minds and hearts of Canadians.
<P>
	In conclusion, this motion M-304 will help Canadians to trust 
Parliament and its agencies once again. It is essential for the 
political stability of this country that Canadians trust their 
elected officials and feel a sense of integrity when proudly 
telling others in the world that they are Canadians.
<P>
	There is nothing to fear in this motion. It is straightforward 
common sense. Let Canadians have the right to an open 
Parliament and the right to hold their politicians accountable.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 is 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="VIARAIL">VIA RAIL</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-GrÃ¢ce, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on October 13 VIA Rail announced that it was cutting a 
further 478 jobs, half of them in Montreal, and that it would be 
doing this without any cut in service to the public.
<P>
	On October 18 I asked the Minister of Transport how VIA Rail 
could cut 478 jobs without reducing service to the public and 
why VIA was still pursuing a downsizing policy introduced by 
the Conservative government in 1993.
<P>
	In answer to my question, the Minister of Transport said that 
the cuts were necessary because there had to be a cut in the 
subsidies to VIA Rail. He said it could not continue with the 
subsidies at the same level. He went on to say again that there 
would be no cut in service. By that he meant there would be no 
cut in trains or no cut in VIA Rail routes.
<P>
	I guess it all comes down to what you mean by service to the 
public. Some of these cuts involve cuts in the maintenance staff 
for VIA Rail. Some of them involve cuts in the sales staff for 
VIA Rail. Let me state some things that have happened to me on 
VIA Rail trains. If there is no proper maintenance and the train is 
breaking down halfway through the trip, as it has done on 
several occasions, and arrival at your destination is delayed by 
half an hour or an hour and if the heating system breaks down in 
the winter and you freeze in the coach, that all has to do with 
service to the public.
<P>
	It is also service to the public when you try to get a sales 
representative on the phone and all you get is a run-around with 
push one, push two and push three. It is very difficult to get the 
type of service you need to buy a ticket for VIA Rail.
<P>
	In fact, these are cuts in service that will affect the public. 
Sooner or later because of the poor service in sales promotion or 
the purchase of tickets or in maintenance, people will stop using 
the train. When they stop using the train because of the poor 
service in these aspects, then VIA Rail will say: ``Nobody is 
using the route to London or to Quebec City or Sherbrooke. Let's 
close it down''. Of course the reason people are not using it 
starts at the beginning with the cuts that were made in 
maintenance, sales, public relations, research and so on.
<P>
	I maintain that these cuts will lead to a cut in service. I see 
these cuts by VIA Rail as a lack of long range commitment to 
passenger rail service in this country.
<P>
	In Canada we have always had subsidies for our 
transportation system. We have it for buses, trucks and airlines. 
The airlines are being subsidized indirectly by the airports, the 
air traffic control. The highways are subsdized by the fact that 
they are built for the public by the provinces and the buses and 
trucks are using them to a great extent. All this is happening in 
this country while in Europe they are building high speed, very 
efficient trains. The chunnel train service from Paris to London 
began just the other day. You can go from Paris to London I think 
in about three to four hours. It is very efficient and very fast. 
Here we are in Canada ripping up the rails.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	It is very difficult to understand why in our country, when we 
had a great railway system and a great seaway system, we are 
letting these things go down the drain. When one drives down 
Highway 401 to Toronto there are so many trucks and buses on 
the road one takes his or her life in danger. A lot of that freight 
traffic should be on trains and on shipping. I just do not 
understand what VIA is doing or what the government is doing.
<P>
	Furthermore, the minister says he is reducing the subsidies by 
$100 million a year in accordance with the 1993 budget. The 
1993 budget was a Conservative Tory budget. We are a new 
Liberal government. Why are we continuing to allow VIA Rail 
to operate on a budget that was introduced by a Tory government 
that we helped to defeat last September?
<P>
	Once again I will put my question to the government. Where 
is the commitment to good passenger service in this country? 
Why was the money saved by these cuts not redirected into 
better rail service? What assurance do we have that these cuts 
will not lead to a further deterioration in service and to more 
cuts in routes for our trains in this country?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to address the question raised by my 
colleague, the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-GrÃ¢ce, 
regarding the impact of service resulting from VIA's recently 
announced job cuts.
<P>
	As he mentioned, these job cuts are part of VIA's strategy to 
improve its operating efficiency and bring the costs of its 
operations in line with its reduced funding levels. In itself, this 
objective is no different from that of any other crown 
corporation or company in the private sector.
<P>
	The challenge that VIA faces is it has to reduce its operating 
costs by $100 million by the end of 1996-97 while maintaining 
as much of the existing rail passenger services network as 
possible. This is no ordinary feat. To meet that challenge VIA 
management must rethink the way it does business. All work 
practices that have been the mainstay of past railway operations 
<P>

<B><A NAME="7968"> 7968 </A></B>
<P>
have to be re-evaluated and streamlined throughout the 
organization.
<P>
	The job cuts announced on October 13 affected people at all 
levels of the corporation from senior management positions to 
the workshop level. The minister mentioned that in his answer 
on the day of the question. This provides an indication that VIA 
management is serious about taking the necessary steps to 
assure its long term viability.
<P>
	The review on the future of VIA services is not yet completed. 
It is part of the recognition by the government that we must 
address our national deficit, the size of which makes it a 
problem for all Canadians and not just an item on the previous 
government's agenda. For its part, VIA management has 
demonstrated that it is ready to meet its current challenge.
<P>
	With the co-operation of its employees, its chances of 
succeeding are significantly improved as, hopefully, will 
service to the travelling public.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="GRAINTRANSPORTATION">GRAIN TRANSPORTATION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am rising tonight as frustrated as I am angry.
<P>
	As you know, Mr. Speaker, because I am a New Democrat I do 
not have the opportunities to ask questions of ministers in this 
Chamber as often as I would like. I consider it an honour and a 
privilege when I am called upon to raise matters with ministers 
of the crown on behalf of my constituents and Canadians 
everywhere who share my views.
<P>
	However, when a minister refuses to respond with a correct 
answer when he has it at his fingertips, he is not only wasting my 
valuable time, he is also wasting the time of the Chair and he is 
insulting the Canadian people.
<P>
	On Tuesday, November 15, I asked the Minister of 
Agriculture to clarify his position with respect to grain 
transportation financing in Canada. There were conflicting 
reports from government printed in the media. Because the issue 
of the Crow benefit is of incredible importance to the farmers 
and the communities that they support in northwest 
Saskatchewan as well as across the prairies, I thought it was 
appropriate to clear the air and let farmers who are now just 
starting to plan next year's crop know where they stand going 
into that crop year.
<P>
	Those conflicting reports were numerous. During the month 
of October when he was touring Asia, the Minister for 
International Trade said he wanted Canada to eliminate all farm 
export subsidies including the Crow benefit and indeed prohibit 
any new ones.
<P>
	At the same time, the federal Minister of Transport said he 
was looking for ways to reduce spending within his department 
and the Crow benefit appeared to be on the block. Late last week 
the minister's deputy minister, Mr. Nick Mulder, told the 
semi-annual meeting of the Canadian Grains Council that it is 
time to update Canada's railway policy, including the grain 
subsidies. In fact he said that if Transport Canada had its way a 
new transportation policy would include a significant change  in 
the Crow benefit method of payment. To quote Mr. Mulder, he 
said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The view is that we ought to make a method of payment change sooner rather 
than later; we have to move in another direction.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	During the recent political convention of the Saskatchewan 
Liberal Party in Saskatoon, the delegates voted on a 
transportation motion and decided it was time to pay the farmer 
rather than the railway. Therefore I thought, since the minister 
of agriculture had been saying that as far as he was concerned 
the issue was one to be resolved in consultation with farm 
groups, that it was time the minister came forward with his own 
thoughts on the matter.
<P>
	On Tuesday afternoon of this week I asked the minister if he 
was the defender of the Crow benefit and if it was the federal 
government's intention to keep grain moving by rail by ensuring 
that the Crow benefit remained in place. The minister did not 
surprise me by saying once again:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Over the course of the next couple of months the Minister of Transport and I 
will be canvassing all the major farm organizations in the country so that we 
might present recommendations to our current cabinet colleagues early in the 
new year.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The minister did not answer my question but at least he was 
consistent in his answer. Mr. Speaker, you can understand my 
surprise and my anger when I picked up the newspaper on 
Wednesday morning to read that on Tuesday night, barely five 
hours after the minister of agriculture had answered my 
question, he met with prairie ministers of agriculture and told 
them that the Crow benefit was on its deathbed. The federal 
government will betray the commitment to thousands of prairie 
farmers and introduce legislation early in the new year to end 
payments to the railways in favour of payments made directly to 
producers.
<P>
	A great number of farmers in northwest Saskatchewan and I 
continue to support the Crow benefit. We want the federal 
government to maintain the current method of payment. It 
would appear the minister, the cabinet and the Liberals across 
the way are not prepared to listen or even understand our 
concerns. We are also appalled that when he had a chance to put 
his position on the table in the House of Commons where it 
belonged, the minister of agriculture chose to conceal that 
information until he was in a private meeting later that day.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7969"> 7969 </A></B>
<P>
	An issue of this importance deserves the attention of the 
House. Our time in question period is too valuable to be ignored, 
and it appears that is exactly what this minister of agriculture 
did on Tuesday.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to answer the question on the Crow 
benefit raised by my hon. colleague, the member for The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake.
<P>
	It is not as simple as he makes it sound. The Minister of 
Transport and the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food 
together are currently in the process of meeting with 
shareholders in the grains and oilseeds industry regarding 
changes to the Western Grain Transportation Act, which I will 
call WGTA for short.
<P>
	Under the new GATT regulations the WGTA on shipments 
through the west coast and Churchill fall within the definition of 
an export subsidy. These subsidies must be reduced, as he 
knows, under the terms of the new GATT. This means that we 
have choices. We can change the WGTA so that it is no longer an 
expert subsidy, or we can pay the railways but only within the 
new GATT rules.
<P>
	The second option would lead to an immediate and severe 
restriction on the volume of grain shipped through the west 
coast and Churchill that would be eligible for subsidies. In other 
words as volume limits for products were reached, shippers 
would suddenly be saddled with the full WGTA rates on 
shipments.
<P>
	Given this context there are now two proposals which have 
been put forward as alternatives to paying the railways. The 
first, presented by the producer payment panel last June, 
recommends payments to producers based on cultivated acres 
and then gradually phasing into payments based on arable acres. 
It also recommends some of the WGTA be put into safety nets 
and research.
<P>
	However the second proposal put forward by the Government 
of Alberta and endorsed by the present Saskatchewan 
government recommended provincial variations in the program 
within a set a principles. It also recommended against putting 
WGTA money into safety nets.
<P>
	After their current discussion with all interested parties about 
these two options, and perhaps other suggestions may come up, 
the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food and the Minister of 
Transport will make a comprehensive set of recommendations 
to cabinet about the overall reform to the Canadian grain 
handling and transportation system.
<P>
	These recommendations must be fiscally responsible and 
consistent with our international trading obligation, as the hon. 
member knows. They must also reflect the concern of all those 
in the grains and oilseeds industry. In finalizing the 
government's position with respect to the WGTA we must 
ensure that Canadian agriculture and Canadian farmers are 
positioned to take on the world and to win.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38 the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have 
been adopted.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>]

	Accordingly, the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10
