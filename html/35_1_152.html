	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, pursuant to 
Standing Order 34(1), I have the honour to present, in both 
official languages, the report of the Canadian delegation to the 
third annual meeting of the Asia-Pacific parliamentary forum 
which was held in Acapulco, Mexico, from January 12 to 15, 
1995.
<P>
	The Asia-Pacific parliamentary forum, which was 
inaugurated in January 1993, is quickly becoming an important 
voice in dealing with political and security matters, 
co-operative economic arrangements and other key regional 
interests and issues.
<P>
	At the same time the Asia-Pacific region is becoming 
increasingly significant in the achievement of Canada's goals in 
terms of trade, technology acquisition in job creation, in 
sustaining a global environment and in managing the 
demographics of immigration.
<P>
	These forums provide parliamentarians of the subject regions 
the opportunity to express their own views and those of the 
people they represent in a frank and open manner. The 
opportunity to meet and discuss issues with fellow 
parliamentarians from 20 other Pacific rim countries was a 
positive experience. In effect it was an international discussion 
at the grassroots level and this is to be encouraged.
<P>
	In 1997 Canada will host the heads of government and the 
ministerial meetings of the Asia-Pacific economic 
co-operation, APEC. The government is considering that 1997 
be declared the year of Canada in Asia-Pacific.
<P>
	I am pleased to add that Canada has also been asked to host the 
fifth meeting of the Asia-Pacific parliamentary forum in 
January 1997. This is an honour and an indication of the high 
regard in which our country is held in the international 
community.

	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 36, I am today presenting 
petitions signed by 1,563 of my constituents of Prince 
George-Peace River.
<P>
	The petitioners feel that no amount of gun control has ever 
succeeded in preventing criminals from acquiring guns for 
illegal means. Therefore they ask Parliament to support laws 
that punish criminals using firearms, support, recognize and 
protect the rights of law-abiding citizens to own and use 
recreational firearms, and abolish any existing gun control laws 
that have proven ineffective.
<P>
	I concur and fully endorse these petitions.

	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have four petitions to present today.
<P>
	On behalf of the hon. member for Calgary Southeast I rise 
before the House on day seven to present petition number seven. 
These petitions are being presented on behalf of constituents 
who wish to halt the early release from prison of Robert Paul 
Thompson. April 11 is the date set for the parole hearing.
<P>
	The petitioners are concerned about making our streets safer 
for citizens. They are opposed to the current practice of early 
release of violent offenders prior to serving the full extent of 
their sentences.
<P>
	The petitioners pray that the streets will be made safer for 
law-abiding citizens and the families of the victims of 
convicted murderers.

	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the third and fourth petitions deal with the issue of 
gun control.
<P>
	The petitioners call on the House to oppose further legislation 
for firearms acquisition and possession and provide strict 
guidelines and mandatory sentencing for the use or possession 
of a firearm in the commission of a violent crime.
<P>
	To date, 1,571 constituents from 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt have signed this petition

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 36, I have two petitions 
to table today.
<P>
	The first one is signed by 75 of my constituents in the 
Langham area. It draws to the attention of the House that 
because of the inclusion of sexual orientation the Canadian 
Human Rights Act will provide certain groups with special 
status, rights and privileges and because these rights and 
privileges would be granted solely on the basis of sexual 
behaviour these petitioners call upon Parliament to oppose any 
amendments to the Canadian Human Rights Act or the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms which provides for the 
inclusion of the phrase sexual orientation.

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the second petition is from the Rosetown area and 
is signed by 29 of my constituents, I believe primarily from the 
Rosetown Alliance Church.
<P>
	They draw to the attention of the House that whereas the 
majority of Canadians are law-abiding citizens who respect the 
law and respect the sanctity of human life, and whereas the 
majority of Canadians believe that physicians in Canada should 
be working to save lives and not to end them, they pray that 
Parliament ensure the present provisions of the Criminal Code 
of Canada prohibiting assisted suicide be enforced vigorously 
and that Parliament make no changes in the law which would 
sanction or allow the aiding or abetting of suicide or active or 
passive euthanasia.
<P>
	I concur with both of these petitions.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="GUNCONTROL">GUN CONTROL</A></H4>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to present four petitions today on behalf of 
my constituents.
<P>
	The first one is rather timely. The petitioners request that 
Parliament support laws that severely punish all violent 
criminals who use weapons in the commission of a crime, 
support new Criminal Code firearms control provisions and 
recognize and protect the right of law-abiding citizens to only 
use recreational firearms, and support legislation which will 
repeal and modify existing gun control laws which have not 
improved public safety and have proven not to be cost effective 
or have proven to be overly complex so as to be ineffective or 
unenforceable.
<P>
	There are 125 signatures which support that petition.

<P>
	The petitioners pray and request that Parliament not amend 
the human rights code, the Canadian Human Rights Act or the

indicate societal approval of same sex relationships or of 
homosexuality, including amending the human rights code to 
include in the prohibited grounds of discrimination the

Offenders Act.
<P>
	The petitioners call upon Parliament to amend the Young 
Offenders Act to reflect the changing character of young 
offenders by increasing the maximum penalty for first and 
second degree murder from five to ten years, allowing the 
publication of the young offender's name after a second

population in Atlantic Canada and the burgeoning seal 
population and calls upon Parliament to urge the federal

	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House urge the government to respond to the demands of Canadians 
for decisive spending cuts and no net tax-increases to eliminate the deficit and 
to produce a smaller federal government.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, as one of Reform's co-critics for 
finance, I have the honour to lead today's debate of this 
resolution. I will discuss its importance by drawing on my 
background as an economist and a long time teacher of 
international finance courses.
<P>
	A number of my colleagues later in the day will expand on the 
theme in the light of their roles as Reform critics of different 
ministries. All of our remarks reflect consultations with constit-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9566"> 9566 </A></B>
<P>
uents through personal and town hall meetings, electronic media 
consultations and the return of questionnaires.
<P>
	As a preliminary, let me note that Reformers do not enjoy our 
role as advocates for spending cuts and a smaller government. 
The government's involvement in the affairs of Canadians is so 
pervasive that few of us, our families or friends will escape the 
effects of such cuts.
<P>
<B>(1015 ) </B>
<P>
	As a professor, I am personally concerned about their effects 
on higher education, my own future and that of my friends and 
colleagues. We all dislike it when changes in government 
policies force us to alter our habits and way of life. Reformers 
therefore appreciate very much the personal difficulties which 
these cuts will bring. We know these difficulties will seem puny 
in relation to those that will be forced upon Canadians if we do 
not get our fiscal house in order on our own terms.
<P>
	Consider what may happen to the exchange rate, interest rates 
and Canada's foreign position if the forthcoming Liberal budget 
does not satisfy both Canadian and foreign investors. Investors 
sell Canadian government bonds and move their money into 
some other governments' bonds, be they American, German or 
Japanese. Such sales depress bond prices and increase interest 
rates, sending the Canadian dollar on a downward slide.
<P>
	How far will these adverse developments go? No one knows. 
There is no doubt that at some interest rate high enough and 
exchange rate low enough, investors will once more purchase 
Canadian bonds and dollars and the slide will be halted.
<P>
	It is often said that rationality or real economic values take a 
back seat to investors' mass hysteria during such speculative 
bubbles. Falling values create expectations of further falls. 
Investors rush to liquidate their holdings before they are worth 
even less. Some hope to buy them back once the bottom has been 
hit, expecting quick profits. Others are made to move their 
money into foreign assets which increase in value at the same 
time that Canadian asset values fall.
<P>
	At some point a new class of speculators enters the fray. They 
hold no Canadian assets but sell Canadian dollars short at 
today's price in the expectation that they can deliver it a few 
days later at an even lower price.
<P>
	Some domestic investors will borrow Canadian dollars and 
buy foreign currencies. The hot money ready to enter such 
speculation is so large that no country in the world, certainly not 
Canada, can stop the slide once it has gathered enough 
momentum.
<P>
	Many can understand what goes on during such speculative 
bubbles. They are likely to have been caught in the fever of 
buying real estate, gold or similar investments in the past. They 
will remember how profitable it can be to participate in the 
exciting events and how difficult it is to resist the herd instinct.
<P>
	We need only to look at the recent experience of Mexico 
during the last few months to appreciate what can happen to 
Canada. The Mexican peso depreciated by over 50 per cent 
against the U.S. and Canadian dollars before stability was 
restored and a slow recovery started. Interest rates went sky 
high.
<P>
	Canadians had a foretaste of possible developments in the 
middle of January when a small speculative bubble hit the 
Canadian dollar. The interest and exchange rates moved by 
extraordinary amounts in a very short time.
<P>
	In the case of both countries the dramatic interest and 
exchange rate changes were halted by the interventions of 
governments. They bought bonds and currency that were being 
dumped by investors. They used at first the dollar and gold 
reserves in the accounts of their own central banks. They then 
drew on credit with private banks, foreign central banks and 
international organizations that have been negotiated before. 
They then went, hat in hand, to arrange new lines of credit, 
asking other central banks to help them by buying their national 
currencies.
<P>
	The Government of Mexico went down very far on this road of 
using ever more costly sources of intervention. It ended up 
arranging for huge direct loans and standby credits from foreign 
governments and international organizations.
<P>
	The cost of such borrowing is now quite transparent and not 
just monetary. The U.S. Congress debated loan conditions and 
came very close to requiring Mexico to adopt very stringent 
policies.
<P>
<B>(1020 ) </B>
<P>
	The important thing is that such loan conditions would have 
represented an almost unprecedented interference in the 
domestic economic, social and foreign aid policies of an 
independent nation state. In the end, President Clinton avoided 
the imposition of such extreme conditions by the use of 
administrative devices which bypassed Congress.
<P>
	It is not clear that Congress will let presidents use these 
devices in the future. The American people and their elected 
representatives are in a foul mood when it comes to bailing out 
foreign governments which have what they consider to be 
inappropriate social and economic policies.
<P>
	Reformers are not willing to gamble on any of these 
eventualities. Our first objective as a country must be to never 
be placed in a predicament like that experienced by Mexico. We 
want to retain Canada's sovereignty over its economic and 
social policies.
<P>
	In the middle of January Canada came very close to the point 
where we too had to go hat in hand to foreign lenders. As some 
put it, we came very close to hitting the wall. An economist who 
watched the tickers flashing interest rates and exchange rates 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9567"> 9567 </A></B>
<P>
dropping by the minute suggested to me that the situation was 
saved this time by massive intervention of the G-7 central 
banks. He is  worried that we may not be so lucky the next time 
or that we can escape really burdensome loan conditions.
<P>
	The next time may well be in the wake of the upcoming 
budget, not immediately but when some other event upsets 
investors. That may be a few days, weeks or even months later.
<P>
	Investors will look for four major policies in the budget. The 
finance minister had better not goof.
<P>
	First, investors will look for tax increases. Individual 
Canadians oppose tax increases because they feel overtaxed and 
want a smaller government for understandable personal reasons. 
Investors would interpret tax increases as a signal that the 
government does not have the courage to make the spending cuts 
needed to eliminate the deficit.
<P>
	Higher taxes mean eventually a bigger government, one 
which during the last 30 years has grown but has not solved and 
instead has increased the problems of slow economic growth, 
increased poverty and unemployment, the breakup of families 
and which to boot, has created frighteningly large and persistent 
deficits. It is big government which has created among 
Canadians the pervasive sense that their and their children's 
lives are getting worse, not better.
<P>
	Second, investors will look for cuts to social spending. Social 
spending programs broadly defined use about $70 billion or 60 
per cent of the federal program spending of $120 billion. The 
current deficit of $38 billion cannot possibly be eliminated 
through cuts in non-social spending even in the face of rapid 
growth in revenue during the current boom without a threat to 
essential efficiency increasing government services.
<P>
	Past governments have lacked the courage to tackle social 
spending. That is why the fiscal situation has deteriorated to the 
present cliffhanger. I predict very confidently that if the 
upcoming budget does not contain hard-nosed cuts to social 
spending, investors will be very unhappy. They will point with 
some justification to a lost opportunity since most Canadians 
are ready for such cuts.
<P>
	In addition, it is now official. The OECD noted in a recent 
report that Canada's social programs are an outstanding 
example of excessive generosity.
<P>
	Third, investors will look for a plan for the complete 
elimination of the deficit during the current economic boom. 
The Liberal red book target of $25 billion two years from now 
has been criticized roundly by many experts. It implies an 
increase in the federal debt by $100 billion or 20 per cent of the 
$500 billion during the first years of Liberal rule.
<P>
<B>(1025 ) </B>
<P>
	Like the Conservatives during the 1980s, the Liberals will 
find that the debt will cease to grow as a percentage of national 
income during the upswing if they achieve their deficit target. 
But this is a hollow victory because the cause of the debt will 
resume the moment the economy slows down again as inevitably 
it will.
<P>
	Predictions are that this may well happen before the end of the 
present election cycle. Few expect decisive spending cuts 
during the last two years before the next election. Therefore, one 
of the crucial aspects of the budget that investors will study is 
whether and by how much spending cuts go beyond the $25 
billion deficit target in two years.
<P>
	They will also look for further plans for deficit reduction 
beyond the last fiscal year covered in the budget. Will the 
Minister of Finance have the backing of cabinet and the Prime 
Minister to plan for further cuts in the future?
<P>
	Fourth, I believe that investors will look to the budget for one 
other important subject. They will look for evidence that the 
government has accepted certain radically different ideas about 
the causes of unemployment which have moved out of 
conservative think tanks and are now discussed freely by the 
Auditor General, the OECD and many academics.
<P>
	According to these ideas Canada's high and persistent 
unemployment rates are caused to a considerable degree by the 
generous social programs themselves. The unfortunate but 
unavoidable reality is that Canada once had the choice of having 
high unemployment rates and generous UIC and welfare 
benefits as a matter of deliberate public preference. That choice 
has disappeared with the debt, deficit and slow growth of the last 
decade.
<P>
	These are harsh messages for a Liberal government to accept, 
which on these matters is caught in its own rhetoric. Investors 
are watching to see if the Liberals can live up to their reputation 
as the ultimate non-dogmatic pragmatists.
<P>
	Let me close by suggesting that Reformers have listened to 
the public and to investors. Our own alternative budget will 
reflect what we have heard. It will outline steps we would be 
prepared to take in order to address the four issues crucial for 
investor confidence and most thoughtful Canadians.
<P>
	My colleagues speaking after me will elaborate on some of 
these matters without revealing too much about our specific 
recommendations. We invite the Liberals to present a budget 
which will take the news out of the policies on these matters we 
will propose very soon.
<P>
	After this gloom and doom, a few words of hope. Once 
Canadians have gone through three years and deal with the 
necessary deliberate and thoughtful spending cuts, there is a 
light at the end of the tunnel.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9568"> 9568 </A></B>
<P>
	Such cuts will restore investor and consumer confidence. The 
economic boom will be fueled and expanded. Economic growth 
will return to the high levels we have not seen since the 
pervasive government intrusion of the last three decades.
<P>
	In a few short years after the budget is balanced there is a 
prospect of tax reduction, a smaller debt, or both. Mild, short 
run pain will not only avoid catastrophic pain in the 
intermediate term, it will also bring large and important gains in 
what in retrospect will seem like a very short time of sacrifice.
<P>
	We hope the Liberals will hear this message, not because we 
want to be right, but because it is right for Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to </B><B>Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome this opportunity to 
remind the House of the fiscal commitment and philosophy that 
will frame our government's upcoming budget. I believe this 
debate should also include some plan and some plain, positive 
talk about the Canadian economy and outlook.
<P>
	This Reform motion cites ``the demand by Canadians to cut 
spending and hold the line on taxes to eliminate the deficit and 
produce a smaller federal government''. Our government does 
not need this grandstanding motion or any of the stage managed 
events of a publicity starved party to be deeply aware of what 
Canadians want.
<P>
<B>(1030 ) </B>
<P>
	Starting last October, we put in place the most extensive and 
most public consultation process in budget history. In my view, 
these consultations prove that Canadians have a more profound 
and positive understanding of the budget challenge than the 
simplistic slash and trash approach of the Reform Party.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In fact, Canadians have identified priorities that are realistic 
and require a great deal of effort. They want a strategy for phase 
two, based on last year's budget, to get Canada out of this 
vicious circle of deficit and debt.
<P>
	However, the vast majority of Canadians also want the budget 
measures to meet other essential criteria. They have made it 
clear that they agree with the principles set forth last fall by the 
Minister of Finance.
<P>
	First of all, deficit reduction must be an essential part of a 
strategy to create jobs through economic growth. Second, 
fairness is paramount, to ensure that the most vulnerable in our 
society are not left behind. Third, deficit reduction measures 
must be based on reasoned choices and reflect clear-cut 
priorities. Fourth, we must use taxpayers' money wisely. And 
finally, budgetary actions should focus on reductions in 
expenditures, as opposed to raising revenues.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Canadians I have heard from want a lean government but 
not a mean government. They want a budget that builds market 
confidence but not one that abandons basic social responsibility. 
This budget will meet that dynamic challenge.
<P>
	There is no contradiction here. Our budget will, because we 
know it must, take the tough action needed to meet the deficit 
goals we set out last year. As the Prime Minister said in Quebec 
City last fall, the time to reduce deficits is when the economy is 
growing. Therefore, now is the time. The economy is growing 
which is good news for all Canadians.
<P>
	Let me give members some examples. Canada's growth rate 
last year was 4.25 per cent, the highest in the G-7. The OECD 
predicts that Canada will continue to lead the industrial world 
for the next two years. In the past 12 months, real exports surged 
over 20 per cent and we continued to set all time records for our 
country.
<P>
	A survey by the Conference Board found that 81 per cent of 
firms planned to maintain or boost investment over the next six 
months, another record high for our country. That investment 
means jobs. Since January 1994 the economy has created over 
400,000 jobs. All of these are full-time jobs. The 
unemployment rate is down to single digits for the first time in 
four years.
<P>
	This good news does not mean that Canadian economic 
renewal is permanently secured. We know that. The government 
knows that cohesive, co-ordinated action is needed on all fronts. 
We understand that the spearhead for this action agenda must be 
to restore a healthy fiscal climate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We all know the price we have to pay today for having let 
deficits and the debt rise to new heights during the past decades. 
That price is higher taxes and interest rates, factors that slow 
down growth.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	This government, however, believes that in order to meet the 
debt challenge successfully, we must first set realistic and 
credible targets. This means maintaining the deficit reduction 
momentum we have set in motion, in other words, bringing the 
deficit down to 3 per cent of GDP in three years. That is exactly 
what we intend to do, and as the Minister of Finance said, there 
are no excuses.
<P>
	The last time we had a deficit level of 3 per cent was in 
1974-75. Since then, the deficit has increased steadily and is 
now close to 6 per cent of GDP.
<P>
	It should also be said that setting firm deficit reduction 
objectives is a considerable departure from past policy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9569"> 9569 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canadians and markets lost confidence because they have 
suffered too many years of rosy, long term promises that became 
nothing but short term fertilizer.
<P>
	Instead, we have set out realistic targets and will take the 
action to deliver bottom line results. Our success here will 
strengthen credibility for our long term objective, which is 
eliminating the deficit completely. This strategy is based on 
fundamental political and public reality.
<P>
	We believe it is best to set short term targets, concrete 
milestones and hit them. With short term targets there is no 
excuse for delay, no acceptable grounds for not taking tough 
action to address the problem. When unrealistic long term goals 
are set, reasons can always be found to avoid tough action today 
and tomorrow and tomorrow after that.
<P>
	That was the Tory record, the first cousins of today's 
Reformers, a legacy we refuse to accept. Let me remind the 
House that we did more than stake out a deficit goal last year. We 
backed that goal with real bottom line action.
<P>
	The 1994 budget set out measures to deliver $20 billion in 
deficit reduction over three years. For every $1 of revenue 
action there were $5 of spending cuts. No budget in a decade 
moved so strongly to cut spending. The fact is we have always 
recognized the need for continued fiscal action. The 1995 
budget process started the minute we introduced the 1994 plan.
<P>
	That is why we combined immediate action with a sweeping 
series of program reviews of government operations, defence 
and social security reform. These have set concrete foundations 
for this year's budget and the tough decisions needed.
<P>
	We all understand that we have a long way to go but I think we 
have made a strong start. I am certain that 1995 budget will show 
all Canadians and markets around the world that the fiscal 
commitments made by the government are the fiscal 
commitments kept by the government.
<P>
	Before concluding my remarks let me comment directly on 
the so-called demand that today's motion cites for no net tax 
increases in the upcoming budget. Nobody likes higher taxes. 
Only a foolhardy politician would think otherwise. That is why 
cuts in government spending must and will be our priority in 
reducing the deficit. We proved that last year when we cut 
spending by $5 for every $1 in revenue measures.
<P>
	Most Canadians know that to ever bring taxes down and more 
immediately to ease the pressure on interest rates and the dollar 
we have to get the debt under control. That can only start by 
meeting our deficit targets. Given this challenge, I cannot 
promise that the budget will not include revenue action. If we 
take it, the focus will be on improving the fairness of the tax 
system.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	Let me challenge those who argue against any tax action. Do 
they really believe that the tax system right now is completely 
fair? Do they really believe that there are no loopholes or no 
unjustified preferences, especially given our fiscal situation? 
That type of Pollyanna politicking is not what Canadians 
demand or need at this time.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In concluding, I would like to point out that the motion before 
the House today refers basically to decisive spending cuts, a 
refusal to tolerate tax increases, initiatives to reduce the size of 
government, and all those measures that are part of an effective 
deficit reduction strategy. In other words, we have here the 
entire substance of what our government has said it would do. 
Unfortunately, the opposition in this House has shown once 
again it is better at spouting clichés than at making proposals of 
any substance.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We welcome the opportunity to debate tax issues before the 
budget, but we wish the opposition would bring some reality to 
the dilemma facing Canadians and hope that we hear more 
constructive propositions during this debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Mr. Speaker, could you tell me how much time is 
allocated please?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is 10 minutes for questions and 
comments. The member will appreciate that in error the 
government was not given a chance to ask questions or make 
comments about his speech. It was my error and I apologize to 
the House. It is 10 minutes basically for questions and 
comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I can understand that the hon. parliamentary secretary 
cannot reveal anything about the forthcoming budget and that he 
had to stay with generalities.
<P>
	The basic principles he laid out, I believe 80 per cent of 
Reformers agree with. The system must be fair, the cuts must be 
discussed widely. All the principles he set out are so universally 
accepted that they are almost empty rhetoric.
<P>
	I was talking about four issues which were raised before the 
finance committee where the member opposite sat and listened. 
An overwhelming proportion of witnesses said we must not do 
these kinds of things. The report that the finance committee 
came up with did not reflect these recommendations.
<P>
	As I said in my speech, those recommendations are absolutely 
crucial to the way in which the investors of the world are likely 
to react to the forthcoming budget. I hope that the government 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9570"> 9570 </A></B>
<P>
will not goof in the budget, that it will take the advice of the 
overwhelming number of witnesses on those four issues. The 
four issues are that a $25 billion deficit target in two years is 
insufficient given the length of the business cycle. It is 
absolutely  dangerous during a period of boom when the 
economy is growing at 3 or 4 percentage points a year to do as 
little as necessary to get to $25 billion in two years. It will send 
the wrong signal.
<P>
	Everyone who studies the budget realizes that the social 
programs are absorbing such a large proportion of the total that 
unless we take very tough steps on those, as has been 
recommended widely by the OECD and the Auditor General, the 
budget will not be credible.
<P>
<B>(1045 ) </B>
<P>
	I raise this matter because early in this session I asked the 
Minister of Human Resources Development when he presented 
his plan for social policy reform whether there would be any 
savings from the reform. He went into a rhetorical flourish and 
said they will not eliminate the deficit on the backs of poor 
people.
<P>
	The world hears this message but the world also knows that 
we cannot get away without making such cuts. We will be judged 
very harshly, especially in light of the fact that we probably have 
the most generous social security net in the world and in the 
light of the fact that it is now increasingly recognized that it was 
a noble experiment. When we are generous we also create 
dependence and increase unemployment as unwanted side 
effects.
<P>
	The world will look for a message on what the government 
thinks about the cause of our persistently high unemployment 
rate. For years, for decades, American and Canadian 
unemployment rates moved in unison. They diverged by very 
little until the middle seventies when Canada increased the 
generosity of her social programs. Since then the Americans, 
who are at the same level of economic prosperity as we are in the 
business cycle, have had unemployment rates below 6 per cent. 
We are at around 10 per cent. In Canada 4 per cent of the labour 
force is unemployed, yet there is no explanation for it. If the 
deficit could eliminate it, if large exports could eliminate it, if 
low interest rates could have eliminated it a few years ago, it 
would have happened. It is not just me who is saying this. The 
cause is somewhere else.
<P>
	Unless the government addresses these issues investors will 
be very unhappy. The probability is that the need for reform and 
for tough measures on all these issues will not come after 
deliberate consideration in the House or in committee. It will be 
imposed by governments and international organizations we 
have to go to in order to get money to stabilize our exchange rate 
and interest rate.
<P>
	It is not a happy picture. We do not enjoy talking about these 
things. I appreciate the hon. member cannot say more about it, 
but the generalities that we heard again today are not the way to 
go. I appreciate the opportunity to share these thoughts with the 
House and the people of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is difficult to know where to 
begin. It is obvious that the rough edges of his speech were left 
for the comments period and not for his actual speech. In his 
speech he kept himself on track and was quite reasonable, but 
when he stood on comments he began to get a bit sidetracked as 
to what the budget process was all about.
<P>
	The committee very carefully listened to witnesses. We were 
very careful in our own presentation to reflect the interest of 
Canadians. We can talk about majorities and what the majority 
said, but we also have in this country a respect for the minority. 
Groups that appeared before us were very concerned about the 
programs that were being presented. They asked us to protect the 
programs.
<P>
	The job of a government is not only to get on the high horse of 
a protest movement. It is also very much to bring into focus what 
a government should be doing in these very difficult times.
<P>
	I would argue that the approach taken by the majority report 
was a reasonable approach. We asked the finance minister to go 
further than he was originally intending to go. Then in January 
there were increased interest rates and difficulty with the dollar. 
I believe it is now accepted that actions will have to be as 
dramatic as they can possibly be.
<P>
<B>(1050 ) </B>
<P>
	The opposition critic vacillates between two important points 
in this debate: between Canadians they are encouraging to fight 
against a tax increase and international markets that want to be 
reassured we have our house in order.
<P>
	If we ask somebody in New York who is concerned about the 
Canadian budget whether there should be any tax increases, he 
would argue that we should do anything to get to our target. He 
would say: ``If you are really concerned about what I think, do 
what you have to do. If it means tax increases, do it and get to 
your target''. Then the Reformers go back to Calgary and say: 
``Tell them not to raise taxes''. The whole strategy is made 
vulnerable because they are playing a double game and they 
know they are playing a double game. Somebody on the floor of 
the House of Commons should call them on that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
wondering if the member has difficulty with his hearing. I was in 
Toronto last week on Wednesday night. There were well over 
2,000 people jammed into the Sheraton Centre who gave a very 
clear message, and I am delivering it to the House: No tax 
increase.
<P>
	I wonder if he could help us understand how it is Liberals do 
not understand that message when there are  rally after rally, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9571"> 9571 </A></B>
<P>
grassroots organizations after grassroots organizations, buttons, 
petitions and everything else. The Liberals are not listening. 
Why?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Mr. Speaker, if my hearing is bad, perhaps his 
eyesight is also bad. Did he see the 5,000 people in Montreal 
who were worried about their futures?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I find it hard to be part of a discussion where people 
call each other deaf and blind. I am grateful for the chance our 
colleagues in the Reform Party have given us to discuss the 
government's budget and, in particular, the appropriateness of 
keeping taxes and income taxes at their present level in the 
Minister of Finance's upcoming budget.
<P>
	I will say right off that the Bloc Quebecois supports the 
Reform Party's statement that increasing taxes and income tax 
at the present time, as the Minister of Finance himself 
acknowledged when he appeared before the finance committee 
in October, would kill the Canadian economy. It would put a 
strangle hold on job creation opportunities in the short term and 
before Canada enters a new period of slowing down, following 
the economic slowdown in the United States.
<P>
	Thus I say straight off that we support the Reform Party's 
proposal that the upcoming budget contain no general increase 
in income tax, as the Liberal majority on the finance committee 
suggested in December, and no additional taxes. Taxes and 
income tax also have an effect on the black market economy, the 
underground economy. The Minister of Finance himself 
estimated it represented between 10 and 15 per cent of Canada's 
GDP. This is a lot and it is the direct result of the excessively 
high level of taxes and income tax in Canada.
<P>
	Having said this, we have not forgotten that the budgetary 
situation of the Canadian government is critical, that the 
budgetary situation of the governments, as well, in Canada is 
one of the worst among industrialized countries. The federal 
debt alone, at $558 billion, represents over 80 per cent of the 
GDP. This is almost a world record. If we add the provincial 
debts, the figure increases from 80 per cent of the GDP to 115 
per cent of the GDP. A catastrophe.
<P>
	Another catastrophe, in terms of Canadian public finances, is 
the high proportion of Canadian securities in the hands of 
foreigners-43 per cent. This means we have a lot less control 
over our economic destiny and, in addition the capacity our 
governments have to act in budgetary or other areas is 
jeopardized.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	In regard to this long-standing situation-it has existed for 
some ten years-we knew we would find ourselves sooner or 
later in a catastrophic situation such as the present one. In spite 
of this, the Minister of Finance gave himself a break of nearly a 
year and a half. The Minister  of Finance has done nothing since 
assuming his position. The Minister of Finance has done nothing 
but present a first budget which hurt the most vulnerable, a 
budget which cut $7.5 billion from unemployment insurance 
programs but, in the end, solved nothing because in financial 
circles, both in Canada and abroad, the measures were not 
viewed as truly serious measures to correct the budget situation 
in Canada.
<P>
	In fact, in May 1994, a mere three months after the first 
budget was brought down by the Minister of Finance, the C.D. 
Howe Institute was already forecasting additional cuts beyond 
those mentioned in the minister's budget, additional cuts of $7 
billion over two years to allow the Minister of Finance to 
achieve his goal of a federal deficit of $25 billion for 1996-97, 
that is 3 per cent of GDP.
<P>
	In his economic statement of last October-just to give 
members an example of the seriousness or, to be more precise, 
the lack thereof, and laziness on the part of the Minister of 
Finance-the minister estimated that costs would have to be cut 
not by $7 billion, as the C.D. Howe Institute indicated, but by 
more than $9 billion. And since January, precisely because of 
the lack of serious intent on the part of the Minister of Finance, 
his inability to take truly corrective measures and immediate 
action, we are now facing necessary cuts estimated at between 
$12 and $16 billion over the next two years because of variable 
interest rates. Over a seven month period, forecasts were 
changed four times as pertains to required cuts or new revenues 
if the Canadian government is to meet its goal of reducing the 
deficit to 3 per cent of GDP as established by the Minister of 
Finance.
<P>
	And people wonder why things are not going well. People 
wonder why they still do not know what the federal government 
is doing to correct the situation. This is what happens when 
nothing is done for a year and a half, when financial circles tell 
us for a year and a half, with increasing urgency, that nothing is 
being done to correct the situation: panic sets in. And at present, 
we are seeing total panic from the Liberal government. They do 
not really know where to go from here. They are making 
proposals left and right. They have been sending test balloons 
out over the last two or three months, but have failed to do what 
was needed for a year and a half.
<P>
	I would even say that not only is the official opposition 
awaiting the Minister of Finance's next budget, but also the 
entire international community. Indeed, all foreign investors 
who hold Canadian debt securities are getting ready to pounce 
on the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	The next budget needs to be a budget that clearly shows that a 
structural reform is taking place, that measures are being taken, 
not just haphazard measures but serious corrective measures. 
Not just superficial cuts, cuts concealing the true catastrophic 
state of our public finances, but real cuts, airtight fiscal mea-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9572"> 9572 </A></B>
<P>
sures that will not only permit the Minister of Finance to brag, 
and pat himself on the back for, reaching his goal of bringing the  
deficit down to three per cent of GDP in 1996-97, we will come 
back to this later, but real proof that the Minister of Finance has 
gotten public finances under control. This is what financial 
circles are expecting.
<P>
	And let me tell you that if they are not convinced that this and 
the 1996-97 budgets contain serious corrective measures and 
take at least some strain off the public finances, since that is the 
heart of the problem, I would say that they are going to demand 
risk premiums, like they did in January and May 1994. In 
addition to the regular return they receive on Canadian debt 
securities, they will demand that an additional percentage be 
tacked on to compensate for the absolutely decrepit state of 
Canada's public finances and for the Minister of Finance's lack 
of action, other than his stand-up comedy act, to really correct 
the situation.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	I would argue that people are a little tired of hearing the 
government and its representatives tell us every day that they 
will achieve their goal of reducing the deficit to 3 per cent of 
GDP.
<P>
	I will make two comments on this. First, if they want to reduce 
the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP by continuing to slash social 
programs enthusiastically, they are on the wrong track. People 
are fed up with this government's hypocrisy. They are fed up 
with the red book telling them that they will be protected against 
underemployment or other social problems they may face and 
with a government that has been doing exactly the opposite in 
the past year.
<P>
	The government has cut UI and stopped contributing to the UI 
fund. It is raising the spectre of additional cuts in transfers for 
social assistance, post-secondary education and even pensions. 
They have been talking about it on that side of the House for 
about six months. People are fed up with the Liberals' actions, 
which are not consistent with the reasons they were elected in 
October 1993.
<P>
	Second, let me reiterate that even if the government managed 
to reduce the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP by 1996-97, it would 
not solve anything, and that is a little indecent. They tell us 
every day that they will reduce the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP 
and solve everything, but that will not solve anything. In 
1996-97, we will still be saddled with a $25 billion deficit and, 
most importantly, with a debt approaching $625 billion. So they 
are not solving the problem. They are behaving like a 
government that only cares about being re-elected in three 
years.
<P>
	From a structural point of view, they are not solving the 
federal debt problem at all. With a $625 billion debt, the 
problem will be just as serious in 1996-97 as it is today; the 
public finance crisis will be as serious as it is today. That is, in 
my opinion, Canada's biggest problem. There are other 
problems but that is the biggest one.
<P>
	Despite the gravity of the problem, this government, which 
bragged during the election campaign of wanting to create as 
many jobs as possible, is doing, in my opinion, the opposite of 
what it should be doing as a result of its attitude toward public 
finance.
<P>
	The debt is so big that going after domestic savings to 
periodically finance part of this debt pushes up interest rates. 
Interest rates are going up in this country. The Minister of 
Finance has lost his credibility with international investors, who 
are demanding higher yields, and this is also putting upward 
pressure on interest rates, which in turn affects our national 
interest rates.
<P>
	If you happen to be an investor and want to invest money and 
create jobs, you will invest less and create fewer jobs because of 
high interest rates due to the pressure of the debt on the 
Canadian economy, the so-called crowding out effect, and it 
will not be any different in 1996-97. This jeopardizes our 
chances of experiencing a really strong economic recovery with 
substantial job creation.
<P>
	When we consider how job creation has evolved during the 
past two and half years since the end of the recession, or at least 
its end in technical terms, it should come as no surprise that in 
Canada we are still about 800,000 jobs short of reaching the 
same labour force participation rate that existed before the first 
quarter of 1990 or before the recession began. And this is all 
because of the federal debt.
<P>
	Even the Department of Finance has calculated that structural 
unemployment is at 8.5 per cent, in Canada, because of the size 
of the debt. Even with an economy that is doing well, even when 
the circumstances for job creation are ideal, the unemployment 
rate is around 8.5 per cent because of the size of the debt and the 
pressure of the debt on the economy, and the situation will not 
change until the structural problems besetting Canada's public 
finances have been solved.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	That is the situation, and I do not think there is any reason for 
members on the other side to be proud of what the Minister of 
Finance has accomplished in one year. If I were the minister, I 
would be ashamed, and if I were the government, I would be 
even more so.
<P>
	In any case, and I have a few minutes left, the official 
opposition wanted to make its own contribution last October 
when the Minister of Finance appeared before the committee, 
and we repeated our suggestions last December when the Liberal 
majority tabled its report on pre-budget consultations. We 
wanted to make a short-term contribution that would at least 
reduce the impact of the deficit and give the Minister of Finance 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9573"> 9573 </A></B>
<P>
a chance to brag that he would hit his 3 per cent of GDP target. 
We wanted to submit recommendations as an alternative to the 
drastic cuts in social programs which the government has made 
and plans to continue.
<P>
	We made ten recommendations, and I will mention the first 
eight, which are the most important ones. The first one, and I 
want the Secretary of State for Finance to listen very carefully, 
because although his minister realizes we made 
recommendations, he himself insists we never did, or maybe he 
cannot read and in that case, he should learn or at least find out 
about the recommendations enclosed with the report tabled by 
the Finance Committee last December.
<P>
	The first recommendation we submitted to the Minister of 
Finance, to help him be on target with his deficit of 3 per cent of 
GDP in 1996-97, was that the federal government should 
withdraw altogether from areas under provincial jurisdiction. 
For Quebec alone, this means a savings of $2 to $3 billion a year 
by eliminating overlap, duplication and redundant 
administration.
<P>
	The second recommendation we made to the Minister of 
Finance-and we are still waiting for him and his team to 
analyse these recommendations-is that we stop giving 
subsidies to business, which, last year, amounted to $3.3 billion 
and which are, more often than not, a form of patronage for 
friends of the Liberal Party of Canada rather than real support to 
business in meeting the challenges of globalization. Here then is 
$3 billion; a big savings in reaching the goal of reducing the 
federal deficit to 3 per cent of the GDP in 1996-97.
<P>
	The third recommendation we made to the Minister of 
Finance, and we continue to stand by it, was to make a further 
cut of at least $1.6 billion in the national defence budget. This 
would have meant a 25 per cent cut in the defence budget over 
the past two years. This corresponds to the analysis we made 
during the electoral campaign. We held that, even with a 25 per 
cent budget cut, national defence could retain its past and 
present efficiency in a world of reduced international tensions.
<P>
	The fourth recommendation, and we still make this 
recommendation to the federal government, which claims to 
want to avoid white elephants and wastage, is that, if it wants to 
maintain some credibility, it withdraw from the Hibernia 
project, which has already absorbed some $3 billion with no 
promise of producing any profits within the next twenty years. If 
this government wants to do something other than playing 
politics, if it wants to be taken seriously, it must withdraw from 
the Hibernia project.
<P>
	The fifth recommendation, one we have been making for a 
long time-but I think the Liberal government lacks 
transparency-is for a complete review of the taxation system. 
Complete, from A to Z, including the 16 tax treaties signed 
between Canada and several countries which are, in fact, 
regarded as tax havens.
<P>
	Businesses can claim operating losses abroad, repatriate these 
losses, though they are fictitious losses, and deduct them from 
their Canadian income to avoid paying taxes. That too is a major 
problem, and will become an even bigger one if allowed to 
continue.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	We had also asked, in the context of this taxation review, that 
the privileges associated with family trusts be eliminated. 
Shortly before adjournment, we made a motion in the finance 
committee which was readily defeated by Liberals and 
Reformers. Why? Because it affected privileges enjoyed by 
their buddies, the wealthiest of Canadians, who avoid taxes year 
after year by paying no tax on capital gains or on personal 
fortunes valued at several hundred million if not several billion 
dollars. We cannot quote the precise figure because, although 
the Minister of Finance is ostensibly in favour of transparency, 
his department does not want to conduct the studies necessary to 
determine the true value of these tax loopholes.
<P>
	The seventh recommendation would be to impose a true 
minimum tax on corporate profits. Not with the aim of adding to 
their tax burden, but because several thousand companies have 
paid no taxes in the last ten years. We must be sure, at least, that 
they are escaping taxes because of their specific production 
conditions and product-process cycles and not because they 
have hired tax experts to save money by not paying Canadian 
taxes.
<P>
	The eighth recommendation is one of the most important. I 
was saving it for the end. The auditor general even made the 
same recommendation, in his last report, regarding the $6.6 
billion that Canadians owe in unpaid income taxes. These are 
not amounts in dispute, but simply money owed to the federal 
government that has remained uncollected due to the 
government's lax approach and failure to allot the resources 
necessary to recover these amounts. The auditor general's own 
opinion is that 80 per cent of the amount owed, more than $5 
billion, could be recovered if only enough resources were 
available for the task.
<P>
	In conclusion, we too are not in favour of new general taxes, 
as was recommended in the Liberal majority reports from the 
finance committee, but at the same time, we recommend that the 
government find ways to improve, even in the slightest way, the 
state of Canada's public finances, at least on the short term, 
because we have very serious longer term problems.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (St. Paul's, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
behalf of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance 
I have a few comments I would like to make to the member 
opposite-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member cannot make 
comments on behalf of another member. He has to speak on his 
own behalf, not on behalf of someone else.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9574"> 9574 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that correction. 
Canadians might have a little sympathy for the government 
after seeing this spectacle of members opposite saying no taxes, 
while the opposition was saying through the last speaker no cuts 
and maybe we should have tax increases.
<P>
	What bothers me particularly about the last comments from 
the opposition critic are the internal consistencies in his very 
statement. Those members speak often about logic, yet I hear 
them say: ``We recommended a whole host of cuts. On one hand, 
cut national defence spending but of course not in Quebec. Cut 
Hibernia but help out MIL Davie'', which we heard much about 
in the months leading up to the Christmas recess.
<P>
	There were other thoughts about family trusts. The comments 
on family trusts, as in the minority report they proposed, reflect 
a complete misunderstanding of the role of trusts in Canada and 
the importance of family trusts to family businesses, to small 
businesses, to families; completely misrepresenting the 
importance and reality of trusts. In the fullness of time, I have 
confidence the finance committee will issue a majority report 
that sets the record straight.
<P>
	With respect to three per cent and the three per cent figure, on 
one hand we have members opposite saying that it is not enough. 
On the other hand we get criticized by the opposition critic for 
adjusting our outlook to take into account the real world, reality, 
and to make sure we get there.
<P>
<B>(1115 ) </B>
<P>
	When we meet that target it will be the first time in a long time 
that we have met a target in the right direction. It will go a great 
distance toward restoring the credibility that members opposite 
suggest is lacking in financial markets and go a great way 
toward restoring the confidence we should have in our ability to 
solve our problems.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, absolutely, I have a reply for my 
colleague, a reply to his three questions. Regarding 
inconsistency, because we are proposing cuts at the same time as 
we are asking for an increase in the national defence budget in 
Quebec, I would say that if there is any inconsistency, it is on the 
other side, not here. We have always been consistent with 
ourselves, with our option and, above all, with our analysis of 
the situation.
<P>
	At the present time, 17.4 per cent of national defence 
spending takes place in Quebec. We represent very close to a 
quarter of the population, or, if you consider it in terms of taxes 
paid, we pay almost 23 per cent of the taxes collected by the 
federal government, but we receive only 17.4 per cent of the 
spending. This means that there are others receiving more than 
they should in terms of population or in terms of their 
contribution to the federal coffers.
<P>
	What we have always said is that cuts should be across the 
board, but with an adjustment for Quebec. This is what happens 
in the case of agriculture, it is what happens in most areas. So, 
that dispenses with the first inconsistency.
<P>
	The second point was family trusts. My colleague claims that 
I have no idea of the importance of family trusts, but neither 
does he. And do you know why? Because we repeatedly asked 
the Finance Committee, senior officials in the finance 
department, the finance minister, the revenue minister, and 
senior officials in the revenue department to provide us with an 
exhaustive evaluation of how much money is in family trusts 
and the resultant losses in tax revenue to the federal coffers. So 
he can stop talking about the importance of family trusts, 
because he is just as much in the dark about them as we are.
<P>
	We have estimates and are at least trying to give some thought 
to the magnitude of tax losses resulting from trusts and from tax 
agreements. My colleague prefers to turn a blind eye to these 
fiscal inequalities. If we are going to talk about credibility, I 
would say that the Liberals should look in their own back yard. 
There has been no sign of credibility for a year and a half now.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to pose two questions to the hon. member who has just 
spoken in response to the member for St. Paul's.
<P>
	The first question is with regard to tax increases. The hon. 
member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot indicated that the Bloc as 
a party did not want tax increases. Then he went on to say that 
maybe there are some places where new taxes can be applied.
<P>
	Is the Bloc Quebecois saying there should be no net tax 
increases of any kind and that if there is a redistribution because 
of a change in tax policy, that if there is an increase in revenue in 
one area, it should be redistributed to other Canadians by way of 
a tax reduction? Is that the position of the Bloc Quebecois, no 
tax increases?
<P>
	I say that in light of some of the other comments and the other 
observations that I have made in this assembly. When we look at 
the cafeteria of social programs, unemployment insurance, 
post-secondary education, old age assistance and also the tax 
credit with regard to those people over 65, the Bloc did not want 
to allow or make the change that was recommended in the 
1994-95 budget.
<P>
	If we maintain all of those programs at their current level, 
how are we going to deal with the deficit and possibly maintain 
the tax policy that the hon. member recommended to the House?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9575"> 9575 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to comment on that first of all. 
Is his party in favour of no tax increases on a net basis?
<P>
	Second, with regard to family trusts, I am a member of the 
finance committee and I have been waiting for some type of a 
presentation which indicates that there is a major error in family 
trusts. Is the hon. member asking the finance committee or the 
government to pass legislation or some mechanism by which it 
is able to deal with people's private income and private bank 
accounts to derive what is the composition of a family trust?
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, in response to the first question on 
taxes, we do not want the Minister of Finance to raise taxes when 
he tables his next budget, or the one after that.
<P>
	However-and I have the feeling my colleague is having 
trouble reading our recommendations, does not understand them 
or does not want to understand them-, there are inequities in 
Canada's current tax system. There are so many inequities, as I 
demonstrated a little before the House adjourned last December, 
business taxation in Canada has become so ludicrous that some 
businesses even sell their unused tax deductions to other 
businesses. There was a classified advertisement in the 
newspaper offering a tax loss for sale to businesses that could 
use it. If you do not find this ludicrous, there is a problem.
<P>
	What we are saying is that there are loopholes to be closed, 
inequities to be corrected in our tax system. As a result, we have 
been recommending for a year and a half that the government 
undertake a comprehensive review of the tax system.
<P>
	We already know about the loopholes. The auditor general has 
already pointed out some of them. He mentioned the 16 tax 
treaties, saying that there were problems with them because they 
were often concluded with countries considered to be tax 
havens, where Canadian businesses open fictitious subsidiaries, 
report fictitious losses, and manage not to pay what they owe 
Revenue Canada.
<P>
	If you want to maintain these inequities, these loopholes, 
these inconsistencies, while asking Canadian men and women to 
tighten their belts another notch, there is a problem within the 
Reform Party although it is not the only problem.
<P>
	As for family trusts, let me reiterate that the Minister of 
Finance held out his hand to us by saying that he would let a 
finance subcommittee look into the matter of family trusts, that 
it would be given carte blanche, that his officials would visit the 
committee and do whatever it would ask them to do. It was a 
monumental farce.
<P>
	It was even, I would say-no, I will not say it because it would 
be unparliamentary-but it is a monumental farce. We had four 
months of regular hearings. We met with officials and experts. 
Imagine, the Liberal chair told the officials that they did not 
have to answer the questions. Enough is enough. There is a 
problem with respect to the relations between the government 
and senior officials. Senior officials can answer if they feel like 
it. They never responded to that.
<P>
	How can we propose specific measures when you and I along 
with my Liberal colleagues do not know what is happening with 
family trusts nor how much money we are losing as a result of 
the tax treaties.
<P>
	There is a lack of transparency, of understanding, and I think 
that it has become ridiculous.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Peterson (Willowdale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise in the House today on this important issue. It is 
very important that Canadians have access to the facts and to the 
issues that face us. We are going to be forced in the next budget 
to make some of the most difficult budgetary decisions that have 
been made in this Parliament's history, probably the most 
difficult decisions that we have had to make outside wartime.
<P>
	As Canadians know, the government inherited a national debt 
of $500 billion and an annual deficit that had gone up to over $45 
billion. As much as we politicians wish we could spend money 
on people and help people, we can no longer continue at this 
rate.
<P>
	If we do not get the deficits down and start to eventually 
reduce our national debt, we will continue to be even more 
hostage to the international capital markets whose investors are 
demanding higher and higher interest rates in order to fund our 
debt. It is a debt which is so enormous we can no longer fund it 
out of the pockets and the savings of Canadians alone.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	If we do not get the deficit down we will no longer be able to 
have the economic climate in which we can get lower interest 
rates, have more investment and create more jobs. Unless we are 
able to meet the deficit targets that have been set, every one of 
our social programs will be in jeopardy. We will not much longer 
be able to go on spending way beyond our means and yet create 
the type of Canada that all of us want.
<P>
	It is going to be a difficult task as we go about, over the next 
two years, of taking maybe $10 billion, $12 billion or even $14 
billion in budgetary actions, that is spending and/or tax 
increases.
<P>
	One of the things that we must continually bear in mind as we 
make these difficult decisions and choices is that when social 
programs are cut, programs designed to protect the most vulner-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9576"> 9576 </A></B>
<P>
able in our nation, it must be done with caution, with 
compassion and with care. For so many Canadians these 
programs are the only means to security, dignity and 
opportunity.
<P>
	In making the difficult decisions that we are called on to make 
and that we shall make, let us not only remember those who are 
most in need, but let us also remember that the burden should, to 
the extent possible, be shared fairly by all Canadians.
<P>
	We know and the finance committee in its report recognized 
that Canadians are just about at the ceiling of taxation. Personal 
income tax rates are very high. When they are combined with the 
taxes on commodities, the payroll taxes and municipal taxes, 
Canadians are saying: ``We want less. We are prepared to do 
with less. We cannot afford vastly higher taxes in order to 
continue the lifestyle to which we have become used''.
<P>
	However, they are also saying to us that when these cuts are 
made, please be fair. We will be judged, first of all on whether 
we meet those deficit targets, and we had better meet them, but 
we will be judged on whether we have done it fairly.
<P>
	When we cut social programs are we really asking the wealthy 
in our society to contribute? How are they bearing their fair 
share when all we are doing is cutting programs? We have $3.1 
billion in business subsidies. We want to get rid of all of those as 
quickly as we can. However realistically our committee looked 
at these, we said that we probably could not cut more than 36 per 
cent of those subsidies over the next two years. That will 
contribute slightly over a billion dollars to deficit reduction. It 
is not going to be enough.
<P>
	We may just have to suggest that the very well-off in our 
society contribute their share to the deficit reduction targets 
through a few added tax measures. This is why we suggested in 
our report that we could perhaps ask the large corporations, 
corporations with capital over $10 million who do not pay taxes 
because they have losses carried forward or they have capital 
cost allowances expenditures, to pay just a little bit more. 
Maybe we could ask Canadians who have huge winnings on 
lotteries to put 10 per cent or 15 per cent of the winnings toward 
the deficit reduction. Is it fair to say to wage earners that they 
will be taxed at 53 per cent or 54 per cent on their wages but that 
they can make a million dollars in a lottery and not pay any taxes 
at all?
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	We recognize our marginal tax rates over the past nine or ten 
years of Tory government have become less and less 
progressive. The wealthy in Canada are paying less tax 
proportionately than the poor and middle income Canadian have 
been asked to pay.
<P>
	We suggested that low and middle income Canadians should 
have their surtax reduced by one percentage point. We think this 
would introduce an element of fairness. In the overall package 
that we called for, recognizing that budget cuts must be the 
prime factor, we said that for about every $9 billion in 
expenditure cuts we might need about $1 billion in tax increases 
over the next two years. I do not believe Canadians are going to 
be reluctant to accept some of the proposed measures,  
particularly when they are expressed in terms of the fairness we 
must go about practising when all Canadians are asked to 
contribute to helping us get out of the mess we are in.
<P>
	The principle of fairness applies not only to the most 
disadvantaged of Canadians who need our programs in many 
cases. This does not mean that we should not reform our 
programs to help people get off welfare more quickly or to help 
them rely less on unemployment insurance. After all, we want 
Canadians want to be working and not be on the dole.
<P>
	In setting these difficult courses we have to start with 
ourselves in Parliament. We cannot ask Canadians to make 
greater sacrifices than we are prepared to make ourselves. This 
is why the first item of business must be the pensions of 
members of Parliament before we ask other Canadians to make 
their sacrifices. This is why we have called in our report for 
major areas to be cut, namely the $20 billion out of $120 billion 
in program spending. This $20 billion applies to our government 
operations, how we conduct our business and how we conduct 
our affairs. We have said that over two years it should be cut by 
12 per cent. In terms of parliamentarians in our own little niche, 
we have called for a cut of 15 per cent.
<P>
	I have mentioned business subsidies. We believe we can get 
rid of most of them over time. There are outstanding 
commitments that we just cannot break. Therefore we concluded 
that we had to be practical. About the most we can hope to get rid 
of over the next two years is 36 per cent. I believe the total 
amount would be slightly over $1 billion.
<P>
	We have to bring a new philosophy to how government deals 
with the private sector. If the only way a private sector 
enterprise can exist is through government handouts and 
government grants, it will not be long before we can no longer 
afford the grants and handouts. Not only that, it is not fair to 
legitimate operators who do not rely on the dole or do not rely on 
the deep pockets of government but compete with industries that 
get these breaks. Not only that. With the new trading regime, the 
GATT and the NAFTA, we have less and less ability to interfere 
in this way because subsidies will be subject to countervail.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	We are in a new world. We are in a world that many Canadians 
would not have believed 10 years ago that we would be facing 
today. The levers of control we had as a national government are 
no longer there. Whether we like it or not we have to live with 
the new reality of global competitiveness, international capital 
flows and international investment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9577"> 9577 </A></B>
<P>
	This will impose upon us new challenges. However one of 
the challenges cannot be grants to business. That is why we 
suggested abolishing all outright grants to business. We cannot 
give business a leg up by way of a loan because our capital 
markets are not working adequately to supply all small 
businesses and entrepreneurs with the startup capital they need.
<P>
	However, if we are to do it, let us do it only on a loan basis. We 
will lend the money but let us make sure that we have equity in 
the company. We do not want a one-way street for the public 
sector such that if the business goes under we lose it. We want to 
ensure that if the business profits from the investment we make 
by way of a loan there is an upside for us so that we have money 
to fund programs and to make them self-funding and 
self-liquidating.
<P>
	There are other areas where we have called for cuts. One such 
area is subsidies. We have about $7.7 billion in subsidies for 
various crown corporations and others like that. Let us start 
weaning them from subsidies. Here we have called for a 10 per 
cent cut. The lowest cut we called for was within the overall 
package of social programs worth about $40 billion at which the 
human resources development committee was looking. Because 
many of these programs go to the most vulnerable in our society 
we called for cuts of 7 per cent over two years.
<P>
	There is a number of areas in which the committee did not feel 
there could be cuts, such as Canada's native people, the Inuit and 
veterans, people who have a lot of catching up to do because our 
programs may not be working adequately to bring about the type 
of social justice they need.
<P>
	We were also very concerned about the aging population. 
Many Canadians have not provided for their own retirement 
needs. Too few Canadians are taking advantage of the very 
generous tax breaks available to provide for their own 
retirement. The ideal would be as our population ages that fewer 
Canadians have to rely on government.
<P>
	This is a major issue and none of us pretends to have the 
answer. That is why we suggested before changes were made to 
retirement provisions, pension plans and RRSPs that we had to 
take into consideration a number of principles. One is parity 
between public sector and private sector pensions. Another is 
the need of those who are self-employed and have to provide for 
their own retirement through registered retirement savings 
plans. They need to be able to build a pension fund comparable 
to those who have been in the private sector and have had long 
years of contributions to private pension plans.
<P>
	We also have to look at our public responsibility. Right now 
we are spending about $15 billion in forgone tax revenues-we 
can call them tax expenditures or whatever we want-to 
encourage self-sufficiency during retirement. Before we change 
this regime we should do so in the context of how we help more 
and more Canadians  provide for a secure and dignified 
retirement. We are becoming more and more an aging 
population.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	The challenge before us is not an easy one. We have called for 
getting our deficit down over a two-year period from about $40 
billion to about $25 billion. That is about 3 per cent of gross 
domestic product.
<P>
	Why is that 3 per cent level important? It is important because 
with the current growth that is the level where our economy will 
be growing more quickly than our national debt. That will be the 
turning point. It will only be one turning point. We will have to 
go much further in subsequent years. We will have to start at 
some point paying down a huge national debt that will absorb 
one-quarter of our national expenditures this year. It takes 
one-third of every tax dollar paid to the federal government.
<P>
	I hope we might be able to go slightly beyond the targets. 
Why? It is because we never know what the economic 
circumstances will be a few months down the road. We have 
seen the volatility of interest rates over the last three or four 
months that make the moderate projections in the papers tabled 
by the finance minister now seem passé. We are on to a new 
scenario. We do not know whether it will happen in the future 
but we must be prepared for it because our credibility depends 
on at least meeting those targets.
<P>
	We need a cushion. It is fundamental to have a cushion for an 
additional reason. Let us admit that we might make mistakes 
when making cuts that we are not used to doing and we are 
probably not going to be extremely good at doing. We might 
unduly prejudice individuals we did not intend to hurt. We might 
cause pain where it is not deserved. I know we will bring to these 
people a Liberal spirit of generosity in attempting to undo any 
harm that was not intended.
<P>
	Let us approach this tremendous challenge with the spirit of 
fairness and with the spirit that every Canadian must be called 
upon to contribute his or her fair share to getting our national 
resources and our financial picture in shape. Let us not achieve it 
on the backs of those who are most vulnerable in the country. Let 
us do it in a spirit of humility that we cannot be right 100 per cent 
of the time, that we will make mistakes and that we want to hear 
from Canadians as to where we have made those errors. If that is 
the case on reflection, let us freely admit that we have made a 
mistake and rectify it quickly.
<P>
	By following these principles we can go into the next decades 
with a much healthier Canada and with a much stronger Canada. 
We will be able to pass on to succeeding generations what our 
mothers and fathers have given us: a strong and united Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
before I became involved in politics which was only 15 months 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9578"> 9578 </A></B>
<P>
ago, I was wondering what was meant by the term code words in 
politics. I suggest code words are being used by the Liberals.
<P>
	With due respect to the chairman of the finance committee, 
when he uses the word ``fair'' and the phrase ``contribute their 
fair share'' what he is really talking about is a further tax 
increase. Taxes are simply the confiscation of wealth.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	It is absolutely outrageous that this government would be 
compounding the problems created by the Conservatives, 
particularly with the corporations, that when the corporations 
have a loss, a no profit year, the government would turn around 
and confiscate some of their working capital by virtue of the fact 
that it says they did not make a profit this year, therefore it is 
going to tax them. It is a simply confiscation of their ability to be 
able to fund their enterprise. It is absolutely outrageous.
<P>
	The top 10 per cent of people earning over the $51,000 figure 
pay 50 per cent of the income taxes. How much fairer can we 
possibly get? The top 1 per cent who earn over $100,000 pay 15 
per cent. How much fairer can we get? Is this not progressive 
enough?
<P>
	The reality is that according to well documented and fully 
accepted statistics, the average tax take on Canadians at all 
levels of government at this point is 46 cents out of every dollar. 
How much fairer can we get? Is there any more room in 
taxation?
<P>
	Considering that, let us get away from the $51,000 and the 
$100,000 ranges and talk about the average family income, a 
joint family income of $46,488. Consider that family spends 
$17,000 on food, clothing and shelter. However, with all levels 
of government as a result of past activity of the federal 
government down loading the taxation to other levels of 
government, that family with an after tax income of $46,488, 
$17,000 of which is spent on food, clothing and shelter, has a tax 
bill of $21,000, which is $4,000 more than it costs to cover food, 
clothing and shelter.
<P>
	Does the chairman not believe that there is no more room, no 
net tax increase, that this is the only position this government 
can take?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peterson:</B> Madam Speaker, I do not believe that for one 
minute.
<P>
	There are some inconsistencies here. The hon. member has 
talked about down loading. That is the concept whereby when 
we make cuts in program spending or transfers to the provinces, 
are those services going to be performed at a lower level of 
government, either the provincial or municipal government?
<P>
	In some cases those services will not be performed because 
there is no money available. As the member points out, 
provinces have increased their taxes in response to certain down 
loadings that have taken place. Is he saying that we should not be 
downloading this time? Why are they calling for cuts in 
transfers-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Provide tax room.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peterson:</B> That is to me a great inconsistency. The 
member has also said that a large corporation with $10 million 
in capital that is running at a loss position should not have to pay 
taxes. I agree. However, if the corporation apart from loss 
carryovers and apart from capital cost allowances is actually 
experiencing a profitable year in terms of income but not in 
terms of taxable income, perhaps it could contribute a little 
more to our deficit reduction. I do not consider that unfair.
<P>
	If the member is making the point that we are highly taxed, he 
is right. We cannot argue with this. Canadians realize this. 
However, this is the party that said no new taxes whatsoever. 
Then in the next breath it said it will tax the Governor General. 
In other words, there are no hard and fast absolute rules.
<P>
<B>(1150 ) </B>
<P>
	Let us look at each particular tax measure to see if we can 
afford it, if it would make us non-competitive, if it would have 
adverse consequences. Let us look at these things with an open 
mind.
<P>
	I go back to the fundamental premise. I cannot guarantee that 
our entire tax system is fair today, that everybody is paying their 
fair share of taxes. We know that overall we are just about at the 
limit. We found over two years $1.1 billion in possible net tax 
increases that we thought might work. Two hundred million 
dollars out of the proceeds of lotteries; is it unfair that we should 
have a 10 or 15 per cent tax on $1 million won through a lottery?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Taxing a dream.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peterson:</B> The hon. member says it is taxing a dream. We 
are also taking 15 per cent out of $1 million which was unearned 
as opposed to taking over 50 per cent out of the pocket of the 
person who has to toil all day long in order to earn that wage. Is 
that the concept of fairness?
<P>
	I hope we do not approach this from an absolute statistic point 
of view. There may be certain cases in which only tax increases 
will give rise to that fairness but we face another problem, as the 
hon. members know. When we cut federal programs we do not 
often in the first year or in the second year obtain actual savings.
<P>
	When we close down a military base and put people on the 
street do we actually save in expenditures when we have to 
provide for unemployment, severance, reconfiguring the land, 
getting rid of equipment and materials and things like this? We 
do not always have savings in the first two years.
<P>
	I believe our deficit crisis is such that we have to meet our 
targets that we have set and we have to meet them within the 
time limit we set. Therefore expenditure cuts alone, while they 
will produce the savings we need over the longer term, may not 
work adequately in the first two years. This is why we may need 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9579"> 9579 </A></B>
<P>
a little tax room on a  temporary basis during the first one or two 
years in order to meet those targets.
<P>
	I hope that Canadians will keep an open mind when they see 
the program, when they see the budget that comes down. I hope 
they will come to the conclusion that the single most important 
thing we must do is meet our deficit reduction targets.
<P>
	The second most important priority is how we meet them. If 
we had to have minor tax adjustments in order to meet those 
targets, in order to be fair I believe that Canadians would say 
they do not like them, they may not like the cuts we have 
imposed but they will judge our overall budget package in terms 
of all of its aspects; who has been hurt through the cuts, who is 
hurt through the tax increases, minor as they may be, if there are 
any. We will be prepared to be judged on the basis of that entire 
package.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
have a question for the hon. member for Willowdale.
<P>
	The hon. member talked about this government's 
commitment to balancing the budget and he talked about the 
target of its very weak goal of 3 per cent of GDP in three years.
<P>
	The interesting thing about that is it is a moving target. It has 
been much more rapidly moving than economic growth. The 
government started out talking about $22 billion. Lately the talk 
has been of $25 billion. It is a rapidly moving target.
<P>
	The hon. member talked about economic growth and how it 
has been much higher than what was forecast. The interesting 
thing is that although economic growth has been much higher 
than forecasts I have not seen an acceleration in the reduction of 
the deficit to correspond with this income which was not 
anticipated.
<P>
<B>(1155 ) </B>
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member why there has not been a 
reduction in the three year target to correspond with the 
unexpected increase in growth.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peterson:</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to respond to 
that. All Canadians need an answer.
<P>
	The member is right. Our growth in Canada has been higher 
than the norm that was set out, the target that was set out, the 
standard that was set out in the finance minister's economic 
analysis. All of us on all sides of the House I believe are pleased 
that our growth has been this vigorous. It means we are creating 
more jobs. It means we have unemployment down from over 11 
per cent when we took office to under 10 per cent now. This is 
very encouraging because the reason we have to meet deficit 
targets is not an abstract study. It is not just because we want the 
deficit down. It is because we want to help the economy that can 
create the jobs and the opportunities.
<P>
	Offside right now in terms of the targets, in spite of excellent 
growth, the interest rates have gone much higher than we 
thought. That is the problem and that is one of the reasons we 
have to meet our targets and get them down. It is one of the main 
reasons we will.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Because the Chair 
recognized a Liberal prior to a Reform member, we will be doing 
two blocks of Reform speakers beginning with the hon. member 
for Lethbridge.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to give notice to the chair that Reform intends to 
divide its time from this period forward.
<P>
	The resolution that we have before us that was placed on the 
Order Paper by the hon. member for Capilano-Howe Sound 
makes a very clear point not only to this House but to Canadians 
that we believe there should be no net tax increases at all used to 
eliminate the deficit that we face in this country. I think that 
should be the focus of the debate here today.
<P>
	Canadians have told us very clearly, as a Reform caucus, that 
is the message that should be brought to this House. I have found 
in the last few days that the rate of mail that deals with the matter 
of taxes has increased significantly. For example, this morning I 
had 80 letters delivered to my office which sent a clear message 
that there should be no new taxes or no net tax increase of any 
kind in the upcoming budget expected at the end of February 
1995. I think that is a message we should listen to and not ignore 
it at all when we are debating this issue.
<P>
	It is important that this resolution is on the floor here today 
prior to the finalization of the 1995-96 budget because the 
minister and the Liberal government must hear a clear message. 
By debating this supply motion I think the clear message can be 
presented here on behalf of Canadians.
<P>
	I want to put into the record a copy of a letter I received that 
was directed to the finance minister. I have the approval of the 
author of this letter to make it available in this House if 
necessary. The letter comes from a resident of my constituency 
from Magrath, Alberta, Mr. McClung. I thought he put this tax 
question clearly on the table as a middle income taxpayer of 
Canada.
<P>
	He said this to our finance minister as of January 31, 1995: 
``Sir, I am mad as hell and I am not going to take it any more. 
Don't raise taxes, cut your spending. If you raise taxes on 
gasoline I will be forced by you to cut back on my driving. If you 
raise taxes on milk I will drink water. If you raise taxes on goods 
and services I will cut back on my purchases of taxed goods and 
services. If you raise taxes on my income I will be forced by you 
to again follow the above pattern.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9580"> 9580 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1200 ) </B>
<P>
	``In my workforce lifetime of 36 years I have seen my take 
home pay dwindle and my purchasing power of that take home 
pay dwindle to the extent that I now need a second job in order to 
pay for my basic needs of shelter, food, clothing and 
transportation.
<P>
	``Your suggestion of raising taxes is revolting. It will not fly 
this time. This is a revolt against higher taxes. Follow the lead 
from the states in the United States who have raised taxes and 
achieved the negative revenue increase and from those states 
who have lowered taxes and have achieved their goal of 
increased revenues''.
<P>
	His final advice to the minister is this: ``Tighten your belt as I 
have tightened mine''. Thousands and thousands of Canadians 
want that message placed on the floor of the House of Commons 
prior to the delivery of the 1995-96 budget.
<P>
	Canadians do not only feel very strongly about taxes not being 
increased, but they also feel they are not getting value for their 
dollar. They also feel they are not getting the services nor the 
results from that dollar that is sent to Ottawa where it is 
redistributed in a variety of ways.
<P>
	They asked this very basic question. ``Where were our tax 
dollars being spent? I cannot see any difference, except that I 
have less left over at the end of the day''. They have less in their 
pockets to spend on their own personal needs. If we look at some 
of the statistics available to us, that comment is only reinforced 
and confirmed in many ways.
<P>
	Canadians today are paying more in taxes but a smaller 
percentage of these dollars are really being spent on services. In 
1961 the average family's tax bill was 22 per cent of the family 
income. Today in 1994 the average family's tax bill is 46 per 
cent of that respective income.
<P>
	I know we have all heard the projection as to how many 
months of the year we pay taxes to various forms of government. 
Not too long ago we paid taxes until the month of May. Now we 
are paying taxes until the month of June and then after the month 
of June we have some money left over for our own personal 
needs and support for our family responsibilities.
<P>
	We also find that since 1980 alone the average family's tax 
bill has increased on average by $3,500. That includes a variety 
of taxes that are paid. That is a major increase, a major 
imposition on Canadians.
<P>
	If we look at the other side of what is happening in terms of 
services, we will see the other part of this paradox that 
Canadians talk about, the fact that there are less services. I have 
heard that expounded here in this assembly.
<P>
	People today find that crime is spreading. There is more 
crime, more dollars are being spent. This country's roads, 
bridges and infrastructure are somewhat deteriorating. The 
government is trying to shore that up  with some kind of an 
infrastructure program that really did not directed to roads and 
bridges like it should have.
<P>
	It got involved in a lot of other hobby projects and projects 
that seemed to be the pet objectives of local, provincial and 
federal politicians, but not on target in terms of what is really the 
basic infrastructure. Look at hospital beds for example across 
Canada. Waiting lists have been growing while we have been 
spending more and taxing more on the Canadian people.
<P>
	The question is obvious. Why has this happened? It is because 
of our debt. We owe too much money and it is costing us too 
much to keep on going the way we have been. In fact, if we look 
at it in a small segment of time, every minute costs us $86,000 in 
terms of interest on the debt. Interest on the debt was about 10 
per cent of government spending in 1974. Today it is over 25 per 
cent. In other words, 25 cents out of every dollar that 
government spends goes to pay the interest on the debt. That is 
not good enough.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Willowdale has made a very eloquent 
speech in this House. He said that the job is tough. It is a difficult 
job to face this deficit question and the government is going to 
stand up to it. He also said in those remarks-and I hear other 
Liberal members saying it at the same time-that we are going 
to introduce new taxes when the budget is brought down at the 
end of February.
<P>
	The hon. member for Willowdale said: ``We are just about at 
the ceiling''. Those are the kind of weaselly words we use 
sometimes as politicians to say: ``We are going to do something. 
We do not think we have pressed you hard enough. We do not 
think we have taken enough from you. We are just about there 
but we can take more''.
<P>
	In the Reform Party we believe we are at the ceiling. 
Canadians believe we are at the ceiling. We have paid enough 
taxes and there is no room between us and the ceiling of 
taxation.
<P>
	The government has made a great case to Canadians about the 
fact that we have to create jobs. If we tax more, what is going to 
happen to the jobs?
<P>
	The question was raised earlier about the hurt in terms of 
taxes and the economy. We know it will hurt individuals. We 
know it will hurt the budget of this country. Every 1 per cent 
increase in our interest rates, which is a direct result of increased 
taxes, will create a problem. I do not think that is acceptable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to the hon. member's 
presentation this morning.
<P>
	One of the things I should tell him and other members of the 
Reform Party is that they are not the only party or the only body 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9581"> 9581 </A></B>
<P>
to invent public forums to create the opportunity for people to 
provide direct input to their  members. Like the Minister of 
Finance and many other members of this House, I have had 
many public forums.
<P>
	Last fall we talked about the debt and the deficit. We talked 
about the ratio of offshore debt which we currently have and the 
concerns which that gave all of us here in this House as well as 
Canadians.
<P>
	He referred to the goal this government had set of bringing our 
debt under control over the next three years, starting with the 
current year of bringing the deficit down to $39.7 billion, to go 
on to $32.7 billion and $25 billion in the third year, to reach our 
3 per cent of gross domestic product. I want to assure the hon. 
member across the way that is only the first goal. The second 
goal will be to achieve a balanced budget as we go on to tackle 
and to break the back of the debt which this country has.
<P>
	One of the things I have often heard from that side of the 
House is: Let us fill those loopholes that are in our taxation 
system; I am sure learned accountants across the country will 
find new ones if new taxation forms, but let us fill them. The 
minister has indicated on many occasions that he will make 
every attempt to fill those loopholes.
<P>
	The system which we have to work with today, which has been 
inherited and has been added to over many years is cumbersome. 
We would like to streamline it. There is no question it needs to 
be done. I believe the minister will make every attempt to fill 
those loopholes to make our tax system more fair and equitable 
to all Canadians, regardless of whether they are in the upper 
echelon of social status, in the middle income group, or in the 
lower income group. That is what balance and equity are all 
about.
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
	There will be those who will consider that attempt to fill in 
those tax loopholes as a tax increase, no question. Anyone it is 
going to affect will consider it a tax increase.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member across the way if that is 
not really indeed what he and his party stands for and would 
support and which the minister, I certainly hope, will bring forth 
in his budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Madam Speaker, the Reform 
Party believes there should be no net tax increase in terms of 
revenue to the Government of Canada. There is adequate 
revenue to support the programs that are here with a change in 
some priorities. That is number one.
<P>
	If we plug a loophole somewhere which increases revenue, 
that should not mean we increase the overall revenue but we 
should then look at reducing tax somewhere else to the benefit of 
Canadians which may create some jobs in the marketplace. That 
would be a good transfer if it is possible. We are not against the 
plugging of loopholes for fairness, whatever that term means.
<P>
	On the other side of the balance scale, expenditure reduction 
and deficit elimination is the road to which we can balance the 
budget and bring our fiscal house in proper order. We do not 
believe that 1 per cent of GDP expenditure reduction in three 
subsequent years will hurt or harm our economy in any way. 
That is a goal that could be achieved.
<P>
	The government should look at that. The government is not. It 
is going to, as the member has stated, work toward the objective 
of 3 per cent of GDP, which will accumulate another $100 
billion on top of our debt. This means that our interest payments 
may go from $40 billion to $50 billion which I think Canadians 
do not want to tolerate at this time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
today our country stands at a crossroads. Some say it is a 
watershed year for Canada. Two very crucial issues must be 
addressed as we go further into 1995, a year that could very well 
be the most decisive since Confederation.
<P>
	The most important issue which must be addressed this year is 
the national deficit and debt crisis. It is growing by $110 million 
per day because of federal government mismanagement. The 
public is becoming all too aware of the effects of big 
government, big spending and big debt.
<P>
	My colleagues alluded to the effects which are upward 
fluctuating interest rates, downward pressure on the dollar, 
higher taxes, lower consumer and investor confidence, and of 
course a lower standard of living.
<P>
	It is interesting to examine what has happened to Canada's 
fiscal health since the 1960s. That decade rushed in the era of 
soak everyone, pay everyone's style of government, a 
government that would create a host of programs to look after 
the people, the creation of the just society.
<P>
	Now we see the results of the so-called just society. We have 
the social welfare state, unsafe streets and the average family's 
tax bill which has soared by 1,200 per cent since 1961. That is 
three times the rate of inflation.
<P>
	The time of government largesse must stop. The Canadian 
public is demanding balanced books from all levels of 
government. People are tired of paying for programs they never 
wanted, they never asked for and they certainly do not want to 
pay for.
<P>
	That is why the Reform's supply motion is so important. We 
are asking that the federal government respond to the demands 
of Canadians for decisive spending cuts and no net tax increases 
to eliminate the deficit and to produce a smaller federal 
government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9582"> 9582 </A></B>
<P>
	My constituents are expressing their dismay over continued 
federal government mismanagement of their tax dollars. Like 
my colleague before me, I receive letters as well, lots of them.
<P>
	Patrick W. Paul, a concerned taxpayer who lives in Edson in 
my Alberta riding of Yellowhead, expressed his sentiments in a 
letter to the finance minister. I have his permission to refer to it: 
Mr. Paul writes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I would like to express my extreme concern over the fiscal quagmire our 
country of Canada has descended into. The taxpayers of our country have been 
forced to shoulder the burden of government fiscal mismanagement for too long. 
It is time for government to change. Increased taxes, year after year, rampant out 
of control government spending, rising interest rates and an ever downward 
spiralling dollar have caused tremendous pressure on the Canadian taxpayer.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Massive government bureaucracy, ridiculous social programs and paper tiger 
politicians are costing us too much. We cannot continue. We are the source of 
ridicule around the world, from the world press to even more seriously the world 
financial community. Our out of control debt, weak willed politicians and 
rudderless leadership are the sources of this ridicule.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	Patrick Paul shares the opinion of most of my constituents 
who have taken the time to phone, to write or to stop me on the 
street. It is coffee shop talk. They want accountability. They 
want the federal government spending spree to stop.
<P>
	Mr. Paul continues in his letter to the finance minister:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Now is the time to stop this lunacy. Use your mandate to dramatically reduce 
government spending and the size of government. This budget must reflect an 
immediate move by government to correct our problem. Do not increase taxes 
in any way, shape or form! Do not attack my pension plan through any 
alterations to the RRSP program-this is my pension plan, not yours. Do not 
approach this in a cavalier manner. There is no accountability in the federal 
political system, only pandering to special interest groups, lip service and finger 
pointing. Stand up, do the right thing and make the necessary cuts required. 
Accept the responsibility of your position, be accountable for your actions. 
Help your country. We are doing all we can.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Like so many Canadians, Mr. Paul has a warning for the 
finance minister and his government:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If this process does not begin with the new budget and there are no significant 
moves to correct this out of control situation, I promise that I will do everything 
in my power to contribute to the defeat of your party in the next election.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Despite the most serious warning from the taxpayers and 
voters of Canada this government continues to be 
unaccountable. We keep hearing through the media about 
possible tax increases in a few areas. People are demanding 
accountability. Unaccountability also takes form through the 
convoluted, cooked up answers we receive from the Liberal 
government regarding government spending.
<P>
	Last week my colleague from Fraser Valley West asked a 
pertinent question regarding a suspect federal expenditure. He 
specifically questioned the merit of a grant for $33,800 for the 
study of major league baseball  in Detroit and how this possibly 
benefits the taxpayers of this country?
<P>
	The Secretary of State for Science, Research and Technology 
expounded a typical non-answer and told the House: ``The 
Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, an 
independent arm's length body, has done a great service to 
university researchers and has provided a very important 
foundation for knowledge in the country''. Since when is the 
knowledge of the Detroit Tigers baseball team between 1945 
and 1992 of any importance to the knowledge base in Canada?
<P>
	The Secretary of State for Science, Research and 
Development does not have a monopoly on unaccountable 
answers in this place. The Minister for Western Economic 
Diversification is also good at dodging the issue of 
accountability of public funds. I asked him about spending in his 
department last week. He reply was filled with more rhetoric 
than substance.
<P>
	I recently released a critical report of the Department of 
Western Economic Diversification. This 36 page document 
points out the inherent flaws of regional development programs, 
including using government money to subsidize private 
industry, distorting the competitive marketplace and pork 
barrelling.
<P>
	The report I released, based on date received from the WED 
department, showed that the minister's home town of Winnipeg 
received a disproportionate amount of WED dollars between 
November 1, 1993 and November 15, 1994. The figures used in 
this report included a list of all the projects both announced and 
published by the department during that year. It shows Winnipeg 
received five times more than Vancouver, seven times more than 
Calgary and seventy times more than Regina.
<P>
	In defence of this program the WED minister said there is 
another 80 per cent of projects which have not been announced 
yet.
<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	I refer to an editorial which recently ran in the Vancouver <I>Sun</I> 
which sums up the absurdity of trying to defend this pork barrel 
program. The editorial is aptly entitled ``The Sage of 
Patronage'' and begins: ``And the prize for the worst political 
defence of 1995-yes, it's early but we just can't believe anyone 
will outdo this-goes to the staff of minister for Manitoba 
patronage, Lloyd Axworthy. Alberta Reform MP Breitkreuz 
pointed out that while Manitoba, population one million, had 
received $22 million between November 1, 1993 and November 
15, 1994, British Columbia with a population of 3.3 million 
received $52 million. That is $22 a head for Manitobans, $15.75 
for British Columbians''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9583"> 9583 </A></B>
<P>
	The editorial goes on to state: ``Not fair, said Mr. Axworthy's 
communications assistant. A better comparison, she said, 
would include all projects which have been approved but not 
yet announced. Using her figures we see that while Winnipeg, 
population 652,000-plus, received $27.4 million, greater 
Vancouver with a population of 1.6 million received $19 
million. That is $42 for every Winnipeger as against something 
less than $12 per head in greater Vancouver''.
<P>
	In trying to defend this program we see Winnipeg gets even 
more money than is stated in my report.
<P>
	The taxpayers of Canada are tired of politicians trying to 
preserve the status quo because it is painfully obvious that the 
status quo no longer works. They want and demand their federal 
government to be fiscally responsible. The upcoming federal 
budget gives the government a chance to prove to Canadians that 
it is capable of acting in the best interest of the majority of 
taxpayers and cut spending, priorize spending to do the right 
thing for Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened with interest to my fellow colleague.
<P>
	All of us are opposed to tax increases. In my lifetime I do not 
remember anyone ever saying that they were in favour of tax 
increases. I can go back 20 or 30 years, I do not remember 
anybody saying that they liked the concept of tax increases.
<P>
	I am surprised by some of the attitudes of the members of the 
Reform Party toward changes in expenditures. For instance, I 
heard the previous speaker talk in terms of any changes in 
revenue that came through a redefinition of taxation 
expenditures should somehow be turned around and given back. 
In other words, it should not be used to reduce the deficit.
<P>
	At the same time, the same people are telling us that we are 
not moving fast enough on deficit reduction. I am getting mixed 
messages. I do not quite understand what they are trying to say.
<P>
	RRSPs are a good example. The previous government raised 
RRSP exemption levels to $13,500, that is income levels for 
individuals earning $75,000. A proposal that I have had is to 
reduce that down to $9,000. With a $9,000 exemption that would 
be somebody with a $50,000 income. The object of the exercise 
would be that people earning over $50,000 surely can save for 
their own retirement without getting assistance from the 
taxpayers of Canada.
<P>
	A second aspect of this also has to do with the foreign 
component of registered retirement savings plans. Currently we 
allow up to 20 per cent of RRSP funds to be held in foreign 
denominations. Once again the question is why is it that the 
Canadian taxpayer is allowing a tax deduction on their tax return 
simply so people can invest in foreign countries? It seems to me 
if people want to make the decision to invest in foreign countries 
they can do so without the credit of the taxpayers of the rest of 
Canada.
<P>
	I am often concerned when I hear people talk about loopholes 
and incentives.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	In my background as an accountant, today's incentives 
become tomorrow's loopholes. The loopholes we are talking 
about blocking today were probably yesterday's incentives.
<P>
	The other aspect about no more taxes, of which I am a 
believer, is the deficit. The reality is that a deficit is unpaid 
taxes. In other words, we did not pay enough taxes and that is 
how we created this deficit; or, as some my colleagues would 
argue, we spent too much relative to our tax base. Be that as it 
may, as of today the deficit represents taxes we have not paid. 
The bottom line is how are we going to resolve those kinds of 
problems?
<P>
	I have taken the time to work on a private member's bill which 
I hope to introduce this month that I call the taxpayers' bill of 
rights. The bill basically focuses on government spending and 
how government spending affects each and every individual. In 
other words, every time the government announces a program it 
should be visible and costed on a per taxpayer basis. It should 
allow the individual taxpayer choices and rights.
<P>
	Do they think a bill in that vein would be good for 
accountability? Why do they feel expenditure reduction should 
not be used in fighting the deficit?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yellowhead):</B> Madam Speaker, it will have 
to be very brief. I believe the member used almost my entire five 
minutes with some more Liberal rhetoric.
<P>
	We believe in a zero tax increase. We believe money is much 
better left in the hands of Canadian citizens than in the hands of 
politicians. The whole problem is not increased taxes, it is the 
money the government spends. It is definitely a spending 
problem, not a revenue problem.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I would not have thought it necessary to have 
this debate today. After the October 1993 election I thought the 
message would have sunk into whichever party formed the 
government.
<P>
	Canadians want decisive spending cuts, no net increases in 
taxes and a smaller, less interfering central government. What 
has happened? Since taking office the Liberal government 
immediately inflated the size of the deficit so when it was 
seemingly reduced it could pat itself on the back, saying job well 
done.
<P>
	By doing this Liberals avoided tough decisions. Then we had 
the costly cancellation of the helicopter EH-101 purchase. Long 
term, high tech jobs were lost and millions paid in cancellation 
fees. The Pearson airport contract was cancelled. An airport 
desperately in need of refurbishing is allowed to decay while the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9584"> 9584 </A></B>
<P>
Liberal government fights it out with developers over the costs 
of cancellation. Again, jobs are lost and taxpayers' money is to 
be paid out with no gain whatsoever.
<P>
	The infrastructure program begins. Billions of dollars 
borrowed for infrastructure programs by communities that 
needed jobs but not increased debt. We know that in a healthy 
economy it is the business sector that creates jobs, real jobs, and 
not the government through temporary government programs. 
As the unemployment figures released last week indicate, the 
jobs are not there anymore but the debt surely is and will be for 
years to come.
<P>
	Then in the 1994 budget it is handed down, the great wait until 
next time budget. Canadians sat in anxious anticipation, hoping 
at last a Liberal government would make tough decisions. Who 
were they kidding? The joke was on the people of Canada. The 
government they elected, this Liberal government, let them 
down. Spending programs abound in last year's government's 
budget.
<P>
	It is hard to imagine a government elected to make tough 
decisions using the old phrase that losing sports teams use, wait 
until next year. This is next year and there is still no sign of any 
willingness to take tough decisions. The government had a 
chance but really side stepped it.
<P>
	Canada was going to go through the most massive 
restructuring of the social welfare system since it was put in 
place. Studies began. The minister of human resources made 
grand announcements. Policy and discussion booklets were 
produced. Two sets of committee hearings were held. This 
committee of the House of Commons travelled across the 
country in both sets of hearings.
<P>
	Four million was given to 159 special interest groups. The 
people we should have heard from are regular, hard working 
Canadians who regularly pay their taxes and receive no special 
grants or privileges. However we heard from special interest 
groups to ensure that the committee heard testimony. And to 
what avail?
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	The minister of human resources announced that the 
government will have to deal with its budgetary problems before 
it will be able to get on with reforms. To paraphrase and perhaps 
combine a couple of old expressions, when the government's 
fiscal chickens came home to roost, they could not because the 
field was too full of social welfare sacred cows.
<P>
	The Liberals side stepped yet another decision to revamp and 
reshape our social system. It is hard to believe a government so 
early in its mandate would admit to be fresh out of new ideas.
<P>
	No one in Canada who has studied our social welfare system 
believes it needs more money thrown at it. If the government 
was not going to do anything, why did it spend all the money 
studying reform? How much did this exercise cost: $10 million, 
$20 million? Who knows, who cares? Obviously no one on the 
government side.
<P>
	We in the Reform Party care deeply. We care about the 
country and we care about its people. As elected members to this 
House we realize we owe the people of Canada a duty, a duty not 
just to criticize but to present alternatives. We believe that the 
country's financial situation must be addressed in a positive way 
before the next election.
<P>
	As a policy the Reform Party believes the solution to our 
deficit problem must be found on the expenditure side rather 
than on the revenue side. Presently the government has more 
than sufficient tax income.
<P>
	Canadians expect to pay taxes. Canadians expect the 
government to spend our tax dollars wisely. When the 
government mismanages our tax dollars as governments have 
been doing since the 1960s, Canadians get angry. We cannot 
blame our fellow Canadians for not wanting their hard earned 
tax dollars to be wasted on grants, unnecessary byelections, 
make work programs and government to government 
international aid, among other things.
<P>
	I recently heard a suggestion that the Liberals might bring in 
temporary tax increases. Let us not forget another temporary tax 
measure which was introduced many years ago. It is still with us 
today. It is called income tax. This tax takes the biggest bite out 
of our incomes. But it is not the GST, income tax or any other tax 
that is the problem. It is mismanagement. The problem is 
mismanagement of our tax dollars.
<P>
	As Reformers are saying, Canadians fear that the Liberal 
budget will be the worst of all worlds: spending cuts that are 
insufficient to lead to a balanced budget and solve the problem, 
combined with tax increases that reduce disposable income and 
kill jobs.
<P>
	As Reformers have said in the past, we believe the first 
change should come with reform of the MP pension plan. We are 
not talking about MPs' salaries, which from what I have seen 
since I have been in Ottawa indicates that MPs work very hard to 
earn their salaries. Cuts must also come in the institutions of 
government; the office of the Governor General, the Senate, the 
House of Commons, the Privy Council and the Prime Minister's 
office.
<P>
	We must look at excessive travel of senior officials and urge 
the government to reduce the number of ministers of state and 
associate ministers. Cut down the size of government. The 
Reform plan in the end is to have a smaller, less intrusive and 
more efficient federal government.
<P>
	We can include the electoral boundaries reform. Cut 
spending. We do not need 295 MPs in the House of Commons or 
300 plus, as the government is suggesting. Each MP costs 
Canadian taxpayers about $1 million. The country to the south 
of us has 270 million people to our 27 million. They have 
approximately 437 in government to our 295. Last week in 
Washington I met 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9585"> 9585 </A></B>
<P>
with American congressmen, congresswomen and constituents 
who told me their representation was very effective.
<P>
	Reform is on record for looking at federal funding to 
multiculturalism and the official languages program. These are 
just some of the examples where Reform would cut.
<P>
	We must protect law enforcement, health, education and our 
environment. We believe we must bring forward alternatives so 
Canadians can see there is another way other than the Liberal 
way. We see a need for a fresh, new vision of social policy in the 
next century, forwarded on the belief that the best guarantee 
governments can provide of individual personal security is to 
establish a framework of laws within which individuals can save 
for or insure against each of the contingencies that life may 
bring upon them.
<P>
	We believe in five guiding principles to support our vision of 
the future. First, build on the Canadian tradition of 
self-reliance, recognizing the family as the primary caregiver in 
society.
<P>
	Second, empower communities and charitable organizations 
to play an ever increasing rather than a diminishing role in social 
security.
<P>
	Third, provide temporary assistance to people who 
experience short term misfortune while ensuring that long term 
assistance is reserved for those who are generally incapable of 
providing for themselves.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	Fourth, where government must be involved in social service 
delivery, entrust the resources and the responsibility to that 
level of government which is closest to the people.
<P>
	Fifth, ensure that we can pay for security measures without 
borrowing more money.
<P>
	We believe that security must be provided against these types 
of problems. The first class of security need is for protection 
against personal catastrophes, such as a medical emergency or 
the death of a family's chief income earner.
<P>
	The second class of security need consists of needs that will 
arise reasonably far into the future but which are predictable. 
Most people will have such needs at some point in the future. 
One cannot insure against them but one can prepare for them. 
Typical needs in this class are post-secondary education, 
non-catastrophic health care, retirement income and periodic 
unemployment.
<P>
	The final class of security need is for intermediate help for 
those who have not been able to provide for themselves. This is 
the proper function of charity or, in the absence of it, 
government transfers.
<P>
	This is not the cruel and heartless vision of social reform that 
is attributed to us by the media. It is a system designed to deliver 
a sufficient level of income to ensure that nobody lives in 
poverty. Public assistance is to be directed at those who for 
reasons of physical disability or advanced age are incapable of 
providing for themselves. At the other end of the scale no one 
with enough to pay taxes would receive assistance and those 
who receive assistance would pay no tax.
<P>
	We must begin to rely on ourselves. We must rely on our 
families. We can no longer ask the government to provide 
personal security from the cradle to the grave.
<P>
	These are some of the ways in which we can achieve a 
government which is smaller but more effective; spending cuts 
which eliminate programs that are no longer useful but retain 
our much needed health care system and our criminal justice 
system.
<P>
	I hope the government is listening and will adopt these 
measures in its upcoming budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it gives me 
great pleasure to rise in the House today to support my hon. 
colleague's motion urging the government to deal with our 
budget crisis through spending cuts rather than new tax 
increases.
<P>
	I cannot stress enough how important it is to approach 
budgetary policy from the point of view that government in 
Canada is too big. There is a very simple reason why 
government spends too much. It tries to do too much. It tries to 
do things that it either cannot do at all or that it can do but does 
very badly.
<P>
	I brought up this point in discussing Bill C-65. I said then, and 
I say now, that unless the Liberal government understands where 
the deficit problem is coming from, it will not be able to solve it. 
I said that our spending problem comes from our big social 
programs and that no solution which fails to target them can 
allow us to deal with our spending problems.
<P>
	I also said then, as I say now, that we should listen to the 
Auditor General. We should make sure that when we devise a 
program we understand clearly what it is supposed to achieve. 
We should also make sure that we have a clear set of criteria to 
measure whether or not it has succeeded. We should shut it down 
if it is not succeeding and shows no signs of succeeding. That 
applies to the question of how to cut spending. It also applies to 
the question of whether to cut spending.
<P>
	Our fundamental objective is to balance the budget. A 
secondary objective is to balance it at a sufficiently low level. If 
the government were to balance its books by spending and by 
taking in taxes three-quarters of the GDP I would not be happy. 
We should certainly consider whether any budget balancing 
measures lead to a zero deficit at an acceptably low level of 
overall spending and taxation. Our main objective is to balance 
the budget.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9586"> 9586 </A></B>
<P>
	I know that the Liberals are still waving their little red book 
and claiming that 3 per cent of GDP is a good deficit target. 
It is not. It is painfully inadequate. Let us suppose that all we 
are setting out to do is to reduce the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP, 
to go over the cliff a little more slowly. How are we going to 
do it? What will our program be? How will we tell if it is 
working? What will we do if it is not?
<P>
	There are three ways to try to control the deficit. The first one 
is to raise taxes. The second one is to cut spending. The third one 
is to fiddle the books. In my home province of British Columbia 
they are getting pretty good at number three. I am not even going 
to consider it. The only thing that I am going to say is that 
leaving things like the Canada pension plan off budget is not a 
good idea.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	Let us assume that the federal government's books get neither 
better nor worse over the next few years. That leaves raising 
taxes or cutting spending. I do not think there is any big mystery 
about the appropriate yardstick for success or failure. Is the 
deficit getting bigger, staying about the same or is it getting 
smaller? By that standard, any reasonable person would 
conclude that what we have done over the past decade has failed.
<P>
	If members want a grim laugh go back and read some of the 
speeches by one Brian Mulroney while campaigning for the 
Prime Minister's job. Or go back and read the budgets of 
Michael Wilson or Don Mazankowski. Heck, read the budgets 
by the former Liberal finance minister, the Prime Minister. They 
all preach about the dangers of deficits and debt.
<P>
	It is absolutely amazing to see how many budgets are brought 
into this House and prefaced with the remarks that the deficit 
and the debt are the most primary concern of the government of 
the day. They all promise to bring budgets under control and I 
have no reason to think they were anything but sincere. Look at 
the method they chose: constant tax increases. Apply the 
yardstick. Did the deficit shrink appreciably? No, it did not.
<P>
	George Orwell once said it is the first duty of every intelligent 
person to state the obvious. I am about to state the obvious. Tax 
increases have been tried as a deficit reduction measure for a 
long time and they have failed. This is also true internationally. 
It is time therefore for us to recognize the wisdom of an 
observation by Nobel prize winning economist Milton 
Friedman: ``Governments will spend whatever they can take in 
plus whatever they can get away with''.
<P>
	The record is clear. Tax increases do not solve budget 
imbalances. Budget imbalances are caused by spending. They 
are caused by programs whose appetite is far greater than the tax 
system can deal with. No tax increases. Spending cuts.
<P>
	The problem is on the spending side. That is where the ducks 
are. As Ralph Klein from Alberta said: &quot;If you want to go duck 
hunting you have to hunt where the ducks are''.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to 
note that I will be sharing my time with the member for 
Carleton-Charlotte.
<P>
	I am pleased to participate in this supply day debate. It allows 
me to remind the House of a very important policy paper on the 
government's economic strategy by the Minister of Finance 
presented at the Standing Committee on Finance last fall.
<P>
	I know that Reform has little time and less interest in any 
prescription requiring more than a single syllable. Its formula 
for government, for the economy and for the budget is simply 
slash and burn. It has the same petulant one-syllable approach to 
even boosting revenues by improving tax system fairness, that 
is, no, no, no.
<P>
	I regret sounding so sarcastic but frankly that is the only 
reasonable response to a motion that sings a one-note song: cut 
the deficit. It proves that the Reform, a Johnny one-note party 
still cannot recognize the wider economic context that 
governments and budgets must address.
<P>
	The great political philosopher Edmund Burke said: ``The 
essence of tyranny is the denial of complexity''. Deficit 
reduction in a way that lays the foundation for deficit 
elimination is essential. That is why the government has staked 
out concrete targets for dramatic deficit cuts. We have made 
clear that the ultimate goal is deficit elimination. Just reducing 
or eliminating the deficit by itself will not sustain or secure the 
type of country most Canadians want and expect. At a time of 
accelerating technology and evolving skills, when almost one in 
ten Canadian workers are still jobless, even a balanced budget 
alone will not deliver the new opportunities they need.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	This is where our government differs so fundamentally from 
the Reform opposition. We understand because a majority of 
Canadians understand that Canada needs a disciplined strategy 
for economic security and growth.
<P>
	Under the previous government Canadians saw too often and 
too much what happens when a government implements 
spending cuts without clear guiding principles. It is like 
building a house without a blueprint. It is costly in the long run 
and then the roof falls in.
<P>
	That is why our government has set out the framework for 
economic policies we intend to build upon. The paper ``A New 
Framework for Economic Policy'' is a clear statement of 
objectives that will guide what the government will do and what 
it will not do. The logic and approaches of the 1960s simply are 
no 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9587"> 9587 </A></B>
<P>
longer good enough for a 21st century global arena. We cannot 
afford them and we will not succeed with them.
<P>
	Previous generations responded to the challenges of their eras 
by building the physical and social infrastructures of Canada. 
We too must create a new infrastructure for our time, the 
infrastructure of ideas and innovation. That is the thrust of our 
new framework paper. It proposes five key areas on which we 
must focus.
<P>
	The first is helping Canadians acquire the skills to get jobs, to 
keep jobs and to find better jobs. The facts are clear. Jobs for 
people with high school education or less are shrinking while 
jobs for those with education beyond high school are growing. 
In fact projections show that almost half the new jobs now being 
created require more than 16 years of education and training 
combined.
<P>
	I should add that there is a particular element of this challenge 
that engages small business. They do not have the resources of 
large firms to bring employees up to speed with the new skills 
that our information age increasingly demands. They depend on 
a public education system that can do its job.
<P>
	In terms of education the challenge in Canada is not money. 
We spend more on education than just about anyone else. What 
we need are better results. Individuals, employers and the 
government must co-operate and share responsibility for 
improving education and training.
<P>
	The second part of our framework is encouraging Canadians 
to adjust to change. Economic progress depends on a 
willingness to embrace new opportunities. It is our view that 
protecting and subsidizing business is almost always the wrong 
way to go.
<P>
	For that reason the government is going to change the entire 
approach to subsidies. Equally we believe regional economic 
assistance should focus on genuine opportunities such as 
tourism that have great potential to be self-sustaining. Further, 
we believe high payroll taxes are nothing more than a tax on 
hiring. That is why we have taken steps to reduce UI premiums.
<P>
	The third element of our framework is getting government 
right. Our attitude here is straightforward. It is time to make 
choices. We must eliminate or reduce lower priority activities 
and target scarce resources on the highest priority programs. 
That is one reason we are also trying to eliminate unnecessary 
federal regulations that cost Canadian business tens of billions 
of dollars every year.
<P>
	Regulatory reform has the potential to increase productivity, 
stimulate new investment and create a more cost efficient 
government. We have already reviewed more than half of the 
3,000 regulations on the books. We have eliminated 
one-quarter, left another quarter in place, and the rest are being 
revised or examined further.
<P>
	Providing leadership in the economy is the fourth objective. 
While the private sector creates jobs the government has a clear 
role in fostering economic growth. In our knowledge based 
economy success depends on skill and innovation. The 
government can contribute to this dynamic process by gathering 
and disseminating information and ideas about technology and 
new markets. As well it can play an important role in bringing 
business together, something that is critical in an economy 
where new firms are small and specialized.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	One priority is to do more to harness science and technology 
in order to improve productivity and growth. Government can 
help by building better links among industry, universities and 
government labs. It also has a particular role in making sure 
small business benefits from the latest know-how, particularly 
in the high technology sector.
<P>
	Trade is another area where government involvement is 
essential for success. Today more than ever Canada is an 
exporting nation. It is vital that more companies become 
exporters and that we look beyond our traditional markets to the 
emerging economies of Asia, Latin America and eastern Europe. 
Here the government can help by providing more information 
and by ensuring that small businesses have access to export 
financing.
<P>
	The fifth and final objective is absolutely essential to all 
others. We must create a healthy fiscal and monetary climate in 
Canada. If we do not meet this fiscal challenge, as the finance 
minister told the Standing Committee on Finance, we will fail at 
everything else.
<P>
	That is why we have staked out a rigid commitment to 
bringing the deficit down to 3 per cent of the economy in three 
years, effectively cutting it in half. That is why we have also 
made it clear that this deficit target is a first step in meeting our 
ultimate goal of eliminating the deficit completely.
<P>
	It would be absurd to claim that a single paper is the answer to 
curing Canada's future, but it is equally absurd to promote 
deficit elimination as a cure-all of every Canadian challenge. To 
me and I hope to all Canadians the evidence is clear. Our 
government has a vision of the role for government in building a 
more prosperous nation.
<P>
	The opposition would better serve its mandate by providing 
meaningful policy alternatives rather than simplistic motions 
without scope, without depth and especially without heart.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it 
is interesting the secretary of state, being as it were second in 
command just under the finance minister, delivered the speech 
that he did this morning. I do not think he or perhaps the 
government or perhaps the Liberal side understands that 
Canadians are concerned about a further tax grab, about further 
tax increases.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9588"> 9588 </A></B>
<P>
	While I respect the fact that the secretary of state gave us 
a nicely balanced speech about economic objectives, fostering 
economic growth and all these other things that are essential, 
nonetheless I would point out to him that what is concerning 
Canadians at this time, and I would suggest what is concerning 
foreign investment or people who are buying marketable 
securities offshore or outside the country, is that his 
government just does not seem to understand. It is an 
overexpenditure problem; it is not a taxation problem.
<P>
	I am fully aware that my comment and my follow-up question 
are not going to be directly on what he just spoke about, but I 
suggest with the greatest respect that his speech did not have 
anything to do with the topic that has been brought forward by 
the opposition, the Reform Party in this instance.
<P>
	I am sure that coming from the banking background and as an 
economist he would be aware of the fact that while corporate 
profits have dropped 10 per cent in the last 10 years corporate 
taxes at all levels, including compliance costs, have increased 
by 69 per cent. I therefore find it somewhat strange that he and 
his government would be talking about a further confiscation of 
the wealth or the ability of corporations to be able to fund 
themselves.
<P>
	I was listening to the chair of the finance committee talking 
about the fact that there are corporations that because of fast 
write-offs or other procedures involved in the current tax 
system should be taxed. That is why the government is talking 
about a wealth or a capital tax on larger corporations. This is 
exactly what the Liberals are talking about.
<P>
	Would the secretary of state be able to inform us whether he, 
the finance minister and their colleagues are perhaps talking 
about a cash flow tax? In other words we understand that we 
have a wealth tax.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	Because a corporation is able to carry forward losses and 
other legitimate things in the tax system it has a sufficient 
amount of flow. The government will say: ``My goodness, here 
is a couple of million dollars flowing along. Why don't we put 
our ladle, our pail or our big scoop into this tax?''
<P>
	Does the Liberal government not understand that individuals 
and corporations are saying no tax increase?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Madam Speaker, I am delighted to reply to the 
hon. member's question. Again we find the Reform Party is 
suggesting new taxes. The only matter of taxation the finance 
minister has mentioned is that we will continue to make the 
Canadian tax system fairer.
<P>
	The Reform Party keeps suggesting new taxes. Let me tell 
Reform Party members that Canadians are not just concerned 
with taxes. They are concerned with taxes; they are not just 
concerned with taxes. They are also concerned with jobs. They 
are concerned with education. They are concerned with crime in 
the streets. I read my  mail every day. They are concerned about 
all these things.
<P>
	The Reform Party is playing a Johnny one-note tune on 
deficits and on taxes and is missing what Canadians really want.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to join in the debate.
<P>
	During one of the question and comment periods this morning 
I mentioned that like many members on all sides of the House I 
have had an opportunity to host public forums on issues such as 
the debt and the deficit. We got input from people across our 
constituencies on what their approach would be. That is part of 
our responsibility. That is a part of our ongoing job.
<P>
	Many people said to me that there had to be cuts on the 
expenditure side, that the government had to do better, that we 
had to eliminate waste wherever we find it or wherever possible, 
and that we had to avoid duplication in efforts whether with 
departments internationally or our provincial counterparts in 
their respective departments.
<P>
	The finance committee looked at those matters during its 
review. The minister and his department have taken them into 
consideration during the process of preparing for the budget. I 
say to my colleagues across the way that many Canadians have 
told us at these meetings that they want government to get it 
right. That is exactly what we are attempting to do.
<P>
	People lost faith in our predecessors. Goal after goal was set. 
Was one ever met? I do not recall one that stands out in my mind 
as being met.
<P>
	The government set goals like one might in business. Any 
good business person knows that challenges and goals must be 
set for both the business and the staff. Goals are set that offer 
challenge; the goals are achievable albeit difficult. That is 
exactly what we have done as a government. We have set some 
difficult goals.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	I have to admit in many cases I have scratched my head and 
asked how we are going to meet this, that it is going to be very 
difficult. During the process both the finance minister and quite 
obviously the Prime Minister have asked all departments, all 
portfolios and all ministers to share in this challenge before us. I 
am sure in many cases specific sums were expected to be cut 
from the respective departments.
<P>
	As everyone in this House knows, program review has been 
taking place. That program review asked every department and 
every portfolio to look at every line of every expenditure to 
ensure that they were going to be able to justify it to you and me. 
Ultimately that is where our responsibility lies. It lies not in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9589"> 9589 </A></B>
<P>
day to day operation but in the policy, the planning and the 
review of the results. That is exactly what the Minister of 
Finance will do when he brings down his budget.
<P>
	As we mentioned earlier, this government did set a goal. We 
took over in the 1993 fiscal year a deficit of some $42 billion 
which had once again gone even further than the previous 
administration had projected. We set a goal to bring that deficit 
down this current fiscal year to $39.7 billion, next year to $32.7 
billion, and the third year to $25 billion, thus meeting our 
commitment of 3 per cent of gross domestic product.
<P>
	Members would know that in the last couple of weeks the 
Minister of Finance has stated publicly that not only will we 
meet that goal this current fiscal year but we will exceed it. That 
is great news for us. It is fantastic. That is what we should be 
working toward and challenging ourselves toward. I know the 
Minister of Finance is doing that and is impressing on the staff 
of the department to ensure we do all possible to not only meet 
the current year and subsequent year goals but to surpass them if 
we possibly can.
<P>
	During this whole process of reaching our goals we have 
another goal. That goal is for growth and job creation in this 
country. Of all the G-7 nations in the world, the economic 
leaders of the world, in the 1994 calendar year this country was 
number one. We were number one in the world in economic 
increase and development.
<P>
	That in itself is part of our challenge, the balancing part, to be 
very gentle. The actions we take must be balanced to achieve our 
goals in reducing our deficit, taking hold of our debt, bringing 
home those offshore portions wherever possible but at the same 
time doing it in a balanced fashion that will keep another 
commitment of this government for economic development: 
jobs and growth. We call it our growth and jobs agenda.
<P>
<B>(1305 ) </B>
<P>
	Members will notice that every piece of material which has 
been brought forward by this government has had that as the 
number one priority: jobs and growth. Growth economically for 
our businesses. Jobs for our young people completing 
community college and post-secondary education in 
universities. It is so they will have the opportunity we and our 
parents had to have a job, to have that self-discipline, to have 
respect for themselves, to know that following their education 
there is an opportunity in this country to go to work and to 
provide for themselves and their subsequent families.
<P>
	As a member of this government I am indeed proud of the 
approach it and our finance minister have taken fiscally. There is 
no question we want to see the major part of deficit reduction 
done on the expense side. There is no question and the minister 
has stated that time and time again.
<P>
	As I mentioned before, a number of those loophole areas are 
going to have to be filled. I pressured the minister, others did as 
well. That will be seen by some people as tax increases. I see it 
as being a fair and equitable tax system for all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
listening with great interest to the member's speech. He was 
talking about the goals the government has set. I would like to 
talk about those goals.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member would agree with me that if we 
aim low we just might be able to succeed sometimes, if to aim 
low so we can succeed is not necessarily where the government 
is coming from. I wonder why the Liberals do not realize that 
you cannot get over a wide chasm in two jumps.
<P>
	The situation is that with our constant overspending and our 
constant deficit building we are taking the future from our 
great-grandchildren who we do not know and we have not seen 
yet. This is an intergenerational transfer of taxation. With the 
spending we as Canadians under this Liberal government are 
presently doing, we are handcuffing our descendants countless 
years into the future with taxation. It is for money we are 
spending today.
<P>
	Specifically the government talks frequently about this 3 per 
cent thing. The people of Canada should know that since the 
government took over, the federal debt, not the deficit which is 
the overspending but the federal debt, has increased $60 billion. 
That is just since this government has taken over.
<P>
	The government's target is to get to 25 per cent of gross 
domestic product within four years. People like ourselves figure 
four years times $25 billion is $100 billion. It will be 
significantly more than $100 billion. Even if we stayed with 
$100 billion additional debt, the interest charge on that 
additional $100 billion that we are having our great, great, 
great-grandchildren responsible for with their taxation, is $9 
billion a year.
<P>
	The federal transfers for post-secondary education are $2.6 
billion. The federal transfers for health are $6.5 billion. In other 
words for just health and post-secondary education, it is $9.1 
billion. And this government with $100 billion more debt is 
going to be encumbering our great, great-grandchildren with $9 
billion more.
<P>
	It is going to be a lot more than $100 billion, but let us take 
that number. If the government in all of its wisdom is prepared to 
go $100 billion more into debt, the interest charges will be at 
least $9 billion. That then wipes out our ability to fund 
post-secondary education or to make federal transfers to the 
provinces in support of health care. Where in the world does the 
hon. member expect to get that from, except the bogey man 
which Canadians are concerned about because it is more of a tax 
grab, more of this government in Canadians' wallets?

<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Culbert:</B> Mr. Speaker, relative to the points and concerns 
made by my hon. colleague across the way, I should say first of 
all that I am not sure how the Reform Party set its goals low as he 
has suggested. However the Liberal way is to set goals that are a 
challenge, yet goals that are achievable even though they may be 
somewhat difficult to achieve. We as a Liberal government have 
set those goals and we will achieve them, as everyone well 
knows.
<P>
	I agree with my hon. colleague across the way that no 
question, when talking about compound interest, it is a 
wonderful thing when you are receiving it or if you have dollars 
to invest and can receive it. It multiplies day in and day out and 
is a wonderful thing. He is absolutely right. It is a terrible thing 
when it is the other way around and you are paying your debts. 
Whether it be us in our private lives, or business, or certainly as 
government, there is no question it is a terrible thing.
<P>
	Those goals have to be set and we have to meet those goals and 
those challenges each step of the way as we go along. In this case 
we will meet our first goal of reaching 3 per cent of the gross 
domestic product. Our next goal will be on a balanced budget. 
Following that, we will break the back of this country's debt. We 
will take hold of these finances for years and years to come.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
respond to the remarks made by my colleague across the way.
<P>
	We hear from these Liberal members today about how 
essential it is for government to be involved in the economy and 
how if we can do things just a little better, if government can just 
get it right, things will get better in Canada.
<P>
	We hear about complexity and we hear about the wider 
economic reality as if these were some buzz phrases that meant 
that government has to stay involved in the economy. I would 
suggest that we have had 25 or 30 years of government involved 
in the economy, trying to direct the economy, trying to drive us 
to where it would like us to be and it has failed miserably.
<P>
	There is a model right now for government to emulate and that 
is Mr. Klein's government in Alberta. Mr. Klein has done some 
very courageous things starting with the elimination of the 
MLA's pension plan and a reduction of the MLA's remuneration. 
He has demonstrated leadership at the top.
<P>
	Then he has gone on from there to make across the board cuts, 
major cuts in his government's spending. The reality of that is 
that Alberta is creating jobs. It is instilling investor confidence 
and it is showing the people in Alberta that it is serious about 
reducing its debt and its deficit.
<P>
	Would the member across the way not agree that is the model 
for this government to be following rather than to be following 
the tired old ideas that have not worked and will continue not to 
work if this government continues on its present course of 
action?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Culbert:</B> Mr. Speaker, first I should say that 
government's involvement is certainly to set an economic 
confidence in this country in which the business and industry 
communities can build economically to create those jobs. That 
is where the jobs come from. The member is right. They do not 
come directly from government. They come from government 
indirectly because government has to set that confidence, that 
pace and that tone economically in the country for that to 
happen. That is exactly what this government is doing.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
today we are discussing a motion by the Reform Party whose 
purpose is, basically, to make the government reduce its 
spending so as to improve the state of public finances. There is 
nothing wrong with the principle as such. The motion also wants 
the government to avoid raising taxes and to downsize 
government. The Bloc Quebecois certainly has no trouble 
accepting these three principles.
<P>
	However, the position behind this motion is not necessarily 
one we can embrace. Our position on the economy is certainly 
not that of the Reform Party, certainly not the position of the 
right, which says that economic growth depends largely on what 
the wealthiest in our society contribute to the economy.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	This is often the group they try to defend, either by proposing 
a single tax or other measures to avoid any form of progressive 
taxation or redistribution. There are certainly major differences 
in how the role of government is viewed with respect to 
redistribution of income. In any case, since it came to power, 
this government has done very little to improve public finances.
<P>
	A few weeks from now, we will be told that by the end of the 
fiscal year, we will have a deficit of about 38 or 39 billion 
dollars, in addition to a debt of over $500 billion, accumulated 
during the past twenty years. This is hardly a reason to celebrate.
<P>
	However, I know some members will celebrate, because the 
deficit will be one or two billion dollars less than the original 
forecast. However, whether the deficit is on target is irrelevant. 
We have to consider the facts.
<P>
	The facts are that we will still have a very substantial deficit 
of 37 or 38 billion dollars, as I said earlier, and perhaps even 39 
billion, if the government tries to include some of next year's 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9591"> 9591 </A></B>
<P>
spending in this year's budget to reduce the pressure on the next 
fiscal year. We must get back to basics. Forget about objectives. 
What we want is results.
<P>
	Since the government failed to make certain cuts last year, 
this has put a lot of pressure on Canadian interest rates. Since 
February, interest rates have gone up by about 300 base points. 
Everyone who has to borrow money is feeling the impact on the 
economy. The Minister of Finance likes to say that increases in 
the interest rate are like increases in income tax. If he believes 
what he says, why did he not do something earlier in the year, 
instead of adding this pressure to the interest rates?
<P>
	Of course, our friends like to say that the state of the economy 
is a destabilizing factor. I, however, contend that the greatest 
destabilizing factor is the state of public finances. Foreign 
investors recognize this, and this is what they look at first.
<P>
	There is also no vision for society. It is unfortunate to find 
that, after a year and a half in office, the present government is 
taking the same approach as its predecessor. According to this 
approach, cuts are the only way to improve public finances-a 
view shared by the Reform Party.
<P>
	I can remember during the elections speeches about giving 
priority to jobs and trying to generate growth as ways to improve 
public finances. So much for those speeches. No vision of 
society has been put forward in an effort to find a way to 
revitalize the economy, to everyone's benefit.
<P>
	You are aware that economic indicators measure growth with 
traditional indicators such as production levels. We must not 
forget, however, what we learned in the 1980s-that increased 
does not necessarily mean increased employment.
<P>
	The two are linked, of course. If there is an increase in total 
production, or in the gross domestic product, the number of jobs 
will certainly increase also, but these two trends are separate. 
Production may increase significantly faster than the level of 
employment.
<P>
	The gross domestic product is therefore not the only yardstick 
for the economy. We have to focus on the people who are 
increasingly excluded from society, the unemployed living on 
unemployment insurance or welfare or who have returned to 
school because they cannot find a job. Many people are waiting 
to enter the labour market. The present government has no 
vision, in this regard.
<P>
	I would like to speak a bit about the approach which consists 
of saying that the deficit problem will be resolved by making 
cuts across the board. We agree that certain cuts can readily be 
made, for example in the government machine. Later on, I will 
return to the Bloc Quebecois' suggestions which we have 
repeated time and again.
<P>
	We have a major difference of opinion with the Reform Party: 
in our opinion, some expenditures are tax expenditures. We 
must look beyond budget expenditures, transfers to individuals 
and to the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	We should also look at whether they are tax expenditures, lost 
revenues. We could get into a real philosophical debate on this 
issue: Is it a tax hike? Is it a spending cut? It seems clear to us 
that it is a question of spending.
<P>
	It has always been difficult to discuss the issue of tax 
expenditures in an effective way, even during the finance 
committee's hearings, because the figures are derived from data 
that is only partly revealed. Expenditures that the government 
plans to make are revealed, but no roll-up of these expenditures 
is ever given, even though that information is available.
<P>
	Therefore, I want to talk about this right leaning philosophy 
that only wants to see across-the-board cuts, blind 
indiscriminate cuts, a philosophy that often ferments such ideas 
as a single tax rate, the same rate for everyone. It tempts even 
the people who would be affected the most. They say ``use one 
tax rate''. Currently, we use a progressive tax rate system; the 
higher the income, the higher the tax rate. Of course, the tax 
system, however, sometimes reverses trends, but that is another 
problem which can be looked at in a different way.
<P>
	Therefore, the principle of redistribution, which is desirable 
in society, would be severely compromised under a system with 
one tax rate. I said to someone who was explaining the concept 
to me that I would give the matter more thought if that person 
could explain to me how income would be redistributed with just 
one tax rate for everyone. As long as the proposal cannot be 
linked with redistribution, how the state redistributes wealth, 
the concept will not get any support from me.
<P>
	I would now like to return to what can be expected in the next 
budget and rumours on this subject. It is becoming clearer that 
the government will increase its revenues in the next budget. An 
increase in the surtax for individuals or in income tax rates, 
traditional taxes or certain consumption taxes is planned, or 
pension funds may even be hit. There is obviously a lot of money 
there, and the government is looking for revenue. It is much 
easier to get a quick revenue fix than to cut spending; it takes 
more courage to cut spending, especially when friends are 
among those affected. The Liberals have always had trouble 
cutting their friends's spending so this may be very difficult to 
do.
<P>
	Now why does the government want to do that? Because of the 
two additional years, and the Conservatives and Liberals are 
equally at fault. For the past two years, there have been no major 
changes in budget policy, and we have just had two consecutive 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9592"> 9592 </A></B>
<P>
deficits of $40 billion, record amounts in Canadian history. This 
is a country that is supposed to have the  best quality of life in the 
world. This is the country they are trying to sell us, especially to 
Quebecers. Perhaps we should check the size of the mortgage.
<P>
	My point is that this government has only itself to blame, 
because it failed to take action during the second year.
<P>
	I will give an example of tax expenditures that were 
introduced and then withdrawn, to show the lack of vision and 
judgment we see so often in our tax system. That is why we 
favour a genuine review of the tax system, not a quick fix to 
please friends who contribute to the party coffers but something 
that will reflect our social values, our principles and our 
objectives. Look at the way the government treats capital gains, 
for instance.
<P>
	What was the procedure in recent years? First, the 
government introduced the principle of allowing a $500,000 
exemption; the first $500,000 of capital gains were not taxable. 
After a while, the exemption was reduced to $100,000. Once 
taxpayers in the highest bracket had taken advantage of this 
exemption-not everyone can declare a capital gain of 
$500,000-the government said: ``Well, this is costing the 
government a pretty penny. We will reduce the exemption to 
$100,000'', and so they did. Now that the others had managed to 
take advantage of this exemption, they said: ``Well, this might 
be too costly for the government after all, so let us cut the 
exemption to zero'', which they did.
<P>
	If it does not make sense to treat capital gains differently 
today, why did they do it in the past? How much money did the 
government lose in the process? How much did it have to borrow 
to compensate? How much did it cost society? Now, they claim 
social programs are too expensive, that they are putting us into 
debt, and the government has all kinds of names for those 
people.
<P>
	Actually, if we look at the operating budget, although it does 
show a deficit, it is practically negligible, which means that if 
we had not accumulated all this debt over the years, we would 
not be having this discussion today.
<P>
	What caused these problems? Is it our social programs? I am 
not so sure.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	This certainly requires some adjustment and a serious look. I 
come back to the approach advocating only cuts and not fiscal 
spending. What does this mean? Forty billion dollars spread 
among 20 million taxpayers. That means about $2,000 per 
person. We resolve the deficit problem by cutting $2,000 per 
individual, cuts in expenditures related to individuals.
<P>
	Can everyone handle $2,000 in cuts? We here in this House 
can do it easily, with no problem. However, what about people 
on social assistance, single parent families and older people? 
Can they handle a $2,000 cut per person? Can they really? It is 
not a sure thing.
<P>
	This is why we need to have another way of looking at the 
approach to public finances as well. There has to be a way to put 
a stop to the present inefficiencies and straighten out the job 
market with different and new ideas. We could use our 
imaginations, we could be creative. There is no end to 
technological innovation these days. When it comes to public 
finances, we are stuck for ideas. We want to copy other formulae 
and other approaches.
<P>
	We hear more and more talk about New Zealand in Canada 
these days. People are trying to convince us that we will share 
the same fate. Why do we not try a different formula? Why not 
do things differently?
<P>
	Over the next year, debate will be vigorous, because two 
visions of society are on a collision course, particularly in 
Quebec with the discussions on the referendum. I hope there are 
Canadians who also share a different vision from what we are 
hearing conveyed at present.
<P>
	I would like to speak about reviewing the taxation system in 
connection with current statistics on income. Sixty per cent of 
people, 60 per cent of the population, have incomes of $25,000 
or less. Returning to my earlier idea of cutting expenditures by 
$2,000, for people with a $25,000 income, that is going to hurt. 
We must target the cuts where the money is and where it will hurt 
much less.
<P>
	Of course, I mentioned redistribution. Also, when we put 
forward budget policies, specific taxation policies, we must 
evaluate them before developing them, while they are being 
developed and after they have been developed. Given the 
veritable army of civil servants, this could be done and it would 
be a more productive use of their time. Perhaps cutting 45,000 
employees would not be contemplated if this type of useful 
analysis were conducted. It is certainly possible to re-think the 
work of the public service in regards to such an approach.
<P>
	I took part in prebudget consultations. I must say that I was 
rather disappointed. Earlier, I heard a Liberal member say that 
all departmental programs were undergoing a review. It is a 
shame that, in politics, we lack the courage to lay working 
hypotheses out on the table when people are being consulted. 
These public consultations were very difficult because the 
discussion became almost philosophical at one point. It was 
hard to say that there was nothing concrete, only partial 
information. It was difficult for people to judge, even for 
members of the committee.
<P>
	If that review had been conducted a little quicker, put out on 
the table to be debated, but it was not, and the government does 
not want to be transparent, it wants to give itself as much leeway 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9593"> 9593 </A></B>
<P>
as possible. It does not want to resolve the public finances issue 
effectively, publicly. Never. This will be done in the backrooms.
<P>
	Therefore, in my opinion, the exercise will be relatively 
ineffective. Anyway, most of the report was written by the 
Department of Finance, which does not want to be affected by 
the recommendations, so it is making sure it has some leeway.
<P>
	I would like to use the remaining three or four minutes to talk 
about the rumour going around regarding a form of flexible 
federalism which will be introduced in the next budget by 
decentralizing some powers. What a laugh. The Axworthy 
reforms were strongly contested and implementing his reforms 
is proving very difficult; the proposal is obviously lacking 
vision; people are not rallying around it, they are divided on the 
issue.
<P>
	The government had to put these reforms on the back burner 
because of the referendum campaign. But the underlying idea 
was to cut social program spending. How can this be done now, 
and in a more positive way? That must be the challenge that 
Cabinet is facing now, and a decision on the issue has probably 
already been reached, since the budget has to go to the printer 
any day now.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	Therefore, it is probably already a done deal and the Minister 
of Finance is probably now in the process of announcing to his 
provincial counterparts how he intends to reduce the amount of 
money they receive, and trying to have them believe that he is 
telling them good news.
<P>
	What the government is essentially trying to do is to regroup 
certain transfer payments. Education, health and Canada 
Assistance Plan transfer payments will be grouped together and 
added up. What the government will be doing is an addition of 
sorts. The government will add up the amounts and say to 
Quebec or another province: ``This was what you received in the 
past, and now we will give it to you in one block payment. 
However, you will get a lot less, because we have to improve 
public finances. The rest is up to you. You must decide where to 
cut, make unpopular choices, tell students their tuition fees will 
go up. You will bear the responsibility». That is essentially the 
message they want to convey, while trying to pass it off as 
decentralized federalism.
<P>
	Will they cut the workforce which administers these programs 
here? I doubt it. Will they abolish national standards if they stop 
contributing financially? If they no longer make a financial 
contribution, will they forget about national standards? On what 
logical basis would we maintain national standards, although we 
know full well that the Liberal Party has this vision of national 
standards, centralized here and equal across the country, a single 
country, a single nation in their opinion?
<P>
	It would be very surprising for them to really decentralize, but 
they try to convince people that this is flexible federalism. I said 
yesterday, and I still think today, that this type of federalism is 
so flexible that we are broke.
<P>
	In conclusion, I will say a word about transfer payments to the 
provinces. If I remember correctly, transfer payments to the 
provinces have been cut by $48 billion since 1982, including 
$12 billion for Quebec alone, but that did not improve the 
government's financial situation. So we must not fall into the 
trap of thinking that this will do much to improve government 
finances. First of all, it is shifting the burden to the provinces. 
This will be hard on several provinces whose credit ratings are 
substantially lower than that of the federal government. The 
federal government's financial situation is worse, except that it 
is easy for them to generate revenue by collecting more taxes, 
but in theory only because people would not stand for it in 
practice.
<P>
	This did not put government finances on a healthier footing 
and it is not a good approach. We must also look at job creation, 
an issue on which the government is very silent. It lacks a vision. 
In summary, yes to selective cutbacks, first in the administrative 
machinery, at the Department of National Defence. We must 
also collect unpaid taxes. We can achieve a real reduction in 
overlap, which provides much more effective ways to create a 
better climate and improve the economic situation. However, I 
doubt very much that this is the approach contemplated by the 
government and that concerns me a great deal. In any case, 
people will have to make choices soon and we will see which 
vision of society they prefer, especially in Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it 
was with considerable interest that I listened to and participated 
in the debate this morning. I listened closely to the speeches by 
the member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot and my colleague 
from Témiscamingue, for whom I have a great deal of respect. I 
do not always agree with them and I would even say that I am 
almost in complete disagreement with their option, but I do 
agree with one point that both members raised this morning, in 
this House.
<P>
	The member for Témiscamingue has just concluded with the 
remark that flexible federalism, or a flexible status quo, if I may 
so describe it, is the cause of the problem we are now facing 
daily in Canada. In this regard, I am in complete agreement with 
him. It is because of the debt load that has plagued the country 
for years now.
<P>
	I also agree with another of their observations, which is that 
the debt load and particularly the deficit we have had for a 
number of years are not the result of social programs.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	There are two factors, first of all the debt load, which is very 
high, and the political uncertainty, which has resulted in an 
incredible jump in interest rates.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9594"> 9594 </A></B>
<P>
	As the member has already pointed out, since the report was 
tabled in December there has been an increase of 300 base 
points, or 3 per cent. I would remind this House that an increase 
of 1 per cent represents an additional burden of 1.7 billion 
dollars. This is why, with the budget soon to be tabled, we are 12 
to 14 billion dollars short of our objective to reduce the deficit to 
3 per cent of the gross domestic product.
<P>
	I would like to put a question to my honourable colleague, 
who said that our problem is one of the main reasons why their 
future is brighter in an independent Quebec. I cannot believe 
that an independent Quebec will be in a better position to offer 
the services that taxpayers now receive.
<P>
	Take the debt, for example. It is a very good example. The 
member for Saint-Hyacinthe told us himself this morning that 
he was prepared to absorb 25 per cent of the debt. Some 
economists say that this additional burden would drive the debt 
of an independent Quebec up to 215 billion dollars. That would 
be 123 per cent of its gross domestic product. There is no way 
that an independent Quebec can offer the same services that 
taxpayers are receiving today.
<P>
	Could the member explain, for the benefit of all those who 
will soon have to make a decision, how he expects to offer the 
same services in an independent Quebec without extensive cuts, 
when the debt burden is so heavy and there is the risk of a 
premium on interest rates that would add to the load?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brien:</B> Madam Speaker, I will be pleased to answer my 
colleague who, I hope, will be living in that Quebec with us too. 
By then, I also hope we will be able to convince him because he 
seems to show a certain interest in that new Quebec.
<P>
	First of all, I would like to make a few corrections in what he 
said about the causes of economic uncertainty. As a primary 
factor, and I hope this is an error, he cited the political situation 
as a cause of instability over the last year. May I remind him that 
the greatest instability in interest rates, when they increased the 
most, in April and May, that was in reaction to the federal budget 
when the stock markets recognized that public finance had no 
means to correct the situation. If he has stock market 
investments, he will be able to check as stock market 
performance and interest rates are very often at variance.
<P>
	The federal budget and overall indebtedness are the first 
factor. Even if some people mention the uncertainty associated 
with a sovereign Quebec, this is not because of the political 
regime or because they have concerns about public finances in a 
sovereign Quebec in view of the present high Canadian deficit.
<P>
	They themselves implicitly admit that it is the size of the 
Canadian deficit which causes uncertainty. This has nothing to 
do with politics. A sovereign Quebec with viable public finances 
would be of no concern whatsoever to financial markets.
<P>
	He also stated that a sovereign Quebec would be responsible 
for 25 per cent of the debt and that my colleague had mentioned 
that this morning. He probably remembered part of what my 
colleague said. The latter probably said that this is what the 
Liberal and federalists would want. If I may give an example, 
the Bélanger-Campeau commission which examined this 
subject indicated that we de not share only one side of the 
balance sheet, we share the assets and the debt, both sides.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	When we add this all up and look at it from an assets 
standpoint, we arrive at a figure of 18.5 per cent. Since we are 
contributing 23 per cent of federal government revenues, and 
taking on 18.5 per cent of the debt, this means a significant gain 
on top of savings in overlap. There will no longer be two 
departments of revenue, two departments of the environment, 
two departments of whatever. I could go on a long time. This 
will eliminate problems for business, which has to meet the 
different environmental standards of Ottawa and Quebec City, 
complete tonnes of forms, GST reports, QST reports. Our 
business people will use this time to concentrate on what they do 
best: improve the economy. This will be good for Quebec and 
good for Canada. I hope Canada's economy will be as strong as it 
can be, because Canada will be our principal trading partner.
<P>
	I have no concerns about the viability of a sovereign Quebec. I 
am perhaps a bit more concerned, sincerely, about the viability 
of a Canada without Quebec, since it will have to redefine itself, 
and the process has not yet begun. It will be hard to adjust 
quickly.
<P>
	Things are happening in Quebec. A lot of people are taking 
part in the regional commissions. They are expressing their 
ideas. They are describing their vision of Quebec in the future. 
And as I said, it is completely different from what I hear people 
talking about here. There, they are talking about equity, 
redistribution and social justice. Here, people are talking about 
reforms to social programs that involve cuts affecting the 
disadvantaged in order to improve public finances.
<P>
	There are other ways to improve public finances, and I think 
the approach of a sovereign Quebec will show the way, and we 
can become an international example on how to turn public 
finances around and achieve sovereignty democratically. 
Quebec knowledge and know-how will become an international 
export.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
cannot believe what I am hearing here today from this member 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9595"> 9595 </A></B>
<P>
of the Bloc. I think it is time he became accountable to this 
House, to the people in his  constituency and to the people across 
the country because he is not being accountable.
<P>
	This member has said that spending on social programs has 
not played a part and has not been the reason that we have a 
deficit in this country. I would like him to answer some very 
direct questions.
<P>
	Total federal spending was about $163 billion last year. About 
$40 billion of that was interest payments on the debt. You are not 
going to make interest payments on the debt? About $80 billion 
was in the area of social program spending. About $43 billion 
was for all other government spending, including the cost of 
government, defence, Indian affairs and so.
<P>
	Reform put out a detailed plan to cut $10 billion from that $43 
billion and presented it to the finance minister and to the finance 
committee. I never heard members of the Bloc saying that they 
would cut more from that area. They complained they would not 
make the cuts that Reform has proposed to make out of that area. 
That means the Bloc is prepared to cut more out of this $80 
billion in social program spending because there is no other 
place to make the cuts. That is reality.
<P>
	I would like this member to start talking about reality. I want 
to ask him directly how he would propose to balance the budget 
using some fact without making cuts in the area of social 
program spending. I would like him to answer this in a way that 
will be believable to the people in his constituency and across 
the country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> You have barely 30 
seconds left.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brien:</B> I will be quick, Madam Speaker, and will ask my 
colleague to reread my speech, which he probably did not 
understand, because it was in French. Let him reread its 
translation.
<P>
	I can see why someone who can only envision resolving the 
public finances issue through social spending cuts would be 
frustrated to see other people find other ways of resolving it. 
They know very well how hard a time they are having with it. 
Their ideas are not being accepted in Quebec and that probably 
frustrates them all the more.
<P>
	It would be my pleasure to send him a copy of the finance 
committee's report, which contains the Bloc Quebecois' 
proposed solution to the public finances problem. I will tell him 
once again that it was certainly not the most needy who got us 
into our current debt situation. That is certainly not the case. 
Look at the past to see the reasons for the current debt level.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roger Simmons (Burin-St. George's, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker-
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry to interrupt. 
May I ask the hon. whether you are taking 20 minutes or 
splitting your time?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> The former. I intend to take most of the time 
allotted because it is an issue raised by my good friend from 
Capilano-Howe Sound, a gentleman who brings great 
credentials to the House and to the debate. However, he ought to 
use more of those credentials in formulating his motion but I 
will come to that a little later because the effort allowing us to 
debate this issue is applauded. For that I applaud my friend from 
Capilano-Howe Sound.
<P>
	I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in the 
debate because the motion does have its merits. I am confident 
that the merits of the motion will be addressed in the budget 
which is upcoming.
<P>
	Unfortunately, however, I have to say to him that the motion is 
also a bit tainted in several areas by a bit of simplistic thinking. I 
would have expected something different from him. It is tainted 
by a search for panaceas that if we do this and this, all of our 
problems will go away. I do not think he believes that.
<P>
	Let me emphasize that the government knows full well that 
Canadians believe taxes are already too high. We agree with 
them on that. We would get a certain impression if we saw some 
people trying to start a tax revolt or in Mackenzie King's famous 
statement: ``There go my troops. I must rush out to lead them''. I 
am not sure which it is, whether they want to start the revolt, join 
the revolt or what. It is either naive or treacherous as the case 
may be but you decide, Madam Speaker.
<P>
	Our priority objectives as a government are to stimulate 
economic growth while putting in place some real fiscal 
discipline. It is this double barrelled thrust that will ultimately 
allow us to reduce taxes in the years to come.
<P>
	Let us remember that the tax and deficit relationship is a two 
way street. Every dollar of deficit borrowing we accept today 
will lead to higher taxes tomorrow. Every dollar we can trim 
from the deficit is a step on the road to keeping the tax burden 
down.
<P>
	That is why the government's 1994 budget was in many ways 
a tax reform and a tax reduction budget. It included measures to 
eliminate loopholes and to increase tax system fairness and 
equity. It also committed to direct action to bring down 
unemployment insurance premiums, a payroll tax that acts as a 
real barrier to new job creation.
<P>
	It was also a tax reduction budget because of the firm 
commitment made by the Minister of Finance to cut the deficit 
to 3 per cent of the economy in three years. Again, let me make 
this central point. Fiscal discipline is the key to long term tax 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9596"> 9596 </A></B>
<P>
reduction in two ways. Obviously  the less we have to borrow, 
the less we have to tax to repay the loan and its interest.
<P>
	There is another important dimension to this process. 
Controlling government's appetite for debt is our fundamental 
tool for getting interest rates back down. Lower interest rates 
mean lower carrying costs on our $500 billion debt. Again that 
means fewer tax dollars that we need to spend.
<P>
	I understand the tax fatigue that so many Canadians feel. I can 
appreciate that some may be cynical about the possibility of 
measures that add to tax revenues today in order to let us cut 
taxes in future.
<P>
	That is why the 1994 budget undertook a program of net 
spending reduction over three years that is the most significant 
of any budget in a decade. Over 80 per cent of the net fiscal 
improvement delivered by the 1994 budget over three years 
came from spending cuts.
<P>
	In other words, there was $5 in spending cuts for every dollar 
of new revenue increase. Obviously I am not in a position to talk 
about the measures that will be set out in the forthcoming 
budget, but the Minister of Finance has already made it clear 
that he will rely overwhelmingly on spending cuts to achieve his 
fiscal targets.
<P>
<B>(1350 ) </B>
<P>
	Lower taxes are important and this government is committed 
to working toward that. In the process we cannot ignore the 
facts. The views expressed by the opposition on the issue of 
taxation appear to be partly driven by a belief that Canadians 
bear one of the highest tax burdens in the world, but there is 
more political grandstanding than truth in that particular 
perception.
<P>
	The Canadian tax foundation, a highly respected non-profit, 
non-partisan research organization, has recently made this 
clear. Among the 24 members of the OECD, an organization that 
includes most of the world's advanced industrial economies, 
Canada ranks 14th in total tax burden. That represents 36.5 per 
cent of our gross domestic product compared with the OECD 
average of 38.8 per cent.
<P>
	I say to my friend from Wild Rose, if he heard the first part of 
my speech, yes it is a matter of concern. If the hon. member is 
going to vent his concern based on facts rather than fantasies he 
should first get at the facts. Among the 24 countries we are 14th 
in total tax burden.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Who do we compete with? The U.S. is 29 per 
cent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Madam Speaker, they have to be given an 
opportunity to vent in a way they never can in caucus. We might 
as well let them do it here.
<P>
	I would never dare be smug about Canada's tax burden. It 
should be clear by now that I am not endorsing high taxes. We 
have to face reality squarely which I believe supporters of this 
motion are failing to do.
<P>
	When they make comparisons of Canada's tax burden it is 
typically vis-à-vis the United States. As much as I want lower 
taxes I have to point out that there are some flaws in that 
particular comparison with the United States. Contrary to what 
some hon. members would have us believe, lower taxes in the 
U.S. do not come without a cost, a financial cost and a human 
cost.
<P>
	Take the example of medicare. Medical insurance represents a 
very substantial cost for millions of Americans and their 
employers. For the tens of millions without insurance a serious 
illness can spell personal and financial ruin. If members want to 
make the comparison between Canadians and Americans, what 
they ought to do in fairness is either when they are making 
comparisons deduct the taxes in respect of which we pay for 
medicare or alternately when they look at the American tax total 
add in the medical care costs which are hidden in the sense that 
they are not tax dollars, they are funded elsewhere but represent 
a cost on the pocket nevertheless.
<P>
	They are comparing apples and oranges. Either compare the 
American and Canadian system with medicare written in or with 
medicare written out. They will find that they do not have such a 
tax holiday as my good friend would like to suggest.
<P>
	The point I am making is twofold. First, we have to avoid 
making comparisons that are simplistic and specious and I 
would go so far as to say dishonest because they compare apples 
and oranges. Second, we have to realize that while the 
opposition's position on taxes sounds a lot like a call for 
motherhood, it is about a lot more than taxes. It is about the kind 
of government, the kind of society that we want in Canada.
<P>
	I can tell the House how to reduce taxes, bring them way 
down. Sock it to all the poor people, sock it to all the 
disadvantaged, do away with our medicare system and so on. 
There is a way to get ever lower taxes. Low taxation, small 
government versus big government are not objectives in 
themselves. None of these is an objective in itself. What they do 
for society ought to be the objective, what they accomplish.
<P>
	If we are going to go to the extreme of having small 
government for the sake of small government, I can tell the 
House how we can make it really small. Let us have no 
government at all, none.
<P>
	I take it you have all written in to forfeit your pensions.

	The Minister of Finance has said very clearly that government 
cannot and should not do everything. We too want-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> He does not do anything.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> They do nothing except spend money.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Can I get that in writing? He says the 
government does not do anything. He could have fooled me 
when I heard his leader yesterday in the House of Commons. I 
thought he was saying we are doing all kinds of terrible things. 
Get together, guys. I do not want a fight, especially on 
Valentine's Day. Let us not have a fight among the kissing 
cousins in the same caucus. He says we do nothing and the other 
member says we do a lot. Which is it?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> A lot of nothing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> The hon. member needs a new writer.
<P>
	The government was elected to bring the people of Canada 
leaner, smarter and more efficient government. Even my friend 
from Elk Island believes that. We were not mandated to wholly 
eviscerate government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> What does that mean?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> As soon as I find out, I will let the member 
know.
<P>
	We were not elected to eviscerate, to cut out the you know 
what of government without regard to the important job it must 
and can fulfil both today and in the longer term.
<P>
	The difficulty if we operate from the premise that we do not 
need a government, as this crowd obviously does, is we have 
difficulty seeing the wisdom in anything the government does. I 
happen to believe we need some government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Some.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Yes, some government and some good 
government. I say to my friend that we not only have some 
government, we have good government. The program review we 
are undertaking is one of the ways in which the government is 
bringing about smaller, efficient, effective government.
<P>
	In the last budget the government launched a review of each 
and every program. Departments were asked to justify programs 
and activities on the basis of several tests.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 
30(5), the House will now proceed to Statements by Members, 
pursuant to Standing Order 31.

<P>
	It reflects little glory on Mrs. Robillard, who systematically

the by-election was a mere formality, somewhat like being 
appointed to the Senate by the Prime Minister. Let us hope she 
knows which door is which when she comes to Ottawa.

	She will have to explain statements she made earlier as the

Speaker, I would like to congratulate Mr. Jim Coombs, who is a 
member of my riding of Don Valley North, and the board of 
directors of Eva's Place, North York's first emergency shelter 
for youth.
<P>
	It is most encouraging that Canadians understand and 
appreciate the role which young people play in our society.
<P>
	The government has been addressing the needs of young 
Canadians, those often referred to as generation <I>x</I>. In September 
1993 there were about 420,000 unemployed young people in 
Canada. Since the government took office the number of 
unemployed youth has been reduced by 60,000. The government 
is committed to creating more jobs for youth and bringing more 
youth back into the economy.
<P>
	We must ensure that our young people have the best possible 
opportunities to lead productive and self-sufficient lives 
because they are the future of our country.
<P>
	Eva's Place is a positive step toward addressing the needs and 
concerns of homeless, abused and often alienated youth. Once 
again I applaud the board of directors and urge the government 
to take notice of their achievements.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
obviously to give the impression that he is always in control of 
his department, the minister of defence has called for the 
suspension of Major-General Brian Vernon, thereby throwing 
him to the wolves, using him as a scapegoat to calm public 
opinion. But Major-General Vernon should not bear the sole 
burden of responsibility for the incidents in Petawawa.
<P>
	Does the minister of defence intend to suspend or relieve of 
their duties all officers in charge of the Airborne Regiment who 
took part in incidents violating army regulations or officers who 
failed to intervene to put a stop to such activities?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member does not obviously listen to answers that I have given 
before.
<P>
	The removal of General Vernon was a decision taken by the 
chief of the defence staff. It is his and his alone. It is a decision 
in which I concurred.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, whereas 
I am accused of not listening to the answers, the minister does 
not listen to the questions; that is not what I asked.
<P>
	Can the minister of defence-and I hope he will understand 
my second question better-confirm that the government will 
soon award the Order of Military Merit to Lieutenant-Colonel 
Kenward, the very person who was supposed to have cleaned up 
the Second Airborne Regiment of Petawawa and who was 
commander-in-chief at the time of the incidents recorded on the 
third video-cassette? Does he still intend to award the Order of 
Military Merit to this lieutenant-colonel?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that 
particular decoration was decided a number of months ago by a 
panel in the military following normal practices and will go 
ahead as planned.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the 
Prime Minister consider it normal that his minister of defence 
still intends to decorate Lieutenant-Colonel Kenward, the 
former commanding officer of the Second Airborne Regiment, 
and in fact to do so even before the start of the inquiry which is 
supposed to get to the bottom of the events in Petawawa? Does 
he consider that normal?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister of defence just gave a very clear 
explanation. If I heard him right, his peers decided to award that 
individual the decoration. That will not prevent the committee 
from asking him the appropriate questions when he comes 
before the commission.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the minister of defence.
<P>
	The latest information revealed regarding the Petawawa 
incidents shows that the minister of defence does not know what 
is going on in his department. Incidentally, we have been 
waiting, since last fall, for a reply from the minister regarding 
the use of an Airbus A-310 by generals who went to Florida to 
go play a game of golf during Operation William Tell.
<P>
	Will the minister of defence tell us whether he knows 
anything about the Canadian army's Eagle River exercise?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is the 
kind of question, as you have advised members before, that 
should be reflected in an Order Paper approach rather than in

department. How can the minister of defence, in this time of 
fiscal restraint, not realize that the Eagle River exercise was a 
sham, designed to hide a sumptuous fishing trip to Labrador for 
senior officers of the Canadian army, at a cost of over $1.6 
million for taxpayers in 1993?

Speaker, today the provincial finance ministers are meeting with 
the federal finance minister to discuss the federal budget.
<P>
	At least half the provincial finance ministers are doing a 
better job at balancing their budgets than the federal 
government. One of their greatest concerns is that the federal 
government will simply offload its own debt problem on the 
backs of the provinces, particularly those that have managed 
their finances efficiently.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. What assurances could 
he give to fiscally responsible provinces that their reward is not 
simply going to be an offloading of the federal debt?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

the budget. We have set some extremely clear goals and we will 
meet them all.

<P>
	Since I have the floor, I would like to applaud everyone who 
voted in the by-elections yesterday and all of the candidates

congratulate the three Liberals who won.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday Liberal Premier Clyde Wells of 
Newfoundland said that the best thing the federal government 
could do would be to stop direct spending in such areas as 
education, health and forestry. He argued that all these services 
could be better provided at less cost by the levels of government 
closest to the public.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister follow the Newfoundland premier's 
advice and give the provinces real control over these areas 
including appropriate tax points? In other words, will he make 
clear his government's philosophy on decentralization 
including the transfer of tax points to the provinces?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I do not know how the hon. member's arithmetic 
works. If we do not spend and we give tax points, the deficit 
remains at exactly the same level. If we are not collecting and 
we are not paying, it is exactly the same. You should have 
checked that before asking the question.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I remind all hon. members to address the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister's replies are hardly inspiring 
confidence. The provincial premiers have joined thousands of 
Canadians in saying no to tax increases, no to new taxes, and no 
to tax grabs in the name of tax equity.
<P>
	As provinces like Alberta, New Brunswick and Saskatchewan 
reduce their deficits their citizens are looking for tax relief. The 
last thing they need to see is a tax grab by a fiscally irresponsible 
federal government.
<P>
	What assurances could the Prime Minister give to the citizens 
of those provinces that their reward for practising fiscal 
responsibility is not going to be a tax grab by a fiscally 
irresponsible federal government?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I said the Minister of Finance would bring in a budget 
very soon. It will be a very responsible budget.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	When we talk with the provinces they know that the federal 
government has to do what is needed to control its deficit. They 
will benefit if we control our deficit because the Canadian bond 
rating will be better for everybody. They have an interest just 
like us that we do very well in the next budget.
<P>
	Everybody knows that 3 per cent of the GDP for the deficit is a 
very reasonable level. I had a discussion yesterday with the

in Canada.

Finance is meeting his provincial counterparts. They will 
probably discuss further reductions in transfer payments to the 
provinces for social programs financing.
<P>
	If I understood correctly what the Prime Minister said to the 
leader of the Reform Party just now, the government is really 
determined to offload its debt problems on the backs of the 
provinces, since he just told the leader of the Reform Party that a 
transfer of responsibility for post-secondary education, health 
and social assistance would not entail a concomitant transfer of 
tax points to the provinces. That is what we understood from the 
Prime Minister's reply.
<P>

	Can the Prime Minister promise, and this is a serious matter, 
that the measures in the upcoming budget will not constitute 
an outright offloading of the government's responsibilities on 
the backs of the provinces? This is walking away from 
responsibility. It is not decentralization.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, every day, the hon. member rises in the House to ask us 
to cut spending. If we cut spending, we cut. If he tells us to cut 
spending and transfer the money, we are back to square one. We 
are going to cut a lot of spending and we are going to try to 
achieve our objectives, and we will. We will do what it takes.
<P>
	Discussions are being held with the provinces. We will try to 
reach an agreement the best way we can. Yesterday, Premier 
Wells said: stop sending us money for our forests. I am not going

<P>

question is fundamentally flawed. There is nothing in the bill

down on the criminal misuse of guns and to achieve the sort of 
control any reasonable society wants to ensure public safety.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I contend that the justice minister's plan is 
fundamentally flawed. Under his plan these individuals will 
only be allowed to transfer their guns to the crown, to the police 
or to a few authorized businesses that are licensed to acquire 
prohibited firearms.
<P>
	Could the justice minister tell the thousands of responsible 
gun owners who now own these guns if they are going to get a 
fair price, considering he has drastically reduced the market?

to have the support of two out of three Albertans among others.
<P>

	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	In her report on her investigation of firearms, coroner 
Anne-Marie David recommends to the Minister of Justice that 
shipments of arms stored and transported by importers be 
covered by specific legislation.
<P>
	In view of the fact that, in Quebec alone, 1,502 imported 
revolvers and pistols were reported stolen in 1992 and 1993, 
how can the Minister of Justice claim to be tabling a bill that 
responds to needs, when he ignored the recommendation of 
coroner Anne-Marie David?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed in 
the hon. member's attitude toward this bill. On November 30, 
when we tabled our program, she found fault with it because we 
had no bill. Now that we have a bill, the hon. member is still not 
offering any constructive criticism. The hon. member knows 
full well that most Canadians, and Quebecers in particular, 
support these proposals.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would suggest that if the hon. member has suggestions to 
make in committee to improve the bill that she do so, but that she 
stand today in this House with the majority of Canadians in 
favour of this bill instead of making individual criticisms when 
overall it meets the safety needs of Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
given the official opposition's criticism when his plan of action 
was unveiled in December, does the Minister of Justice still plan 
to allow the owners of the 13,000 automatic weapons registered 
in Canada, including 4,000 AK-47s, to keep them legally for the 
rest of their lives?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, according to the bill 
that was tabled today, all such paramilitary weapons will be 
prohibited. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9604"> 9604 </A></B>
<P>
They will be out of circulation at the end of the lives of those 
who now own them.
<P>
	In the meantime, so that we do not ``confiscate'', to use the 
word of the hon. member from another province, they will be 
permitted to trade them, buy them and sell them among 
members of that same class. However, at the end of the day, in 
keeping with the policies and principles of the bill, those 
firearms will be out of circulation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	On December 1, 1994 one of my colleagues who was 
concerned about the detrimental effect the ban of .32 and .22 
calibre handguns would have on the world cup shooting 
competitors who have trained at great expense and proudly 
represented this country, asked the minister this question: ``Will 
the minister make a commitment to remove the .32 calibre 
handgun from this list of banned firearms?'' The minister's 
response: ``I most certainly will not''. I ask the minister, what 
made him change his mind?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the .32 calibre 
handguns along with .25 calibre handguns will be prohibited by 
this legislation.
<P>
	What we have made clear is that the unique firearm, used for 
example by Linda Thom in earning a gold medal at the 1984 
Olympics, which is a .32-.22 interchangeable barrel Walther 
handgun, will be permitted.
<P>
	Today we made clear that as we refer this bill to committee 
after second reading in this House, we are asking the committee 
to identify other handguns that are used in competitions 
sanctioned by the International Shooting Union so that 
legitimate competitions can continue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I might 
advise the minister that the Liberal Party of Alberta opposes his 
proposal.
<P>
	Nevertheless, inasmuch as the justice minister has changed 
his mind regarding the banning of handguns used in competitive 
shooting, what other areas of legislation is the minister prepared 
to change?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I hope it is evident not 
only to the hon. member but to everyone in this House and in the 
country that notwithstanding changes as reflected in the bill 
introduced today, the one thing that remains is our commitment 
to the principles of this policy.
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	Speaking of commitment to principles, the hon. member is a 
member of a party which prides itself as the law and order party 
in the House of Commons. I would like that party to explain why 
it opposes legislation which has the support of the police and the 
victims groups of this country.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister. The tenors of the federal 
government keep on repeating that we can make federalism 
more flexible without reforming the constitution, and that 
administrative agreements could suffice to settle the issue.
<P>
	If the Prime Minister wants us to take him seriously, before 
the referendum, why has he refused to grant Quebec's requests 
regarding job training, and for the sake of efficiency, to finally 
acknowledge the consensus in Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we made the provincial government some offers on this 
issue several months ago. We could not grant all of their 
requests, and as the minister responsible for federal-provincial 
relations said, half a loaf of bread is better than none, and yet, 
they refused.
<P>
	I know very well that she would remain a separatist even if we 
resolved the workforce issue. The question that should be asked 
in the referendum is: ``Do you want to separate from Canada?'' 
That is the question, and Quebecers will reply: ``We want to stay 
in Canada, we do not want anything to do with the separatists''.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I detect 
in the Prime Minister's answer that he is interested in foiling the 
separatists, to the detriment of the unemployed, who are in need 
of job training.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister confirm that his government never 
planned to transfer responsibility for job training to Quebec, but 
on the contrary, that he intends to increase intervention in this 
area through his social program reforms, financing that 
intervention even more, perhaps even with surpluses from the 
unemployment insurance fund?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to see flexible separatists, because in 
this case, she is asking to change the Canadian constitution. She 
is no longer talking about separation. So she is going to have to 
make up her mind eventually.

<P>
	At the most recent meeting of the Northwest Atlantic

halibut. Now the European Union is threatening to ignore this 
internationally respected conservation body and launch a

of this challenge?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans,

<P>

was assigned by the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries 
Organization-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I would ask you please to respect 
both the questions and the answers. I am sure we want to hear

<P>
	<B>Mr. Tobin:</B> Mr. Speaker, a noisy House is particularly 
difficult for quiet-spoken members like me.
<P>
	Canadian fishermen indeed were pleased to receive from the 
Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization 60 per cent of the 
turbot quota at the meeting in Brussels. They thought it 
appropriate that the Spanish fleet fishing under the EU flag 
received an appropriate level of allocation, in this case 13 per 
cent.
<P>
	We want to work with the European Union to see this 
conservation plan put in place in a responsible fashion. The 
Department of Foreign Affairs has taken the lead in making 
Canada's view known.
<P>
<B>(1440 ) </B>
<P>
	We have heard reports that the EU may object to the NAFO

connected with those incidents and those in Somalia, but retain 
the regiment.
<P>
	Has he considered that by disbanding the airborne he is 
unnecessarily inflicting upon the Canadian taxpayer millions of

for dismantling the facility at Petawawa and for establishing a

all these questions three weeks ago. I am sorry the hon. member 
is now just addressing them.
<P>
	With respect to operational costs, there probably will be some 
operational costs involved. On the other hand, most of the 
activity at CFB Petawawa will be retained simply because in the

the toxic coke oven site is not included in the clean ups and the

<P>

process?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

working very closely with the province of Nova Scotia to ensure 
that the CCME guidelines that were adopted in 1992 on 
hazardous waste incineration, that is stronger, more stringent 
guidelines, will be applied. We will be working with the 
province to monitor its application to ensure the health and the 
safety of all of the residents around the Sydney tar ponds.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this is only part of the problem. A full environmental assessment

<P>
	Yesterday the minister replied that the tar ponds project was 
operating within CCME guidelines. The minister's answer is 
inconsistent with the 1994 consultant's report which lists 
federal guidelines and compares them with the tar ponds 
operating permit, showing many discrepancies.
<P>

the tar ponds consultant's report and her answer yesterday?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

operating permit was established in 1988 it was established

<P>
	When in 1992 the Canadian Council of Ministers of the 
Environment improved the guidelines to ensure that they were 
more stringent with respect to PCB incineration, the project in 
Nova Scotia in question was voluntarily submitted to those 
guidelines.
<P>

working with the Government of Nova Scotia to ensure that not

also that the regulations generally be changed to reflect that.

	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to have the last word today.
<P>
	In response to the hon. member, we have made a review of all 
order in council appointments. Hundreds of have been cut since 
this government has taken charge. We are reviewing all of these 
appointments. We have reduced them and we intend to continue 
to do so.
<P>
	In the case of this individual, as the Minister of State for 
Veterans said, it is a problem which is before the courts at the 
moment.

	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last week, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
said that most of the $5.9 million budget for its department's

duplication and overlap between federal and provincial 
programs.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, we currently have action plans with eight 
provinces and two territories to reduce duplication. Over the last 
year, we signed 64 agreements with the provinces and the 
territories and they are all public. Consequently, we have no 
problem with letting the opposition marvel at such 
achievements.
<P>

<P>
	By September 12, 1994, eight agreements had been concluded

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
12 years ago a Boeing 767 flying from Montreal to Edmonton 
nearly crashed over northwestern Ontario. This near tragedy 
was not a result of a mechanical failure or a powerful prairie 
thunderstorm. It simply ran out of gas.
<P>
	In its statement the airline placed the blame for this 
emergency on human error involved in converting the fuel 
measurement from imperial to metric amounts. It was only the 
skill of the pilot that manoeuvred the drifting aircraft to a safe 
landing. At 30,000 feet refuelling is no longer an option. The 
fate of the passengers lay in the hands of leadership. 
Interestingly enough the airline was Air Canada.
<P>
<B>(1505 ) </B>
<P>
	Canada as a nation is like that aircraft. Our ship of state is in 
trouble, not because of some internal mechanical malfunction 
but because of human error.
<P>
	The world has changed to a new competitive economy. The 
rules have changed but our ground crew still does not know how 
to make the conversion. After two decades of human error air 
Canada is drifting. Our financial reserves are empty and 
Canadians, the passengers, are deeply concerned about their 
future and safety. The only problem is that at this moment the 
incompetent ground crew is still flying the aeroplane.
<P>
	Each one of us knows that personal security is vitally 
important to Canadians. Ours is a compassionate society. We all 
want to know that our friends, families, neighbours and 
ourselves will be taken care of during times of need. Yet 
somehow after 30 years of ballooning government spending on 
social programs we have been left with less security rather than 
more. Why is this so?
<P>
	Let me save the suspense by answering my own question. 
Canadians feel more insecure now than ever before because 
government overspending has robbed them of their personal 
security. The welfare state has failed. Just as communism and 
socialism crumbled after a 75-year experiment, our own 
25-year social digression has come to a painful conclusion.
<P>
	Canadians are beginning to realize that the welfare state is not 
working and that it is time to re-evaluate the government's role 
in providing social security to individuals. The greatest single 
danger to the personal security of Canadians comes from the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9610"> 9610 </A></B>
<P>
financial unsustainability of social programs currently 
monopolized by government. They are unsustainable if we have 
to borrow money to pay for them, which is  exactly what 
successive governments have done for the last 25 years.
<P>
	Thanks to such irresponsible management the federal debt is 
now over $530 billion and provincial and municipal 
governments owe another $190 billion. Instead of providing 
peace of mind these programs and their associated debt have left 
Canadians feeling anxious about this, about their and their 
families' futures.
<P>
	Why have Canada's debt and deficit left Canadians feeling 
anxious and insecure about their futures? The reason Canadians 
feel such concern is that after being deceived for so long, led to 
believe that government would look after them and take care of 
them from cradle to grave, they have come to realize they are 
now relying on a bankrupt state. They have come to realize the 
interest payments on the debt have become so large and are 
growing so fast that it is beginning to crowd out the social 
programs that have protected them for nearly a generation.
<P>
	The greatest risks to Canada's social fabric are the threats of 
annual deficits and a rising national debt which over the past 30 
years has crowded out many legitimate expenditures of 
governments.
<P>
	We have borrowed so much over the last 25 years and 
accumulated so much debt that all the money we borrow this 
year will be used to pay interest on our federal debt. When it 
comes to government there are no free lunches. In fact 
compound interest make the ultimate cost of what government is 
borrowing very costly indeed; in fact more costly than if we had 
paid for them outright, if we had paid our own way to begin with.
<P>
	Effectively interest payments are crowding out programs. 
Money that could be used to help Canadians is simply not 
available to us because we have to pay our interest obligations. 
Interest payment on the debt is now the single largest 
expenditure item for many governments, depleting resources for 
public investments in health, education and infrastructure. As 
we continue to borrow, our debt increases as does the interest, 
leaving even less money for essential programs.
<P>
	Where does all this debt and compound interest leave 
Canadians? It leaves us paying more taxes while at the same 
time receiving fewer services. Canada's debt burden is both 
eating up a substantial portion of current tax dollars and 
reducing the ability of all levels of government to provide 
essential social services. Can we understand now why 
Canadians are concerned?
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	How did we get into this mess? Whose human error or 
ignorance while working with ground support has brought us to 
a place of flying empty at 30,000 feet? Who could the 
passengers of our drifting air Canada hold responsible for 
bringing them into such a dangerous predicament?
<P>
	It just so happens the ground support staff has been promoted 
to captain and crew. Is that not a comforting thought? The very 
ones who got us into this mess are now in control. Meanwhile, 
Captain Chrétien sails serenely on committing ordinary 
Canadians to a perpetual stream of more interest. Ironically it 
was the Trudeau Liberal government of which Mr. Chrétien was 
a member and a one-time finance minister-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I remind the House 
that during any intervention while referring to any member of 
the government cabinet we refer to the position or the office. In 
this case it is the right hon. Prime Minister or the Minister of 
Finance as opposed to the individual's name.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, ironically it was the Trudeau 
Liberal government of which the present Prime Minister was a 
member and a one-time finance minister that first sold 
Canadians on the myth that big government could solve most of 
our problems. What they never made clear was that they would 
pay for this by heavy taxation and borrowing from future 
generations.
<P>
	For more than a quarter of a century Canadians have been 
encouraged to increasingly rely on government and they have 
done just that. The disastrous consequences of these Liberal 
policies are now threatening the well-being of society.
<P>
	As a co-pilot and former ground support staffer, the failure of 
the human resources minister to reform social programs to make 
them target better and cost less is a failure that all Canadians 
will pay for in the form of higher taxes.
<P>
	We need to fight the debt and deficit not to hurt people but to 
help them, to free them from the chains of insecurity, the links of 
which are made of debt and interest payments. The welfare state 
is sinking under the weight of its own waste, inefficiency and 
disabling dependency.
<P>
	Fundamental reform and renewal of our social security 
framework are absolutely imperative if we are to have any hope 
of sustaining our existing high quality of life, providing 
Canadian youth with opportunities rather than simply an 
unmanageable financial obligation, and continuing to help the 
poor and needy among us.
<P>
	The government intends to continue to borrow billions of 
dollars every year. Extra interest must then be paid on each 
year's borrowings. Each extra dollar in interest is a dollar taken 
out of our economy, a dollar that could have been used to expand 
a business, take advantage of trade opportunities or hire an 
unemployed Canadian.
<P>
	Let us imagine what Canadians could have done with the over 
$40 billion we had to pay out of our pockets in interest last year 
alone. Let us imagine the health care it would have paid for or 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9611"> 9611 </A></B>
<P>
the poor whose basic needs could have been met. Let us imagine 
the education and training that $40 billion could have provided 
or the help to our seniors who live in poverty.
<P>
	The government should act now before interest drains our 
social security further and further every year, get a grip on its 
spending, find more effective ways to deliver the services we 
require, and let us get on with the job of building a secure society 
for ourselves and our children.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the member for Calgary North who I thought gave a 
fine presentation. Seemingly she is concerned about finding 
somebody to blame for our past problems and our budgetary 
situation today.
<P>
	I note that all western democracies, all OECD countries, 
increased their deficits during this period of time. Clearly we 
would not blame the Prime Minister or our party for the debts of 
the rest of the world.
<P>
	I do not think it is fair realistically to go back and study 
history. What we want and what the people of Canada want are 
solutions. I am surprised by an opposition party that has no 
solutions. All I heard were complaints. All I heard were 
problems. There were no solutions.
<P>
<B>(1515 ) </B>
<P>
	There is one thing I would like to know as a bottom line from 
my hon. colleagues in the Reform Party. They want to basically 
allocate social spending to the provinces, give up tax points to 
the provinces. What is the end result of this philosophy? Ten 
balkanized countries within Canada? What about standards, 
health standards, labour standards? What is it that makes a 
country?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, there were a lot of questions in 
that intervention. I would be happy to address them.
<P>
	My hon. colleague says that Canada was not the only one that 
ran up a debt, that everyone else did too, so why pick on us. I do 
not know about you, Mr. Speaker, but your mother was probably 
like mine. She used to say to me: ``If all your friends jump off a 
bridge, does that mean you are going to too?''. We are not 
responsible for other countries. The leadership of our country is 
responsible for us. It has not done a very responsible job of 
looking after our interests in the long term.
<P>
	Members opposite are always pleading for solutions from our 
party. We have worked hard to provide them with solutions. We 
will even be providing them with an alternative budget which is 
something no opposition party has ever done before.
<P>
	I would suggest to the hon. member that perhaps he and his 
party need to work a little harder to provide some solutions. 
They should provide some glimmer of reform solutions to the 
people of Canada. I might add that solutions in the social policy 
area were promised loud and long and have never been delivered 
on.
<P>
	Members opposite need to realize that if tax points were given 
to the provinces in order to allow them to have more control over 
the social programs in their provinces, the tax points grow as the 
tax base of the province grows. The tax base, the economies of 
our provinces and our country have been growing.
<P>
	Once we give provinces tax points, their potential tax base 
actually expands, many over time. They actually have more 
hope of funding their programs long term and having a 
continuing source of revenue than if they were dependent on 
transfers from the federal government. As we have seen, 
transfers can be cut or are very uncertain. Provinces that have 
their own tax base to draw from are much more secure-and my 
economist colleague is nodding so I think I have this right-than 
if they are totally dependent on whatever largesse the federal 
government might decide to give them from time to time.
<P>
	My colleague mentions fears that if there is not a centralist 
government, a tightly controlled federation from the centre 
which has always been the Liberal vision of this country, that 
somehow things will go to hell in a hand basket. I might point 
out to him that things are not too far from going to hell in a hand 
basket with the centralist vision having been very firmly in 
place for the last 25 years.
<P>
	Surely we can do no worse than to trust those governments 
which are closest to us the people. We have the most impact on 
those and we can influence them more effectively than distant, 
federal central governments. If we could have more say and 
more influence over our own local governments, we would be a 
lot better off than we are today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to speak to our supply motion 
which demands that the government respond to the demands of 
Canadians with spending cuts and not net tax increases.
<P>
	Currently we are engaged in one of the greatest threats to our 
society and economy. It is not something that comes from 
without, but something that comes from within our own 
boundaries. It is not the deficit spending but the debt, that 
massive summation of overspending that has gone on for at least 
two decades that seeks to compromise every aspect of our 
society, every aspect of our economy and seeks to affect every 
individual in this country from coast to coast.
<P>
	What is the magnitude of this debt? Many people talk about 
the federal debt being $550 billion. They do not include the 
provincial debt of $220 billion, the municipal debt of several 
billion, and unfunded liabilities such as CPP in the order of $500 
billion. What does this do? The combination of all this amounts 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9612"> 9612 </A></B>
<P>
to over $1.2 trillion. This debt is ever increasing and causes us to 
pay increasing amounts of interest from the public purse on this.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	The government takes in about $120 billion every year and 
spends about $160 billion which means a deficit of about $40 
billion. It is interesting because this amount is actually the 
amount of interest we borrow every year to pay on our debt. The 
government also spends out of this $40 billion on government 
services and about $80 billion on social programs.
<P>
	As the debt increases we have larger interest payments to 
make which must come from one of two sources, either 
increased taxes or a boost in the economy. The increased taxes 
will either come from companies or from individuals.
<P>
	If you are an individual it decreases your ability to spend 
money which has a downward effect on the economy. Similarly, 
if members speak to businesses in their communities they will 
find they cannot hire more people, they cannot do more 
research, they cannot do any more development, they cannot 
expand. Therefore it has a depressing and downward effect on 
the economy.
<P>
	The citizens of Canada have sent a clear message to every 
member of Parliament: No new taxes; get the economic house in 
order; and make the necessary cuts in expenditures to do this 
because our taxes are already too high.
<P>
	The government has said it will cut expenditures to 3 per cent 
of GDP, but I submit this is an element of intellectual 
dishonesty. This comes from the Maastricht negotiations where 
it was said that the combined amounts should be 3 per cent of the 
net debt, not the federal debt, but the accumulated debt which in 
this country is over $1 trillion.
<P>
	If we adhere to what this government wishes to do, over a 
period of three years we will add at least $100 billion to the debt 
and further increase the amount of interest payments we have to 
make every year.
<P>
	Even if we balance the budget, and we should look at the New 
Zealand experiment, there will be no change in interest 
payments over the short term and these expenditures will 
continue, but we do not have a choice in the matter. If we look at 
New Zealand now, some 10 years after its economic downturn, 
we see a country that is booming, a country that has one of the 
most aggressive and positive economies in the world. The 
reason it did this was because it was forced to the wall to get its 
economic house in order.
<P>
	We do not necessarily want to go the way of New Zealand. We 
do not want a solution foisted upon us from outside the country 
by the international financial institutions. We would like to have 
a made in Canada solution, a solution which makes cuts that are 
sensitive and sensible without affecting the poorest of the poor 
in order to save the core of our social programs and to keep the 
economy we have come to know.
<P>
	Our role in opposition is not to continually criticize, as the 
member from the other party mentioned just a few minutes ago. 
We have put forth a constructive and specific program to this 
government on how and where to make the necessary decreases 
in government expenditures. In other words, we have put 
forward constructive alternatives which very few opposition 
parties in the history of Parliament have ever done.
<P>
	Initially, our financial group looked at government operations 
and removed $10 billion from that. Further, it decided to make 
cuts of $15 billion to $18 billion from social programs. The rest 
we would need in order to balance the budget would come from a 
3 per cent growth in the economy.
<P>
	Contrary to what has been put forward in the media, we are not 
a slash and burn party. Rather we are putting forth constructive 
and sensitive cuts in order to preserve the core of social 
programs in order to minimize the effect it will have on those 
who are most disadvantaged in our society.
<P>
	Be aware that if we do not make these necessary changes now 
while we are in an economic upturn, we will have to do it in an 
economic downturn. That, my colleagues, will be one which is 
going to affect those who are least advantaged the most.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	As I said before, our financial group has put forth a very 
constructive and specific plan in making these decreases to 
expenditures. The first priority is that we in this House must set 
an example. As a result of that we say: Let us make the cuts from 
the top first.
<P>
	First we spoke about revamping MP pension plans and time 
and time again we have presented to this government specific 
ways in which to do that.
<P>
	We have also advocated a 15 per cent cut to our budgets and 
eliminating excessive travel by members of Parliament. Just as 
an aside, each of us in this House can actually do this. In my 
office we found that by booking early and looking for deals we 
have decreased the amount of travel expenditures by 60 per cent 
from the average MP. If we all did this, it would be a 
considerable saving to the taxpayer.
<P>
	We also say in this party that we must prioritize the funding to 
ensure that those aspects of government that are essential, that 
is, health care, education and law enforcement, are of the 
highest priority in terms of spending. We must also decrease 
duplication between the federal and provincial governments for 
savings of roughly $3.5 billion.
<P>
	Some examples are eliminating the Official Languages Act 
which would save $310 million, to such things as eliminating 
official multiculturalism. Just as an aside I would like to say that 
this policy is one of the most divisive policies in the country. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9613"> 9613 </A></B>
<P>
Rather than concentrating on those things that bind us together 
as individuals it concentrates on our differences.
<P>
	Speaking as an immigrant to this country, one who is very 
proud to have had the ability to come here and live here, this 
country offers so many things to all different peoples. One of the 
beauties of this country is that we are one of the few countries in 
the world which has been able to merge together over 160 
different ethnic groups into a relatively heterogeneous group in 
peace. It is something as Canadians we ought to be proud of. Our 
new Governor General actually made a point of mentioning this 
in his installation speech which I was very grateful to hear.
<P>
	Another aspect in our financial plan has been to stop 
subsidizing businesses and special interest groups to the tune of 
$3.7 billion a year. When we speak to businesses in the 
community they do not want handouts. They want a stable 
economy, a stable dollar, a skilled workforce and good 
information about where they can capitalize on export markets.
<P>
	I encourage our fellow members who sit on the foreign affairs 
committee and the foreign affairs and international trade 
department to please listen and devise ways in which companies 
in our country can aggressively take advantage of export 
markets. They are out there and we can do it. We are more than 
happy to help.
<P>
	The cuts we propose are over three years. Again we have 
emphasized no new taxes.
<P>
	Some studies recently have come out to say that we in Canada 
are not taxed that heavily. I would argue again that this is an 
example of intellectual dishonesty. What it looked at was an 
example of taxation as a percentage of GDP which has no 
relation whatsoever as to how this affects each individual 
Canadian.
<P>
	What is perhaps more revealing is to look at how it would 
affect the average person on the street. In 1961 the average 
Canadian family paid 22 per cent of its income in taxes and the 
free tax day was May 3. In 1994 the average Canadian family 
paid 46 per cent of its income in taxes and the tax free day 
jumped 44 days to June 16. We are being taxed more. Just in the 
eight years these taxes per family have gone up $3,500. This is 
due to increased spending by governments.
<P>
	The government has recommended and made rumblings on 
increases in taxes on gas, lottery winnings, dental and medical 
benefits, surtaxes on individuals and businesses, RRSPs, 
inheritance taxes, and so on. The public and we in this party have 
said time and time again: Do not do this; we will not allow it to 
happen.
<P>
	We would ask the finance minister to please look very 
carefully at the well thought out and specific plans our financial 
group has put forth. Please adopt as many of these plans as 
possible to do. We are more than happy to help you get our 
economic house in order. I put that to you as an offer.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to the member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca tell us a 
lot about federal expenditures. I must remind him that this has 
been going on for a long time and particularly since 1970, when 
the Liberal government of the time decided to centralize pretty 
well everything in Ottawa in an effort to boost the economy, so 
to speak. At that point in the 1970s, the government, by 
borrowing to create jobs and build up the economy, also caused 
the economy to overheat somewhat, which led to an appalling 
rate of inflation.
<P>
	Do you remember the 1970s? Having created the inflation 
itself, the government was obliged to raise interest rates enough 
in the 1980s in order to reduce this appalling inflation, which 
had reached a rate of approximately 10 per cent per year. This 
means that the government created the inflation between 1970 
and 1980. In 1980, it raised interest rates to reduce inflation and 
caused the recession. In 1984, the Conservatives continued to 
spend in the same way as the Liberals, who had set up certain 
projects to get through the recession between 1980 and 1984.
<P>
	Between 1984 and 1990, the Conservative federal 
government continued to spend as the Liberals had between 
1970 and 1980. They created more inflation, and, naturally, in 
1990, they raised the interest rates and created another 
recession, which has lasted four or five years now.
<P>
	It is easy enough to understand; this means that the federal 
government has caused all of Canada's problems. It is clear and 
precise. I will try to explain, in three minutes, that the real cause 
of the debt is the federal government itself which interfered in 
matters of no concern to it. It meddled in the economy, in all 
kinds of things.
<P>
	I agree in principle with the Reform Party member who says 
that the federal government must stop some of its interference 
with the provinces if not most of it. And before him, the Reform 
Party member for Calgary-North said much the same. The 
government must disentangle itself and decentralize precisely 
to restore order in the country.
<P>
	This is why I, for one, have taken the position that federalism 
has caused a tremendous amount of harm and has led Canada to 
bankruptcy and this is why I ask and we ask that Quebec become 
a sovereign nation in economic association with the rest of 
Canada, with Canada remaining as a type of committee or 
advisory board, a type of board responsible for managing areas 
the regions have in common. I would to hear the member's 
comments on this.
<P>

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my hon. colleague for the number of questions he poses.
<P>
	We all know the history of the debt and deficit but rather than 
pointing fingers back in time we should look forward in the 
interests of all Canadians to put forward a constructive solution. 
I believe that is one of the things we have done.
<P>
	Another issue that my hon. colleague mentions is the division 
between federal and provincial responsibilities. I will take but 
one example that is probably very close to his heart and that is 
the official languages policy. We in this party and people from 
coast to coast, including the people in Quebec, have said that the 
official languages policy has been a dismal failure.
<P>
	We are saying we should give language responsibility to the 
provinces. If every province had that responsibility then they, 
the people inside the province, will determine what will be the 
language of choice in that area. It would reflect the regional 
bilingualism or unilingualism of an area. It would also save the 
taxpayer hundreds of millions of dollars per year.
<P>
	To reiterate, the biggest threat we have to the social programs 
is continued overspending. What we are trying to do, what we 
are obligated to do in the interests of those who are most 
disadvantaged in our society is to ensure that we get spending 
under control to enable the government to have the money to 
spend on them.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure for me to participate in this debate.
<P>
	As I listen to the Reform Party and particularly the last 
speaker, I cannot help wondering if they believe in a country 
called Canada at all, believe in a sense of nationhood, in a 
society in which the public sector, the private sector all have a 
role to play. Do they believe in the kind of liberalism that has 
always defended the proper balance between those two roles but 
above all has stood for a sense of nationhood from coast to coast 
and not a patchwork quilt?
<P>
	This debate provides us a good opportunity to bring 
Canadians and the Reform Party up to date on some of the very 
specific measures that the government has undertaken to control 
spending and to use their money prudently.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	If the hon. members opposite would only take the time to look 
at the budget the Minister of Finance tabled last year and to add 
up all of the initiatives on public finances taken since, they 
would conclude that the motion is a little off the mark.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In that budget we made a start, but only a start, by reducing the 
deficit from $45.7 billion to $39.7 billion. This was done by 
cutting spending. There were $5 of cuts for every dollar of 
revenue action.
<P>
	More important, we introduced a number of policies to 
stimulate job creation and the economy responded admirably. 
Since we came to office in November 1993, 413,000 new jobs 
have been created in Canada. I have to say on behalf of my own 
region that 13,400 of these were created in the national capital 
region in spite of expenditure reductions and government 
restraint. The Canadian economy is now out performing those of 
all G-7 countries and it is expected to do the same next year.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	For clarity and conciseness, I will only comment on 
initiatives sponsored by the hon. Marcel Massé, Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs and Minister responsible for Public 
Service Renewal.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	These initiatives, in general an integral part of the 
government's overall approach of fiscally sound management, 
will themselves contribute in a substantial way to the longer 
term economic management of the country.
<P>
	When the government took office, we realized that as a 
nation, we are confronted with change the magnitude of which 
we have never seen before. The changes that are occurring here, 
in other countries and in most spheres of human endeavour are 
ushering in an altogether new era.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It was obvious to us that the old methods of approaching and 
resolving problems were longer adequate. It was also obvious 
that, to continue serving the population well in the next century, 
we would have to change the very role the government played.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As a government, our agenda is clear: creating the conditions 
to sustain economic growth, facilitate the creation of new 
business and get people back to work. As a government, our 
message is clear. Government spending is being and will 
continue to be brought under control.
<P>
	As a nation we have reached a point of no return where we no 
longer have alternatives. Postponing the hard decisions that are 
needed this year would merely postpone the inevitable need for 
more dramatic and disruptive action in the future.
<P>
<B>(1540 ) </B>
<P>
	My hon. colleague, the minister and the government caucus 
understand that any serious attempt at deficit reduction now and 
especially in the long term requires a basic restructuring of what 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9615"> 9615 </A></B>
<P>
government is and what government does. That is exactly what 
the minister has been doing this last year, looking at precisely 
how  government can be restructured in such a way that it not 
only spends less but also concentrates on its core roles and 
responsibilities.
<P>
	The full details, as we are all aware, will be announced in the 
forthcoming budget. However, the minister has looked at ways 
that government operations can be more focused, more client 
centred, more efficient and more cost effective. In a word, the 
kind of government Canadians want, at a price they can afford.
<P>
	It is very obvious that Canadians have understood our 
intentions, that they agree with and support our approach. We 
need only look at the results of yesterday's byelections for 
confirmation of this. The voters in three riding enthusiastically 
endorsed the Liberal government's actions to create jobs and 
growth.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you will recall that the Prime Minister asked Mr. 
Massé to lead a review of every department's programs, 
activities and expenditures. This initiative, known as a program 
review, covered approximately $47 billion in program spending.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The program review had three major objectives. The first was 
to strengthen the public administration of federal programs and 
services. Program review will lead to a smaller, more efficient 
federal government delivering high priority programs to 
Canadians.
<P>
	The second objective was to make a contribution to the 
modernization of Canadian federalism. Program review will 
help ensure the federal government delivers only those 
programs and services it is best equipped to deliver.
<P>
	The third objective was to help the government meet its fiscal 
objectives. Federal departments have recommended major 
reductions in program spending based on their priorities. In 
general, ministers proposed a range of program changes and 
consolidations which are to be implemented following the 1995 
budget.
<P>
	These changes are designed to ensure that departments 
discard non-core responsibilities. Similar programs and 
services are placed in a single department to achieve maximum 
efficiency. What has been done with pesticide control in recent 
days is a very good example of that.
<P>
	Overlap and duplication among and between departments and 
jurisdictions is removed. New technologies are used to lower the 
cost of program delivery, while increasing service standards. 
Cost recovery and user fees are to be used to finance programs 
that provide economic benefits to clients and stakeholders.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Every sector of government activity-from transportation, 
farming and fisheries to energy, mines and forestry, as well as 
assistance to businesses, immigration, etc-was reviewed. 
Almost all federal departments will be called upon to restructure 
their programs and to concentrate their efforts on sectors of 
national or international importance, sectors which are in the 
general interest of the country. This was one of the program 
review's guiding principles.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Program review outcomes will provide clear and undeniable 
evidence that the federal government has confronted its fiscal 
pressures by getting its own fiscal house in order. The federal 
public service will be reduced significantly. Its size and 
functions will be brought into line with the federal government 
core roles arising from the program review.
<P>
	This is and will continue to be a difficult period for public 
service employees right across the country and here in the 
national capital region. Local members of Parliament such as 
myself and the newly elected member for Ottawa-Vanier are 
all committed to ensuring that reductions in the public service 
workforce are managed in a fair, orderly way so as to reduce to 
an absolute minimum the stresses and disruptions to the lives of 
individuals affected.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	As public service employees across this country hear 
horrendous stories about the magnitude of downsizing, I want it 
to be clear that we are not talking about huge numbers of public 
service employees losing their jobs. Financial compensation 
packages will be there. They will be fair and they will be 
adequate.
<P>
	We will be flexible and imaginative in our approach. Every 
means at the disposal of government will be used to ease and 
facilitate the acquisition of new skills to make the transition to 
new careers as smooth and as complete as possible.
<P>
	Let me illustrate how the program review will translate into 
specific actions by citing the Department of Transport as an 
example.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As the Minister of Transport said several times, the 
transportation system in Canada is too intrusive, subsidies are 
distorting trade and several parts of the system are in bad shape. 
Following the program review, Transport Canada will no longer 
own large parts of the system. It will no longer operate and 
finance them. Instead, it will focus on its fundamental 
responsibilities in terms of direction and regulation in order to 
ensure the safety of the transportation system.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9616"> 9616 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Market discipline and business principles will be brought into 
the operation of transportation services. Costs will be reduced, 
overcapacity eliminated, regulations streamlined.
<P>
	Another example is in the Department of Industry. The 
minister has announced that the era of providing subsidies to big 
business is ending. I am pleased to hear that the Reform Party 
supports that initiative of our government.
<P>
	The private sector is the engine of economic growth and job 
creation. Nevertheless, the federal government will continue to 
have a significant role in creating the climate for business to be 
able to invest, innovate and compete for markets.
<P>
	These are the types of sensible and meaningful improvements 
that will result right across government as a result of program 
review.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would now like to draw the attention of members opposite to 
another similar initiative taken by the minister to make the 
federation more efficient by reducing overlap and duplication 
between the various levels of government.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Members will recall that at the first ministers meeting in 
December 1993 very shortly after our election, there was 
agreement to forge ahead on tackling specific issues and areas of 
shared responsibility or jurisdiction where overlap and 
duplication could be greatly reduced or eliminated altogether. 
Six months later, through a process of joint bilateral 
agreements, the two territories and eight of the provinces with 
one more coming on board signed action plans and set 
timeframes for concluding their work to get rid of overlap and 
duplication.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	To really understand the type of improvements sought, let us 
consider the situation faced by the pulp and paper mills. They 
now have to deal with inspectors from the three levels of 
government, federal, provincial and municipal. We have agreed 
that, from now on, one inspector would be enough.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This is an example of the kind of sensible, meaningful 
activities which will result from the more than 50 action plans 
that have so far been signed between the federal government and 
the provinces. This work will continue. There will be more 
action plans in the months and years ahead as we continue to 
find ways to improve the efficiency of the federation.
<P>
	It is important to underline that the reduction of overlap and 
duplication does not just result in savings. It also results in 
something as or more important and that is less government 
intervention on the individual and business and a more rational 
understandable  environment in which to operate. That is not 
small change.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	In addition to these two initiatives, the Minister responsible 
for Public Service Renewal has also looked at the role, function, 
size and cost of more than 400 federal agencies, boards, 
commissions and advisory bodies.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Ministers have been asked to review the various organizations 
under their jurisdiction, in order to simplify the machinery of 
government, by eliminating the organizations which have 
become useless or inactive and by streamlining the others.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In undertaking this review of boards and commissions, there 
were no set targets. Rather, it was intended to identify sensible 
and practical changes to make government work better. I might 
also say that has also been our approach to the public service: 
not to set numerical targets and not to take the slash and burn 
approach, but to say what makes sense to make this government 
work better.
<P>
	To return to the boards and commissions, the first phase of 
this initiative is already before the House as Bill C-65, 
legislation which will enable the government to eliminate or 
significantly streamline 22 agencies and advisory bodies. By 
doing this, 150 governor in council positions will be eliminated. 
In very real terms these measures will save taxpayers about $1.5 
million a year.
<P>
	That is only one step in that process. The minister will be 
returning to the House with a second omnibus bill which will 
conclude the work. At that time hundreds of additional governor 
in council positions will be eliminated at what is anticipated to 
be a savings of approximately $10 million.
<P>
	As the minister said in the House last week, the government 
wants to ensure that federal agencies continue to be relevant, 
that they are serving Canadians as effectively as possible and 
also that sensible and practical actions are taken to eliminate 
overlap and duplication and simplify government wherever 
possible.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I have just described three impressive components of the 
overall approach taken by the government towards fiscal 
responsibility. I think it is important for members opposite to 
understand these initiatives and agree that, as is the case with all 
the measures taken by this government, these are thoughtful, 
rational and well-considered decisions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9617"> 9617 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Proposals for mindless, indiscriminate axing in spending do 
not work in the modern context. Such proposals are simple 
minded and damaging not just to the economy but to the people 
of this country. Protecting the vulnerable is an essential function 
of government and to this we are deeply committed.
<P>
	Yet we must be fair to taxpayers. Fairness to taxpayers means 
eliminating abuse, eliminating the careless use of public funds, 
eliminating non-productive activities, reducing the size of 
government where possible and providing government that is 
not only affordable but answers to the real needs of citizens and 
of the nation.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I am sure you will concur with me that the range 
of initiatives undertaken by the government meets the 
objectives of fairness, eliminates wasteful spending and builds a 
more co-operative approach to a better future for Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member talked about the cuts proposed in governor in council 
appointments and mentioned a figure with regard to that. It is 
very interesting that Bill C-51, which was before the House 
before Christmas, adds governor in council appointments and 
Bill C-61, which just passed second reading yesterday, adds 
governor in council appointments.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	I would like to know if this figure the hon. member presented 
was net of the new appointments that have been added or is this 
more Liberal doublespeak?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. It gives me an opportunity to say that the world does 
not stay frozen in time and neither does this government.
<P>
	Perhaps the hon. member wants to suggest there are no new 
and emerging needs where this or any government needs the 
wise advice of Canadians who bring special knowledge, special 
skills, special expertise and wisdom to the operations and the 
programs of the federal government. Or, where it makes sense, 
to open up new ways in which we can be advised and counselled 
by Canadians who are capable of keeping us informed and aware 
of broader issues than those we may address in this House. We 
welcome their contribution to the future of this country. At the 
same time we do not want to continue carrying out functions and 
making appointments simply for the sake of making 
appointments.
<P>
	As I have said, we have a multi-stage process for getting rid 
of appointments which are no longer serving a purpose and 
agencies which no longer make a valuable or important 
contribution to the essential work of this government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, once 
again, this member has brought up the issue of protecting the 
vulnerable. I suggest that the Liberals are trying to protect the 
vulnerable with fairy tales.
<P>
	The difference between the Liberal approach and the Reform 
approach is that the Reform pragmatic approach is to take the 
necessary steps to ensure that we can protect those who are most 
vulnerable in our society.
<P>
	This Liberal government by design is going to borrow more 
money in its lifetime to pay the interest on the money we have 
already borrowed, more money in its lifetime factored for 
inflation than we borrowed to fund the entire second world war. 
How in the world are we going to have the money to protect the 
most vulnerable?
<P>
	The Liberals are simply trying to protect them 
euphemistically or with fairy tales rather than practically and by 
doing the things that need to be done to protect the vulnerable in 
our society.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party often says that 
in generalities and yet proposes programs and program cuts that 
would make victims and casualties of women, children, the 
disabled, and seniors in this country. That is what its programs 
would accomplish.
<P>
	For the first time in 20 years, this government is going to 
reverse that pattern which the member talked about of 
increasing interest payments, increasing debt and increasing the 
burden on the future. For the first time this country and this 
House are going to see action instead of promises.
<P>
	This country is not prepared to sacrifice on the altar of short 
term economic need those who most need to have a stake in the 
future of this country, those who most need the opportunity to 
develop their skills and their talents and the ability to be fully 
part of the Canadian economy and Canadian society.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have had several opportunities on the finance 
committee and elsewhere to tell witnesses the truth about the 
welfare program budget cuts that our party is recommending. 
There is no truth whatsoever to the allegation that we would not 
protect the truly needy in our society.
<P>
	The OECD is a highly respected international organization of 
which Canada is a full standing member and has to approve its 
reports. It has said that Canada is an outstanding example of 
excessive generosity in welfare programs.
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	We are not talking about hitting the poor in this world and it is 
an untruth being told and repeated again and again here. We are 
talking about retargeting all the excessive spending that is going 
on. That is the truth. The rest is slandering.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9618"> 9618 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, when I hear members of the 
Reform Party speak I sometimes wonder if they know any 
people who are poor, if they know any people who are 
vulnerable, if they know the women in my riding living in 
subsidized housing, working for minimum wage, supporting 
their families on welfare sometimes, trying very hard to raise 
children decently on an income of less than $12,000 a year.
<P>
	I know those people. I would be happy to take the hon. 
member out to visit my riding to find out just how hard those 
people are working and what they need to support their dreams 
for the future and the dreams of their children.
<P>
	It is also important to point out to this member and others in 
the Reform Party the cost of poverty. Getting our debt and 
deficit down does depend on ending poverty in this country. 
Poverty is expensive. Poverty costs. One out of every five 
children in this country is poor. That child is four times as likely 
to end up seriously ill than the child who is not poor. That means 
that one child simply because of poverty will cost the health care 
system in this country more than the other four non-poor 
children. We cannot get our debt and deficit under control unless 
we get people out of poverty.
<P>
	Poor children are four times more likely to drop out of school. 
At the age of 15 they are out on the streets and five years later 
they have never held a job, they are living in poverty, they are 
perpetuating the cycle of poverty. That costs us money. When 
children in poverty drop out of school we pay the price. We pay 
the price in wasted lives and wasted productivity.
<P>
	We cannot tackle the problem of the debt and deficit unless we 
tackle the problem of poverty in this country which costs us all 
every day.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be taking 
the full period of time.
<P>
	I have to start by addressing the last speaker and speakers 
before this. Nowhere is there any fact saying that we are not 
going to take care of the poorest of poor. We are talking about a 
whole plan, having a plan. The economic management that the 
member talks about, economic management that is going to add 
$100 billion to the debt in the next three years, is not 
management, it is suicide. That is going to hurt those poor and 
that is what is going to lose these programs more than anything 
else we might do.
<P>
	It is like the cab driver said last night when I was in the cab. 
He said: ``I have heard it all before. It doesn't matter what 
happens in these elections. It doesn't matter because they are all 
the same. They get there and they are not going to change a 
thing. They don't have a plan. They are not dedicated. They 
don't mean it. They just go and do the same thing''.
<P>
	While we hear all this double talk and all this talk about the 
poor and the tears roll down the eyes, they do not have a plan. 
There is nothing there. There is nothing behind it. It is just all 
more talk and I agree with that cab driver.
<P>
	I heard another speaker say that these were simplistic 
approaches. Voters want it simple once in a while. They want 
somebody with a plan they can understand, not a bunch of legal 
double talk, a bunch of on in the future some place we are going 
to handle this problem of our debt and deficit. They want it done 
now and they mean now, right now, and that is what we are here 
talking about.
<P>
	I come back to why I even came to this job. There are times we 
all wonder why we are here. The reason is the government was 
not listening. It was a top down kind of process that we had here. 
There was spending and waste. All of us knew about it and all of 
us were disgusted by the waste that we talked and heard about.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	It does not really matter, we thought, what party one elects 
and I am coming to believe that. It does not matter whether it has 
the PC tag or the Liberal tag. They are all so much the same.
<P>
	We send good people from home and those good people all of 
a sudden come back and tell us what the party says is best for us, 
it is what the party wants us to do. We are so hung up on this 
undemocratic party process in this place.
<P>
	Probably the worst day since I have been here was February 
22 last year. I felt like wearing a black arm band. We had a 
finance minister who gave us a budget or whatever it was, but it 
did not address anything that the people had been saying since 
1984. It did not say anything about the debt and deficit, about 
what our foreign creditors were telling us. It did not address 
anything.
<P>
	The government members said it did not have time, that it had 
only been here for three months. It should have had that plan in 
place long before the election was ever called.
<P>
	We each had that sunken feeling on the 22nd and we said we 
are not going to let that happen again. You are going to see our 
alternate budget. You are going to see it before you see the 
finance minister's budget. You are going to get a chance to 
compare.
<P>
	I challenge-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I want to remind 
colleagues in the House to make all their interventions through 
the Speaker. Basically if we are using the term ``you'' it is to the 
Speaker and I do not think that is the intent. I ask members to 
keep that in mind.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, what I challenge is that 
the government, our Prime Minister and our finance minister go 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9619"> 9619 </A></B>
<P>
on national television with the leader of our party and our 
finance critic and talk about and compare  the two budgets, the 
budget of the finance minister and the budget that we are going 
to put out as an alternate. I challenge them to compare those in 
front of the Canadian people. That is what has to be done.
<P>
	Let us go back to some of the history behind our problem. I 
have heard a lot here today. I have not heard a lot of people who 
seem to really understand very much or certainly could not 
communicate it to the people who really matter, the taxpayers.
<P>
	In 1945 we had it pretty good. Europe was in shambles. Asia 
was in shambles and we were able to grow. We had no 
competition and we learned the good life. By 1965 we were well 
into the social experiment programs that we now all feel are 
threatened and are threatened because of the serious problem we 
are in.
<P>
	We allowed government to replace family. We allowed 
government to replace individual initiative and we said 
government will take care of each of us. We will lead this good 
life. We will never have any problems.
<P>
	What also happened then was that the other parts of the world 
rebuilt and started to compete. As they started to compete we 
had a cash shortfall. We had developed a system that we could no 
longer afford and therefore we started to borrow.
<P>
	We continued to borrow. Members know where that has taken 
us today. We have a crisis. In 1984 we said we must change this 
government. Right across this whole land everybody said we 
have to change it. Except for a few of those sure seats, the 
Liberals were literally annihilated.
<P>
	The belief was that the $289 billion would be dealt with and it 
would be dealt with now. By 1988 it was up over $390 billion 
and we were told we did not have time, it was a worse mess than 
we thought it was, et cetera. However, we were no longer 
believers in that sort of analysis, and so the birth of our party.
<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	In 1993 we had a $489 billion debt and we were told the 
Liberals will come up with a plan, and so they did. From October 
25, 1993 when the debt was $489 until the budget comes out this 
month it is going to be $550 billion. We have added another $61 
billion to our debt. That is totally unacceptable. The people of 
Canada will not accept that. They are demanding that action be 
taken.
<P>
	It is not good enough to say we will just add another $100 
billion and then we will plan to get it under control some time in 
the future. That is not good enough. We have precipitated a 
crisis which we are being told about. The dollar is a good 
indicator. It was about 80 cents U.S. a year or so ago. Look 
where it is today and where it is going. We know where the 
interest rates were and where they are going today. Those are 
simply symptoms and warnings that we had better take action 
and it had better be soon.
<P>
	The biggest threat to our social programs is from this debt and 
that is why we must deal with it. We must passionately convince 
the government that it must deal with it.
<P>
	The double talk we have heard today, I am glad it was not from 
the finance minister or people from the finance committee. 
Hopefully they understand things better.
<P>
	We are going to lose pensions, UIC, social programs and 
education. All of those things are going to be threatened. Not 
because of any party or because some members take the slash 
and burn position. They learned that about a year ago and they 
have not stopped saying it. We are going to lose those programs 
because of the debt and those interest payments. Then what 
happens?
<P>
	There is foreign control. I think we should talk about that. We 
should look at what just happened to Mexico. Mexico has lost its 
sovereignty for probably 50 years into the future. Does Canada 
want to lose its sovereignty? Does Canada want to give up its 
control of water? We have to look at all of those things. Our 
sovereignty is being threatened by that debt and deficit.
<P>
	What do our good friends across the way propose? They have 
floated trial balloons. They talked about raising gas prices 1.5 
cents per litre. That should hit just about everyone, including 
those poor families trying to earn a living. It is going to hit 
everybody. That comes from the finance committee.
<P>
	Taxing RRSPs, that is pretty good. We are encouraging people 
to take care of themselves and all of a sudden we are going to tax 
something that goes against this. Dental and medical plans, 
surtaxes and surcharges on income. Changing the GST to a VAT. 
Are we going to change that? How high is it going to go? A lot of 
people predict it will go to 12 per cent. Maybe 15 per cent would 
be a better number. That is going to hit everybody, not just the 
rich we so often hear about.
<P>
	What about a carbon tax? Give it any name you like, I do not 
think it is dead yet. If any kind of unity is to be promoted in this 
country it had better be put to rest once and for all.
<P>
	What are the solutions? There has to be a light at the end of the 
tunnel. There has to be. That cab driver we talked about has to 
know there is a solution. He cannot simply say there is no hope, I 
hate politicians, I hate politics, I have no use for them all. In a 
couple of ridings only 30 per cent of people voted. That is a 
disgrace. That is the frustration of people who are saying it does 
not matter anymore, you are all the same, you are not dealing 
with the issue. That is not fiscal management. That is no 
management at all.
<P>
	The money markets are telling us very clearly to get our act 
together. They are telling us by the dollar. They are telling us by 
interest rates. They are telling us to cut spending, do not raise 
taxes, do whatever to encourage the country but do something.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9620"> 9620 </A></B>
<P>
	The public is telling us a lot also. Listen to the messages the 
public is getting. On February 11 in the <I>Vancouver Sun</I>, a quote 
from the revenue minister: ``Protest all you want, Canadians, 
but you are not going to change the final look of the coming 
federal budget''. They are saying that they will listen to what 
the people are saying, but here is someone saying: ``Protest all 
you want, Canadians. We are not going to change our minds. 
We are not going to listen to you''.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	We might just ask the member from Transcona what message 
the people gave him in Winnipeg the other day as they drove him 
from the stage. What was the message yesterday? What was the 
message in Toronto? What was the message in Vancouver? What 
was the message in Halifax?
<P>
	The message is for the government to get its act together and 
cut spending. We hear: ``Yes, we are going to. Yes, we will''. We 
have heard that before. We have heard that for years and years 
and it has not happened. The public is saying that the 
government should cut spending, stop listening to special 
interest groups and stop waste.
<P>
	I knocked on doors in some of the poorer sections of 
Montreal, for the benefit of the member who was talking about 
that, and the universal thing everybody said was: ``Get rid of the 
Senate. Get rid of that waste. It is an embarrassment''. I should 
have said the other place. They asked us to get rid of it or change 
it because it is not working.
<P>
	Another item was MPs' pensions. They asked us to have the 
courage to lead from the top. They want us to do something and 
not get stand around making promises. For 15 or 16 months we 
have been talking about doing something. We cannot go after the 
public of Canada without doing something here.
<P>
	They are asking us to do something about the perks and the 
GST the Liberals promised they would change. How about the 
international travel that goes on in this place and the 
parliamentary associations that are going on junkets every other 
week, heading off all over the place and maybe taking their 
wives for cost? That touches a nerve ending. Nobody wants to 
talk about it because it is something we can get away with; it is 
one of the perks because we have such low pay.
<P>
	We could try to tell the poor people about whom the minister 
was talking about the pay MPs receive. How about the eight or 
nine levels of management versus those levels in a company? 
Companies right sized long ago. Companies got down to two or 
three levels of management. I challenge anybody here to go to 
big corporations and ask them how much management they 
have. They have two or three levels while this place has eight or 
nine levels of management protecting themselves. They are not 
going to be cut. A few at the top will go but they will not be cut 
down to anything.
<P>
	Let us look at the other waste that goes on here. All of us go 
downstairs in the Confederation Building. Has anyone ever 
wondered why we have a round of marble seven feet in the air in 
the new renovations over there? Does anyone know how much 
marble costs? Why is it there? It is there because the bureaucrats 
are not use to trying to save any money.
<P>
	A lot of waste goes on in this place. Let us talk about it. 
Anything would be better than the kind of waste we have. That is 
what taxpayers are demanding. They want us to get waste under 
control. The public has lost confidence in the government and 
politicians. It is saying that we should cut spending and have no 
new taxes. That message is everywhere.
<P>
	That message is not just in Canada. That message is in all 
democratic countries around the world. They are sending the 
same message. We can learn that lesson. There are lots of places 
from where we can take examples. People are demanding 
results. People have finally taken control of the situation.
<P>
	What would happen if we had a government that would listen 
and bring about those massive spending cuts that are essential 
and eliminate the waste that is going on? We would have the 
confidence of the people, of businesses and of international 
investors. We would have jobs. We would have growth and the 
economy would boom. There would be extra income, more 
money coming in from taxation, and we would be able to start 
dealing with the real problem, namely our huge debt.
<P>
<B>(1620 ) </B>
<P>
	Above all, to get the trust of the general public of Canada back 
we must enact legislation, a taxpayer protection act that puts a 
cap on government spending so that this can never happen again. 
We can never let government do this to the Canadian people 
again. We have had 30 years of this and it has to stop.
<P>
	Let us examine what might happen in this situation. There has 
been a lot of speculating on the other side so I will speculate for 
a minute. Look at the old line parties first. Let us start with the 
PCs. To examine the PCs there are three books that might help 
us. I would suggest that <I>Beyond the Law</I> might be a place to start. 
<I>On the Take</I> might be another interesting piece of reading. 
<I>Underground Nation</I> by Diane Francis might be good reading 
too for finding out what has happened because of extra taxes. 
That pretty well takes care of the PCs. I guess last night 
confirmed that.
<P>
	What about the Liberals? The Liberals started this whole 
thing. Of course they still feel good and are happy. They are 
saying: ``Maybe we can grow our way out of this problem. It 
should be fine. Hopefully we will be okay''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9621"> 9621 </A></B>
<P>
	Then we have the NDP. Its socialist Utopia has not worked 
any place in the world so we can dispel that.
<P>
	We know the Reform Party must be different. We have a 
situation wherein it is the people versus the elite. Who are the 
elite? We have talked about the elite a lot before. It is the 
national media. Certainly it is the old line political parties, the 
bureaucrats at the top and in many cases big business and banks. 
Those kinds of people are all part of the elite.
<P>
	What are the people saying about all of this? They are saying: 
``We won't take it any more. If you keep spending you are going 
to pay''. The message should be loud and clear. The people's 
power should be obvious to everyone here but it is not. The last 
message was in the referendum. The elite to the very last person 
said: ``Vote yes. It will be good for you''. However the people 
said: ``No way''. The people found out about it. They worked on 
it, got information and made their decision. They were not heard 
that well, though.
<P>
	In 1993 there was another message. We know what that 
resulted in. What do we have to look at? The people are saying 
reduce and the government is saying increase. On pensions the 
people are saying eliminate and the government is saying 
modify. On the Senate the people are saying abolish and the 
government is saying ignore and promote. On RRSPs the people 
are saying raise and promote and the government is saying: 
``Maybe we will tax them''. On jobs the people are saying: 
``More money should be in the hands of people'' and the 
government is saying: ``We will have infrastructure and more 
bureaucracy. The government can, after all, still take care of 
you''.
<P>
	In conclusion I quote from Terry Moore, a radio announcer in 
Calgary:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We have had it, and you have got to get a handle on this and attack the debt 
and deficit in Canada and quit playing political games with our future, our 
children's future, our grandchildren's future and our great-grandchildren's 
future-because if you don't pull it together, this country will go down the tube.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the member's comments. It is fair to 
summarize by indicating that members of the Reform Party will 
continue to raise spectres, rumours, innuendo and tax revolts. 
They will continue to say they are going to do many good things.
<P>
	However, the important point is that Reform Party members 
have been tinkering around the edges. They have ignored and 
failed to explain to Canadians how they are going to deal with 
their $15 billion cut in social programs. They have not 
articulated a specific initiative by which they would deal with 
social programs. They have not told Canadians the truth about 
what they really have planned for Canada.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	We have a source for what Reform Party members plan. I want 
to give an example. It is articulated in their minority report 
included in the Standing Committee on Human Resources 
Development report that was tabled last Monday. I refer the 
House to their first three recommendations.
<P>
	The first concerns the guaranteed income supplement in 
which 40 per cent of seniors participate. They are 
recommending increasing the age of eligibility. On old age 
security they are saying: ``Eliminate old age security for seniors 
who have above average incomes''. On the Canada pension plan 
they are recommending raising the retirement age, raising the 
age of eligibility.
<P>
	It is fairly clear that the true agenda of members of the Reform 
Party is slash and burn. If they do not believe our seniors 
represent a significant portion of the poor in our country they 
have lost touch with Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, if I were the finance 
minister I would say to wait until next week, but I will try to 
answer the question.
<P>
	The member can wait until next week but he will see that those 
in need have to be totally taken care of. People at the upper end 
who do not need it are quite willing to accept their share of the 
responsibility to get the country going. They are saying that as 
long as it is equal and fair they will take those cuts. However the 
people at the bottom will have to be taken care of. The most 
needy can never be out on the streets, as the member would like 
to portray. Next week he will see the exact details of what we are 
talking about.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with great interest to my friend's presentation. I agree with him, 
our financial situation is critical, but there are solutions 
nevertheless.
<P>
	A while ago, I heard him speak of the Progressive 
Conservative Party which I believe is part of history. I think that 
when you are really optimistic, whether you are a government 
party, a person or a group, you look to the future. Therefore, we 
must widen our horizons and determine what aspects of our 
taxation system can be changed.
<P>
	For example, since we are here to represent the population, I 
think it is important that we propose solutions whenever we 
criticize. I do believe that together we will succeed in 
addressing the problem of the enormous deficit of our country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question.
<P>
	I agree with him 100 per cent that we should not be tinkering 
around the edges and that we should look at some major reforms, 
certainly a flat tax system, a new system of taxation that is much 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9622"> 9622 </A></B>
<P>
fairer than the present tax system with all its exemptions and 
exceptions. This is  something Canadians are asking for and the 
House should be entertaining as soon as possible. It should be a 
part of the exercise as we look to fix our finances.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I also listened closely to the speech of the 
hon. member. Like all the members who took the floor today-I 
have been sitting here all day, although I never intervened-I 
agree that the Canadian situation is very difficult right now.
<P>
	I also think that the government has a tendency to study, to set 
up committees, to ask for reports and, generally speaking, to 
postpone any decision. For 20 years we have heard the same 
speeches from the various ministers of finance. We could take 
any of them and reissue them, they are all the same.
<P>
	There are two opposition parties in the House. The Bloc 
Quebecois proposes a very clear option: let us review 
completely the Canadian taxation policy. We sincerely believe 
that without a complete overhaul of taxation we are going 
nowhere fast.
<P>
	The Reform Party's option is to cut deeply where it really 
matters, into social programs. Unlike my Liberal friends, I do 
not believe that our Reform colleagues are fundamentally evil. I 
think they have done a serious economic study of the situation.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	If the Reform and the Bloc parties do not do anything, Canada 
is going to go bankrupt right away. We have to do something.
<P>
	I would like to ask a question of my colleague on an economic 
matter. Most people know that we want to make Quebec 
sovereign and we seriously think that this will become true 
within a few months from now.
<P>
	Most Canadians actually believe in two assumptions 
concerning Quebec. The first is we are a bunch of 
troublemakers, politically speaking, because we are never 
happy with what we get. Second, we receive much more money 
from Canada than what we put in. A lot of people believe these 
assumptions.
<P>
	I would like to ask this question of my colleague. Does he not 
think that a sovereign Quebec would be part of the solution for 
Canada, depending of course that we take out of Canada our fair 
share of the debts and assets? That is exactly what we intend to 
do. Would this not be part of the solution for Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, certainly we agree with a 
lot of the things that were said.
<P>
	More important, what I have learned from visiting Quebec a 
number of times is that the problems in Quebec are the same as 
the problems in Alberta or in any other part of Canada. We are 
all the same. We are concerned about the debt and deficit. We are 
concerned about crime. We are concerned about all of the same 
things. We are the same. That is the first myth that we have to 
dispel, that there is any difference between us because there is 
not.
<P>
	The people in my part of the country do not hate the people of 
Quebec. The people in Quebec certainly do not hate the people 
of Alberta. We need to dispel these myths.
<P>
	Economically, I believe firmly that as members of the G-7, in 
negotiating world trade as we are now actively doing, that the 
bigger the unit the better we are going to be economically.
<P>
	I hope that the people of Quebec look at the big picture. We 
are going to be a trading unit of the Americas. I have said that in 
this House a lot of times. North and South America together are 
a trading unit. The smaller the unit the more difficult it will be 
balancing our budgets and taking care of our people.
<P>
	We have to look at the big picture. The big picture says that 
the EU is going to get common currency and is going to come 
together more and more, that the seven tigers of the Orient are 
going to come together more and more and that the Americas are 
going to come together more and more. Rather than thinking of 
little units we should be thinking about bigger units. That is 
really the success of this country. This is the best country in the 
world and we need to save it with Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jane Stewart (Brant, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to say that it is a pleasure to participate in the debate on the 
motion tabled by the hon. member for Capilano-Howe Sound.
<P>
	As a member of the Standing Committee on Finance the items 
that are included in the member's motion have been front and 
centre on my personal agenda for well over a year. There is a 
reason for that. The reason is that our government understands 
and takes very seriously the fiscal circumstances that face this 
nation. We are committed to working responsibly to manage the 
deficit and the debt and to responding to the needs and the 
interests of Canadians.
<P>
	We are doing that in a very dynamic way. It is that process that 
I would like to refer to in my comments here this afternoon.
<P>
	About a year ago the Minister of Finance came to us in the 
House and invited us all to participate in the first ever prebudget 
debate. He invited us as members to bring the concerns, the 
issues, the strategy, the direction of our constituents, Canadians, 
to this House of Commons and share them with him.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9623"> 9623 </A></B>
<P>
	That process worked very well. That debate was very 
energized. It was informative. I know that the minister took a 
lot away from that day in the House and included it in his 
subsequent budget, our first budget as a government, that I 
would remind the House included a number of things. It 
included issues of tax fairness where we got rid of the $100,000 
capital gains exemption. More important and more particular, 
for every dollar that we raised in revenues there were $5 saved 
in spending cuts, a five to one ratio.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	The process has continued in a very dynamic way. In October 
1994 the Minister of Finance came to the Standing Committee 
on Finance and presented a very articulate and clear 
understanding of his view of the economic forecast for our 
nation. At the same time, he talked about the fiscal 
circumstances that we faced then and face right now. He 
enjoined the members of the committee to take this information 
and share it in detail with Canadians and to begin the first ever 
prebudget consultations.
<P>
	That consultation process started here in Ottawa with a panel 
of experts from the economy, from banking, from the social 
sector, from the NGOs. We sat around the table and talked about 
the economic assumptions in the minister's papers. We talked 
about the strategies of spending cuts versus revenue measures. 
We talked about the spending cuts that might be appropriate, 
those that would be inappropriate, the tax measures that might 
be appropriate and those that might be inappropriate.
<P>
	From there and armed with a lot of information, the 
committee members fanned out across the nation. We talked to 
hundreds of Canadians. We went to communities like Lunenburg 
and Hamilton. In Hamilton I had the great fortune to chair the 
session.
<P>
	We did something a little different. Rather than just hear 
individual witnesses, we encouraged Canadians as individuals 
to come to sit with us around the table. They took a very short 
time, two, three minutes, to position their particular areas of 
interest, their particular concerns. Some of these people came 
with presentations from groups. Some came merely as 
individuals interested in the process.
<P>
	We sat together and we encouraged and invited them to talk 
with each other, to do their best to build consensus, to try to find 
and agree on the things that Canadians say we need to do to deal 
with the fiscal situation that we face.
<P>
	As this process continued and coincident with it, members 
and colleagues of mine went back to their ridings and had town 
hall meetings with their own constituents, asking the same 
questions. Tell us about the assumptions. Tell us about spending 
cuts versus revenue measures. Members brought that data back 
to the minister who I know will read them and respond probably 
after the budget when he can not only comment  on their 
suggestions but on his thinking around where he agreed and 
where he made some different choices.
<P>
	I had one of these meetings. It is my second annual meeting 
and what I found in my riding was very interesting. Last year, I 
had 20 people out to my forum. It was a very interesting and 
informative night but only 20 people were there.
<P>
	This year there were over 100 people. The message to me 
from my constituents was that they appreciated the process the 
government was taking. They believed that the government is 
listening to them, that it will take what they are saying and deal 
with it to build a consensus, a balanced strategy to help the 
country restore itself to fiscal stability.
<P>
	The other thing that proved to me that this was so was that the 
whole thing was done without cost. The room was donated. The 
microphone system was donated. The coffee and donuts were 
donated. The community said: ``This is important to us. This is 
significant for us. We believe in this process''.
<P>
	We did not have to charge Canadians $1 a shot to phone in on 
the 1-900 number. People were invited to come and share free of 
charge their concerns and their interests.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	Over the course of the last five months we have been engaging 
Canadians in a very participatory and involved strategy. It 
makes a difference. Canadians want to be a part of this. They 
want to be heard.
<P>
	What are the messages we have heard over the last while? 
Very clearly we found consensus that we must deal with the 
deficit and the debt. There is no question. Second, there is 
general agreement that it is far preferable to focus on the 
spending side and to reduce spending than it is to do a lot on the 
revenue measures side.
<P>
	When I gave a speech in my riding last week I said to my 
constituents, ``We are listening. We hear you. We understand the 
importance of spending cuts. But please understand what you 
are saying. You may think that your tax dollars are being burned 
in the fireplace and going up in smoke. Yes, there are places 
where we have to do a better job, where we have to cut back and 
where we have to be more efficient, but there are many programs 
that are helping Canadians''. Those programs are helping 
groups in my community. They may be cut. As a result we have 
to be prepared to be compassionate.
<P>
	With that in mind I would like to turn to some of the 
recommendations which were made by the standing committee. 
The first recommendation, which I strongly agree with, is that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9624"> 9624 </A></B>
<P>
we must deal with the issue of MPs' pensions. I look forward to 
the President of the Treasury Board presenting that legislation, 
sooner rather than later, because I believe that as we members 
have to show as these spending cuts come into effect-and they 
are  going to be an impact-that we too are part of the process.
<P>
	The other thing which we recommended as part of the 
committee report was that we must start with government 
operations. Government must take the responsibility to look at 
itself, improve its efficiencies, improve the quality of the 
programming that we are providing to Canadians and do it less 
expensively. We have to understand there are going to be cuts in 
the public service. People are going to be affected.
<P>
	I have been involved in downsizing programs in the private 
sector. There are good ones and there are bad ones. The ones that 
work recognize that the people who are affected really have 
nothing to do with the growth in the business or in the 
government. They are not guilty; however, they are the ones who 
will have to make changes.
<P>
	I know that the Canadian taxpayer as a good employer will 
want to provide to the people who are leaving packages which 
allow them to leave with respect and dignity. These packages 
will cost money. It would be totally inappropriate for me to say 
that there can be no new spending in this budget. We have to 
recognize that for longer term gains we have to have spending in 
the short term to recognize the good work that our public 
servants have done. Certainly in my riding I have been well 
supported by the correctional people, by my human resources 
development people and by Industry Canada, those in the 
regional office, and I thank them. We must deal with that with 
compassion.
<P>
	As we talk about the strategy of spending cuts versus tax 
measures, I would like to point out that in the jurisdictions that 
we hold up as the best jurisdictions for spending control-and I 
am thinking of Alberta as one-there have been revenue 
measures. In Alberta the increase was in medical premiums of 
about 50 per cent. There were other increases in fees and in 
licences.
<P>
	I know that the hon. member for Capilano-Howe Sound 
talked once in an intervention about loopholes. He said, ``Those 
are taxes. They collect money. If it looks like a tax and it collects 
money like a tax, it is a tax''. These fees and these revenue 
measures could be determined or viewed as taxes.
<P>
	My point is that in jurisdictions where they are managing their 
deficit and debt there are revenue initiatives which go along 
with and are part and parcel with the spending cuts.
<P>
	When we look at these messages we now consider what it is 
that the minister is going to do in terms of his next budget; the 
action that we will see as a response to this consultation and 
these messages. I do not know what he is going to have in his 
budget. He has been very good and done a good job as a minister 
in keeping those things close to his vest, as he should.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	The thing I need to point out, which has been pointed out on a 
number of occasions in this House today, is that we have to, as I 
believe the minister will, deal with this very difficult agenda 
with compassion, generosity, fairness and balance.
<P>
	Strangely enough those words are clearly absent from the 
member's motion. There is never a reference to how it would be 
done. Perhaps that in itself is the difference between the Liberal 
Party and the Reform Party. While Reform members protest that 
they will not hurt anyone, they never use words like fairness, 
balance and compassion. Those are real in our society and are 
things which I am committed to and which I believe in.
<P>
	In closing I would like to say that experiencing the 
cross-country discussions, talking to Canadians, and hearing 
their perspectives was tremendously important for me to 
understand the differences that exist across this vast nation.
<P>
	The last budget was brutal in Atlantic Canada. Communities 
that lost their defence installations were hit very hard. It is my 
expectation that in the next budget some of the rest of us may 
start to feel that pinch. It is going to be a challenge for us as a 
government to continue in a positive fashion to make sure 
Canadians do not go without, but that we do manage things more 
effectively and efficiently, that we recognize where government 
can play a role and where other partners in society can fill the 
void or maybe take over.
<P>
	These are challenges that will make it very interesting for us 
over the course of the rest of our mandate. I very definitely 
believe and I would encourage the Minister of Finance to 
continue his dynamic and evolving process in this important 
area.
<P>
	I have to make reference to one particular event that 
happened. Over the course of our discussions many Canadians 
said: ``You know, these are tough times and I really do not want 
more taxes, but by golly, this country is important to me. We 
have to make sure it stays together. If there is a way of me 
providing funds that will go directly to maintaining our country, 
to reducing the deficit, I would be willing to participate''.
<P>
	Do not get me wrong. I would never suggest this is a strategy 
that will help us out of our problem. What made it important to 
me was the fact that I received a cheque from one of my 
constituents made out to the ``save Canada and deficit reduction 
fund''. Interestingly, I discovered there is an account this money 
could be sent to. I have sent it on and expect he will receive 
recognition for his contribution.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9625"> 9625 </A></B>
<P>
	The message to me is that Canadians do feel passionately 
about this country. They do want things to be better. They do 
believe this government through balance, fairness and equity 
has a plan that will work.
<P>
	I look forward to the minister's budget. I have every 
confidence that he is listening to the Canadian people and will 
respond to their needs and to the needs of others who have an 
influence on our domestic economy. With that I close and thank 
the member for providing us with the opportunity today to talk 
about this very important subject.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to thank the member for her speech, although I basically 
disagree with her fundamental premise. I would like to make a 
comment and have her respond.
<P>
	Having worked with her on the Standing Committee on 
Finance for a while, I know she is sincere in looking for 
solutions. As an individual who obviously by her considered 
remarks is very intelligent, I would like to offer a suggestion as 
to how to find that solution.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	A lot of people know that if you define the right problem or if 
the problem is defined correctly, you now have at least 50 or 60 
per cent of the solution because that is where you will focus your 
efforts.
<P>
	I would present the case that this government has not 
identified the right problem. We have a problem in this country 
with the deficit, debt and the interest costs to service this debt. It 
is the debt that is causing the high interest costs and it is the high 
interest costs that is the number one problem in this country. 
Therefore the deficit is part of it because it contributes to the 
debt which increases the interest.
<P>
	I will go very slowly. There are three parts to it: debt, interest 
and deficit. The government says it is the deficit that is the 
problem, that if we reduce the deficit, we will solve the problem. 
Wrong.
<P>
	At the end of three or four years, this government's program 
will have added $90 to $100 billion to the debt which then would 
make the interest costs rise regardless of this 3 per cent of GDP. 
That is what everybody is saying in the world economy. That is 
why they are concerned about the toughness of the cuts 
necessary. It is adding to the problem.
<P>
	What this government is doing is adding to the problem, 
thinking it is solving it by defining the wrong problem. That is 
why it is paramount that we get to a zero deficit so that we do not 
keep adding to the debt. It is the interest cost that is going to hurt 
those very people who the government is concerned about, the 
very people the government wants to help. The government will 
raise taxes to help and it will hurt the economy even more.
<P>
	I am saying if we identify the interest costs to service the debt 
as the problem that then we will come up with different solutions 
and more of the solutions that the Reform Party is putting forth. 
I would like the member to make a comment on that, please.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Stewart (Brant):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have enjoyed working 
with the hon. member on the finance committee.
<P>
	He points to a very important matter and I referenced it in 
some of my last comments. Not only do we have to understand 
and look at the things that Canadians need, but we have to 
unfortunately look outside our nation to the other people who 
have an influence on our current situation. What we find is that 
if the foreign markets are comfortable with us, if they are 
confident that what we say is what we mean and it is what we are 
going to do, then they back off and leave us alone a little.
<P>
	We have worked very hard to indicate very clearly to the 
outside world that we are committed to price stability. Thank 
goodness we have been able to maintain inflation at very low 
and sometimes negative rates. That helps us in dealing with 
outside responsibility.
<P>
	The other thing we have to do is be absolutely clear on what 
our strategy is. We have been. Our strategy has been to say that 
we will get the deficit to GDP ratio down to 3 per cent 
come-excuse my French but the minister said it-hell or high 
water.
<P>
	If the minister can confirm that and make sure that is our 
strategy and that we do not waiver from it, the confidence it 
creates outside the nation is extremely helpful to us. That is 
because it has been difficult for us to have the best economic 
growth in the world, to have inflation managed efficiently, to 
have unemployment reduced significantly.
<P>
	I expect after the implementation of our next budget it will 
again be clear to the markets that we are committed to this, that 
we mean what we say and that we will do what we say we are 
going to do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's speech. It was full of 
compassion. She also argued that she had a monopoly on 
compassion, that the Reform Party had no compassion whatever.
<P>
	I have been in this business of arguing over social and 
economic policies for over 30 years. We agreed a long time ago 
that discussions over who is more compassionate will lead 
nowhere. I assert herewith that I am more compassionate than 
that member and every member of the Liberal Party.
<P>
	The issue ought to be not who is more compassionate, but 
what is a rational solution to the problem so that we can give real 
expression to our compassion. That is the issue. This is rhetoric 
which leads nowhere. This country is going down the drain and 
we have to have practical solutions to the problems we face.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9626"> 9626 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	I also would like to make a brief comment on the member's 
description of the consultation process. I sat through more hours 
of this than I ever want to think about and travelled more miles 
than I would like to.
<P>
	Most of the time I found that the witnesses said: ``I do not 
know anything about the budget making process. That is your 
business, but let me take the next 20 minutes and tell you why 
the money I have been getting from the government is the best 
way the money could be spent and why you must never touch my 
program''. Others had been coached by the intellectual and 
political left and had patent solutions that were obvious 
demagoguery from lowering the interest rate, to taxing the rich, 
taxing capital.
<P>
	The Globe and Mail had an editorial saying that this process 
was dividing the country into hostile camps. I have not got the 
same impression, that this was a fruitful exercise in the way in 
which the opposite member was talking about.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Stewart (Brant):</B> With regard to the initial comment I 
would say that perhaps the member doth protest too much.
<P>
	He is saying that he is compassionate and I am sure he is. I 
still stand and say nowhere in the motion doe I see and never do I 
hear the words fairness, balance and equality. I am sorry but 
without those words I do not know how anyone can pretend to be 
compassionate.
<P>
	As far as the process goes, perhaps compassion has something 
to do there as well. Quite frankly to hear the message that 
Canadians are giving, you have to listen. You have to be patient. 
You have to recognize that the venue is not one they are 
particularly familiar with.
<P>
	Yes, the hon. member is right. There are many people who 
said: ``By golly, cut the deficit and look after the debt but do not 
touch me''. I do not necessarily blame those people because they 
have only had one year of experience with us. They may still be 
thinking back to the old government, the government they could 
not trust and they had to say: ``Do not touch me, because I do not 
trust you for not touching me''. We are a little different from 
that. We do listen.
<P>
	I suspect the next time we have these prebudget consultations 
which will be next year, we will hear a lot less of that. We will be 
better at the process. Canadians will be better prepared to be 
involved and understand the role that they can and must play.
<P>
	I think the process was wonderful. It is a step in the right 
direction. It is an opportunity to give Canadians the governance 
back to them, to let them be part of this very important thing we 
call governing.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the intervention by the member while eloquent reminds me of a 
song from ``My Fair Lady'' that says ``words, words, words, I 
am so sick of words''.
<P>
	Just talking about equity and compassion and fairness is all 
very nice, but saying it does not make it so. These words keep 
rolling off the tongues of members opposite as if they have a 
corner on knowing of compassion and fairness and equity.
<P>
	The Liberals have no plan to present the people of this 
country. In the short time they have been in office they have run 
up our interest obligation almost $2 billion. Every year forever 
because of their overspending we will have to pay almost $2 
billion more in interest, just for one year. That is $2 billion that 
has been taken away from the poor people of this country, the 
people who need help, the services of this country.
<P>
	Yet they are the ones who talk about giving fairness and equity 
when they are the ones taking the money and using it for interest 
because they cannot control their spending. It is also a 
government that has yet to stand up and give a plan to the people 
of this country to break the gold plated pension plans that they 
are getting. Where is the fairness in that?
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	Where is the fairness from a member talking about fairness, 
taking a pension that no other Canadian can hope to get? I ask 
this member to show the kind of fairness that she-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> On a point of order, the 
hon. parliamentary secretary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Mr. Speaker, I know that we are generally pretty 
generous with each other in the House but there is an obligation 
with members to be careful in the way they insinuate such things 
as people receiving pensions when they are sitting in the House.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I would like you to actively encourage people to 
follow the public record more carefully.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> With the greatest of 
respect to the member, that is not a point of order. I will return to 
the member for Calgary North. There are a few minutes left in 
the intervention of the member for Brant. Has the member for 
Calgary North concluded?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Stewart (Brant):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will respond quickly to 
the hon. member and say wait for the budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, mine is more of a complaint than a question.
<P>
	The hon. member said ``pardon my French'' and then went on 
to make some expression about ``hell and high water'' which I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9627"> 9627 </A></B>
<P>
think was rather derogatory and indicates that the French 
language is used in a derogatory way.
<P>
	I wonder if she might withdraw that statement.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Stewart (Brant):</B> Mr. Speaker, I sincerely thank my 
colleague. I would be glad to have that removed from the record. 
It was an inappropriate comment. I appreciate that being drawn 
to my attention.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
afternoon, I am happy to speak to the motion presented by the 
Reform Party which is supposed to be trying to provide the 
finance minister with some solutions, answers, and ideas on how 
to cut government spending and shift the fiscal burden.
<P>
	Of course, I suppose that, by the very nature of its name, the 
Reform Party has set out to reform Canadian institutions. This is 
the reason why it is called the Reform Party. Before finding 
solutions to all of Canada's financial ills, one should find their 
causes.
<P>
	I am going to give a brief background, starting in 1970, when 
Mr. Trudeau's Liberals were in office. I remember well that in 
early 1970, I believe it was in 1969, the federal government had 
a budget surplus. One must assume that the Liberal Party was 
not happy with the situation and that, with characteristic 
generosity, it found that Canada was not progressing fast enough 
on the economic and job creation front. In 1972, the deficit 
really started building up with Mr. Turner and under Mr. 
Trudeau.
<P>
	The then Liberal government decided that the only way to 
create jobs and to have a decent standard of living was for the 
federal government to interfere in just about every area. So it 
started borrowing money and the deficit started growing. In 
1972, 1973 and 1974, the deficit was respectively $5 billion, $10 
billion, $15 billion and then $20 billion. It kept on growing well 
into the 1980s. In 1972, 1980, and especially 1984, we had huge 
deficits.
<P>
	From 1972 to 1980, the government used borrowed money to 
create an artificial economy. It borrowed in order to pour large 
amounts of money into our society, which resulted in the 
economy becoming completely artificial. It was not a normal, 
natural economy. It was borrowed money that was injected into 
our society so that people could spend, which in turn led to job 
creation, but all that job creation was artificial.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	Spending borrowed money created an artificial economy. 
This overheating of the economy generated inflation, which 
lasted several years. Members will recall that in the years 
1975-1976, the annual inflation rate varied between 6, 7, 8, 10 
and 11 per cent. Such high inflation was not normal. But instead 
of cutting expenditures at that time, the government kept 
borrowing, which continued to create this overheating of the 
economy.
<P>
	What solution was available to the governor of the Bank of 
Canada? He had only one solution, as he said himself, and that 
was to raise interest rates. And the government, as ignorant then 
as it is today, continued to borrow money, thereby creating 
inflation.
<P>
	So, in 1980, interest rates went up as high as 20 per cent. It 
ruined a large percentage of small and medium size businesses 
in Quebec. It created hardship and unemployment. It created 
impossible situations. People were discouraged. People lost 
hope, particularly in Quebec where there are a lot of small and 
medium size businesses.
<P>
	The result, in 1980, was a horrible economic disaster. The 
government, which had not found a solution, tried to correct its 
mistakes by borrowing even more, putting in place programs to 
save the economy. It kept injecting money into our society to try 
and protect the poor, and it was right. Having created an 
economic disaster, it had to do whatever it could, so it then 
injected, between 1980 and 1984, some $100 billion in borrowed 
funds to try to save the economy and avoid a crisis like the one of 
the 1930s. So more money was injected to help people who the 
government had just put out of work by its sky high interest 
rates. So much for the federal government.
<P>
	In 1984, when I was with the Conservative party which was 
elected, the federal government had tallied up an accumulated 
debt of $175 billion. It had completely lost control over its 
spending. Revenues were of about $70 billion and expenditures 
of about $110 billion, and at the time Mr. Lalonde had predicted 
a deficit of some $39 billion for 1983-84; the largest deficit in 
Canada's history. People were saying, ``We are bankrupt. It 
makes no sense. We have lost control over spending in Canada''.
<P>
	When I hear members of the Reform Party refer to this today, 
they might do well to remember that this is nothing new; this 
federal system does not work, it no longer works, it is a big 
mess.
<P>
	Returning to 1984, the deficit was $38 or $39 billion. We had 
completely lost control over spending. On 4 September 1984, 
the Conservative government took office declaring, ``We have 
to get out our axe. We have to make cuts''.
<P>
	At that time, the Conservative Party was similar to the Reform 
Party in terms of its culture and habits. It had more or less the 
same policies. It was a party pretty much of the right. People 
said that it would clean things up, that it was made up of people 
with a sense of responsibility. They said the Liberals had made a 
mess in the previous 20 years and that the Conservatives would 
put a stop to things and fix Canada up.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9628"> 9628 </A></B>
<P>
	Well, it was very difficult for the Conservatives, because the 
debt was extremely high. The Liberals had made a lot of long 
term commitments. It was therefore very difficult for the 
Conservatives to cut.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	Nevertheless, the economy grew between 3 and 5 per cent 
from 1984 to 1988. It would have been very easy to cut 
expenditures by $5, $10 or $15 billion a year, and we would have 
had economic growth at the rate of 2 per cent, probably, instead 
of 4 to 5 per cent. This would have been a normal rate of growth. 
The economy would have been sound and natural, not artificial. 
Public finances would have been put in order.
<P>
	However, the federal system does not work this way. The 
federal system is governments in power, which want to show 
their electors-and I have seen it, I have been there-that 
expenditures cannot be cut, because people had to be shown that 
the federal government was useful and necessary. Money just 
had to be spent to prove that the government was indispensable, 
that federalism was alive, and that, without federalism, we could 
not function and exist as a country, without federal spending. A 
government always has to justify itself to the people and it 
generally does so by its spending.
<P>
	If the people do not get anything, they believe the government 
is useless. So, what is needed is a government sufficiently strong 
to say what its role is and what the role of the provinces in 
various sectors is.
<P>
	But no! Because the federal government had the power to 
spend, it continued to borrow, continued to spend in order to 
prove to Canadians that federalism was the solution, and that 
was the only way to justify federalism's existence.
<P>
	Therefore, by 1990, we were faced with the same problem. We 
had to raise interest rates because the Conservatives did not cut 
spending enough and set off inflation themselves and we were 
back at square one. In 1990, interest rates were increased to 
cause a recession. Intelligent, is it not? What a smart 
government. We created the problem ourselves and we 
aggravate the situation by saying: ``We created inflation 
ourselves so, now, we will increase interest rates to slow the 
economy and create a recession''.
<P>
	But this time, people were not deceived. A short time before, 
they had just lived through a terrible recession. And people 
stopped trusting the federal government. They still mistrust the 
federal government. The recession has lingered since 1990. It is 
now 1995. People have lost faith in the federal government, 
have lost faith in the future and have lost all hope. There are 
more and more family problems, young people are becoming 
more and more desperate, they have no hope for the future 
because over the past 25 years the federal government has not 
learned how to assume its responsibilities in order to prove that 
it is indispensable.
<P>
	And it was Trudeau's policy, that of the strong central 
governments of the Liberals of today and of the past, which has 
led Canada to bankruptcy. Canada is bankrupt, pure and simple. 
Thus, now that we know what we did wrong in the past, other 
problems have emerged, of course.
<P>
	I was forgetting another problem: that, in this Canadian 
system, we have a structure designed to administer perhaps 
some 300 to 400 million people and there are now 28 or 29 
million people in Canada. We have 11 political powers, 11 
governments. There is a socialist government, an NDP 
government, in Ontario; there used to be a Liberal government 
in Quebec; there was a Conservative, then a Liberal government 
in Ottawa, with contradictory policies in most cases, so that the 
system cannot work.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	At any one time, there is a government getting ready for an 
election. Since there are also Liberals in Ontario, the Liberal 
government in Ottawa tries not to hurt its Liberal colleagues in 
Ontario and vice versa. This means that the federal government 
never takes action, never does the right thing, never acts 
rationally, so that the country cannot function.
<P>
	Let us stop putting our heads in the sand and believing that 
Canada is the country with the highest standard of living in the 
world. Such a claim is ridiculous and deceives people. Canada is 
now considered to be a third-world country in terms of its debt.
<P>
	We are now considered to be at the same level as the third 
world, but we still call Canada a rich country. I thought that the 
way to evaluate a business is to look at its assets and liabilities. 
Canada is now considered a third-world country in terms of its 
debt. Let us stop putting our heads in the sand and look reality in 
the face.
<P>
	That is why we in Quebec think that extensive 
decentralization is the key to saving Quebec and even Canada. 
Canada stands at the edge of the abyss but can be saved through 
extensive decentralization. We started to talk about it with the 
Meech Lake Accord, we said that we had to decentralize, we said 
the same thing in Charlottetown, and Canadians said no. 
Canada's future lies in small sovereign countries.
<P>
	We in Quebec want to achieve sovereignty because we believe 
that with a single government and a smaller country, we will be 
better able to succeed. It is easy to understand. We are saying 
that in a small country with only one level of government, that 
government, the universities, as well as business and union 
people can arrive at solutions together. We will be able to set a 
joint economic and social policy for the mid and the long term.
<P>
	There will only be one government, instead of 11 different 
ones constantly fighting and implementing conflicting policies. 
We will work in harmony. We feel it is the only way to get out of 
this mess. As Quebecers, we do not want to sink with the rest of a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9629"> 9629 </A></B>
<P>
country, which has  been mismanaged for a quarter of a century 
and is now bankrupt. I am not exaggerating when I say that we 
are bankrupt; I am merely telling the truth.
<P>
	The Reform member who spoke earlier was quite right when 
he said that, in Canada, the accumulated debt stands at $1.2 
billion. That figure includes the debts incurred by the federal, 
provincial and municipal levels of government, as well as by 
private companies. We are currently paying $100 million per 
day in interest to foreign creditors.
<P>
	Surely we must have borrowed enough money if, every day, 
$100 million leave the country to pay the interest on foreign 
loans. We could do a lot with that money. Why is that? It is 
because the federalist structure did not allow us to manage the 
country in a way that would have been beneficial to everyone.
<P>
	Consequently, we are struggling with this serious problem. As 
Quebecers, as members of a nation speaking the same language, 
sovereignty is the only option. Our culture is different from that 
of the rest of the country, whether we are talking about financial 
institutions, artists or creators. We are simply different. As a 
small country, if we work together, we will be able to have our 
own legislation, collect our own taxes, spend according to our 
priorities, and we will undoubtedly be better off. It is with that in 
mind that we embark upon our plan for a sovereign Quebec. We 
do not have anything against anglophones, Ukrainians, Italians 
or Jews. We do not have a grudge against anybody. All we want 
is to survive. We just want to keep at least a decent standard of 
living, which we will lose if we stay within the Canadian 
Confederation. It is with that in mind that we intend to embark 
upon our plan for a sovereign Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	The future belongs to small countries. We will negotiate and 
we will succeed. I can guarantee Quebecers that even the hon. 
member from Quebec, on the other side, knows I am right and 
agrees with what I have just said. But, unfortunately, he will not 
accept this daily reality.
<P>
	What I say today does not all come from me. In the study 
which was carried out by the Bélanger-Campeau Commission, 
in 1992, experts clearly said that there was only one solution, 
that is, that Quebec must recover the great majority of its 
powers. If not, it will have to become sovereign or risk losing its 
standard of living and becoming poorer and poorer. Since the 
rest of Canada said no, this leaves us with only one alternative.
<P>
	In matters of public finance, changes of all sorts are no use. 
There is only one alternative for Quebec, and for the rest of 
Canada, that is, to have a sovereign Quebec, an economic 
association open to the world. This is the only way we will save 
Canada and Quebec.
<P>
	Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for this opportunity to speak this 
afternoon. I am convinced that some federalists from Quebec, 
on the other side, have understood some of the matters I have 
discussed this afternoon.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
couple of comments and then a question for the hon. member 
who has just spoken.
<P>
	The hon. member gave a very good history of government 
incompetence in the terms of fiscal mismanagement over the 
past 25 years. He has proven to be very accurate in that regard. 
Certainly some members of the cabinet from the governing 
party have played an important role over this time period 
including the Prime Minister who was finance minister in a 
former Liberal government.
<P>
	The member also said that it is this fiscal mismanagement and 
the financial condition of Canada that would drive Quebec out of 
this country and is leading Quebec out of this country if the 
referendum is successful.
<P>
	The hon. member said that under these conditions of financial 
mismanagement the federal system in Canada does not work as 
it is now. I absolutely agree with that. The federal system in 
Canada does not work as it is now. I would like to ask the 
member a question. I am going to put some ``ifs'' into the 
question.
<P>
	If governments over the past 30 years had been more fiscally 
responsible, if the federal government had left the powers that 
rightly belong to the provinces under the Canadian Constitution 
in the hands of the provinces, and if each province were given 
control over language and culture, would this member be sitting 
as a separatist in this Parliament? If those conditions had 
happened, would he be sitting in this government trying to lead 
Quebec to become a separate country? I am asking the member 
to look back.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before I ask the member 
for Longueuil to reply, the pages have reminded me that I have 
been delinquent.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the 
House that the questions to be raised tonight at the time of 
adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for 
Bourassa-immigration; the hon. member for Yukon-violence 
against women.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am glad to be asked 
this question. The member said there were several conditions. 
Yes, of course, there were several conditions. However, I want to 
point out to the Reform member that we have been working hard 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9630"> 9630 </A></B>
<P>
for 10 years and, personally, when I was a member of the 
Progressive Conservative Party, I worked hard to get approval 
for the Meech Lake Agreement.
<P>
	I can tell you that we worked for two and even three years, 
because it took three years, a lot of discussion and efforts, to get 
this agreement approved. Let me remind Reform members that 
we spent almost $500 million. The Canadian government spent 
almost $500 million to try to explain how this country could be 
managed. The overall process, the ads, the whole thing cost 
almost $500 million and took several years. In the end, the 
federal government and English Canada did not want any 
changes.
<P>
	So, do not say we did not try. We did and we spent a lot of 
money we did not even have. We borrowed to try and get 
approval for this agreement and it was rejected. What else can I 
say, we did everything possible. Mr. Mulroney put all his heart 
into trying to renew Canada, but he failed. Maybe the Reform 
Party will succeed, I do not know, but I have lost faith. Any way, 
I can tell you that we tried our best, but we failed.
<P>
	Do not try to convince me that I made a mistake in becoming a 
sovereignist member in this House. From an economic 
standpoint, it is a matter of life and death. I believe, and I will 
repeat it, that the only solution for Quebec is to become a 
sovereign state, to collect its own taxes, to make its own laws, to 
sign its own treaties and to have an open economic association 
with the rest of Canada, just as we have today. If Quebec 
continues to do business with the rest of Canada after it achieves 
sovereignty, there is not one Canadian that will see a difference. 
People from Montreal will continue to go to Toronto to do 
business, and people from Toronto will continue to come to 
Montreal just as they do now.
<P>
	It will not change a thing. The only difference is that we will 
have only one government, we will have only one set of laws, we 
will collect our own taxes, we will spend according to our own 
priorities and we will make progress. And the rest of Canada 
will also benefit from that because a strong Quebec will share its 
wealth with the rest of Canada and help Canadians to continue to 
live well. We will stay good friends.
<P>
	I can assure you that I will continue to ski in Whistler and I 
will feel very good about it. I have no problem with that. It is in 
that sense that we will succeed in helping the rest of Canada to 
survive economically so that it does not become a kind of third 
world country, as we already are in terms of our debt.
<P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="NUCLEARREACTORFINANCELIMITATIONACT">NUCLEAR REACTOR FINANCE LIMITATION ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP)</B> moved that Bill C-285, 
an act to eliminate financial support for nuclear reactor design 
and construction in Canada or abroad and to amend the Atomic 
Energy Control Act in consequence thereof, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am really pleased to have the chance to 
raise this private member's bill today. It is very timely. Today is 
Valentine's Day when we acknowledge the special relationships 
that we have in our lives.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9636"> 9636 </A></B>
<P>
	Today I call into question the relationship that the federal 
government has with the nuclear industry. For many years it 
has been a sweetheart deal between the federal government and 
the nuclear industry of Canada.
<P>
	Essentially this bill is intended to cut the subsidies that the 
federal government over the years has provided for the nuclear 
sector. I have a list from 1948 until 1992. I will not read it out 
because it goes on and on. It clearly identifies the hundreds of 
millions of dollars with which the Canadian taxpayers subsidize 
Canada's nuclear industry.
<P>
	I want to make clear from the start that this in no way reflects 
a reduction in support for the use of isotopes for medical use. We 
all acknowledge the benefits that accrue from a whole set of 
medical initiatives.
<P>
	Perhaps I should read what this bill does. The title is Nuclear 
Reactor Finance Limitation Act.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	It says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Notwithstanding any act of Parliament, no payment shall be made from the 
consolidated revenue fund for the purpose of subsidizing or paying or loaning 
any part of the cost or of guaranteeing any loan that is for the purpose of 
subsidizing or paying or loaning any part of the cost of any real property, 
intellectual property, goods or services that are used for the research, 
investigation, design, testing, construction, manufacture, operation, use, 
application or licensing of any thing or property of any nature that will be used 
in or for a nuclear reactor.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It goes on to elaborate on this theme. Basically it is a bill that 
would eliminate the subsidies that the federal government 
provides to the nuclear sector. These are substantial. I think if 
one were to generalize, it would not be an elaboration to suggest 
that on average about $200 million a year of taxpayers' money 
goes to subsidizing this particular industry.
<P>
	This is a time when we are all conscious of the need for fiscal 
restraint and aware of the need for evaluating every subsidy, 
grant and expenditure on a cost benefit basis. We can apply any 
cost benefit analysis to ask whether the $200 million year after 
year is a good investment for the taxpayers of Canada. There is 
only one conclusion in economic, health and environmental 
terms. It does not stand up to scrutiny.
<P>
	I want to elaborate on a few points. We talk about being on the 
dole. A previous leader went on at some time about the corporate 
welfare bums. If there were ever a corporate welfare bum it has 
to be the nuclear sector. We would assume the nuclear industry 
is a major player in the energy sector because of the tremendous 
subsidies it receives.
<P>
	We would assume the nuclear sector contributes a significant 
percentage of the overall energy sector of Canada. It does not. It 
is actually beneath firewood. In other words, more people use 
firewood for energy than nuclear energy. By firewood I am 
talking about hog fuels as opposed to what people are using in a 
fireplace or whatever. We typically burn chunks of wood.
<P>
	Wood accounts for about 7 per cent of the energy picture. 
Coal, electric and others account for 6 per cent. Hydro accounts 
for 14 per cent, gas for 33 per cent, oil for 36 per cent, nuclear 4 
per cent. Out of all of the various energy options in our country, 
nuclear accounts for about 4 per cent of the entire energy 
package. Yet in terms of research and development monies 
coming from the federal government, it receives more than all 
others combined.
<P>
	When we add up the $200 million a year over the life of this 
particular government, it will come to nearly $1 billion. I think 
if taxpayers were put the question in a referendum: ``Are you 
prepared to spend $1 billion over the life of this particular 
federal government to support and subsidize the nuclear energy 
sector?'', my guess is that overwhelmingly people would say no.
<P>
	I know that an argument people often use for example is there 
are a number of people employed in this sector. Of course, we 
could say that about any sector. If that were the sole motivation, 
I suppose we should be subsidizing the marijuana industry or the 
drug industry if jobs are the criteria.
<P>
	Any economic activity will create jobs, including the nuclear 
sector. Of greater relevance is whether such jobs are sustainable, 
including the overall cost to society of maintaining those jobs.
<P>
	When I talk about the $200 million subsidy annually, that is 
not the actual cost to Canadians. That is the cost today. 
Eventually we are going to have to start dismantling these 
nuclear reactors, 22 of them with Ontario Hydro alone. We are 
going to start decommissioning these nuclear reactors. To 
decommission a nuclear reactor is not some minor financial 
undertaking.
<P>
	The Auditor General, I think in the 1992 report, indicated that 
a major cost that is never counted into the accounting system of 
Atomic Energy Canada is the cost accruing in terms of eventual 
dismantling. We have some evidence of what that cost would be. 
I think the most recent nuclear reactor that was dismantled in 
New Jersey cost $157 million U.S. Rounding it out, for one 
nuclear reactor alone we are adding another $200 million for the 
decommissioning. That is just decommissioning. What do we do 
with the nuclear waste? Again, we have yet to come up with 
something for what is at this moment a serious problem and 
likely to be a problem for perhaps hundreds, thousands or 
millions of years to come.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	Here we are on this treadmill developing nuclear reactors, 
going head long in terms of these incredible subsidies to this one 
energy sector that only accounts for 4 per cent of the total energy 
package for Canada at a time when they are unsafe, we do not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9637"> 9637 </A></B>
<P>
know what to do with the waste. Even now the subsidies do not 
reflect the true cost.
<P>
	We just had on Parliament Hill a reception. The minister 
welcomed the nuclear industry to Parliament Hill. We heard 
what people are really worried about, that this is very 
economical.
<P>
	If it is so economical why have we had to subsidize this 
industry since 1948? Why does it cost the taxpayers of Canada, 
not $200 million, not $1 billion, but close to $20 billion? Is this 
what we call economical? That industry after decades of 
subsidization still cannot stand on its own two feel. It requires 
this incredible subsidy by the federal government on an annual 
basis.
<P>
	Talk about being on the dole. That industry should be hanging 
its head in disgrace, coming here wearing out the knees of its 
pants asking for that kind of handout from the taxpayers of 
Canada year after year. Has it no grace? Has it no pride?-not as 
long as those people are across the way, whether they be Tories 
or Liberals, it does not make any difference. They are there, 
backing up the old truck and shovelling out the taxpayers' 
dollars, $200 million to start with on an annual basis.
<P>
	I think my Liberal friends across the way surely should be 
waiting for me to sit down so they can get up and condemn this 
abuse of taxpayers' money and to say now is the time to send a 
message to our Minister of Finance. They should stand up and be 
counted. Do the right thing. Listen to Canadians and stop this 
handout to the nuclear industry.
<P>
	I got a little worked up but I cannot help it when I see the kind 
of abuses we tolerate.
<P>
	What can we say about this? I want to reiterate a few points. 
The nuclear industry represents 4 per cent of the energy package 
of Canada and yet receives more than the natural gas sector, the 
oil sector, the coal sector, the renewable sector and conservation 
combined in terms of subsidies.
<P>
	I ask my Liberal friends across the way-I know my Reform 
friends will agree with me and certainly the Bloc will agree with 
me-if we are going to subsidize any part of the energy sector 
should it not make more sense to subsidize the area that is 
looking into how to replace this kind of industry, the renewable 
resources or the alternative, the conservationist options that are 
available to us?
<P>
	We heard sometime ago that down in New York they decided 
to back out of the big James Bay hydro project. The reason they 
did that was the conservation elements that they introduced in 
the state of New York were so overwhelmingly successful they 
did not need the power. There might be other factors that we 
have to take into consideration but fundamentally the energy 
authority in the state of New York said the conservation methods 
introduced have been so successful that it does not have to enter 
into that long term energy agreement with Quebec Hydro.
<P>
	Again, where we have evidence it works. Yet this government 
seems to be walking around with a real hearing problem, a real 
sight problem. It cannot see what is obviously the right thing to 
do. I say to the government if it is confident in what it says it 
does, ask the people of Canada what they think; if we should be 
handing out money by the basket full, $200 million a year plus to 
one energy sector that accounts for only 4 per cent of the whole 
energy package in Canada.
<P>
	If there is a country in the world that does not have to 
subsidize the nuclear industry, that does not need a nuclear 
industry, it is Canada.
<P>
<B>(1825 ) </B>
<P>
	We have energy coming out of our yin-yang. We have coal, 
we have-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> Yin-yang is a town in Saskatchewan, I think. I am 
not certain of that.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It is a little town in China.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> My friend says it is a little town in China. That 
sounds better.
<P>
	Despite 50 years of massive government subsidies, being on 
the dole, asking for handouts, the nuclear industry still cannot 
stand on its own two feet. Should that not get all of our attention 
in this House? After 50 years of handouts, after 50 years of 
coming in here and begging for support, it still cannot stand on 
its own two feet. Should we not say it is time it reassess how 
viable it is in terms of the future of Canada?
<P>
	This gets almost obscene. The federal government wrote off a 
$70 million loan to AECL for the Douglas Point reactor at Bruce 
site. Quebec's number one reactor never operated properly and 
had to be shut down. A $90 million loan to AECL was written off 
by the federal government.
<P>
	Despite the failure of that reactor Ottawa has now financed a 
second one to the tune of $151 million. It gets worse. It is very 
embarrassing.
<P>
	It is the standing policy of this government, the Tories before 
and the Liberals now, to finance one-half of the estimated cost 
of any province's first nuclear plant. That is policy. The 
Government of Canada has written off about $800 million in 
unpaid loans to Nova Scotia and Quebec heavy water plants. In 
1977-78 the federal government wrote off about $190 million in 
loans to AECL.
<P>
	Canada's Nuclear Liability Act limits the liability of nuclear 
operators to $75 million in the event of a nuclear accident. It has 
been estimated that a severe accident at the Darlington nuclear 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9638"> 9638 </A></B>
<P>
station would cost at least a trillion dollars and could lead to 
over 200,000 fatalities.
<P>
	I could go on and on. That brings me to an important point, 
whether the nuclear energy sector is safe? I think this is 
fundamental in people's minds. It is certainly not economical. It 
is certainly environmentally unsound and I think that is a given. 
Is it safe?
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I think you will be shocked. During 1993 the 
Atomic Energy Control Board recorded 700 ``unusual 
incidents'' at Canada's 22 operating nuclear reactors. That is 
almost two a day. You are astonished. I am too. These incidents 
range from spills of radioactive heavy water to unexplained 
power surges. Of these, 270 were serious enough to warrant a 
full report to AECB and a follow up investigation. That is 
incredible, two incidents a day that warranted full scale 
investigations.
<P>
	The annual reports of the Atomic Energy Control Board 
provide ample evidence of the inherent dangers of nuclear 
technology. The following really got me riled up in terms of 
having to do something to prevent this catastrophe that is about 
to happen. It is reported that in August 1992 radioactive heavy 
water from the Pickering A nuclear reactor leaked into Lake 
Ontario downstream from the water supply plants for the 
communities of Ajax and Whitby, forcing a shutdown of the 
plants. This incident resulted in the highest single emission of 
radioactive tritium into the lake since the reactor began 
operating in 1971.
<P>
	This goes on and on. No wonder those whales are whipping up 
on the beaches in Quebec all scarred up, sick and blue. We have 
nuclear waste draining into the Great Lakes.
<P>
	The 1992 annual report, the one that really got my attention, 
states that in March 1993 Ontario Hydro discovered a serious 
deficiency in the analysis of an accident involving a large loss of 
reactor coolant. The analysis showed that the consequence of 
such an accident, if it were to occur while operating at full 
power, would be unacceptable. The term unacceptable is a 
euphemism for a disaster, probably.
<P>
	They are not safe. They are not economical. They are 
environmentally unsound. They are a threat to our health and 
they are breaking the treasury. Why on earth would we continue 
on this sort of treadmill to nowhere, forking out that kind of 
taxpayers' money?
<P>
<B>(1830 ) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, my time is quickly coming to an end. So I will sit 
down now while I wait for my friends across the way to explain 
to the taxpayers of Canada how this incredible subsidy ought to 
continue.
<P>
	Hopefully, a little lightening bolt will come out of the sky and 
give them a little snap so they will say: ``Yes, tomorrow morning 
I am going to walk over to the Minister of Finance's desk, sit 
down beside him and say: ``Mr. Minister of Finance, it is time to 
end this madness. Save the taxpayers of Canada hundreds of 
millions of dollars. Bring them a safer environment, a healthier 
environment and something that is economically and 
environmentally sound now''. The only  way we can do that is to 
stop funding Canada's nuclear sector.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Earlier in his intervention 
the member referred to the Speaker being shocked. I am not so 
sure about that, but I am still looking for that little town in the 
Chinese province of Saskatchewan.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leonard Hopkins (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, well here we go again. The NDP party with 
the same bill it brought in before. The same old party. The same 
worn out rhetoric. The same wrong conclusions-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. I want to hear the 
hon. member's speech however, he mentioned the NDP party. 
Think about it. That would be the New Democratic Party party. 
If he is going to refer to us, at least say the New Democratic 
Party.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Respectfully, the member 
does not have a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hopkins:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thought I was very kind because 
I have heard them called worse.
<P>
	I want to remind the hon. member that Ontario Premier Bob 
Ray stood with the Prime Minister of Canada when we sold two 
reactors to China. He was so proud of our Canadian technology. 
I know he got into a bit of criticism over that, but he understands 
what research and development means and we respect him for 
that.
<P>
	This bill will prevent the federal government from giving any 
financial assistance or technical support to nuclear reactor 
projects, except those making isotopes for medical use.
<P>
	The hon. member made a great deal out of wasting money. Let 
me state one important point right off the bat, and this is for 
Canadian consumption in view of what the hon. member has 
said. From 1952 to 1992 the Canadian government invested $4.7 
billion in Atomic Energy of Canada Limited. During the 30 year 
period from 1962 until 1992 the nuclear industry in Canada had 
a return for Canadians of $23 billion. Now, if we are going to get 
a return of $5 for every dollar invested, I do not think that is a 
bad investment.
<P>
	NDP members have learned one thing. It took them some time 
to learn it, but they learned that isotopes are useful in medicine. 
Radioisotopes have various applications. One use is for 
sterilizing medical instruments. The hon. member does not 
seem to understand that cobalt 60 which is a byproduct from 
Ontario Hydro's power reactors is an isotope product. He wants 
to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9639"> 9639 </A></B>
<P>
destroy the reactors that produce it, yet he wants isotopes saved 
for medical purposes.
<P>
	Come on, do your homework here. In their press conference 
material the hon. member and his colleagues do not want the 
production of isotopes for medical use interfered with, but in 
this bill they are proposing to cripple hydro power reactors 
which produce isotopes. What a contradiction.
<P>
	Molly 99 which is a shortened version of Molybdenum 99 is 
produced at the NRU research reactor at Chalk River. This is a 
radioisotope product which is supplied to Nordion International 
Incorporated so that Canada can continue to control the 88 to 90 
per cent of the world market we control today in isotopes. 
However, the NDP today wants to cripple some of the 
production facilities of isotopes while at the same time wanting 
to maintain isotope production. That sounds like the modern day 
rhetoric of the NDP.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	I want to get on to some other very interesting things in reply 
to what the hon. member has said. Those are items about the 
economic factors.
<P>
	In 1993, 50 per cent of Ontario's electricity came from 
nuclear generators and in New Brunswick, 35 per cent came 
from nuclear generators. In 1993, Ontario Hydro's published 
generating costs were 6.8 cents per kilowatt hour for fossil fuel 
and 5.4 cents per kilowatt hour for nuclear power. This is a 20 
per cent advantage for nuclear power, yet the NDP calls that 
waste. We can understand that.
<P>
	In terms of lifetime performance, five in the top 20 reactors in 
the entire world were Candu reactors made in Canada by 
Canadians. Canada's Pointe Lepreau reactor was the number 
two reactor in the entire world.
<P>
	The automobile industry uses nuclear technology to test steel 
quality in cars. The paper industry uses it in the production of 
coded stock. Manufacturers use it to check for flaws in jet 
engines. Construction crews gauge the density of road surfaces 
and subsurfaces with it. Pipeline companies test the strength of 
welds, and oil and gas mining companies map the contours of 
test wells and mine bores with it. But NDP members want to do 
away with all this. They are very progressive in their thinking. It 
is no wonder they are sitting where they are today.
<P>
	Atomic Energy of Canada Limited engineers developed the 
first commercial sterilizers in 1964. There are roughly 170 such 
units currently in use in 46 countries and 90 of them are 
Canadian designs.
<P>
	Radioisotopes are used extensively by industry in quality 
control and process management. The petroleum industry uses 
them to test pipeline welds. The pulp and paper industry uses 
them to measure the thickness of paper. Many industries use 
them to trace the flows of material through process systems.
<P>
	Imagine what would happen to our modern day industry if we 
destroyed the basis of all this. In environmental matters, the 
worldwide use of nuclear power plants results in lowered CO2 
emissions globally by 1.5 billion tonnes a year.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> And they are opposed to this?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hopkins:</B> Yes, they are opposed to this.
<P>
	If Ontario Hydro had used coal fired generating plants to 
produce the same amount of electricity as has been made by its 
nuclear plants to date, it would have released 9.9 million tonnes 
of acid gas into the atmosphere and produced 23.3 million 
tonnes of ashes.
<P>
	All of the used fuel from Canada's nuclear plants would fit 
into one olympic size swimming pool. The coal ashes would 
require about 25,000 times as much space if coal had been used.
<P>
	What is more, the nuclear fuel still has the potential for 
recycling to produce much more energy. A single uranium fuel 
bundle of about 10 centimetres in diameter and 50 centimetres 
long and weighing 25 kilograms produces as much electricity as 
380 tonnes of coal or 1,800 barrels of oil. But the NDP wants to 
do away with this.
<P>
	A large nuclear power reactor uses 150 tonnes of natural 
uranium per year, equivalent to two million tonnes of black coal 
or 10 million barrels of oil. Is that what the NDP stands for?
<P>
	Since 1973 nuclear power plants worldwide have cut fossil 
fuels used to generate electricity by 17.6 billion barrels of oil 
worth $470 billion U.S., 2.2 billion tonnes of coal, 26 trillion 
cubic feet of natural gas. This is not a bad saving. It is not bad for 
conservation.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	For medical applications almost every facet of modern 
medicine relies in some way on nuclear technology, from 
nuclear powered units in heart pacemakers to the sutures, 
surgical gloves and medical supplies that are sterilized by 
radiation and used in hospitals each day.
<P>
	Millions of diagnostic procedures are carried out annually 
using nuclear technology. Cancer treatment systems using 
nuclear technology are used to save thousands of lives 
throughout the world. More than 1,300 of the world's cobalt 
therapy machines have been supplied by Canada. This figure 
represents close to 50 per cent of the total cobalt 60 therapy 
machines used to date.
<P>
	Every year in 70 countries an estimated one-half million 
people are treated for cancer using cobalt therapy machines 
designed and built in Canada. Canada is a world leader in the 
production of cobalt 60. The country supplies more than 80 per 
cent of the world's total cobalt 60 used in medical and industrial 
applications. AECL was instrumental in the development of the 
cobalt 60 treatment for cancer.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9640"> 9640 </A></B>
<P>
	Cobalt 60 is a human-made radioisotope produced using a 
nuclear reactor. Radioisotopes are used to help diagnose 
medical ailments and prescribe remedies. Such isotopes can 
detect how well organs are functioning, how well the body 
absorbs particular substances, and where tumours might be 
located. They have a range of valuable uses.
<P>
	The hon. member has told this House of Commons and all 
Canadians that AECL is a waste of money. Are all these facts a 
waste of money? The hon. member should take a second look 
and do his homework.
<P>
	I will end my comments here. I have much more I would like 
to say to educate the hon. member, but I will pay due respect to 
the Chair. My time is up.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to say that I am very happy to take part 
in the debate on Bill C-285. First of all, I wish to thank the NDP 
member who introduced this bill and who has done so in such an 
entertaining and informative way.
<P>
	Bill C-285 provides for the elimination of financial support 
for nuclear reactor design and construction. That prospect is 
viewed by the Bloc Quebecois as interesting and relevant under 
the present circumstances.
<P>
	Indeed, how could we not have doubts about the nuclear 
energy development policy of the Canadian government and the 
significant investments required for the implementation of that 
policy. As the Official Opposition of the House of Commons, we 
are deeply concerned by energy development policies.
<P>
	Our concerns are twofold. First, we should wonder about the 
environmental costs of the development of any type of energy, in 
this instance nuclear energy, and second, about the impact the 
development of such energy may have on the economy of a 
country. I would like to take a few minutes to discuss those two 
issues.
<P>
	The Minister of Natural Resources of Canada said recently to 
the Nuclear Awareness Project that she believed it would be 
appropriate to continue to develop nuclear energy in Canada. 
But at what cost to the environment and the Canadian taxpayers, 
that is the question.
<P>
	First of all, in the industrial process of long term development 
of nuclear energy, the risks for the human environment are very 
high. Indeed, we know fully well that radioactive waste 
produced by the nuclear industry is most dangerous to the 
human species. Spent fuel represents not only the highest risks, 
but also the most difficult challenge if we want to find a safe, 
long term method of storage.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	After 500 years, for example, nuclear fission material 
produced by the Canadian nuclear industry will still be active. In 
December 1992, there were 21,000 tonnes of spent fuel stored in 
Canada, 90 per cent of which was  produced by Ontario Hydro, 
and the Canadian nuclear industry is not even 50 years old. For 
human beings, radioactivity is highly cancerous and very 
harmful genetically.
<P>
	Clearly, the results of the accidents that occurred at the 
nuclear compounds of Three Mile Island and Chernobyl are very 
good examples of that. We must also remember that the nuclear 
industry in eastern European countries is in such a state that it is 
a time bomb for humanity and we can all see clearly what 
political problems that creates. The coming apart of the Union 
of Soviet Socialist Republics left nuclear power plants almost 
abandoned everywhere because the people in charge of those 
plants moved from Eastern Europe to more financially secure 
countries where they can earn a better living. Mechanics and 
plumbers generally speaking operate the power plants and these 
certainly are time bombs for humanity.
<P>
	Not only does the nuclear reaction from the fuel produce 
radioactive elements, it also produces neutrons which strike 
other components of the reactor itself and activate some of its 
substances which also become radioactive. This means that the 
reactor structure will have to be stored as radioactive waste once 
the reactor has reached the end of its useful life. The Chalk River 
nuclear laboratory of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited 
contains three outdated nuclear reactors, and the site itself is 
seriously contaminated by radioactive waste. Atomic Energy is 
also responsible for two outdated reactors, at Whitshell, 
Manitoba, for the NPD reactor at Rolphton and the Douglas 
Point reactor at Bruce, both in Ontario, and for the Gentilly 1 
reactor in Bécancour. All of these reactors are no longer in use 
and should be stored.
<P>
	The cost of a stockpiling system is astronomical. The 
estimated cost of stockpiling a little over 100,000 tonnes of used 
fuel is $9 billion. We share the view of the Auditor General of 
Canada that Atomic Energy of Canada will require even larger 
subsidies in order to cover the costs of dismantling these 
outdated reactors. This means that the costs the government is 
calculating now, in terms of the cost of this energy, the costs that 
have to be budgeted later, to ensure safe storage of the waste 
from these plants when the government is no longer in power, 
simply because hundreds of years are involved, these costs are 
never calculated.
<P>
	This leads to the next question of whether the nuclear industry 
can turn a profit over the long term. Another question with 
respect to the human environment concerns the use of nuclear 
energy for military purposes. Uranium 235 and 238 are 
consumed in Canadian reactors of the CANDU type; they are 
elements which, when bombarded by a neutron to cause fission 
and create energy, become plutonium 239 atoms. The creation of 
plutonium 239 in nuclear reactors raises a very serious problem 
in regard to nuclear weapons and world peace.  Plutonium 239 is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9641"> 9641 </A></B>
<P>
fissionable and can be used in the production of nuclear 
weapons.
<P>
	Even if plutonium 239 is the isotope preferred by arms 
manufacturers, other plutonium isotopes are also fissionable 
and can be used to manufacture bombs. Knowing that Atomic 
Energy of Canada, the body responsible for promoting nuclear 
energy in Canada, is trying to sell CANDU reactors by any 
means possible, which is, after all, why they are building them 
all over the world, we must look into this very closely. Despite 
the many multilateral and bilateral treaties on the 
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons between Canada and the 
rest of the world, we must be realistic: there will be a real risk of 
nuclear technology being used for military purposes as long as 
the nuclear industry is developing in the world.
<P>
	The second facet of Canada's nuclear industry is government 
financing. I have already mentioned the astronomical costs of 
storing radioactive waste. Maintenance at Atomic Energy of 
Canada Limited is subsidized by the public purse, and has been 
for the past six years, to the tune of $1.2 billion. The cost of 
building a reactor is $1.5 billion, an investment on which even a 
long term return is not guaranteed. We are justified in 
questioning the investment of public funds in this industry.
<P>
<B>(1850) </B>
<P>
	During the Prime Minister's trip to China last fall, according 
to representatives of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited who 
were interviewed in Peking, Atomic Energy made a proposal to 
build two reactors on Chinese territory under a turnkey proposal 
without requiring a large investment by China. The 
representatives said that acquiring these reactors, valued at $3 
billion, would be extremely advantageous for the Chinese, who 
would not have to tie up foreign currency holdings for a long 
period. In other words, we are selling CANDUs, but we are 
financing them entirely.
<P>
	What about the people of Canada who pay the major part of 
the construction costs of such reactors? Is the present evolution 
of Chinese society collateral enough for Canadian investments? 
These are legitimate questions we should ask ourselves.
<P>
	The present Canadian policy in the area of nuclear 
development is costly and dangerous, in terms of both public 
finance and the human environment. This is why, considering 
that Canada is trying to reduce its deficit, we believe that Bill 
C-285, which seeks to eliminate financial support for nuclear 
reactor design and construction in Canada and abroad, is a 
worthwhile initiative.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the millennium has 
arrived. We have just had an NDP member suggesting that we 
cut off subsidies to a major crown corporation. I thought I would 
never see the day.  Actually what he is in effect proposing in the 
practical sense is the privatization of AECL.
<P>
	If he wants to make the same proposal with respect to the 
CBC, the National Film Board and what is left of the 
government's stake in Petro-Canada, I will move over one seat 
and let him join us. We will make him a Reformer, an honorary 
Reformer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> Thanks but no thanks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> It is a good idea to talk about privatizing 
AECL but it is not simple. We cannot do that in one quick step.
<P>
	We must remember that more than 80 per cent of the nuclear 
industry in Canada is already private. The only parts that are still 
under government supervision and are still being subsidized by 
the government are the parts that do not make money, the 
research facilities primarily. Everything else is being operated 
by the private sector. There are 150 companies out there that 
compete with suppliers in client countries. They are efficient 
and they make money.
<P>
	The Koreans have been so delighted with what we have done 
with the private end of the industry, the building of the reactors, 
that they have ordered three more. I would have to take issue 
with the hon. member who spoke for the Liberals. Wolsong 1 is 
probably a better reactor even than Point Lepreau. It has been up 
and running since 1982. They love it and they want more of 
them.
<P>
	Let us get back to AECL specifically. Among the major crown 
corporations it is the only one that is seriously cutting costs. 
This formerly bloated entity has cut its staff from 4,500 to 
3,700. Even more commendable is that it has reduced its Ottawa 
head office staff from 160 to 54, a two-thirds reduction.
<P>
	I was out at Chalk River a couple of months ago to look the 
place over and what I found was quite a tight ship. There was 
none of the opulence that we have come to associate with 
government. It was nothing like the Department of National 
Defence, for example, or the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans. This is an outfit that knows what money is for.
<P>
	Let us take a look at the specifics of the bill. Clause 3(b) 
speaks of research, investigation, design, testing, construction, 
manufacture, operation, use, application or licensing of any 
thing or property of any nature that will be used in or for a 
nuclear reactor. If the world were only that simple. We cannot 
pigeon hole or categorize scientific research like that. Much of 
what is being done at Chalk River at the moment is pure 
scientific research which may or may not be applicable to 
reactor design.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9642"> 9642 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1855) </B>
<P>
	The line between pure and applied science is very hard to 
draw. That is why privatization although necessary and 
desirable will be difficult. An entirely new company of 
researchers will have to be formed to sell their services to the 
people who have the reactors. That is going on now to some 
extent. They take in $86 million a year in fees for the work that is 
done at Chalk River on behalf of reactor owners. Eventually 
they will have to become self-sufficient and I do not think it will 
happen until it is privatized.
<P>
	With all the pure science going on out there it is not going to 
be an easy sell. However we do not just kill the flagship of 
Canadian R and D. Let us remember the Avro Arrow, because 
this is the sort of thing we are talking about. Clause 4 would 
preclude provision to any person, any professional, scientific 
technical information or assistance that relates to research 
investigation, design, testing, construction, manufacture, 
operation, use, application or licensing of any thing or property 
of any nature that would be used in or for a nuclear reactor. In 
plain English, it would make orphans of the Candu reactors that 
provide almost half of Ontario's electricity.
<P>
	The work being done at AECL that is not pure science is 
bankrolled by the utilities. As I have mentioned they spend 
about $86 million a year on it. It is to enhance plant safety, 
prolong operational lives and cut maintenance costs. If we want 
to remain in the forefront of an industry we have to do R and D 
and we have to do it continuously.
<P>
	They are doing work out there now on the applications of 
computer technology to the construction and operation of 
plants, improving reactor fuel channels, better fuel design and 
so on. Bill C-285 would stop this cold.
<P>
	Clause 5 says that the act does not apply to a nuclear reactor 
that has as its sole purpose the manufacture or development of 
isotopes for medical use. The hon. member for Kamloops should 
know that this function of AECL has already been privatized. 
Nordion was sold for $165 million. Incidentally the government 
of the day pocketed the funds into general revenue and did not 
leave a penny for the operations.
<P>
	During his long harangue about the technical side of nuclear 
energy the hon. member for Kamloops reflected the 
anti-industrial primitivism that is so common among a small 
segment of his party, the people we refer to as the nuts and 
berries crowd.
<P>
	We live in a climate of irrational fear of the atom because 
most people do not understand it. They do not have a vague 
notion of how a reactor works. Polls indicate that 10 per cent of 
the public actually believes that a reactor can explode like an 
atomic bomb. Vast numbers who at least know better than that 
believe a nuclear plant constantly emits streams of deadly 
radiation that will induce cancer, make them sterile or cause 
them to conceive defective children.
<P>
	A few highly visible crusaders have seized upon the fears as a 
convenient means of attacking a social order that they find 
distasteful and have found highly successful careers as virtual 
cult leaders. When primitive man was troubled by fears of the 
unknown, he consulted the witch doctor or the shaman. 
Sophisticated modern man appeals to Amory Lovins, Ralph 
Nader or Barry Commoner.
<P>
	The hon. member was engaging in a little shameless sophistry 
when talked about 4 per cent of the energy uses of Canada 
coming from nuclear. For God's sake that includes the use of 
fuel in cars. There are not very many nuclear cars. What it does 
produce is 20 per cent of the electrical energy that is used in the 
country and, as has been stated two or three times, nearly 50 per 
cent of Ontario's electrical energy. We used to have a bumper 
sticker out west that said: ``Let those eastern bastards freeze in 
the dark''. Apparently this is what the hon. member for 
Kamloops is suggesting we do again.
<P>
<B>(1900) </B>
<P>
	He mentioned the decommissioning cost of $13 billion. That 
is not bad for an industry that produces $4 billion worth of 
electricity annually over a period of probably 30 years of 
operational life for a plant. Remember, that $13 billion is not 
just for one reactor, that is for the whole shooting match. At least 
that is a number which both the pro and the anti-nukes agree on.
<P>
	There has been a lot of talk about the waste. It is an insoluble 
problem. It will be with us forever. The nuclear priesthood will 
have to guard it. I am reminded of a quote from Goethe that the 
phrases men repeat incessantly end by becoming convictions 
and ossify the organs of intelligence.
<P>
	If Canada went 100 per cent nuclear for its electricity each 
family share of spent fuel, or high level waste if you prefer that 
term, would be seven ounces a year. This stuff is put into the 
swimming pools at the plants. As somebody said, there are 
21,000 tonnes of it around now. Within 10 years the 
radioactivity is reduced by 90 per cent. Within 1,000 years in 
dead storage the radioactive levels would be sufficiently 
reduced to make it perfectly safe to eat a few spoonfuls of the 
stuff.
<P>
	You get these anti-technological myths about plutonium, 
because there is plutonium in the waste. It is the deadliest thing 
known to man. It is evil. God did not create it. That is garbage. 
That stuff is an alpha emitter, for openers. You could wrap it in a 
piece of tissue paper, put it in your pant's pocket and walk 
around with it with impunity because it emits no gamma 
radiation and no beta radiation. It is not dangerous. If you were 
to eat a bunch of it, it is 50 times less poisonous than ordinary 
arsenic trioxide. Mr. Speaker, you can look that up in any good 
journal of toxicology.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9643"> 9643 </A></B>
<P>
	It has been studied in great detail. The toxicity of plutonium 
on a weight dose basis is much less than that of many items 
which are kept commonly around the home. It is lethal only if 
breathed into the lungs or directly injected into the 
bloodstream. Then it will kill you, and it will kill you quick, 
but not as quickly as botulism poison, for example, which is 
fairly abundant, and anthrax. Again, there are many natural 
toxins which are more toxic than this horrible stuff that we all 
have to worry about so much.
<P>
	I see the Speaker starting to rise from his seat. I wish I could 
have spent some time on the technical aspects of this. As you 
have probably gathered I do have some knowledge of nuclear 
energy production. Perhaps another day.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Iftody (Provencher, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak to Bill C-285 on behalf of the people of the 
Whiteshell facility in my riding of Provencher and to say that 
this bill would in effect eliminate Canada's nuclear industry.
<P>
	The government believes that to do so would be 
fundamentally wrong. Not only has the nuclear industry 
provided a good return for investment to Canadians, and I will 
get into that later, it has achieved international acclaim. That 
recognition includes the recent Nobel prize to Dr. Bert 
Brockhouse for pioneering scientific work carried out at the 
Chalk River laboratories of AECL.
<P>
	I would like to look at the myths and also address the facts of 
the Canadian nuclear industry. Nuclear energy supplies 15 per 
cent of Canada's nuclear electricity with a value of close to $4 
billion.
<P>
<B>(1905) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Kamloops stated earlier that the nuclear 
industry provides 4 per cent of Ontario's power. That is not true. 
The fact is the 22 reactors in Ontario provide 66 per cent of that 
power.
<P>
	Direct employment in the nuclear sector is estimated at 
30,000 jobs and at least 10,000 jobs in other sectors depend 
directly on the nuclear industry. Many of these jobs are highly 
skilled and knowledge based, the kind of jobs that are consistent 
and compatible with the new economy. They are the kind of jobs 
that we are trying to develop and encourage in Canada. Indeed in 
the last year we have created 437,000 of those kinds of jobs.
<P>
	More than 150 companies across six provinces supply 
manufacturing and engineering products or services. In addition 
to those that we directly subcontract to, there are another 400 or 
500 companies beyond that who subcontract to those 150 
companies.
<P>
	The recent sale of three Candus to Korea has generated more 
than $1 billion in Canadian content, providing some 25,000 
person-years of work over six years. The Korean Candu sale in 
1992 was Canada's largest export order. It is well known to most 
Canadians and certainly to all those interested in the nuclear 
industry of the Prime Minister's most successful and  recent trip 
to China where letters of undertaking were signed with the 
Chinese for two more reactors, estimated to bring back a total of 
$4 billion worth of investment in Canada.
<P>
	In 1991 the industry had a trade surplus of approximately 
$500 million and that trend continues. Ontario Hydro estimates 
that from 1965 to 1989 the nuclear industry saved the Canadian 
economy $17 billion in foreign exchange. Were we to have 
imported oil and coal, it would have cost the Canadian taxpayers 
another $17 billion, to say nothing about the points addressed by 
my hon. colleague from Renfrew about the acid rain emissions 
and other kinds of global warming effects that would inevitably 
occur from burning these other kinds of fuels. For each year of 
the 1990s foreign exchange savings will amount to about $1 
billion.
<P>
	The federal government has supported the development of 
Canada's nuclear energy capability. In the period between 1952 
and 1994 the nuclear industry contributed at least $23 billion to 
the gross domestic product. The federal government received 
$700 million annually from the nuclear industry in the form of 
income and sales taxes.
<P>
	I can tell you of a similar study to the one that Ernst &amp; 
Whinney completed for the Government of Canada done in 
Manitoba which demonstrates clearly that the investment that 
the government makes in the facility close to where I live 
generates $30 million of tax a year in the Manitoba economy 
alone.
<P>
	The private sector also benefits. In the four years between 
1988 and 1992 private sector companies that provide nuclear 
products and services had sales of almost $10 billion. The 
performance of the research reactors has been the envy of the 
world. The performance of the Candu reactor is second to none.
<P>
	Out of the 369 power reactors which provide significant 
amounts of electricity in 29 countries throughout the world there 
are four Candus in the top 10 in lifetime performance. As was 
pointed out earlier, the reactor at Point Lepreau, New Brunswick 
is number one. That is a formidable record.
<P>
	With the kind of high-tech job-creation initiative that is 
inherent in the nuclear industry why the member for Kamloops 
would want to oppose that kind of job creation and that kind of 
record for Canadians and Canadian researchers.
<P>
	Nuclear energy's contribution to electricity supply is not its 
only benefit to humankind. It also contributes to the quality of 
life. Its spinoff benefits to the environment and to medicine are 
equally significant. I refer to clause 5 of this bill where the 
member for Kamloops wants to keep isotope production but toss 
out everything else.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9644"> 9644 </A></B>
<P>
	Let me make a couple of other points about some of the more 
recent research and possibilities.
<P>
<B>(1910 ) </B>
<P>
	In the biotech area, for example, in terms of a radiation 
facility we can design new kinds of drugs. A nuclear capacity 
allows us to investigate small, molecular membrane interactions 
which will help in terms of the health care, the medical field and 
the life chances of Canadians who are unfortunate enough to 
have trouble with cancer or other kinds of illnesses. This is a 
record breaking and ground breaking kind of technology that is 
important to us all.
<P>
	The boron neutron capture therapy is another example. It is a 
new mode of radio therapy that combines tumour seeking 
components to destroy cancer cells and tumours. Is that wrong? 
Is that bad? Is that not a worthy undertaking for the Canadian 
economy? Is that not a legitimate expense for the Government of 
Canada?
<P>
	It was mentioned earlier by one of my colleagues that we have 
built in AECL through one of its spin-off companies over 1,300 
of the world's cobalt therapy machines. Each year 500 million 
people are treated for cancer through those 1,300 machines. Is 
that not a wonderful contribution and worth the effort of the 
Government of Canada to participate with our world neighbours 
in cancer treatment research? I think so.
<P>
	The nuclear industry is an important factor in the sustainable 
development equation. Nuclear electricity generation is clean, 
burning an abundant fuel and has no other practical uses. It does 
not emit the acid gases, as I referred to earlier, carbon dioxides 
and particulates associated with fossil fuels.
<P>
	Nuclear energy has been and continues to be a good 
investment for Canadians and for Canada. It plays an important 
role not only in providing clean electricity, but in the creation of 
jobs, revenues and in spin-off benefits that have improved the 
quality of life of Canadians and the people in other nations.
<P>
	We talked earlier about some of the financial aspects in the 
Ernst &amp; Whinney study which I think was important and timely 
in terms of allowing Parliament to tell Canadians what this kind 
of investment has meant over the past 30 years.
<P>
	As my hon. colleague from Renfrew pointed out earlier, 
surely I could go to any Canadian taxpayer or the the Canadian 
business person and say: ``For every dollar you give me, I 
promise you a 400 or 500 per cent return, a 4:1 or 5:1 ratio''. 
Surely that is a wise investment of Canadian tax dollars to bring 
those revenues back to the Government of Canada, to create jobs 
in Canada and to continue to place Canada and Canadians at the 
front of the Canadian nuclear industry.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wells:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
understand our time is up for debate on this issue. Unfortunately 
I am not going to get the opportunity to deliver the tremendous 
speech I had prepared for this time.
<P>
	I would like to go on record, with your permission, to advise 
the House that I was going to speak in favour of Bill C-285 and 
that I fully support the House referring this to the Standing 
Committee on Finance for-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> That is not a point of 
order, but I guess the member was able to get his view on the 
record.
<P>
	Under right of reply, the member for Kamloops. No one else 
will speak to the motion and this will close the debate in a 
maximum of two minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> Mr. Speaker, before I wrap up my comments, my 
hon. friend was obviously waiting for an opportunity to get in on 
the debate and I think has a speech with him. Would it be 
appropriate for the House to seek unanimous consent to have 
him table his speech as part of <I>Hansard</I>?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> Mr. Speaker, there has obviously been a difference 
of views presented here this afternoon. I respect the views of my 
colleagues, although they are perhaps not exactly the same as 
my own. Others are similar and supportive.
<P>
	I make two requests. The other day the minister announced 
that the government was to examine the whole nuclear industry 
and the support of that. The question was put to her at that time 
whether she would allow public input. At that point I think she 
mumbled a bit.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> She did not say she would. I say mumble because 
she made no commitment.
<P>
<B>(1915) </B>
<P>
	I would hope that after hearing the diverse views here she 
would say that legitimate views exist in the country and that she 
would agree to hold public hearings in all parts of the country to 
allow the public an opportunity to present its views.
<P>
	Just on the long shot that people are generous here tonight, 
would there be any inclination on the part of my hon. friends to 
provide unanimous consent to send this to committee for further 
consideration?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> There is no consent. The 
time provided for the consideration of Private Members' 
Business has now expired. Pursuant to Standing Order 96, the 
order is dropped from the Order Paper.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="IMMIGRATION">IMMIGRATION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
February 8, I put my main question to the Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration and a supplementary question to 
the Deputy Prime Minister regarding the deportation of 
Taramatie Ramsubhag and her three children, who are originally 
from Trinidad and Tobago.
<P>
	The minister then asked me to bring any new information to 
his attention so that he could review this case on the basis on 
humanitarian considerations, which I did on February 10, when I 
personally gave a document to the minister and his 
parliamentary secretary. Although Mrs. Ramsubhag and her 
three children had adapted well to Quebec society, they were all 
ruthlessly deported the same day.
<P>
	Furthermore, the minister rejected, without any sign of 
consideration or deference, a request by Quebec's Minister of 
International Relations, Cultural Communities and 
Immigration, Bernard Landry, to delay the deportation, to allow 
the Quebec government to consider issuing a certificate of 
selection.
<P>
	The minister and his government did not show any respect or 
consideration for the numerous women's rights organizations 
begging them to grant Mrs. Ramsubhag permanent resident 
status in Canada. These organizations include Assistance aux 
femmes de Montréal, the Canadian Advisory Council on the 
Status of Women, Vancouver Status of Women, the Ontario 
Association of Interval and Transition Houses, the CNTU's 
national committee on the status of women, the Quebec 
women's federation, etc.
<P>
	The minister showed an unacceptable insensitivity to this 
refugee claimant. Yet, he gave her aggressor and ex-husband a 
special permit allowing him to return to Canada. Is that the 
Liberal government policy on women who are victims of 
spousal abuse?
<P>
	Mrs. Ramsubhag does not have a criminal record. Canadians 
and Quebecers will never understand the policy applied by the 
minister in this case, nor why immigration officers had to use 
force to arrest three children aged 9, 11 and 13. Under the 
circumstances, arresting these children without a warrant 
amounts to kidnapping pure and simple. Mrs. Ramsubhag also 
had to pay $800 to have her case reviewed by the same officials 
who wanted to deport her.
<P>
	During the election campaign in September 1993, the Deputy 
Prime Minister promised that women who were victims of 
family violence and applied for refugee status would no longer 
be deported. However, so far at least two members of this group 
of women in Montreal have  already been deported. What about 
the Deputy Prime Minister's commitment to defending women's 
rights? That the Canadian government should take this kind of 
action is appalling, especially the immigration officers who 
arrested the three children. This attitude is in stark contrast with 
the open and generous approach taken by the Government of 
Quebec, which had applied for a stay of execution to consider 
the possibility of giving the Ramsubhag family a Quebec 
certificate of selection.
<P>
	I wish to commend the many womens' groups that sent letters 
to the minister, with copies to the critic for the Bloc Quebecois, 
as part of the campaign to defend the case of Mrs. Ramsubhag. I 
hope she will return to Canada, with her children, as a landed 
immigrant.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Canada is 
universally recognized as having one of the fairest and most 
generous refugee determination systems in the world.
<P>
	We were the first country to establish formal guidelines on 
gender persecution. It would not be, and the hon. member well 
knows this, appropriate to go into the details of an individual 
case on the floor of the House. However let me assure the hon. 
member that the application was reviewed in a most thorough 
and fair manner and the individual was found not to qualify as a 
refugee.
<P>
<B>(1920) </B>
<P>
	Similarly the case was reviewed in the light of our gender 
persecution guidelines three times and was examined for any 
special merit on humanitarian and compassionate grounds.
<P>
	As the results of all these reviews were negative, the 
individual was obliged to comply with the removal order. We 
carried out the deportation order to uphold the integrity of the 
immigration system as a whole. The person did not qualify as a 
refugee but she is welcome to apply to immigrate to Canada 
through the normal channels.
<P>
	I understand the Government of Quebec has shown interest in 
the case and under the Canada-Quebec agreement Quebec 
officials are welcome to facilitate her application for 
immigration to Canada for residence in the province of Quebec.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="VIOLENCEAGAINSTWOMEN">VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
December 6, the National Day of Remembrance and Action on 
Violence Against Women, I asked the Deputy Prime Minister 
whether her government was committed to ensuring the 
continuation of core funding for essential services that help 
prevent, treat and counsel against violence against women. The 
minister answered at that time that her government would 
respect its 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9646"> 9646 </A></B>
<P>
commitment to funding for women's shelters and other support 
services.
<P>
	However since that time the review by the Minister of Human 
Resources Development has taken place. We have heard a lot of 
prebudget comments being made. Indeed there are Liberal 
members of Parliament who are advocating that these services 
to women's groups be cut or reduced.
<P>
	As well, the federal government is considering combining 
transfers for social programs, health programs and 
post-secondary education to provinces and territories. One of 
the concerns in this regard of many groups across the country 
including myself is that it could break the social consensus that 
has been built in Canada. It has been one of the strengths of 
Canada that says that regardless of where one lives 
geographically and regardless of income there are certain 
standards of service that one gets as a right of a Canadian 
citizen.
<P>
	It is also my feeling that these proposals to do this transfer 
without national standards would in the end hurt women more 
than men. Single mothers could lose many of the supports they 
now have. We know that is the group with the largest number of 
unemployed.
<P>
	The Canadian Action Committee on the Status of Women 
estimate that violence against women adds at least $1 billion a 
year to the bill for health and related services in Canada. It is the 
time for zero tolerance of violence against women. Yet I do not 
see from the government or in the Deputy Prime Minister's 
response a true commitment in this regard.
<P>
	We have the Minister of Justice introducing gun control 
legislation that he says will make women safer because of the 
number of women who are victims of violence. Yet there is no 
proof the legislation he is proposing would do that.
<P>
	It seems hypocritical to me that there is one piece of 
legislation that we are told by the Minister of Justice will make 
women safer in their homes, again with no proof, and at the same 
time they are looking at either not funding at all or severely 
reducing funding for services that provide information, 
counselling and protection for women who have been victims of 
violence.
<P>
	I was quite interested in doing my research to come across a 
letter written in 1990 by the opposition at that time to a women's 
centre. It stated that core funding cutbacks, that is those 
proposed by the former Conservative government, would have a 
devastating impact on women seeking shelter from family 
violence. That letter, by the way, was written by the now 
Solicitor General.
<P>
	I want to ask again whether it is the policy of the government 
to have a real plan to combat violence against women or simply 
a public relations effort and whether in fact the government and 
the minister will be committed to having core funding for 
women's shelters to provide the services that help women who 
may be victims of violence.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have 
already demonstrated our commitment.
<P>
	In 1994-95 for the women's program of HRD Canada the 
contribution was $4 million in core funding to a broad 
cross-section of women's organizations across Canada which 
carry out a clearly defined program of activities related to the 
areas of economic equality, social justice and access and 
participation.
<P>
	In addition, the women's program and the disabled persons 
participation program of the same department are involved in 
the family violence initiative, providing approximately $5.5 
million for community based initiatives to raise awareness and 
promote institutional change.
<P>
	I remind the hon. member, and I know how very deep her 
commitment to this issue goes, that in the February 1994 budget, 
the women's program budget for group funding was spared from 
the 5 per cent across the board cuts made to other HRD 
programs. That is commitment.
<P>
	This government has also moved quickly toward prevention 
of violence against women. We have taken prompt action in 
several areas. The Minister of Justice today tabled gun control 
legislation. As well there are the amendments to the Criminal 
Code's peace bond provisions to be proclaimed into force on 
February 15, 1995. These amendments will provide increased 
protection to women and other victims of violence before the 
courts.
<P>
	That is commitment and it is a commitment we intend to carry 
on with.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38, the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
have been adopted.
<P>
	Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 
p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7.26 p.m.)
<P>
