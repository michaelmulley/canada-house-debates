	<B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Moose Jaw-Lake Centre, Ref.)</B> 
moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should immediately 
pursue negotiations with the provinces and agri-food industry in order to 
reassign jurisdictional responsibilities in agriculture and eliminate overlap and 
duplication.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, today I am pleased to introduce debate 
on this votable motion. In discussing this motion I would like to 
share with the House a proposal that I refer to as reconfederating 
agriculture.
<P>
	Today I will discuss the proposal in broad terms. Later in the 
debate I will suggest what the proposal means in practical detail 
about the policies, programs and budgets for governments, the 
agri-food industry and farmers.
<P>
	Let there be no doubt about it, there has to be and there will be 
significant change in the way we do agriculture in the future. I 
hope it will be change for the better and that we will have an 
agriculture sector that is more market oriented, knowledge 
based and more productive and efficient.
<P>
	I believe that we are at a time in our history when we must 
debate very basic ideas. We must ask ourselves, if we had to start 
all over again at square one knowing what we know now, what 
kind of agriculture sector would we design?
<P>
	Someone has said that the difficulty is not in developing new 
ideas but in escaping from old ones. For too long we have let 
past ideas about how things have been determine future courses 
of action. New ideas are important for progress.
<P>
	My motion is based on the premise that it is time to examine 
not only how government works but also what government does. 
At the end of this millennium our priority task is to determine 
areas where government should be involved and play a role and 
then seek to improve performance in those areas. In other words, 
we must be effective and do the right things and then we must be 
efficient and do the things right.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	My proposal today builds on statements and ideas put forward 
in this House by my colleagues beginning in May of 1994. It also 
reflects the ideas which are being generated by many farmers, 
academics and farm leaders across the country. There is a real 
momentum building to radically alter and redesign how 
governments and industry function together in agriculture, in 
other natural resource sectors and in many other sectors of our 
society. This is an issue on which people are ahead of the 
governments in their thinking, in their ideas and in their 
proposals. It is time to bring those ideas and proposals to the 
legislative table, to look at them honestly and openly, to have the 
debate and discussion needed and to move forward. I am not 
suggesting what I will share today is the first or final word but it 
is a starting point for discussion and dialogue.
<P>
	I want to ask three basic questions about agriculture in Canada 
in my remarks today. One, what does it mean to reconfederate 
agriculture and why do we need to do it now? Two, what should 
governments do in agriculture? Three, what should the 
agri-food industry do?
<P>
	In answering the question of what it means to reconfederate 
agriculture and why we need to do it now, we are talking about 
outlining a more effective and efficient division of 
responsibilities between the federal government, the provincial 
governments and the agri-food industry.
<P>
	The federal and provincial governments are both heavily 
involved in supporting the agri-food industry through 
expenditures. Because of the concurrent jurisdiction under the 
constitutions of the two levels of government, both federal and 
provincial resources tend to be allocated to similar activities. 
This is the basic reason for overlaps, duplications, excessive red 
tape and costly bureaucracies. Complicated regulations are 
confusing and intimidating for many farmers and processors. 
Confusion creates frustration and mistrust between 
governments and industry.
<P>
	By way of current illustration of government involvement, in 
1994-95 the 10 Canadian provinces will spend a total of almost 
$2.2 billion of taxpayers' money in support of agriculture. The 
federal government will kick in an additional $2.2 billion with 
the 10 provinces for a total of $4.4 billion. The 10 provinces had 
just over 10,000 agriculture civil servants employed in their 
agriculture departments this year, as well as the federal govern-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9500"> 9500 </A></B>
<P>
ment in its department, for a total of over 20,000  full time 
equivalent people on the public payroll in support of the private 
sector agriculture and agri-food industry. This translates into 
one agriculture civil servant for every 14 farms in Canada, or 
one person on the public payroll for every 19 farm operators.
<P>
	We must examine the effectiveness and efficiency of these 
manpower and financial expenditures and what the return on 
investment is. For example, I have examined each province's 
current share of agricultural gross domestic product with the 
public dollars which are being spent supporting the agricultural 
industry in that particular province. This allows us to see how 
many public dollars are spent for each 1 per cent of the 
province's agriculture GDP share. Expressed another way, it 
shows how effective the agriculture industry is in a particular 
province by taking that public dollar and multiplying it into a 
share of GDP.
<P>
	I have also compared the number of agricultural civil servants 
in each province with the number of farms and farm operators in 
that province. I have also compared the departmental 
organizations of each province with each other and with the 
federal department of agriculture.
<P>
	The purpose of these comparisons is to see how we might be 
more effective and efficient. By honestly looking at these things 
we can learn from each other and get agriculture done smarter 
and cheaper. It is time to get past the political turf wars. We must 
address the spending of our governments in a co-operative and 
bold way with the vision of a new way of doing agriculture. The 
legal advice that I have received is that we do not need to open 
the Constitution. All we need to do is develop a shared vision 
and the political will.
<P>
	I realize that we cannot just analyse organizational and 
economic facts and figures. Each province also has unique 
natural endowments such as climatic conditions, proximities to 
markets and the selling power of products.
<P>
<B>(1110 ) </B>
<P>
	It is mother nature who is not bound by geopolitical borders 
that determine farming activity, productivity and policy. 
Nevertheless, a comparison of the factors I have suggested can 
be helpful in determining how to do agriculture better.
<P>
	Reconfederating agriculture means that we will develop a 
system of government in which more decisions are made at the 
local levels and at the farm gate. It means the devolution of some 
federal government responsibilities to the provincial and local 
levels, to the agriculture industry and to the farmer.
<P>
	Why to we need to do it now? For the first time in a long time 
good economics and good politics are converging. We now live 
in a global trading environment made accessible by our market 
oriented, knowledge based, technologically equipped farming 
industry.
<P>
	Developing a new system such as this does not mean an 
absolutely watertight allocation of responsibilities among 
players. We must try to reconcile competing tendencies. For 
example, there is a need to be global in outlook but local in 
application, to be small and big, to be centralized and 
decentralized, and to be capable of generating both economic 
freedom and justice for all the players. This process of 
reconfederating agriculture will therefore be an ongoing process 
of learning.
<P>
	This leads to the second question. What should governments 
do in agriculture? I begin by reiterating what my colleagues and 
I have said previously in this House when we have proposed a 
clearer division of jurisdictions between the federal and 
provincial governments. It is my thinking that the jurisdiction of 
the provincial governments be in the physical and human 
resource areas. This is because those are the elements that are 
most unique to each province or region and are most manageable 
by them.
<P>
	I have then proposed that the responsibility of the federal 
government be in one, trade policy and trade distortion 
adjustment support; two, whole farm income stabilization 
programs; three, health and safety standards; four, 
macrophysical, monetary and taxation policy.
<P>
	These responsibilities reflect the true nature of the federal 
government. They assist lower levels of government by taking 
responsibility for those elements that span provincial 
boundaries and are common to all farmers and concern the 
whole farming industry right across the country.
<P>
	We propose that the federal and provincial governments have 
more distinct areas of jurisdiction. This will result in public cost 
savings by reducing overlap and duplication. It will result in 
industry expansion and competitiveness by reducing the 
regulatory and tax burden.
<P>
	Proposing this clear division of responsibilities between 
levels of government as well as between the public and private 
sectors is based on some basic assumptions about what 
government should do in agriculture.
<P>
	I want to now briefly discuss six functions that government 
can most appropriately perform in support of agriculture or, for 
that matter, in support of other industries in the private sector. 
The first is research and development, an information sharing 
function. The purpose of basic research is to ensure we have a 
thing of value before we attempt to add value to it. This is often 
also called precommercial research and is thus usually done by 
the public sector.
<P>
	Basic research deals with Canada's physical resources. 
Canada's agriculture industry is oriented on an east-west basis 
and covers three distinct climatic zones. The provinces that span 
this east-west orientation are thus blessed with different 
physical 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9501"> 9501 </A></B>
<P>
resources. This is why I argue that the provinces should be more 
directly responsible for the physical resources of our country.
<P>
	In pre-commercial basic research and development the 
provinces should work jointly with the federal government. This 
is where major public dollars should be spent. All the 
intellectual resources of our country should be harnessed 
together for pre-commercial R and D. Both government 
partners would also have a role in the sharing of information 
about the resources.
<P>
	Second, governments have a limited commercial function. I 
assert that if we expect governments to maximize their 
pre-commercial activity we should also expect them to 
minimize their commercial functions.
<P>
	A limited commercial function for governments means that 
they should provide a good or service that is normally not 
capturable by the private sector. These are called public goods 
or services. Their nature is that they are non-rival and 
non-excludable and thus not capturable for commercial 
purposes. Usually an entity like government is needed to 
identify the demand for these public goods and services, make 
arrangements for their provision and impose a payment on their 
beneficiaries.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	This matter of the appropriate commercial function for 
government is one of the most salient and important discussions 
taking place today in countries and economies right around the 
world.
<P>
	Many are saying that the obligation to provide a particular 
good or service should be assigned to the public or private sector 
based on this differentiation between non-commercial and 
commercial interests. Debate about which sector should provide 
the good or service should focus on the complementarity that 
each sector can bring to the society. The operative word is not 
compete but complete.
<P>
	The choice between private and public sectors should not be 
one of politics but a seeking of balance, cost effectiveness and 
efficiency. Government should clearly invest mostly in the 
pre-commercial and non-commercial provision of public goods 
and services.
<P>
	The third function that governments have is a regulatory role. 
All levels of government are needed to provide an appropriate 
and acceptable minimum level of regulatory policy upon the 
private sector. They should regulate in their separate areas of 
jurisdiction so as to minimize overlap and duplication.
<P>
	One of the immediate improvements we could make in 
agriculture is to take all legislation that affects the industry 
directly and indirectly both federally and provincially, rewrite it 
in simple terms under one set of guidelines and administer it 
through a highly trained, effective single system of regulation 
throughout the industry.
<P>
	I want to emphasize minimum level of regulatory burden. 
Farmers and agricultural players up and down the food chain 
want governments off their backs as much as possible.
<P>
	The fourth function that governments perform is service. 
Service to the agri-food industry and general public is the sole 
reason for the governmental departments of agriculture and 
agri-food. The system of government should be of the people, 
by the people and for the people. Government is simply the 
chosen way that citizens have determined to manage their 
collective affairs.
<P>
	The services provided by governments can be varied, however 
the basic role of government is to facilitate the private sector. In 
recent times this has come to be known as third party 
government, that is, an effort by elected representatives to raise 
resources and set social priorities through a democratic political 
process while leaving the private sector to do what it does best: 
organize for the production of goods and services.
<P>
	It is not government's obligation to provide all services but 
rather to see that they are provided. To provide their service, 
governments have a taxation role, a corporate organizational 
role, and a spending role.
<P>
	Governments should establish as low a level of taxation 
regime as possible. Taxation policies should not create 
dependency on the public sector but rather facilitate private 
sector entrepreneurs. Tax policy should ease the 
intergenerational transfer of assets. Tax money should be used 
primarily as investments in pre-commercial productivity and 
marketing enhancing programs like research and development 
and physical infrastructure.
<P>
	In providing their services governments must efficiently and 
effectively organize themselves. There is lots of room for 
improvement in that area. The spending of public funds must be 
done effectively and efficiently. Public servants are stewards of 
funds entrusted to them by private citizens.
<P>
	It is absolutely essential that taxation, spending and 
regulatory policy be set democratically, be clear and simple and 
be fair and equal for all the players. Governments should 
develop a taxation, spending and regulatory climate in which a 
free market system can flourish with justice. Governments 
should act as the referee who adjudicates a fair set of rules 
binding upon all.
<P>
	The fifth function that governments have is a mediation role. 
Democratic governments are needed to mediate and attempt to 
reconcile specialized and sometimes competing interests among 
the sector players.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9502"> 9502 </A></B>
<P>
	Sixth and finally, governments have an education and 
training function which I have already indicated is most 
appropriately handled by the provinces.
<P>
	These then are some proposals about what governments 
should do in agriculture.
<P>
	Finally, the third question I ask is: What should the agri-food 
industry do? I reiterate that we are proposing a clearer division 
of responsibility for the agri-food industry than what exists 
now. Government is too involved in the commercial business 
aspects of agriculture.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	The basic responsibility of private industry stakeholders is to 
supply the demand for private goods. The industry has a 
commercial interest in providing a private good or service for 
exchange and profit. The entire life cycle of a private good or 
service from its envisagement through its development to its 
sale provides opportunities during which and from which 
financial benefit can occur to the provider of that good or 
service.
<P>
	The vast majority of these private sector responsibilities and 
decisions should be made by the industry with minimum 
involvement by the government. At the commercial research 
and development stage private industry could profitably 
research and develop all material and non-material goods and 
services related to agriculture, including foods, animals, plants, 
genetics, biotechnologies, non-food products, machinery, 
equipment, and climate and weather forecasting, et cetera.
<P>
	At the production stage private industry could profitably 
provide for the acquisition, preparation, planting, feeding, 
controlling and harvesting of livestock, plants and lands. This 
includes value-added initiatives.
<P>
	At the processing stage the private industry could manage all 
matters related to goods or service, storage, inspection, grading, 
packing, assembly, pricing, marking and labelling.
<P>
	At the transportation stage the private sector can profitably 
provide for the orderly process of an agri-food good or service 
from farm or processing gate to point of sale or export.
<P>
	At the marketing stage the private sector can profitably 
provide for the advertising, promoting and selling of an 
agri-food good or service. This includes the concept of 
individual and/or group marketing.
<P>
	Last, farm financing and insurance could profitably be done 
by the private sector. This includes all matters relating to 
securing, managing and the accounting of funds needed for the 
agri-food good or service life cycle and the ensuring of the 
material assets of the farm, including crops and livestock in the 
food processing industry.
<P>
	There may be small niche roles for public financial services. 
However, the vast majority of these private sector, 
commercially profitable responsibilities should be handled by 
the private sector with minimal involvement by the government.
<P>
	As I mentioned, later in the debate I will propose how we need 
to transfer specific policies, programs and involvements that 
governments now have to the industry.
<P>
	The private sector is better suited to performing the six 
business functions than government is. These functions include 
the commercial function which is the provision of goods and 
services that are capturable by an entrepreneur and can provide 
him or her with the profit upon provision and sale. In other 
words, we want to have a free and just market system. This again 
is one of the most salient issues occupying the attention of 
economists and politicians around the world today.
<P>
	That is why my colleagues and I insist on the importance of 
direct farmer and businessman involvement in developing 
agricultural policy. We must work from the bottom to the top. 
Business and governments alike are realizing that the more 
democratic they are, the more economically and socially 
successful they are.
<P>
	Industry stakeholders should be able to democratically 
organize, carry out their activities-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Recognizing that the 
mover of this bill has 20 minutes, I am under the impression that 
the member for Moose Jaw-Lake Centre might require a few 
additional minutes to conclude his intervention. I wonder if 
there might be consent to allow the member for Moose 
Jaw-Lake Centre to conclude his remarks?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kerpan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that support from my 
colleagues.
<P>
	I want to conclude at this point. Certainly in the next two or 
three hours I will have the opportunity to go into much more 
detail than I have done.
<P>
	I began by saying it is time to reconfederate agriculture in 
Canada. The time is right and the need is now. I have suggested 
that we cannot just tinker with policies here and there. There 
must be a whole new way of doing agriculture based on more 
distinct and co-operative roles for both levels of government, as 
much as possible separate from each other and separate from the 
private sector industry. These suggestions are based on sound 
economic, organizational and democratic principles.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	The first act our Fathers of Confederation passed some 125 
years ago was the Agriculture Act of 1868. At the end of this 
century perhaps we as parliamentarians could have the foresight 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9503"> 9503 </A></B>
<P>
and vision our predecessors had, the boldness, the courage, the 
openness and the good will to develop a new vision of 
responsibilities for agriculture.
<P>
	I have sketched out a modest proposal. However, I would urge 
that we all look at this matter seriously and that we see how we 
can work smarter and cheaper and that we continue to provide 
Canadians and people around the world with the highest quality 
agriculture products possible.
<P>
	I look forward to discussions with all my colleagues and for 
the House to vote in favour of this motion. More than that, I hope 
that serious dialogue will begin immediately with the provinces 
and the industry.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I would 
like to thank the hon. member for Moose Jaw-Lake Centre for 
giving me and my colleagues in the next hours of debate on this 
motion the opportunity to tell the House how the government 
has been working with the provinces and the industry to advance 
agriculture and the agri-food sector.
<P>
	I appreciate his concern for the viability of this important 
sector of our economy, one that employs 1.8 million Canadians 
and 15 per cent of our Canadian workforce. It is a concern I 
share, a concern the minister shares, and a concern our 
government and all of us on this side of the House share.
<P>
	We also share his concern about overlap and duplication, not 
just in agriculture and agri-food but in all areas. That is why the 
government has launched a process to improve the efficiency of 
the federation.
<P>
	The hon. member will be pleased to know that the objectives 
and the successes of this process are certainly ones that have 
gone unmatched before. The objectives and the successes are in 
these areas: to reduce overlap and duplication, as the hon. 
member is pointing out; to improve effectiveness of programs 
through federal-provincial co-operation; to reduce 
administrative costs through streamlined program 
arrangements; and to improve client services so that all 
Canadians receive the best service possible as efficiently and as 
effectively as we can possibly deliver to them.
<P>
	In agriculture and agri-food this process is resulting in a 
number of important activities. All of us know the first major 
issue this government had to deal with after taking office 
somewhat over a year ago was the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade, or GATT.
<P>
	I am pleased to say I was able to join the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food in those last few days in Geneva. We 
returned from Geneva in December 1993 with the new 
agreement. Before we arrived back in Canada the minister had 
invited all of the provincial ministers of agriculture and 
agri-food to Ottawa for a meeting which took place less than 24 
hours after we returned. This meeting was held to discuss the 
implications and to plan together how we could and would meet 
those obligations.
<P>
	As a result of that meeting I was asked to head a 
federal-provincial task force on orderly marketing which 
reported to the ministers during the middle of last year and again 
in December 1994. As a result of everyone pulling together to 
get the job done, our supply managed sectors are moving 
forward to meet the challenges of the new trade regime. That job 
is not yet complete but again I want to thank everyone, every 
stakeholder in the industry, who got together around the same 
table to talk about how we can all go forward to strengthen and 
encourage the supply managed sectors in Canada.
<P>
	The new GATT also brings the opportunity for us to take 
advantage of the new trading rules to expand our markets and 
especially to broaden our horizon beyond the United States.
<P>
	Last July federal and provincial ministers of agriculture 
reaffirmed their commitment to work to see the Canadian 
agri-food exports reach $20 billion per year by the year 2000. 
They added a further target in a further challenge which is to 
regain Canada's traditional 3.5 per cent share of the global 
agri-food trade. When we put that challenge forward that goal 
moves on from $20 billion per year to $23 billion per year. With 
the advances made the last number of months, everyone is 
becoming more and more confident that we can meet and 
hopefully beat the $23 billion target.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	The Federal-Provincial Market Development Council has 
developed a comprehensive work plan to accomplish these goals 
and both levels of government are working actively and 
effectively to eliminate overlap and duplication. The provinces 
and the federal government are also co-operating to develop a 
single window point of access for federal and provincial 
marketing programs.
<P>
	Another area where we are making progress and reducing 
duplication is in the provision of financial services to the 
agri-food community. We know this is very important. 
Agriculture is an industry that takes a tremendous amount of 
capital. We must assist primary producers in all sectors to put 
their business plans together so they can be successful.
<P>
	The Farm Credit Corporation and interested provinces are 
discussing strategies to reduce duplication of government 
services. As part of this process the Farm Credit Corporation has 
acquired the New Brunswick Agriculture Development Board's 
$37.4 million portfolio. In addition a Canada-Alberta pilot 
project was launched last June to combine the lending services 
of the Farm Credit Corporation and the Alberta Finance Services 
Corporation into a single delivery point. Needless to say, that 
makes a lot of sense. We are continuing to hold discussions with 
other provinces to improve efficiencies in this area.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9504"> 9504 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to make it clear that this is simply not a 
government to government process. The examples I have used 
so far have been primarily that. Agriculture and Agri-Food 
Canada is working closely with the private sector and the 
universities on research. Last year the department ran a pilot 
project called the matching investment initiative, matching 
dollar for dollar the money industry was willing to put up for 
research and research projects. The department and the private 
sector have been doing this in a collaborative way for a number 
of years with great success.
<P>
	There are some other areas where that co-operation is 
working very well. We have safety nets, the Canada food 
inspection system. I could go on but I will leave those examples 
and a few more words to some of my colleagues who will be 
taking part in the debate as time goes on.
<P>
	These two initiatives are significant achievements in that they 
show federal, provincial and even municipal co-operation to 
reduce overlap and duplication and to improve service.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to again point out to everyone that 
agriculture is a shared jurisdiction between the federal 
government and the provincial governments under the 
Constitution. This has meant that the two levels of government 
have had to work together since Confederation, which is 127 
years ago.
<P>
	In recent years federal and provincial governments have 
focused on working together to make the management of this 
shared jurisdiction as effective as possible. A report prepared 
for and by the Government of Quebec last year showed that the 
two levels of government work well together and that the 
overlap and duplication is minimal. The report put the cost of 
overlap and duplication at 1 per cent of combined federal and 
provincial spending in agriculture in the province of Quebec. 
That is not very much.
<P>
	However, I would be the first to agree that is probably 1 per 
cent too much. We will continue to work constantly in 
co-operation with all provinces and with the industry to ensure 
that the Canadian public gets the maximum value for its tax 
dollars.
<P>
	In order to keep within my allotted time, I have had to reduce 
the number of examples I could use. However, I know that my 
colleagues will express more of those as we go on in the debate. 
We look forward to comments from everyone and suggestions as 
to where we can continue to make improvements.
<P>
	The facts presented here today should show clearly that if we 
were to adopt the hon. member's motion to ``immediately 
pursue negotiations with the provinces and agri-food industry to 
eliminate overlap and duplication'', we would be reinventing 
the wheel. We are all doing that at the present time. I appreciate 
the emphasis and the encouragement he has given. On behalf of 
the government I can assure him that we will continue to move 
in that direction and make the federal role with  our colleagues 
in the provinces, industry and universities even more effective 
than it is at the present time.

	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, before I 
start, I would ask for your consent and that of the House. I have a 
20-minute speech and I will be the only speaker during the 
three-hour debate today. Therefore, I ask for unanimous consent 
to deliver my speech in full.
<P>

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Our colleague from 
Lotbinière has explained to us his predicament. He wishes his 
intervention to be of 20 minutes' duration, which is twice as 
long as usual.
<P>
	He gives his assurance to the House, and as the presiding 
officer I take the undertaking from the hon. member for 
Lotbinière that no other member of the Bloc Quebecois will 
speak on this bill during its duration, which is three hours.
<P>
	The hon. member for Lotbinière is asking, as the only 
spokesperson from the Bloc Quebecois on this bill, that he be 
allowed to speak for 20 minutes. He assures us he will be the 
only member from the Bloc Quebecois to speak on this bill.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Landry:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker and all members of this 
House. I am pleased to rise today to speak to Motion M-314 put 
forward by the Reform Party. Allow me to read the motion in 
question:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should immediately 
pursue negotiations with the provinces and agri-food industry in order to 
re-assign jurisdictional responsibilities in agriculture and eliminate overlap 
and duplication.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	There is no need to reiterate my party's position regarding 
overlap. It goes without saying that the Bloc Quebecois has been 
fighting against all these unnecessary and, above all, extremely 
costly cases of overlap since its arrival in this House. That is 
why the motion put forward by my Reform colleague is quite 
acceptable and even desirable.
<P>
	Yet, common sense seems in short supply in this government. 
We find ourselves repeating over and over again why it is 
essential to eliminate overlap between Ottawa and the prov-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9505"> 9505 </A></B>
<P>
inces. The Minister of Finance should listen to us instead of 
going after the most disadvantaged and the middle class when he 
tables the budget in a few days. It is never too late to make 
amends.
<P>
	In agriculture as in all other sectors, the federal government's 
presence in areas of shared jurisdiction creates unnecessary and 
costly overlap, as I was saying a moment ago, not only in terms 
of administrative costs but also in terms of duplication of 
policies, which often compete with or contradict each other. 
This, in turn, reduces the effectiveness of government measures. 
Measures adopted by two different levels of government 
regularly cancel each other out. Each level wants its priorities 
and objectives to prevail, and the tugging back and forth is 
endless as neither will let go.
<P>
	But Quebec has been asking for years for control, not only 
over agriculture, but also over regional development, natural 
resources, manpower training and so on. There are also 
problems in areas other than areas of shared jurisdiction. The 
federal government does not respect the provinces' exclusive 
jurisdiction over areas of provincial jurisdiction, and never did.
<P>
	The Reform member's motion is relevant, but does he realize 
that the federal government has always been, and continues to 
be, centralizing? Quebec knows that this government turns a 
deaf ear to even the most sensible suggestions when it comes to 
decentralizing powers to the provinces. Let us be wary of 
transfers of administrative responsibilities in lieu of 
jurisdictions. With the former, the provinces are at the mercy of 
the federal government which can, at any given time, cut budget 
allocations. In the present situation, the Liberals are likely to 
suggest such transfers, when we know full well that it is just 
passing the buck to the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	The provinces are asking for responsibility, of course, but 
also for the income tax points that come with it. We know that 
the so-called flexibility of the federal government is nothing but 
a sham, an empty word that the big guns of federalism use to 
deceive us once again.
<P>
	Only by becoming sovereign can Quebec exercise any real 
control over its socio-economic development. So, when I say 
that we support the motion, this means that we realize that the 
federal government never paid any attention to this.
<P>
	The federal-provincial division of powers issue will become 
irrelevant once Quebec has achieved sovereignty. However, you 
will agree that, for some provinces, including Quebec, a federal 
Department of Agriculture and Agri-food is more of a burden 
than a benefit.
<P>
	In Quebec we have two departments of agriculture, each with 
its own farm income stabilization scheme; we have federal and 
provincial involvement in marketing board systems; and we 
have two levels of government involved in agricultural research 
and farm credit. The result? The kind of overlap that causes 
constant fiction between both levels of government, with federal 
decisions being made at the expense of Quebec, and that 
generates major costs in the agriculture and agri-food sector, a 
sector that has to live with two regulatory levels and meet  the 
requirements of programs that do not reflect the same policies.
<P>
	To support this motion means putting an end to the friction 
caused by unclear jurisdictional divisions. For years, Quebec 
has received from Ottawa only half or as little as one third of 
federal taxes earmarked for the agricultural sector.
<P>
	The several hundred million dollars foregone annually could 
be used to create jobs in an industry that is responsible for 11 per 
cent of total employment in Quebec. In 1993, Quebec received 
$372 million of the $3 billion budget of the Department of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, a meagre 12.4 per cent, and this was 
better than usual.
<P>
	Between 1986-87 and 1991-92, Quebec's share was 8.3 per 
cent, according to Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. 
Interestingly, Quebec's revenues in the agricultural sector 
represented 16 per cent of total Canadian revenues in this sector. 
Furthermore, in terms of added value, the Quebec food industry 
represents 25.4 per cent of the Canadian food industry, 
according to Statistics Canada.
<P>
	The following is an example of the utter confusion caused by 
the involvement of two levels of government in health standards 
and meat inspection. At the present time, at least three 
inspectors visit farms to get exactly the same information, 
which is then transferred to Health Canada, to Agriculture and 
Agri-Food and to the Quebec Department of Agriculture, 
respectively.
<P>
	The federal government spends $275 million each year on 
inspection and regulatory procedures, in an area that is covered 
almost identically by the Government of Quebec. For Quebec, 
this outright duplication means an annual loss of $64 million.
<P>
	If the provinces were given jurisdiction over agriculture and 
agri-food, Quebec could stop subsidizing the central 
government, whose policies are based on the needs of the west, 
as we have repeatedly pointed out in the House. These policies 
are based on the needs of a grain export industry, whereas 
Quebec's supply management policies are designed to support 
the livestock industry. One advantage for us would be not having 
to invest so much energy in Ottawa any more to establish the 
legitimacy of our own programs.
<P>
	At this point, the short sighted view of the federal government 
would indicate dark days ahead for agriculture. We remain at the 
mercy of Ottawa's unilateral cuts. The upcoming budget 
provides for major cuts to the Department of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, cuts that are likely to affect service to the industry 
and to the public.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9506"> 9506 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	These cuts are the result of Ottawa's wastage of public funds. 
This is what happens when unnecessary overlap continues 
unchecked.
<P>
	It would be appropriate to recall here the position taken by the 
Union des producteurs agricoles du Québec in its brief to the 
Bélanger-Campeau commission in December 1990. It stated 
that, in the area of agriculture, Quebec wanted to take its 
legitimate share of federal funds and invest it according to its 
own priorities, policies and programs. It wanted to continue to 
develop agriculture in the province with the federal funds 
granted to it on the basis of the four forms of support to 
agriculture: supply management, income stabilization, farm 
credit and crop insurance. Each time, energy was wasted in 
confrontations, for the most part to no avail, trying to assert its 
point of view on this matter.
<P>
	Obviously, Quebec is entirely prepared to assume its 
responsibilities in respect of agriculture and agri-food. We have 
all the tools to develop our industry and a strategy to do so. I 
myself have described this strategy to the House on more than 
one occasion. I would like to review its main points.
<P>
	The stakeholders and parties in Quebec interested in regional 
development and agri-food matters met in February 1991 in 
Montreal and decreed that the community should take charge of 
its own future. The following objectives were identified during 
these rural estates general: respecting and promoting regional 
and local values; dialogue with regional and local partners; 
protecting and renewing resources; redistributing political 
power from the top down.
<P>
	Thus round tables on the food sector were established in 
Quebec. During the conference in Trois-Rivières in June 1992, 
they came to an agreement on the main areas to be emphasized to 
ensure development of the agri-food sector in Quebec. These 
included, in particular, recognizing, developing and supporting 
human resources training; ensuring continuity, development 
and growth in agri-food companies; readjusting current income 
security programs on the basis of production costs; developing 
income security programs consistent with the rules of 
international trade; promoting funding for agricultural 
businesses and their transfer without incurring massive debt; 
providing for support for non-viable businesses likely to be 
reorganized within the sector and providing assistance to 
persons getting out of the agricultural business. Stakeholders in 
the Quebec agricultural community have taken measures to 
control decision-making in their area.
<P>
	All the while, the federal government is gearing its 
agricultural policy to the needs of farmers out west. The 
agricultural bills that have been introduced in the House over the 
past year all dealt with the grain sector. In addition to Bill C-61, 
there has been Bill C-49 to amend the Department of 
Agriculture, Bill C-50 on the  Canadian Wheat Board, Bill C-51 
on Canadian grain and, now, Bill C-66 on western grain 
transportation.
<P>
	Yes, Quebec is ready to assume full responsibility for its 
agricultural and agri-food sectors, but we need adequate 
financing, which we can only get by recovering our share of 
taxes earmarked for those sectors.
<P>
	If by some miracle the federal government should adopt the 
motion and agree to transfer jurisdiction over agriculture and 
agri-food to provinces that want it, the provinces will have to be 
involved throughout the process. Therefore, the governments 
which will assume responsibility for the jurisdiction will have to 
be included in discussions on the transfer of responsibilities and 
in negotiations with the industry.
<P>
	We must be on guard: the federal government cannot enter 
unilaterally into negotiations with the industry to make major 
changes in responsibilities between it and the industry while it is 
in the process of transferring jurisdiction to the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	And the government should make no mistake: we are not 
talking about a transfer of responsibilities, but of jurisdiction. 
We will not be dumped on. In the case of agriculture, the power 
will be strictly provincial when administered by the provinces.
<P>
	In Quebec, we know from our experience with fisheries that a 
transfer of responsibility can be unilaterally cancelled by 
Ottawa. We must avoid, at all costs, repeating this catastrophe in 
the agricultural sector.
<P>
	Thus, we say yes to the motion. We would also like to say that 
we, the Bloc Quebecois, are able to say yes to any motion that is 
good, whether proposed by a Reformer, a Liberal or a 
Conservative. Yes to a transfer of jurisdiction, but no to 
transferring responsibility without transferring tax points.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I know there were some 
discussions with the Chair as to who would speak next. During 
private members' hour the Chair has a great deal more 
flexibility in terms of recognizing members alternating from the 
government to opposition parties.
<P>
	In this instance, just to make sure I sustain debate, I wanted to 
be assured whether the member for Lotbinière was going to be 
speaking for or against the motion. Having spoken for the 
motion, I will now go to a speaker who I suspect will be against 
the motion. I should not assume that; in private members' hour it 
is a free-for-all.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gary Pillitteri (Niagara Falls, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member for Prince Edward-Hastings has already referred 
to the work the government has done with the provinces and 
industry to develop a whole new farm safety net program.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9507"> 9507 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to elaborate. The problem that had to be resolved 
in this process was to design a national whole farm safety net 
program that would still meet the specific needs of each 
province.
<P>
	In December 1994 federal and provincial ministers received 
the final report of the national safety net consulting committee. 
A consensus was reached consistent with the recommendations 
of the committee. The farm income protection policy centred on 
three key elements: crop insurance, a national farm income 
program, and specific companion programs.
<P>
	The new whole farm program will be built on the existing net 
income stabilization account, NISA. A number of changes will 
be reviewed with the industry to make the program trade neutral 
and cost effective. Companion programs would derive support 
tailored at provincial levels to allow for flexibility to meet 
specific provincial circumstances.
<P>
	What is most important in this consensus is that the provinces 
will be able through the companion programs to identify where 
they want to spend their money in co-operation with the federal 
government.
<P>
	Currently provincial and federal officials are completing the 
necessary details for a multilateral memorandum of 
understanding. The policy is based on a 60 per cent federal and 
40 per cent provincial cost sharing arrangements, monitoring 
and management process. Once it is completed we will develop 
federal-provincial bilateral arrangements with each province to 
allow for specific companion programs.
<P>
	What I have just outlined is but one example of how federal 
and provincial governments are continuing to work together to 
reduce overlap and duplication. In view of the work that is being 
done, I urge my hon. colleagues to reject Motion No. 314.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak on the private member's motion of the member for Moose 
Jaw-Lake Centre on jurisdictional responsibilities in 
agriculture. The motion encourages a complete rethinking of the 
role and scope of governmental involvement in the agricultural 
industry.
<P>
	Like most farmers everywhere in Canada I believe 
agricultural support is not always delivered in a way that is 
beneficial to farmers. Taxpayers are consumers. Some of the 
activities performed by both federal and provincial 
governments are duplicated, counterproductive or even working 
at cross purposes. It is high time a thorough overhaul of the 
system was done.
<P>
	Within my province of Alberta many federal programs and 
provincial programs are in place. Therefore the case for 
consolidation is clear. What started out as a way of helping 
farmers through the rough times has grown into a top heavy 
bureaucracy that needs to be pared. As a result of the growth of 
the department there is now one agricultural bureaucrat for 
every 14 farmers, which ratio  is unsustainable in the long term. 
We owe it to both farmers and the public service to design a 
stable and sustainable system.
<P>
	The overlap and duplication in the system make clear the case 
for consolidation. There are two forces pushing on the farm 
industry providing the impetus for making changes now. They 
are trade agreements with our international partners and the 
country's fiscal situation. However the most important reason 
for making the kinds of reforms the motion proposes is that 
farmers will receive better service from the government. It will 
cost less and we will all be far better off as a result.
<P>
	It is important to remember that the well-being of the farming 
community is at the heart of why we have agricultural support 
programs. They are not make work programs for public servants 
or regional development initiatives or even ways of competing 
with trading partners. It is vital we keep the welfare of the farm 
and the farm family at the centre of our focus.
<P>
	The recent trade agreements we have entered into with other 
nations, such as NAFTA, GATT and the World Trade 
Organization, have created a set of international subsidy and 
transportation rules to which we are a signatory. It has become 
clear to us that many of our current programs will have to be 
altered dramatically to comply with international trade rules. 
Being as we have to change our programs anyway to fit the new 
world trading system, it makes sense to take this opportunity to 
overhaul our approach to agriculture.
<P>
	Another reason for systemic reform as I mentioned earlier is 
that our national finances are in a mess. We all know that. The 
cost of administering these programs, hundreds of them from 
coast to coast, is unsustainable even in the short term.
<P>
	Farmers are not seeing any benefit from much of the moneys 
spent by the ministry of agriculture because far too much of it is 
spent on administration. Taxpayers are growing weary of paying 
more and more for less and less. The time for revolt is coming 
close. We hear about it in the papers every day: a tax revolt here 
or a tax revolt in Toronto. All across Ontario, Saskatchewan, 
Manitoba and Alberta, everywhere, we are hearing about tax 
revolts.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	If we can reduce the number of program overlaps with the 
provinces, bring better service to farmers and save taxpayers' 
money, that is sufficient reason to carry out an industry wide 
review. There is considerable evidence that government 
intervention and programs designed from the top down are very 
often not in the best interest of farmers.
<P>
	Those of us who have been in the industry for a while will 
remember the LIFT program from the early seventies. This was 
a program designed by the minister of the day to deal with low 
grain prices caused by a glut of grain. Farmers were given 
financial incentives to leave land out of production in an attempt 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9508"> 9508 </A></B>
<P>
to firm up demand  for the product. Demand did rise 
dramatically because right about that time the Soviets, among 
others, began buying vast amounts of grain on the international 
market. The price of grain rose dramatically.
<P>
	Unfortunately most of the farmers could not take advantage of 
the higher prices because they had been encouraged by the 
government to take the land out of production. They lost the 
revenue. Most grain farmers ended up worse off financially as a 
direct result of government intervention. Farmers were told to 
stop growing grain. As soon as that happened, the price of the 
grain went up. Taxpayers paid farmers to stop producing and 
they could have made more money if they produced and sold it 
on the world market.
<P>
	This is a typical situation of government intervention at the 
wrong time, in the wrong place, in the wrong way, that totally 
distorts the whole market. We end up being much worse off 
because of it.
<P>
	Another of the great government flip-flops in agricultural 
policy has been the GRIP. This has been a dud from the word go. 
The initiative that spawned GRIP was the growing together 
exercise, as it was billed by the then minister of agriculture 
Mazankowski ``a great consultation with farmers that would 
discover their needs and develop programs to deal with them''.
<P>
	When introducing the GRIP program to the prairie pools, the 
minister referred to it as an unprecedented exercise in 
partnership. He said that people on the prairies want the 
government to consult with them before making major 
decisions.
<P>
	The motion put forward by the member for Moose Jaw-Lake 
Centre is admirable, should be given every consideration and 
should be supported.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> When we come to the 
debate during second hour on this motion someone from the 
government side will lead off that hour of debate.
<P>
	The time provided for the consideration of Private Members' 
Business has now expired. Pursuant to Standing Order 93, the 
order is dropped to the bottom of the order of precedence on the 
Order Paper.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 1</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-59 be amended by deleting Clause 33.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, in the last budget, the federal 
government decided to reduce the age credit. As we know, all 
taxpayers aged 65 and over can ask for a tax credit equal to 17 
per cent of $3,482 at the federal level and 20 per cent of $2,200 
in Quebec.
<P>
	This credit is non-refundable, that is, it applies to the tax 
payable; the excess portion is non-refundable but can be applied 
to the spouse.
<P>
	The amendment made in the last budget is aimed at reducing 
this credit for seniors with a net income exceeding $25,921. This 
threshold will be indexed annually to the increase in the 
consumer price index, and this measure will be implemented 
gradually.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	We oppose this measure because it reflects, in our opinion, a 
deliberate effort by the government opposite to go after the 
middle class, as demonstrated by the so-called social program 
review and by a proposal to cut UI benefits, since some 
recipients can earn between $25,000 and $50,000.
<P>
	By targeting only those with incomes under $25,000 or 
$18,000-we are not against helping them, quite the opposite, as 
you know-by cutting off ties between those with incomes over 
$25,000 and those making less than $25,000, the government 
goes beyond simply bringing universal measures to a sudden 
end. It is more serious than that. Universality is not just a 
buzzword; it also means solidarity.
<P>
	Does the government think that a senior citizen with an 
income of $25,000 is a rich taxpayer? Yet, it is attacking this 
very group, who can now enjoy themselves a little after working 
hard all their lives. But on $25,000 a year, you still need to 
manage your money carefully throughout the year if you want to 
enjoy yourself. It is those people who are targeted by the 
amendment to this tax credit.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9509"> 9509 </A></B>
<P>
	For government that claims to be liberal to be attacking the 
middle class is a serious matter, because the middle class is the 
one largely responsible, by its work, for the financial support 
of government and, more importantly, the one responsible also 
for creating solidarity. But the middle class does not want to 
be the only group to pay. What is happening? Instead of 
reforming the tax system, as is urgently needed, the 
governement attacks the middle class, the unemployed and the 
less affluent. We were non-equivocally reminded of this fact 
at the rally held yesterday in Montreal by community groups 
and central labour bodies denouncing the fact that the proposed 
Axworthy reform-and it is the same thing with this change to 
the age tax credit-attacks the middle class, the unemployed 
and the less affluent instead of attending to the much-awaited 
review of the Canadian tax system.
<P>
	Let me remind you that speaking of the budget, Lloyd 
Axworthy himself stated in 1985, when he was-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I just want to remind the 
hon. members that, in addressing a minister, they should refer to 
his position: the Minister of Human Resources Development, 
the Minister of Finance, and so forth.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Thank you for reminding me, Mr. Speaker. I 
have been on a long Canada-wide tour, as you know; some of the 
veneer of parliamentary procedure may have worn off. I do not 
think I will need to be reminded again.
<P>
	The current Minister of Human Resources Development, who 
was opposition critic at the time, said it was a fact that the 
buying power of seniors had been cut substantially and 
retroactively. First the government had taken their income 
assistance away, and now it was taking their buying power away. 
As if this were not enough, they were struck a third blow with a 
$2 billion cut in provincial transfers by 1990. He added that it 
was clear the budget was an attack the income of seniors in many 
regards.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	What would this same Liberal critic say, were he a critic for 
the opposition, not only about a so-called reform of social 
programs, but also about this important age tax credit? If the 
Liberal government wishes to maintain throughout this country, 
which we crossed as members of the human resources 
committee, the slightest faith in some fairness in the taxation 
system, it must move swiftly to truly examine that system, 
ensuring that the unemployed, the poorest and the middle class 
are not saddled with the burden of the deficit and the debt.
<P>
	Yes there is a debt, but certain parties who remain in the 
background are not worried, and in fact are helping, perhaps 
even cheerfully, to dismantle what provided some well-being to 
so many such people who are slaving away, struggling, having 
difficulty paying their rent or affording to take a vacation. These 
are the people who are threatened at this time by the proposals as 
a whole,  both for reforming social programs and those 
contained in this amendment. This is why we are asking the 
House to adopt our amendment, and thus amend the bill.

<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to address the 
amendment put forward by the official opposition.
<P>
	It is correct that Bill C-59 will subject the age credit to an 
income test. Canada's debt and the burden of high taxes and 
interest rates it imposes on all Canadians, including seniors, 
demands that government spending be both fair and effective.
<P>
	This measure meets that test by ensuring that assistance goes 
to seniors who need it but not to those with annual incomes 
hitting $50,000. Under the current tax system, all Canadians 65 
and older are eligible for the age credit. It delivers a combined 
federal-provincial tax reduction of about $950 a year.
<P>
	Under the proposed legislation, individuals with net incomes 
below $25,921 will retain their full credit. For people with net 
incomes above the threshold, the credit will be reduced at a rate 
of 15 per cent of their net incomes exceeding $25,981. The 
threshold will be indexed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to make it very clear that 75 per cent of all 
seniors, 2.6 million people, will not be affected. In addition, 
most of the people who are affected will continue to receive 
partial benefits. In fact, only six per cent of all seniors, those 
whose income is over the $49,134 threshold, will stop receiving 
benefits altogether.
<P>
	It is also important to note that the reduction will be staggered 
over a period of more than 12 years. In 1994, the reduction 
would reach half of the figure that otherwise would have been 
set. In addition, people will still be able to transfer the age tax 
credit to a spouse.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let me assure the House that we do not take this measure 
lightly. It is today's senior citizens who built this country into 
what is considered by many the best place in the world. Our 
government will never forget the obligation it has to helping 
seniors and why.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9510"> 9510 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	We also must remember the obligation we owe to all 
Canadians to restore the fiscal responsibility that makes 
possible lower taxes, easing in interest rates and more jobs.
<P>
	The Toronto <I>Star</I> in an editorial this morning made the point 
that as it scrambles to cut spending Ottawa can achieve fairness 
only if it allocates its limited resources on the basis of real need. 
By itself the age of 65 is not a measure of need.
<P>
	That is why Bill C-59 moves to sustain aid to those seniors 
who do need it but not for those with significant incomes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity of being able to enter into this 
discussion on Bill C-59. I want to say very clearly to begin with 
that I do not support the amendment which was moved by the 
hon. member for Mercier today. There are some very strong 
reasons we cannot support what was suggested.
<P>
	The recommendation that came in the 1994-95 budget is 
certainly a policy change by the Liberal government. It is a 
move away from universality. Now the program is targeted and 
takes into consideration those people most in need of additional 
assistance to carry out their daily responsibilities.
<P>
	As has been pointed out not only by the mover but by the hon. 
member from the government who just spoke, this amendment 
would continue universality and put back in place a federal tax 
credit of 17 per cent or an amount of about $3,482 for any and 
every taxpayer 65 or over. At this point we have to ask whether 
we can afford it and continue to do that.
<P>
	The Liberal government and Liberals when they were in 
opposition argued that universality should be sustained and it 
should continue and that should be the policy of government 
forever after. They argued that when the question of the 
clawback on old age assistance was presented before this House 
in the last sitting. At that time the Conservative government 
made the decision that we should put a clawback in place. Now 
that is in place and old age assistance is somewhat more targeted 
toward those in need.
<P>
	Now we are at the stage at which the Liberals, now in 
government, see that the reality of our fiscal situation is 
bringing us to this kind of decision making and that it is most 
necessary. We must be able to target government funds toward 
those most in need. If we supported this Bloc amendment it 
would revert to universality and I do not think that would be 
realistic in light of today's current economic circumstances.
<P>
	I would like to make one or two remarks with respect to the 
case put forward by the hon. member for Mercier today. The 
hon. member said in her presentation that the change of the 
federal tax credit from universality to one which is targeted and 
institutes the clawback principle is  a deliberate attack on the 
middle class. The hon. member went on to say that it abruptly 
ends universality. She said that before we do these kinds of 
things we should have tax reform. She said we want to keep a 
feeling in Canada that everybody belongs and that we should 
keep taxes off of the unemployed, the middle class and those 
most in need.
<P>
	That sounds like an ideal society that a socialist point of view 
would certainly put forward in this House.
<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	It is always the underlying premise that one is going to take 
away from the rich somewhere and give to someone else. One is 
going to transfer payments continually to look after someone 
else in our society. One can understand that from people who 
have this kind of a left wing socialist approach to life in which 
they think that somebody is rich, that somebody else is earning 
more money than they and that through government law they 
must transfer those earnings to somebody else they may feel is 
in need.
<P>
	If we look at this policy here where we had the tax credit to all 
taxpayers over the age of 65 it will tag seniors who have retired 
with huge incomes. It could be $1 million or $100,000 or 
$200,000 a year, we were providing an extra benefit to the rich. I 
do not know how well that sits with someone who looks at it 
from a rather left wing, socialist approach as the Bloc Quebecois 
does.
<P>
	I have been most disappointed to hear that kind of view from 
that party in its contribution to this House. Most likely it has 
made a very good replacement in some sense for the New 
Democratic Party which once sat somewhere in this relative 
position in the House.
<P>
	However, we must look at reality today. The Government of 
Canada has a deficit of $39.7 billion. We have interest payments 
of $40 billion on a debt of over $500 billion and it is moving 
toward $50 billion per year as our debt continues to accumulate 
as we continue to spend. That is the way it is. Every one minute 
$18,000 is added to the debt. If we look at that in terms of the 
income of members of Parliament, every four minutes we add 
$64,000 to the debt of this country on to the current accumulated 
debt. That is adding up very quickly and we need to do 
something about it.
<P>
	Fiscal responsibility must be part of the policy that we have in 
front of us here. We must recognize that the decrease in cost to 
the government of some $300 million is part of an expenditure 
reduction program that was necessary and is necessary to be 
used to try and keep the level of deficit down and keep the level 
of interest costs down so we can get this country back on a more 
pay as you go basis.
<P>
	Bloc members do not understand that kind of language. They 
feel they can have it both ways. They feel they can spend here, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9511"> 9511 </A></B>
<P>
tell one crowd that we are going to spend and keep all these 
benefits for them on this hand and at the same time we are never 
going to have to face fiscal reality and deal with this big deficit 
in the country  or deal with the accumulating debt of the country. 
Those two policies, if they were told in the same building at the 
same time, would look very foolish. These inconsistencies are 
continually presented on the floor of this House and Canadians 
are not buying that kind of approach.
<P>
	I know the people of Quebec, as they may watch this debate 
today and as members of this House point out the 
inconsistencies of this debate that is presented, they will not buy 
the kind of message that the Bloc Quebecois is presenting to 
Canadians in this House and in the referendum that is going on 
in Quebec trying to present to the people of Quebec. They will 
not buy it. They will see the inconsistencies. They will see that it 
is the wrong approach to building Canada. It is the wrong 
approach to building any city in Quebec. It is the wrong 
approach to building any community in Quebec. It is not the 
approach that will bring fiscal accountability to Canada, nor will 
it bring fiscal accountability to the province of Quebec as it 
should.
<P>
	This amendment before us is unacceptable in principle and 
unacceptable in terms of the current circumstances. It is 
unacceptable because it comes from a philosophic bent that is 
unacceptable to Canadians. It is one that will not build this 
nation of ours.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	I encourage the members of this House to vote against the 
amendment because it just does not fit in terms of today's 
reality.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome 
this opportunity to support the amendment standing in the name 
of the hon. member for Mercier, whose purpose is to eliminate 
one of the proposals in the bill before the House today which 
would involve a considerable reduction in the age credit, the tax 
credit for seniors. As you know, the citizens of this country are 
entitled to special tax relief on the basis of age. This age credit is 
currently set at $3,482, which works out to a reduction in federal 
income tax of about $610 annually for all tax-paying seniors. 
Combined with the credit allowed by most provinces, this adds 
up to about $950.
<P>
	The proposal, which our amendment before the House today 
would eliminate, would apply an income test to the credit, so 
that seniors whose net income exceeds $25,921 would see the 
value of their tax credit go down and, in the case of seniors 
whose net income exceeds $49,134, disappear altogether in two 
years' time. Let me explain. The proposed amendment to the 
Income Tax Act will initially have no impact on seniors who are 
among the neediest in our society. Seniors with an income of 
less than $25,920 will not be affected. This will only have an 
impact on seniors with a net income between $25,000 and 
$50,000.
<P>
	These people belong to the middle class. These are people 
who have worked all their lives, have saved money for their 
retirement and have a net income of about $30,000 or $40,000. 
These people are not wealthy. These are members of the middle 
class who have worked to enjoy a good life during their 
retirement. These are the people who will be hit, and that is why 
the Bloc Quebecois is opposed to this amendment. I heard 
members of other parties say: ``Sure, but this tax credit also 
benefited people earning $200,000, $300,000 or $400,000''. I 
think that is rather exaggerated, since the vast majority of those 
who will be affected are people in the middle class with average 
incomes.
<P>
	The message this amendment sends to people, especially to 
seniors, is that our society does not appreciate them. The age 
credit provision was included in the Income Tax Act-at least, 
that was my understanding-to provide some recognition for 
people who worked so hard to build our country and who 
managed to save some money for their retirement, and I think 
the country, whether we are talking about Canada or Quebec, 
should recognize their contribution. I think the age credit was a 
way to tell them that society valued their contribution.
<P>
	The other thing I see in all this is that those who want to 
reduce the credit believe that seniors have a fair amount of 
money, that there is not enough money to go around, that there is 
a deficit, and that everyone has to pay. But in fact not everyone 
in Canada pays. I think that, before we go after the incomes of 
seniors, we should really look elsewhere. Over the past year, and 
even during budget preparation, the Bloc Quebecois suggested 
places to the Minister of Finance where money could surely be 
found to replenish government coffers so that the people in the 
middle class and, particularly, those 65 and over in Canada 
could be left alone.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	They talk about family trusts, a way for the very rich to shelter 
large amounts of capital from taxes. They could be a source of 
hundreds of millions of dollars.
<P>
	There is the whole business of tax havens. You know, Canada 
has agreements with some 15 or 16 countries, which allow 
companies in Canada and other countries to spread out profits 
and therefore to avoid paying taxes. It is primarily in countries 
that welcome big multinationals where people with a knack for 
accounting arrange for these companies not to pay any taxes.
<P>
	I think we should look at these agreements and get the money 
that is due to Revenue Canada-Taxation. Here again, hundreds 
of millions of dollars are involved. This is where we should be 
looking, instead of targeting people who have worked hard all 
their lives to enjoy decent retirements.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9512"> 9512 </A></B>
<P>
	Furthermore, we should take another look at the real 
minimum tax that could be charged on the profits of major 
corporations. Do you know that, right now in Canada-and I 
think many people find it disgusting; it is a real sin-there are 
companies, big corporations, not paying any taxes. They make 
profits, but they do not pay any taxes.
<P>
	Under a particular accounting policy, they can carry over 
losses incurred in previous years. So, in a year when they make a 
profit, they can carry over losses from preceding years to offset 
it and avoid having to pay taxes.
<P>
	If individual taxpayers were allowed to do the same, I think 
that we might be surprised by the results. Some people earn a lot 
of money one year and considerably less the following year, for 
any number of reasons. I do not think it is that easy for 
individuals to carry losses over from one year to the next.
<P>
	There is a great deal of money to be made with a minimum tax 
on corporations and at the same time this would put an end to an 
outrageous situation that people read about in the papers: large 
corporations not paying a cent in income tax while individual 
taxpayers are seeing $500, $600, $1,000 or $2,000 deductions 
taken away from them. I think there is something wrong in terms 
of tax fairness and, as a result, the public doubts that the 
Canadian tax collection process is fair and equitable.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to remind you that the auditor general 
reported that there some $6.6 billion was currently owed to the 
federal treasury in Canada. For one reason or another, the tax 
man did not collect the amounts due. At least 80 per cent of these 
unpaid taxes could still be recovered. This adds up to several 
billion dollars.
<P>
	I think that, with the assurance that all amounts due will be 
collected, the public would accept more readily that measures 
such as the one we proposed this morning, although debatable, 
be adopted.
<P>
	But first, the federal government and the Minister of Finance 
must demonstrate that the Canadian tax system is really fair, that 
corporations pay their share, that the rich pay their share, that all 
those who owe back taxes pay them. I think that we must resist 
any further tax increase on the middle class. The middle class is 
large. Small amounts times millions of taxpayers amount to a lot 
of money in the end.
<P>
	But when the most heavily-taxed middle class, whether 
retired or younger people, come to realize that the system is no 
longer equitable, this gives rise to situations where people 
protest and refuse to pay taxes, not because they think that it is 
not fair to pay taxes, but because they feel that not everyone is 
paying his fair share.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	So, I hope that my hon. colleague's amendment will be passed 
and that plans to eliminate the age tax credit will be 
reconsidered as far as certain categories of seniors are 
concerned, in particular middle class seniors.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak against the motion put forward by the Bloc to remove 
means testing whereby the tax credit for seniors is reduced as 
their incomes go up. As I have said in the House before and will 
say again, members of the Bloc are not only separatists but 
socialists too. They always want to ensure the status quo is 
protected: we cannot change anything given to a group of people 
even though it has been shown to be no longer appropriate.
<P>
	We have a fiscal crisis in the country. The finance minister is 
starting to recognize it. The Reform Party has recognized it for a 
long time and has been able to raise awareness of that fact. Now 
the government is coming on side and saying that we really have 
a problem.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance promised us a tough budget with 
some more tax increases in the name of fairness. Some may 
question the fairness but they are certainly tax increases. We are 
going to see some cuts. The Reform Party has been proposing 
these for many years. We ran in the election on balancing the 
budget within three years. We must get the job done to ensure 
that our social programs for those in need are protected. That is 
the number one priority. After that we have to ensure that we get 
the budget balanced.
<P>
	The motion put forward by the Bloc would suggest that we 
continue the old situation of taxing the poor to pay for the rich. 
We have millionaires in the country who spend their winters in 
Florida, in Mexico, in southern United States and in Hawaii 
because they are retired. They have large incomes and a large 
amount of assets. Yet we continue to give them a tax break paid 
through the additional taxes of young families struggling to pay 
mortgages, young families trying to raise children, educate 
them and get on their feet. These people are being focused. We 
are calling them the middle class and saying: ``You have to pay 
more in order that a certain segment can live in the lap of luxury 
and get a tax break too''.
<P>
	Surely it makes sense to recognize that the elderly poor need 
assistance, to focus on them and to remove the credit for those 
who can afford to pay their share of taxes. That is what it is 
coming down to. We want to be really fair and not like the 
Minister of Finance who suggests that fairness is an increase.
<P>
	We want to ensure we are fair and focus the money where it 
will do the greatest amount of good. We should remove the tax 
credits from those who can afford to do without them. It is not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9513"> 9513 </A></B>
<P>
pleasant. We would rather not do it but unfortunately with the 
situation the country is in we really do not have a choice.
<P>
	We hoped the Liberal government would have acted quickly 
and decisively to get the job done a year ago. We are $45 billion 
or $55 billion more in debt, and the Minister of Finance says: ``I 
think I am going to start this time''. I do not think that is good 
enough, but it is water under the bridge, the horse is out of the 
barn or whatever. Here we are today; let us hope this time the 
Minister of Finance will make an aggressive start rather than 
continue his policy of gradualism to get the budget balanced 
some time down the road.
<P>
	Let us get the job done. If we do not get the job done we will 
not only find that we have to reduce the tax credit for seniors this 
year but we will have to eliminate it for everybody another year. 
We will have to cut social programs we can no longer afford that 
are not only desirable but almost mandatory. However we will 
not have the money for them.
<P>
	That is the crisis looming ahead if we do not act decisively 
now. I cannot understand why the Bloc would suggest that we 
should continue allowing this tax credit for millionaires. The 
point is that we must move ahead.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	Our leader, the member for Calgary Southwest, has said quite 
specifically on several occasions that we are going to introduce 
a budget and the Minister of Finance is going to have a budget 
and he is prepared to debate the two of them.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance is playing games again. He told us he 
was going to reduce the deficit to $25 billion in three years. A 
couple of weeks ago he said we were to have two-year rolling 
targets. Everybody thought that was progress until they realized 
that he was only going to release them one at a time. Now he is 
going to say: ``Guess what, my two-year rolling target is $25 
billion in 1996-97''.
<P>
	We knew that a year and a half ago. We have not moved 
forward. He admitted back in October when he appeared before 
the finance committee that things were falling apart and he had 
to make extra cuts between $9 billion and $15 billion to meet his 
goal. Interest rates have gone up even more since then. The cost 
of the debt has gone up even more since then. His figures are 
even more off track. Yet he still has a policy of gradualism.
<P>
	Death by a thousand cuts is one thing I was looking at. I was 
looking at Bill C-59 and the number of tax increases being 
proposed. These are just last year's budget increases. We have 
not even started to get the job done. We have seen the budget 
reduced from $40 billion to $39.7 billion, a minuscule drop. We 
have seen the $100,000 lifetime capital gains exemption 
eliminated. We have seen extended the taxation on employer 
provided benefits to include the first $25,000 of life insurance. 
There is the age credit we are talking about today. Business 
meals and entertainment expenses have been reduced from 80 
per cent to 50 per cent. Divisive corporate reorganizations 
curtail a tax avoidance tactic that allows capital gains and so on. 
Investment tax credits  reduce the rate at which a tax credit is 
calculated and so on. It is death by a thousand cuts and we have 
not started the job.
<P>
	The deficit still has not come down in any meaningful way 
until the Minister of Finance introduces another budget in a few 
weeks time. If interest rates continue to rise that will not do any 
good whatsoever.
<P>
	Therefore, while we support the reduction being proposed in 
Bill C-59 that is opposed by the Bloc, we are also saying loudly 
and clearly to the Minister of Finance: ``Get the job done''. If he 
gets off this policy of gradualism and deals with the crisis 
effectively, we can say to seniors and others who depend on 
social programs that we recognize we have a responsibility and 
want to preserve social programs for those in need. If the 
Minister of Finance does not get the job done now and get it done 
quickly, these programs will be in jeopardy because the 
government could not get the job done.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
duty to rise today to speak to Bill C-59, an act to amend the 
Income Tax Act, since this bill includes several tax provisions 
that were announced in the last budget almost a year ago. 
Consequently, I will support the amendment moved by my 
colleague, the hon. member for Mercier.
<P>
	This bill reflects an effort to correct certain shortcomings in 
the tax provisions, but I am not sure that the goal will be 
achieved since this government managed to divide Canadians 
and Quebecers into several categories: the rich, the poor, and the 
disadvantaged.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	Once again, the government is going after the most 
disadvantaged in society. It wants to take half a billion dollars 
from the pockets of seniors by reducing their age credit. That is 
really outrageous. A lack of money precludes any kind of 
participation in community life. Take off your masks and tell us 
clearly what you have in store for our seniors, a growing number 
of whom live in poverty.
<P>
	Is this the kind of life the Liberal government has in mind for 
our seniors? As you know, in 1992, the average income for 
seniors was $18,000 a year. Furthermore, 21 per cent of seniors 
are low income earners living at or below the poverty level. The 
government now thinks that a senior with a $25,000 income is 
rich. The provision in this bill is based on these people's low 
income. It would be unconscionable to collect such amounts 
when there are so many ways to get more money elsewhere.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9514"> 9514 </A></B>
<P>
	Seniors are now eligible for non-refundable tax credits. 
Many of them-from across Canada, I think-are very 
concerned that this credit might be cut or eliminated altogether. 
The Liberal government decided to reduce this tax credit. This 
amendment is aimed at reducing, for seniors with a net income 
of $25,921 or over, the tax credit by 15 per cent of the amount 
by which the individual's net income exceeds $25,900. This 
credit will be completely eliminated when individual income 
reaches $49,000.
<P>
	The government wants to implement this measure gradually 
over two years. In other words, half of the amount calculated 
will be eliminated in 1994 and the other half in 1995. This 
measure will affect about 250,000 senior citizens. Of that 
number, 170,000 are considered to be on low incomes. This 
verges on outright injustice to seniors on average incomes, and 
all for the sake of an estimated savings of $20 million in 
1994-95, $170 million in 1995-96 and $300 million in 1996-97. 
It is outrageous, when we realize that this money will come 
directly out of the pockets of our senior citizens.
<P>
	Need I recall that the Liberals were the first off the mark to 
criticize the Conservatives for cuts affecting senior citizens? In 
fact, on June 18, 1985, when the Minister of Human Resources 
Development was in the opposition, he said: ``The fact of the 
matter is that the government has substantially reduced in a 
regressive way the purchasing power of senior citizens. Not only 
has their direct income support been taken away, but their 
purchasing power has been taken away. As if that were not 
enough, a third whammy is added through reductions in transfer 
payments to the provinces by $2 billion between now and 1990. 
The Budget is clearly a multifaceted attack on the income base 
of senior citizens''.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	And where is the Minister of Human Resources Development, 
now that he has changed his tune? Now that his party is in power, 
the minister's policies are right in step with the same policies he 
used to criticize so roundly, and I am referring to the reductions 
in transfer payments and the purchasing power of senior 
citizens. This government was all about promises and a red 
book, but now they are in power, the red book is fading fast.
<P>
	The Prime Minister is a good example. After promising he 
would not raise taxes, he is now leaning towards taxing RRSPs, 
another way to increase the tax burden on the middle class. This 
will lead people to put less money in their RRSPs, at a time when 
public pension funds are showing signs that they will be unable 
to meet the needs of an ageing population.
<P>
	The government can get its half billion dollars somewhere 
else. Do something about tax evasion! Many hundreds of 
millions of dollars are locked up in family trusts because of tax 
treaties with foreign countries. The perfect tax haven.
<P>
	This government has a funny way of showing its recognition 
to people who have worked hard all their lives. What does it 
want? Let senior citizens enjoy their well-deserved retirement 
in dignity.
<P>
	Unemployment is over 10 per cent. Youth unemployment is 
close to 17 per cent. In Quebec, more than one million people are 
on unemployment insurance or welfare. The government should 
be doing something about unemployment, for a change. Let us 
restore the pride of Canadians and Quebecers by putting them 
back to work. The government should stop taking money from 
the poor, but Bill C-59 is one more step in that direction, with its 
measures against senior citizens.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois condemns this bill which does nothing to 
help this section of our population and will merely add to the 
number of poor people in our society. In concluding, I want to 
ask the following question: Is this flexible federalism? If so, this 
is one more reason to get out.

MONETARY PENALTIES ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from February 10 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-61, an act to establish a system of 
administrative monetary penalties for the enforcement of the 
Canada Agricultural Products Act, the Feeds Act, the Fertilizers 
Act, the Health of Animals Act, the Meat Inspection Act, the 
Pest Control Products Act, the Plant Protection Act, and the 
Seeds Act, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
purpose of my speech on Bill C-61 is threefold. First, I will 
outline what is contained within this bill and what it intends to 
achieve. Second, I will outline three areas of concern I have with 
this bill and offer some constructive alternatives to those 
concerns. Third, I will outline the positive aspects of increasing 
the monetary penalties for offences dealt with by the courts.
<P>
	At this time I am not speaking either for or against the bill 
which leads me to wonder whether I am becoming too much of a 
politician. For the most part I will be asking questions of the 
minister. I hope the answers will explain some parts of this 
legislation which will help me in preparing to deal with this 
issue in committee and in later debate in this House.
<P>
	First, I will outline the purpose of this bill. Industry 
associations have pointed out the need for more equitable 
enforcement of regulations and more equitable treatment 
between imported and domestic products. This bill is an attempt 
to apply consistent standards to both imported and domestic 
products and to promote the competitiveness of the agriculture 
and agri-food sector.
<P>
	To address these concerns the food production and inspection 
branch has proposed an administrative monetary penalty system 
to decriminalize certain federal regulatory offences. This bill 
permits the minister of agriculture, if he is requested to do so, to 
conclude compliance agreements with those who commit 
regulatory violations.
<P>
	The rationale behind these monetary penalties is to use the 
threat of a financial penalty to obtain compliance rather than to 
simply punish. The system is based on negotiating solutions to 
regulatory violations. Monetary penalties range from $50 to 
$15,000.
<P>
	Bill C-61 gives the department of agriculture more options 
and greater authority to enforce relevant regulations. Currently 
most violations of regulations under these acts are treated as 
offences and are prosecuted through the courts.
<P>
	The new system is intended to streamline the process by 
implementing a ticketing system at ports of entry into Canada 
and monetary fines for other infractions. Only the most serious 
infractions will end up being prosecuted through the courts as 
offences. One important result of this bill could be lowering the 
number of cases going to court. The end result of a cost saving to 
taxpayers is of course very important.
<P>
	Bill C-61 adds to the enforcement options of certain 
legislation administered by the department of agriculture by 
allowing a system of administrative monetary penalties to be 
imposed for these regulatory violations. Under this legislation a 
violation would result in a ticket or a monetary fine.
<P>
	For example, a violation could include the failure to meet 
certain sanitary regulations at a meat processing plant, or the 
mislabelling of an agricultural product. However, an offence 
which is considered a more serious infraction of the regulations 
for imported and domestic products would remain subject to 
prosecution through the courts. An example of an offence would 
be taking an animal out of quarantine and marketing it, thus 
endangering consumers.
<P>
	Under compliance agreements administrative monetary 
penalties may be reduced or cancelled if the violator agrees to 
the actions necessary to ensure future compliance.
<P>
	Monetary penalties are subject to review by a board of 
arbitration or a review tribunal. The system of administrative 
monetary penalties would apply to the following acts: the 
Canada Agriculture Products Act; the Feeds Act; the Fertilizers 
Act; the Health of Animals Act; the Meat Inspection Act; the 
Pest Control Products Act; the Plant Protection Act; and the 
Seeds Act. Certain monetary penalties already exist within the 
Departments of Transport and Employment and Immigration. 
They are also used in the United States and Europe.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	I will outline three areas of concern that I have with this bill. I 
agree with the overall intent of this bill. Reformers favour 
streamlining a regulatory process to make it work more 
efficiently and reduce costs. Currently most regulatory 
violations are prosecuted through the courts. For the most part 
this a cumbersome and ineffective process. Because there are 
limited alternatives in the current system to enforce compliance 
with the law outside of criminal prosecution, minor violations 
and violators are often ignored.
<P>
	I have three main areas of concern and I also have three 
questions, the answers to which could alleviate these concerns. 
Are the penalties set high enough to be an effective deterrent, 
particularly to large companies? Why have the ministerial 
powers been so dramatically strengthened? Why is it the sole 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9516"> 9516 </A></B>
<P>
discretion of the minister to appoint and expand the board of 
arbitration and the review tribunal?
<P>
	My first area of concern is the size of penalties. Are the 
penalties set high enough to be an effective deterrent? I agree 
with the goal of compliance instead of punishment, and this is 
positive because it will reduce the burden of the courts, but will 
it also increase the likelihood of violations since the 
consequences will not lead to criminal action?
<P>
	Corporations may deliberately engage in minor infractions 
which are by regulation subject only to monetary penalties and 
not to court action. The company will therefore simply pay the 
penalty and in accordance with the changes made in clause 23 
have its record wiped clean after five years.
<P>
	For example, corporations knowingly emit more pollutants 
into the air than is acceptable under Canada's environmental 
regulations. Because the benefits to the company outweigh the 
costs, some companies would rather break the law, pay the 
minimal fine and continue operating at a maximum profit level.
<P>
	A solution to this problem would be to ensure that repeat 
violators will be prosecuted in court. For example, a two strikes 
and you are out system could be implemented. This means that 
after a company has received a monetary penalty twice for a 
violation a further violation would automatically be deemed an 
offence and court action would be taken.
<P>
	In order to strengthen the effects of regulatory violations, I 
would propose that the five year period for retaining records of 
violation as outlined in clause 23 of Bill C-61 be extended to ten 
years so a record of infraction takes longer to wipe away.
<P>
	The second area of concern is that the ministerial powers have 
once again been substantially strengthened. Clause 5 allows the 
minister to decide what constitutes a violation subject to 
monetary penalty and what constitutes an offence subject to the 
courts.
<P>
	For example, under the Fertilizers Act the minister can decide 
whether a violation has occurred which is subject to a maximum 
fine of $15,000 or whether an offence has occurred which is 
subject to a maximum fine of $250,000. That is a lot of power in 
the hands of a minister without precise legislation to guide.
<P>
	In the case of a violation clause 6 allows the minister to decide 
who will receive a notice of violation and to determine the form 
and the content of that violation. Clause 7 allows the minister to 
make regulations that set penalties for each violation or not to 
impose a penalty at all. Under clauses 9 to 13 the minister may 
also make exceptions which would allow a penalty to be reduced 
or increased.
<P>
	All of these situations create an opportunity for political 
favouritism. Companies that are friends of the government 
could be let off lighter than those that are not friends of the 
government. If clear guidelines are in place to alleviate this 
concern, I would ask the minister to provide them to me. If his 
answer is that an alleged  violator can take recourse through a 
board of arbitration or a review tribunal, this offers me no 
comfort.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	Let me explain by discussing my third area of concern, how 
appointments are made to these two boards. It is clear there is 
too much ministerial involvement in appointing and expanding 
the board of arbitration and the review tribunal.
<P>
	Monetary penalties are imposed on the basis of absolute 
liability which means a penalty can be imposed without proving 
fault. The briefing from the food production and inspection 
branch of the agriculture department cites essentially regulatory 
nature of the violations, the relatively modest levels of the 
penalties and the absence of the probability of imprisonment as 
factors to support the use of absolute liability. In the real world, 
though, these penalties are large enough and can be used 
effectively to punish enemies of the minister.
<P>
	This legislation states that if an alleged violator objects to the 
penalty assessment he has received, a review by an appropriate 
government official and by a tribunal may be requested. This is 
outlined in clause 9(3) which states a person may request to 
enter into a compliance agreement or a review by the minister or 
a review by the tribunal.
<P>
	The practices of departmental review and review by a board of 
arbitration and review tribunal were in place before Bill C-61. 
However, clause 28 of this bill eliminates the ceiling for 
membership on these minister appointed boards.
<P>
	Under the existing Canada Agriculture Products Act both the 
board of arbitration and the review tribunal can only consist of a 
minimum of three and a maximum of five members, all 
appointed by the minister.
<P>
	Clause 28 of this bill allows the minister to appoint an 
unlimited number of members to these boards. The current 
process is already open to government patronage. Lifting the 
ceiling on the number of members to the board of arbitration and 
review tribunal only allows for more patronage to occur.
<P>
	Here is another chance for the Liberal government to add to 
that list of patronage appointments that was presented in the 
<I>Globe and Mail</I> last week. Is this the intent of this section of the 
legislation?
<P>
	I do not believe that there are legitimate reasons for the 
minister to have sole discretion in appointing members to the 
board of arbitration and the review tribunal. This direct and 
deliberate patronage can be avoided by vetting all appointments 
through the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food 
in an open and thorough process.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9517"> 9517 </A></B>
<P>
	Even though this is a Liberal dominated committee, at least 
it would provide the opportunity for open and honest 
discussion, the opportunity to critique the qualities of those 
considered for the appointment.
<P>
	With respect to the elimination of the ceiling for membership 
on the board of arbitration and the review tribunal, if the 
government has a legitimate reason for removing the maximum 
number of members for the board, for removing the level that 
was set previously, I would like to know what the reasons are. I 
ask the minister to provide me with this list of reasons. Next 
week or sooner would be fine.
<P>
	As stated in my introduction, the third aspect of my speech 
will deal with what I consider to be a positive aspect of this bill, 
that the monetary penalties for offences dealt with through the 
courts have been strengthened.
<P>
	For cases involving a gross offence, the department still 
retains the option of criminal prosecution through the courts. In 
such cases administrative monetary penalties will not be 
imposed.
<P>
	Fines proposed for indictable offences have been drastically 
increased. For example, clause 52 increases the maximum 
penalty for an offence under the Fertilizers Act from $500 to 
$50,000 and for an indictable offence from $2,000 to $250,000, 
a substantial increase. Strengthening these penalties may 
increase the deterrent to breaking Canadian regulations. 
Reducing regulatory infractions through deterrence is a positive 
goal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Vanclief:</B> Recall.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Some members opposite are referring to recall. I 
would just like to remind them that the hon. member for Beaver 
River in early November introduced the recall bill into this 
House. Had the members opposite voted for that recall bill 
instead of against it, people in my constituency would have had 
the right to invoke a recall petition. Therefore, I encourage them 
to bring this bill up on their own to show that they really do 
believe in direct democracy. I would be more than happy to 
honour that recall legislation.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	I have outlined what this bill attempts to achieve. I have 
discussed my three main areas of concern with this bill and I 
have outlined what I consider to be the most positive aspects of 
this bill.
<P>
	I have one final comment on this bill. Achieving the best 
balance between which details should actually be included in 
legislation and which should be left up to ministerial discretion 
is often difficult. By adding more detail, which is often covered 
by regulation rather than in the legislation itself, a bill can limit 
the flexibility of implementation. This can be positive or 
negative. The more detail added to the legislation the less 
discretion the minister has in implementing the legislation. Less 
discretion means less power.
<P>
	I believe this legislation needs more details. If it sounds like I 
do not trust government and bureaucracy, that is true. It has been 
well demonstrated in the past that it is wise to view government 
with a certain level of distrust. Governments have earned this 
reputation. This was very apparent to me this last weekend as I 
canvassed for the Reform candidates in Ottawa-Vanier and 
Saint-Henri-Westmount. Many people I talked to expressed a 
high level of distrust of both present and past governments.
<P>
	Because I am leery of giving the government too much 
flexibility in implementing legislation, I will be looking for 
more detail to be added in third reading. I look forward to 
getting the answers to the questions that I have presented to the 
minister today and I look forward to discussing Bill C-61 in 
committee and in further debate in this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murray Calder 
(Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to speak on Bill C-61 which is before the House this 
afternoon. I wish to add my voice to supporting Bill C-61, an act 
to establish a system of administrative monetary penalties for 
the enforcement of the Canada Agricultural Products Act, the 
Feeds Act, the Fertilizers Act, the Health of Animals Act, the 
Meat Inspection Act, the Pest Control Products Act, the Plant 
Protection Act and the Seeds Act.
<P>
	I think we are all aware of the purpose of the acts, but for those 
of you without agricultural backgrounds let me share with you 
how important they are for a poultry producer who farms near 
Holstein, Ontario.
<P>
	The Seeds Act ensures that the seed I buy to grow feed for my 
chickens conforms to the prescribed standards, marked and 
packed and packaged labelled as required. The western growers 
would know what tombstone would mean to wheat production if 
it were able to get farther into the seed system than what it is 
right now.
<P>
	The Health of Animals Act helps to ensure that my flock will 
be disease free. Within the poultry industry there is a disease 
called ILT, infectious laryngotracheitis. Try saying that three 
times. It is something that a producer would look at losing 70 per 
cent to 80 per cent of his flock of chickens which would be 
economic disaster.
<P>
	The Plant Protection Act provides for the prevention of pests 
injurious to plant life in agriculture and forestry sectors. I think 
we all remember back to Ontario and the outbreak of elm disease 
and all the trees that had to be destroyed because of that.
<P>
	The Feeds Act ensures that no person will manufacture, sell or 
import into Canada any feed that may adversely affect animal or 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9518"> 9518 </A></B>
<P>
human health. In that situation with all the animal feeds we have 
right now which are very highly mixed, with computer 
technology, farmers are aware of how micro toxins can 
adversely affect the health of their livestock.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	The Fertilizers Act provides that any fertilizer when utilized 
in accordance with directions does not contain destructive 
ingredients.
<P>
	Finally, the Pest Control Act regulates the products used for 
the control of pests and organic functions of animals and plants.
<P>
	As can be readily seen, the operation of my farm and its 
success depends as much on my ability as manager as it depends 
on the federally enforced standards and also supply management 
in my case. Without these standards and the enforcement of 
these standards, Canadian agriculture would be unable to 
compete in the global marketplace. Unable to guarantee quality, 
domestic and foreign markets would soon disappear.
<P>
	As colleagues have noted this bill does more than impose 
monetary penalties. It authorizes the minister, if requested to do 
so, to conclude compliance agreements with individuals who 
commit violations. Under these compliance agreements 
administrative monetary penalties can be reduced or cancelled if 
persons agree to make appropriate corrective action to comply 
with the agri-food acts and regulations.
<P>
	Notwithstanding the ability to assess monetary penalties the 
bill also provides for an independent tribunal to review such 
penalties in keeping with the government's belief in due 
process. It is important to protect the integrity of Canadian 
agriculture and agri-food products. This bill will strengthen the 
concept and the quality that is central to the Canadian agri-food 
industry.
<P>
	I will give an example. This is probably a question that my 
hon. colleagues on the other side of the House would want to 
know. How many administrative monetary penalties does the 
department expect to issue this year? The estimate is that the 
food production and inspection branch will issue approximately 
350 notices of violations. Currently it will probably prosecute 
220 of these offences. We will currently and after this be able to 
issue administrative monetary penalties for all but a few of these 
offences.
<P>
	As this system is more effective and efficient than 
prosecuting in the courts we will be able to increase our 
enforcement activities. In addition to the 350 notices of 
violations we will probably issue approximately 1,200 tickets at 
the ports of entry. These tickets will be issued for high risk 
violations by the public who try to illegally bring in meat or 
meat products or plants or plant products at the airports.
<P>
	This problem is a serious one because of the possibility of 
introducing plant or animal diseases into Canada as I have 
previously stated.
<P>
	As colleagues have noted this bill will help to reinforce the 
many unique things that we do in Canada which will ensure that 
everything from the seeds that we grow to the food that is on our 
table is the very best. That is what the Canadian consumer has 
come to expect from Agriculture Canada. This bill will affirm 
that quality will continue to be the foundation of Canada's 
agri-food strategy.
<P>
	It is important to note that while classifying each infraction as 
a minor violation or as a serious violation or as a very serious 
violation with the accompanying escalation in monetary 
penalties imposed, it should be remembered that nothing in the 
bill precludes the minister from seeking greater penalties by 
proceeding with the infraction as an indictable or summary 
offence before the courts rather than as a violation. At present 
the department only prosecutes serious non-compliance with 90 
per cent of the penalties not going to hearings.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	The industry wants the importers to comply with the high 
domestic standards we have, thereby giving them a level playing 
field to compete on. However, it is important to reiterate that not 
only is there an appeal mechanism in place when the person is 
judged in the violation, we also have the opportunity of 
overturning such penalties that have been imposed.
<P>
	Where the minister is satisfied that a person who has entered 
into a compliance agreement has complied with the said 
agreement, any security given under the compliance agreed by 
the person shall be returned.
<P>
	This ability to pursue through the courts those judged to be in 
flagrant violation of the aforementioned acts, while treating 
with compassion those who comply, is one of the strengths of 
this legislation. The element of fairness that gives this bill its 
greatest strength is the balance. We all want compliance, not 
punishment, so the integrity of the agri-food industry is without 
question. The bill would give us the opportunity to maintain 
these standards of quality.
<P>
	I would like to commend the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food for his leadership. The bill typifies the way the 
government deals with issues. With the support and assistance 
of the industries being regulated, the government has proposed 
effective changes intended to improve the operating and 
administrative efficiencies relating to the enforcement of the 
agri-food industry standards.
<P>
	Taken together, the amendments to the various acts offer 
Canadians a comprehensive package of measures that support 
efforts to ensure the quality and safety of agri-food products 
here in Canada and around the world. For these reasons I most 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9519"> 9519 </A></B>
<P>
heartily encourage the members of the House to support this 
bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Moose Jaw-Lake Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in defence of my colleague from Vegreville, I feel there 
is a need to repeat something. I do not think the government 
hears us the first time. It is very important that we make our 
point.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member a question. I agree and 
can support the idea of less regulation when it comes to court 
cases or the idea of compliance. What bothers me about Bill 
C-61-the member mentioned it as well-is that it will give the 
minister far more latitude in some of the powers he has in these 
regulations.
<P>
	What protection is built into this bill that would protect 
consumers and the industry from the wide-ranging powers of 
this minister or any other minister that may sit in the House from 
time to time?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Calder:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would say the integrity of the 
department would go a long way to protect the individual 
producer. Also it would probably be underneath a vote too.
<P>
	I know the hon. member has probably never been in this 
situation but it is like speeding down the highway. You might 
have been five miles over the speed limit. The police officer 
comes up beside him. The police officer has the right to charge 
him for speeding. I know there have been some instances where 
the police officer has said: ``Listen. Don't do it again. You have 
12 hours. This is a warning.''
<P>
	I would say that is probably a fair answer to the member's 
question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Moose Jaw-Lake Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it must be my lucky day. It seems like I have been up 
every half hour this morning and early afternoon.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	It brings a concern to my mind. Like the rest of my colleagues, 
I have been sitting in the House for somewhat over a year now. I 
sometimes wonder about the priority the government puts on 
agriculture. Last year when we started in January we sat until 
almost May before we had a debate on agriculture.
<P>
	This concerns me because I am a farmer from Saskatchewan. 
Many of the constituents who elected me in Moose Jaw-Lake 
Centre are farmers. Certainly most or all of them are concerned 
about what happens in the agriculture industry. It is a concern 
that there seems to be a lack of interest in the whole idea of 
agriculture. It is good to see that we have a number of bills 
before the House now that are pertinent and relevant to today's 
agricultural communities.
<P>
	I want to talk for a few minutes on Bill C-61. Bill C-61 
proposes a system of administrative and monetary policies for 
the enforcement of the Agriculture Products Act, the Feeds Act, 
the Fertilizer Protection Act and the Seeds Act. It proposes some 
new provisions and also various amendments to the current acts.
<P>
	Basically the bill gives the Department of Agriculture and 
Agri-food more options and greater authority in enforcing the 
relevant agriculture legislation. Currently most contraventions 
of regulations under these acts are treated as offences and 
prosecuted as such. We have already said that puts a burden on 
the court system and is generally very inefficient.
<P>
	The new system is intended to streamline the process by 
utilizing a ticketing system that will include AMPs but will not 
be treated as a criminal offence unless it is deemed serious 
enough.
<P>
	One of my great concerns is who will deem it serious enough 
to be a criminal offence? Will it be the minister? Will it be a 
board or a tribunal that is appointed by the minister? It concerns 
me, if not for the current minister, but for future ministers. We 
have no guarantee and no protection, in my mind, that protects 
consumers and the industry from a minister who would want to 
play heavy-handed politics in the industry. That is probably my 
one great concern with Bill C-61. Up until this time I do not feel 
the question has been answered on how we will be protected 
from a heavy-handed minister.
<P>
	I do not believe a lot of accountability is built into Bill C-61. 
The debate on this bill should also focus on the amount of 
regulation in general. Some of the regulations relevant to this 
bill are quite necessary.
<P>
	For example, the regulations dealing with health of animals 
and meat inspection have to be a concern and must be a priority 
for government as I mentioned this morning in another speech 
on another subject. In areas such as these we could talk about the 
need for the industry to regulate itself. That is something of 
which the industry would be in favour and in which industry 
would be willing to negotiate and get involved.
<P>
	Some amendments should be put forward to this bill. I can 
think of numerous things. Again I want to mention the idea of 
protection for the consumer and those involved in the industry.
<P>
	Canadians want the safety that this bill will provide for them 
in areas like the illegal and undeclared importation of plants, 
plant products, meat or meat products. It is a serious concern 
because of the probable introduction of plant or animal diseases. 
Those could cost millions of taxpayers' dollars for control and 
elimination. When we look at a $500 billion plus debt, everyone 
in this House would agree that we have to be concerned and 
make sure that we do not spend any taxpayers' dollars than is 
absolutely necessary.
<P>
	The current process involves prosecution in the courts which 
really has not been all that effective. There are also limited 
alternatives in the current system to enforce compliance. This 
bill proposes the implementation of a ticketing offence proce-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9520"> 9520 </A></B>
<P>
dure at ports of entry in the hope of increasing efficiency and 
effectiveness in dealing with this problem.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	The second point I would like to make is that Canadians want 
less but more effective regulatory burden. Overall the 
streamlining of the regulatory process is a very worthy goal, as 
is reducing court costs and the associated regulatory burden.
<P>
	With this process however, will there be a bottleneck and an 
overload of people wanting to pursue the compliance agreement 
process? What industries have asked for development of this 
legislation or something similar to it? Are there any companies 
out there that would be opposed to this type of legislation? If so, 
why?
<P>
	Assuming we already agree with the regulations under the 
eight agriculture acts I can personally support in principle 
measures which would increase compliance with this legislation 
and the regulations.
<P>
	The decriminalization of the federal regulatory offences is an 
important component. It would reduce the burden of the 
criminal court system, but will it reduce the likelihood of 
violations since the consequences will be less likely to include 
criminal prosecution? This probably would not be the case for 
individuals but perhaps for large corporations, if they would 
rather absorb a monetary penalty as opposed to a criminal 
penalty which could mean the loss of their licence. The 
compliance record would be wiped clean after five years which 
could make this route more appealing to some.
<P>
	The examples I have developed which would likely be treated 
as violations could include things such as unsanitary facilities in 
a meat processing establishment or the mislabelling of 
agriculture products. Examples of a contravention which would 
likely be treated as a criminal offence could include taking an 
animal out of quarantine and marketing it, thereby endangering 
the health of consumers.
<P>
	The main goal of compliance instead of punishment does 
seem agreeable. Transport Canada, by the way, and employment 
and immigration use the administrative monetary penalty 
system at this point in time.
<P>
	The third point I would like to make is: How much power do 
we want to give to the minister? The powers granted to the 
minister are extensive. He may make regulations which decide 
what constitutes a violation and what constitutes an offence. In 
the case of a violation, he can decide whether it is minor, serious 
or very serious and set penalties for each violation. In my mind I 
can see a scenario taking place sometime in the future, whether 
it is next year or 10 years down the road where any particular 
minister could in effect wield power and clout that could be far 
beyond what he or she should be allowed to do.
<P>
	I can see the possibility of this getting very political. 
Someone who did not support any particular party and ran a 
corporation for instance could be in trouble with any particular 
minister should that minister decide the corporation is close to 
the line. The minister would have the option to decide what 
would be a violation and what would be a criminal offence. That 
scares me.
<P>
	Right now the minister is given the power to decide whether a 
contravention should be treated as a violation or an offence. The 
fines we have talked about. There is no need to go into the 
increase in fines. There is no problem with that.
<P>
	The fourth point I would like to make concerns the board of 
arbitration. My colleague from Vegreville mentioned it and I 
certainly am in agreement with him. It is important that we have 
a board of arbitration. I would like very much before the board is 
appointed to have the appointees brought before the Standing 
Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food for a good hard look 
at who these people might be.
<P>
	I wonder if these types of regulations will be binding upon all, 
including the big players. We have seen the problem of 
backtracking where millions of dollars are wasted every year.
<P>
	This Transport Canada system certainly has not solved the 
problem. Is this a reluctance to go after the major players in the 
industry? The railways have not been punished in the past for 
failure to perform their duties. This type of system is only useful 
if it is applied fairly and uniformly, but with so much power 
given to the minister there is really no assurance of that.
<P>
	Let us not forget that one of the main causes of regulation 
violation is business frustration with the regulatory and taxation 
burden. Therefore, one of the best things the government could 
do in my mind to increase regulatory compliance is to lower the 
input costs for doing business, lower the tax burden and thereby 
increase the profitability margin. My thinking on this is that 
happy campers are compliant campers and they are good 
campers.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	Speaking of the non-criminal remedies available to the 
government departments, I would ask if the minister of 
agriculture would offer some of his advice to the Minister of 
Justice who wants to make criminals out of law-abiding gun 
owners.
<P>
	In conclusion, as I mentioned at the outset, there are some 
good points in this bill. For me to stand here and say that I 
personally would oppose this bill based on the theory would be 
wrong for me to do and I certainly will not do that. As I have 
mentioned two or three times during my speech, there are some 
areas we have to look at which could be subject to amendments, 
certainly the major one being the powers given to the minister.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, comments have been made about the hon. minister of 
agriculture being heavy handed but there have been no 
specifics. The comments have been long on rhetoric but short 
on specifics.
<P>
	With the quick resolution of the dispute over durum wheat 
exports to the United States, does the hon. member feel that is 
heavy handed on the part of the minister of agriculture? Does the 
hon. member consider the minister's acting to protect our supply 
management system in parts of Canada protecting the best food 
supply system perhaps in the world is being heavy handed? Does 
the hon. member feel that acting with due haste to make sure the 
regulatory system in Canada particularly in areas like the 
biotech industry and trying to streamline it and getting it done 
very quickly is perhaps another example of the minister being 
heavy handed?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kerpan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I know my hon. colleague was 
listening to my speech because I saw him listening to my speech. 
But if he had been truly listening he would have heard me clearly 
say that it would not necessarily be this minister, it could be any 
minister. It could be any minister now or in the future who could 
be heavy handed and could take absolute control of this 
regulatory process.
<P>
	The member stated I was short on specifics and has asked that 
I give specifics. I would suggest that the Minister of Agriculture 
and Agri-Food has been somewhat short on action. When I look 
at things like the backhauling issue, and I know that will be 
coming up in this House very shortly, I realize this has been 
going on for over a year and no one has bothered to stop it. That 
would be my response to my hon. colleague.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I too was listening very attentively to the remarks of 
the member for Moose Jaw-Lake Centre. I too have a little 
difficulty with his suggestion that this would give too much 
power to the minister. He offers as an alternative the setting up 
of a tribunal which would look after this type of thing.
<P>
	I point out to him that his party and another colleague in the 
House have spoken out very eloquently many times against the 
refugee board in another context suggesting that it is another 
tribunal which is a waste of taxpayers' money. Now we hear the 
hon. member proposing yet another tribunal which would draw 
on the public purse. Would he explain the economics of that for 
me, please?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kerpan:</B> Mr. Speaker, first I would like to say to the hon. 
member that there are certainly differences between good 
tribunals and bad tribunals.
<P>
	The concept of the tribunal is already laid out in Bill C-61. I 
personally do not have a major problem with the idea or the 
theory of a tribunal. The concern I have is that tribunals could be 
very susceptible to political patronage appointments.
<P>
	We have seen that. Look at the current Minister of Agriculture 
and Agri-Food and some of the appointments which have taken 
place over the past six months to a year. Look through the 
records. There is clearly a trend to political appointments. That 
is my concern with an appointed tribunal.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	All I have said is that any proposed tribunal should go to the 
Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food before its 
members are accepted. Obviously there would be a huge Liberal 
majority in the standing committee. That is a given, but let us 
have the opportunity to discuss it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Prince Albert-Churchill River, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when the act makes reference to the 
minister, it does not mean the minister, it means the department. 
Therefore the idea that there would be some interference by the 
minister is completely inappropriate.
<P>
	With these types of regulations the minister does not even see 
or become aware of their enforcement. They are handled at the 
departmental or administrative level. That is the first 
clarification we need to make.
<P>
	First you indicate that there needs to be-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> While we are on the 
merits of clarification, let me clarify a good rule of the House. 
That is to direct interventions to the Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> Mr. Speaker, it has only been 15 months; I will 
be getting the hang of it shortly.
<P>
	The hon. member wants a streamlined system. Right now the 
only way to enforce these types of regulations is through the 
courts. Now the hon. member wishes to set up a tribunal system 
which is just another court. This is in fact increasing the 
regulation and the steps people have to take to solve the 
problem.
<P>
	What is being suggested here is that you cannot have it both 
ways. Either the system is simplified by delegating the authority 
to the department or it goes through the courts.
<P>
	I might add that this type of process is ultimately subject to an 
appeal to the Federal Court which will deal with any of the 
concerns the hon. member has. If he still has concerns, I would 
like to hear them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kerpan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I heard something that I will ask 
the member later if he would clarify it with me. He said in his 
comments it is the department to appoint these boards or to 
make these regulations. Then what would the minister's job be? 
Does that mean the tail should wag the dog? I think I heard 
something to that effect.
<P>
	If the member would look at Bill C-61, he knows there is a 
tribunal already in place for these types of things. It is nothing 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9522"> 9522 </A></B>
<P>
new. It is nothing that I have said should happen. It is something 
which came through the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I heard the hon. member across the way talk about 
the issue of these appointments to the board. He indicated these 
appointments should be reviewed by a parliamentary 
committee.
<P>
	I am wondering if he is familiar with the fact that the present 
House rules provide that any parliamentary committee can 
review orders in council that are referred to it. All orders in 
council are referred to a parliamentary committee which has 30 
days to make such a review.
<P>
	Perhaps he could tell us how many times he has availed 
himself of that process.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kerpan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the member's 
comments. As a member of the Standing Committee on 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, I would like to have the opportunity 
to review these appointments at the nomination stage rather than 
at the appointment stage. I will keep that in mind the next time 
we do have orders in council. As a member of the standing 
committee I can ask for that.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I intend to support Bill C-61 in the name of my 
hon. colleague the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food.
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-61 introduces an administrative monetary penalty 
system that should result in a higher rate of compliance with the 
regulations respecting imported or domestic agri-food 
products. It would also enable employees of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food Canada to more effectively enforce federal 
regulations.
<P>
	Under the current system the only options available to 
regional inspectors are to give warnings, to seize or detain 
products that are not in compliance with standards, and to 
prosecute alleged violations in the courts. Although recourse to 
the courts is sometimes necessary, in most cases it is preferable 
not to proceed through the criminal justice system. This saves 
time and money.
<P>
	We all know how costly the criminal justice process can be 
both to government and the private sector. Moreover criminal 
prosecution is usually considered an excessive reaction to 
regulatory violations as it can lead to a criminal record and 
imprisonment. As a result we had to find effective mechanisms 
that were as non-coercive as possible to bring firms into 
compliance with our regulations.
<P>
	In my view the administrative monetary penalty system is the 
best approach for decriminalizing violations of the regulations. 
It brings these regulations into the 21st century for higher 
efficiency.
<P>
	As the name suggests, the administrative monetary penalty 
system provides for a broad range of monetary penalties for 
enforcing Canadian regulations respecting agriculture and 
agri-food products. For instance, small fines would be issued 
for minor violations while larger penalties would be issued for 
more serious offences. That being said, Bill C-61 precludes 
criminal prosecution in cases of serious and repeated violations. 
However the criminal justice system would only be used as a last 
resort when all other options have failed.
<P>
	The centrepiece of Bill C-61 is the compliance agreements 
that can be negotiated under AMPS. Officials representing 
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada would have the authority to 
negotiate the terms of compliance agreements with offenders. In 
addition, inspectors would be able to reduce or waive fines if the 
offender takes the necessary steps to ensure future compliance. 
Inspectors would obtain assurances that corrective action would 
be made at the source.
<P>
	In some cases this might involve upgrading a plant, replacing 
obsolete equipment, making changes to manufacturing 
processes or implementing a more stringent quality control 
system. In other cases proper employee training at the plant 
might remedy the situation. In brief the inspectors would have 
credible indicators that the problem would be resolved in the 
very short term.
<P>
	The objective of Bill C-61 is not to punish offenders. In fact 
offenders can completely avoid penalties by taking immediate 
corrective action. It is clear this is the best way to achieve 
co-operation from violators without delays in a very precious 
time frame.
<P>
	A monetary penalty system similar to that proposed by Bill 
C-61 is already being used successfully by Transport Canada 
and several departments in the United States. In their experience 
nine out of ten offenders pay their fines outright. As a result very 
few cases go before a review tribunal or court of appeal.
<P>
	On the basis of this experience it looks in the future like 
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada would be in a much better 
position to carry out its broader control activities.
<P>
	As we know, the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food 
must inspect plants and animal products imported into Canada 
by the travelling public. Among other things, plants, skins, live 
animals and meat products must be declared to protect the 
agri-food sector and consumers against the potential risks of 
exotic disease.
<P>
	In addition, inspectors are permanently assigned to most ports 
of entry to control the safety of food products and to ensure 
compliance with regulations. This aspect is of critical 
importance for Canadian firms that compete directly with 
imported products.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9523"> 9523 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	The program review currently under way at Agriculture and 
Agri-Food Canada is clearly favourable to the implementation 
of the administrative monetary penalty system. It is felt that 
inspectors need this tool to improve the efficiency and the 
effectiveness of the regulatory system.
<P>
	Canadian agri-food organizations feel that the new system is 
essential given the current context of the liberalization of trade. 
I should also mention that the United States, Mexico and a 
number of countries of the European community have already 
implemented monetary penalty systems. The implementation of 
Bill C-61 would ensure a level playing field for everyone.
<P>
	To conclude, the administrative monetary penalty system 
would facilitate the job of inspectors and give them the tools 
they need to be more effective in enforcing regulations. This 
would improve our business relations with foreign firms and 
would ensure compliance of both domestic and imported 
agri-food products with Canada's regulatory system.
<P>
	The bill ensures the fundamental controls and regulations are 
in place to take Canada into the 21st century. At the same time it 
ensures a quality and safe supply of food to Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we had an 
interesting interchange a few moments ago on the issue of 
appointments to boards and how those appointments are 
reviewed in committee.
<P>
	I would be quite interested in the member's comments. When 
those appointments are reviewed, would she think it was better 
to review them at the nomination stage or at the appointment 
stage? If the member feels it is okay to nominate at the 
appointment stage, how many times have board appointments 
been turned down in the history of Canadian Parliament?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brushett:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. I understand the system has been in place probably as 
long as the House of Commons, the Parliament of Canada.
<P>
	As the hon. member recognizes, from community and 
municipal governments to provincial and federal governments it 
is necessary that citizens become involved. They should take 
part in the process of government. The names of those citizens 
come from throughout society. It has been my experience to 
keep a resume, as I have at the municipal and provincial levels 
of government, of citizens in the community who are prepared to 
give their time, energy and commitment to the process of fair 
and equitable government and to give their intelligence, which 
is what is required in managing the regulations and boards in our 
government process.
<P>
	The government is prepared to receive names at any time from 
all citizens in society who may be prepared to participate in the 
democratic process.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
whole issue of the board and how it is going to resolve disputes 
or complaints is very important.
<P>
	Let us look at the parole board. It is an appointed body. The 
Immigration and Refugee Board is another appointed body. I 
believe the CRTC falls in the same category. There are 
numerous other ad hoc appointments, crown prosecutors for 
one. Now we are looking at an agricultural board. Each one has a 
similar problem.
<P>
	How much more accountable is the minister without the board 
than the board having no accountability to the minister? The 
ministers across the way time and time again have stated that 
they cannot intervene or interfere with a quasi-judicial body and 
the matters are never resolved.
<P>
	What makes the hon. member think this board will not suffer 
from the same problem that all other quasi-judicial bodies under 
the government suffer?
<P>
<B>(1355 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brushett:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe the hon. member is 
missing a fundamental point in the bill. The bill is classified in 
specific violations: a minor violation, a serious violation or a 
very serious violation. These violations will be classified 
according to regulatory personnel, the public servants of 
Canada. The minister, the bill and the process today which you 
are part of-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. When whoever is 
in the Chair rises, I would ask your co-operation in giving up the 
floor. Obviously I rise for a reason.
<P>
	I want to remind colleagues once again that when addressing 
any issue all interventions should be made through the Speaker. 
As debates sometimes take on greater emotion and more passion 
it becomes even more important to our parliamentary process.
<P>
	I would like to verify if the member for 
Cumberland-Colchester had concluded her remarks.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brushett:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I heard a 
couple of comments and I would ask for some clarification from 
the previous speaker.
<P>
	The member said that civil servants and bureaucrats would 
have the opportunity to reduce and waive fines. That to me 
seems to destroy the whole system of credibility, 
trustworthiness and fairness.
<P>
	If we are to allow people who break the regulations, break the 
law, to be able to negotiate with public servants about whether or 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9524"> 9524 </A></B>
<P>
not they will be fined for doing so opens a whole situation for 
bribery, corruption and puts the whole regulatory process into 
question.
<P>
	I wanted the member to comment on another point. She said 
small fines for small offences. Last year a I saw bill passed in the 
House that required a book publisher to send two books to the 
national library. Failure to do so used to account for a fine of up 
to $200. That was changed to a fine of $25,000 for failure to send 
two books to the national library.
<P>
	When the member says small fines for small offences, could 
she clarify what she means?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We are running a bit tight. Perhaps the hon. 
member could think about the response and give it after question 
period. I hope I never borrow those two books at that price; it is a 
bit up there.
<P>
	It being 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 30(5), the House 
will now proceed to Statements by Members pursuant to 
Standing Order 31.

	<B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I draw to 
the attention of the House the Black Creek Orphans' Project in 
Mbiko, Uganda. This impressive international development 
initiative was started by Billy Vlaad and Kristi Taylor, two of my 
constituents in their early twenties from Espanola, Ontario. 
Theirs is an example of the good news the new Governor 
General asked us to speak about.
<P>
	While Billy and Kristi were participating in a university 
sponsored development project in Uganda a couple of years ago, 
local residents expressed a desire to see the development of a 
program that would instil pride and self-sufficiency among the 
residents and many orphans in the village of Mbiko. The Black 
Creek Orphans' Project assists the guardians of local orphans in 
setting up business ventures through a capital loans system and 
access to technical and business skills training. The profits from 
these business ventures will be used to fund educational 
opportunities for orphans under their care.
<P>
	Mr. Vlaad and Ms. Taylor returned to Canada from the site of 
their project in Uganda several months ago to work on the 
Canadian portion of their organization. Since that time they 
have obtained charitable status designation from Revenue 
Canada. We should applaud their worthy efforts on behalf of the

<P>
	We now know what this taxpayers' money is being used for: to

	We understand why these civil servants shun the cameras, 
why their offices are all unmarked and why their names do not

	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
year ago I asked the Solicitor General why we were not able to 
kick Mr. Colin Wood, a non-resident, out of Canada after he 
committed his first serious offence. At that time the Solicitor 
General responded that it was a policy that somebody convicted 
of an offence should serve the sentence imposed by law. He 
stated: ``If my hon. friend's proposal were followed we would be 
doing the convicted foreigner a favour by getting him out of the 
country before he paid the penalty required by Canadian law''.
<P>
	Why is it that suddenly out of the blue the chairman of the 
standing committee on justice asked: ``Why spend any money 
on them at all? Let us kick them out right away''. Is this another 
example of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is 
doing? Is the Solicitor General now prepared to support getting 
rid of non-citizen criminals as suggested by the committee 
chairman?
<P>
	When will this government get its act together and tell us what 
it intends to do with foreign criminals? Now is the time to act.

for centuries, the Gwich'in people rely on the caribou for food. 
However, this resource is  threatened by a recent Alaska

serious danger.

the attention of this honourable House the name Vera Clyke. 
Mrs. Clyke's family came to Canada from the United States in 
1860, seeking freedom from slavery and discrimination.
<P>
	As choir director and organist for Zion Baptist Church in 
Truro, she has served faithfully since 1927, some 68 years. In 
1965 she represented Nova Scotia in the Dominion Day 
celebrations on Parliament Hill.

community and I presented certificates on behalf of the Prime 
Minister, the hon. Secretary of State for Multiculturalism and 
the Status of Women, the hon. Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration and myself, duly recognizing her leadership, her 
community participation and model citizenship.

	By all community standards Vera Clyke is an outstanding 
Canadian, and at the age of 86 she continues to play the church

governing financial institutions are brought up to date, the 
Government of Canada will ensure the system is more effective. 
We will continue to have the confidence of the Canadian people 
as they will have greater access to information and a fiscally 
responsible method of ensuring that their rights as financial 
consumers are protected.
<P>
	By addressing those elements of our financial system that 
need closer scrutiny and by preserving those aspects that have 
served Canadians well, the proposals outlined  in the white 
paper will build on the positives and minimize the negatives.
<P>
	I applaud the call for enhanced disclosure of financial 
information, earlier intervention in problem institutions, 
increased protection for policy holders and a stronger 
framework within which systemic risk will be controlled.
<P>
	These proposals will work to strengthen Canada's financial 
system and demonstrate our government's commitment to the 
financial security and well-being of its citizens.

	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies,

be part of GATT and NAFTA, the Prime Minister has once again, 
for lack of other arguments, resorted to scare tactics. With his 
remarks, the Prime Minister is increasing the risk that his own 
people of Saint-Maurice will be isolated.
<P>
	The Prime Minister is also going against the interests of the 
rest of Canada for which maintaining trade with Quebec will 
continue to be an unavoidable necessity. The most recent poll by 
Léger &amp; Léger indicates that nearly 60 per cent of English 
Canadians would want to maintain economic ties with a 
sovereign Quebec.
<P>
	Nor is there any doubt that provisions under GATT and 
NAFTA will effectively apply to a sovereign Quebec, the second 
most important trading partner for the rest of Canada and the 
eighth most important for the United States.

Mr. Speaker, the federal government, particularly the Minister

respond quickly to the recommendations made by the royal 
commission on aboriginal peoples in its special report on 
suicide among aboriginal people released last week.
<P>
	The royal commission argues that there has been a steady 
stream of studies and reports by aboriginal and non-aboriginal 
analysts over at least 20 years which has called attention to the 
problem of suicide among aboriginal people but there has been 
little result. The studies and reports have presented a long march 
of compelling evidence that aboriginal people have been dying 
by their own hands much too often and for far too long. Yet 
Canadian governments have never made suicide prevention a 
high priority issue for themselves.
<P>
	The royal commission's recommendations stress the urgency 
of this significant matter. This time the federal government must 
respond quickly and adequately to ensure that the long process 
of healing can finally begin.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
following the recent revelations concerning the existence of a 
third videotape involving the airborne regiment in Petawawa, 
the minister of defence gave one press conference after another 
and said that the situation was totally bizarre. Obviously 
overtaken by the events, the minister has lost control of his 
department.
<P>
	Now that the minister has decided to dismantle the 2nd 
Airborne Regiment, are we to understand that the removal of 
Major-General Vernon, who was designated as scapegoat, 
constitutes phase II of the minister's strategy to bury the 
Petawawa powder keg without getting to the bottom of this 
matter?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the chief of 
defence staff today relieved Major-General Vernon of all of his 
responsibilities as commander, land forces command which is in 
effect Ontario central command.
<P>
	He did this because General Vernon was the author of a report 
to the chief of the army, Lieutenant-General Reay, to General de 
Chastelain and myself concerning the activities of the airborne 
regiment with respect to what has become known as the second 
video.
<P>
	The three of us were misled. As a result the chief of defence 
staff, who is the one responsible for all disciplinary measures 
within the Canadian Armed Forces, has taken the appropriate 
action today.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, can the 
minister of defence tell us if the decision to relieve 
Major-General Vernon of his duties is based solely on the fact 
that he played down the contents of the third videotape or if, 
following his recent investigation, the minister has learned 
other, more serious facts of which he had not been informed?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I answered 
that question. I quote from the chief of defence staff that the 
reason General Vernon was removed from his duties was 
because the report, which I have just mentioned, contains 
inaccurate and misleading information that caused the chief of 
defence staff to misinform the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, can the 
minister of defence tell us if, in addition to removing 
Major-General Vernon, the minister intends to take disciplinary 
measures against other Petawawa officers, including those who 
attended or took part in the events recorded on the videotapes?

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance. In 
anticipation of the federal-provincial meeting of finance 
ministers scheduled for tomorrow, the provinces have cautioned 
Ottawa against the temptation to cut federal transfer payments 
to the provinces, thus irresponsibly shovelling its deficit into 
their back yards. The provinces clearly refuse to be left holding 
the bag as Ottawa withdraws its financial support for social 
programs.

<HR>
<B><A NAME="9529"> 9529 </A></B>
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance undertake tomorrow to transfer 
to the provinces not only the responsibility for social programs, 
but also adequate fiscal resources to fund these programs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I discussed with 
the provincial finance ministers ages ago the fact that we would 
not do as the previous government did and cause surprises. And 
we certainly have no intention of causing any surprises 
tomorrow.
<P>
	We have a deficit at the national level. The provinces 
certainly realize it and they have asked us to really start cutting 
from our end, which we intend to do. I think the system needs to 
be changed at the national level, at the provincial level. 
Everybody agrees on this and that is what we intend to do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, does the Minister of Finance recognize that, as the 
Saskatchewan finance minister suggested, it would be hard and 
appalling for Ottawa, following an eventual withdrawal, to ask 
the provinces to cut social program spending while at the same 
time imposing national or Canada-wide standards, whatever 
they are called?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I must tell you that 
the vast majority of provinces certainly realize the situation this 
government is in. In fact, several of them are facing exactly the 
same situation. But at the same time I think there is a realization 
that we all have to work together.
<P>
	Allow me to quote the Premier of Newfoundland, who said 
this morning that potential cuts in transfer payments worried 
him, but that he would support these cuts because what matters 
above all is that the national government put its fiscal house in 
order. I think that Mr. Wells is voicing an opinion that I have 
heard from the vast majority of the other provinces.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in an interview over the weekend, the finance minister 
said that any tax hikes in this month's budget will be taken from 
the top first. What Canadians want is for the government to start 
at the top with spending cuts, not tax increases.
<P>
	For example, the government is going to spend $12 million to 
build an office tower in Sault Ste. Marie, a city that already has 
one of the highest vacancy rates in the country.
<P>
	Why does the finance minister continue to propose tax 
increases when there is still so much visible waste and 
inefficiency in government spending? Why not wring that 
inefficiency and waste out of the government before they wring 
more dollars out of taxpayers' pockets?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government is 
very conscious of the degree to which Canadians feel they bear 
too great a tax burden.
<P>
	The government is also very much aware of the degree of 
waste that exists in any large institution and certainly within the 
institution of government. That is why over the course of the last 
budget we did not increase taxes. It is the first time in a long 
time that has happened.
<P>
	It is also the reason the Minister responsible for Public 
Service Renewal has worked so hard along with the President of 
the Treasury Board to eliminate waste in the operations of 
government and why we have been able to make, over the course 
of the year, a series of announcements on the elimination of 
boards and commissions that have waste.
<P>
	This is one case where action speaks louder than words. We 
have demonstrated very strong action.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this wringing of waste has a long way to go. Twelve 
million dollars for an office building in Sault Ste. Marie is just 
the tip of the iceberg. Many federal bureaucrats are trying to 
blow out their remaining budgets before the end of the fiscal 
year.
<P>
	Both the department of furniture and oceans and the 
department of public works are spending $10 million on 
unnecessary computers-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am sure the hon. member inadvertently 
mentioned another department.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sorry. The Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans and the department of public works are 
spending close to $10 million on unnecessary computer 
upgrades; over $15 million is earmarked for getting a fax 
machine on virtually every public servant's desk. That is $37 
million in unnecessary expenditures right there.
<P>
	My question is for finance minister. In the name of common 
sense and in the name of taxpayer relief, will the finance 
minister order an immediate freeze on such unnecessary capital 
expenditures until the budget is balanced?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can assure the 
hon. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9530"> 9530 </A></B>
<P>
member, and this will become very clear in the budget, that both 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and the minister of public 
works have gone at their departments very hard in terms of 
waste and the kind of  unfortunate management practices they 
inherited from a previous government.
<P>
	I hope the leader of the third party will support all members of 
cabinet who have gone at their departments tooth and comb, line 
by line, to eliminate the kind of waste that we inherited as a 
result of the activities of the previous government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the ministers are going after waste and inefficiency 
with the vigour that the finance minister suggests, why do we 
continually, day after day, see these illustrations such as the 
office building in Sault Ste. Marie and the unnecessary 
computer expenditures?
<P>
	If there has been this huge, deep, passionate commitment to 
eliminating waste, why do these instances continue to show 
themselves day after day after day?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, to be an effective 
member of Parliament one must have all the facts.
<P>
	The hon. member opposite has forgotten to share with the 
House the fact that the building which is to be constructed in 
Sault Ste. Marie will save the taxpayers of Canada $500,000 per 
year in operating costs.
<P>
	It is becoming a common occurrence with the hon. member 
that he stands in his place and gives certain information which I 
would suggest is somewhat inaccurate. The software to which 
the hon. member refers will save the government $4.6 million.

	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs. In its statement 
of policy last week, the government set human rights as a matter 
for priority action in its foreign policy. It is therefore not clear 
why Canada is not speaking out on the intensified intervention 
of the Mexican army in Chiapas.
<P>
	How could the Canadian government close its eyes to what is 
happening in Mexico, one of its principal economic partners, as 
the army is bombarding civilian groups in an attempt to stop the 
Zapatista movement?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, the government's eyes are wide open and watching 
the events in Mexico very closely. Clearly, we do not want this 
situation to end in reprehensible acts of violence. We have 
always advocated moderation and particularly efforts at 
conciliation between the parties in order to bring about a 
peaceful solution to the crisis in Chiapas.
<P>
	The Canadian government's position is well known, and I 
cannot accept the comments by the hon. member, who is well 
aware of the government's position and is trying to make 
political points over a very serious situation.
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is why 
we are here, to make political points.
<P>
	How can the Canadian government, which claims to be 
concerned about human rights, allow the Mexican authorities to 
deny access to the press in the areas of conflict and does it intend 
to intervene directly with the Mexican government in order to 
promote respect for human rights in Chiapas?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his candour. It is very 
clear why he is in politics, and I find it absolutely reprehensible.
<P>
	The situation in Mexico is serious. A remarkable job is being 
done by Canadians, working through non governmental 
organizations, with the support of the Canadian international 
development agency and Canadian groups promoting peace and 
the protection of individual rights and freedoms. I believe the 
hon. member knows perfectly well that everyone working there

	Unquestionably, the airborne has suffered from command and 
control problems, but Canadians' sense of fair play does not 
support the punishment of a whole regiment for the 
unacceptable actions of a few. They recognize, as does the 
minister, the continuing need for a quick reaction force.
<P>
	There is a compromise available. Will the minister consider 
the following course of action: suspend airborne operations 
rather than disband the regiment, then suspend all courts martial

<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Canadian Airborne Regiment was disbanded for the reasons 
given a couple of weeks ago. There will be no reconsideration 
of that decision. It is firm, it is fixed and it is final.
<P>
	With respect to the airborne capability to which the hon. 
member refers, that can be discharged in any number of ways. 
General Reay, who is in charge of land forces, has been tasked to 
come up with alternative arrangements to ensure there is the 
airborne capability in the armed forces.
<P>
	Last, I have repeated this so many times. A full inquiry which 
will be public and will be headed by a civilian will look into all 
the matters concerning the deployment of the airborne to 
Somalia in 1992 and 1993. That will begin as soon as the last 
court martial is terminated.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is now clear that the hazing rituals are not limited to 
the airborne. They exist in the parent regiments. They exist in 
the navy. The so-called systemic troubles for which the minister 
disbanded the airborne are widespread.
<P>
	Will the minister accept that leadership from the top and not 
behaviour at the bottom is the real problem in the Canadian 
forces, or does he eventually plan to disband his whole 
department?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the 
unfortunate events shown in the videos relating to ceremonies 
involving the airborne have enlightened Canadians, perhaps 
somewhat in a negative way, as to some of the traditions in the 
armed forces.
<P>
	Another tape was released a few days ago. I am glad the navy 
was quick to correct the record. It felt that ordinary members of 
the public would have the reaction I had which was that at first 
blush it seemed to be quite offensive. It corrected that 
impression.
<P>
	Because of all of these questions that have been raised, the 
chief of defence staff will be bringing all of the commanders to 
Ottawa this week to talk about these matters: what is 
permissible, what is not permissible; what is in the military 
tradition and what is not. Once he has a chance to talk with the 
commanders and they then inform the troops under their 
command across the country, this matter will come to rest.

worst environmental disaster in Canada, the Sydney tar ponds.
<P>
	Over the last nine years both the federal and provincial 
governments have been working on an incinerator to burn over 
700,000 tonnes of toxic waste which includes PCBs and a deadly 
brew of various hydrocarbons. Nine years and $55 million later, 
the project still does not work.
<P>
	Can the environment minister justify why the people of 
Sydney, Nova Scotia now have the highest cancer rate in North 
America and the government waste, mismanagement and 
inaction on the cleanup of this toxic cesspool?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am glad the member 
has brought to the attention of the House that indeed there is an 
investment of $55 million to clean up tar ponds that obviously 
took many years to build up.
<P>
	As one whose grandfather was born there I know the sacrifices 
of the people in the Sydney area. I know the sacrifices of 
industrial workers who have lived with pollution for eight 
decades of this century.
<P>
	The Sydney tar ponds cleanup is proceeding. The level of 
incineration at the moment is being examined regularly to 
ensure that the health and safety of the people in the area is not 
affected. We hope the cleanup of this mess will not take the 
decades it took to accumulate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would disagree with the minister. Her own project manager says 
the project does not work. It is going to have to go out to private 
tender to make it work.
<P>
	The Canadian Council of Environment Ministers agreed to a 
set of environmental guidelines for the burning of toxic waste. 
Both the Nova Scotia minister and the federal minister are

	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Indian Affairs. According to audit 
reports that the minister received on census surveys of 
aboriginal people living on reserves, the government continues 
to use incomplete, unreliable and questionable data, to quote the 
exact terms used in the reports. In June, the opposition brought 
this situation to the minister's attention.
<P>
	Will the minister tell us whether Statistics Canada's census 
takers will have access to reserves in the future in order to take 
exact population counts, since grants for aboriginal people are 
calculated on a per capita basis?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sure after 15 months the 
hon. member knows this. Most of the social programs we do on 
First Nations are not based on Statistics Canada figures. When 
we build a school, we go in there and count the number of 
students, whether it is an elementary school or a high school in 
some cases. Or, the Minister of Health will go in there with 
Operation Head Start. If it is a health facility the same applies.
<P>
	The only time we use statistics is when we fund tribal councils 
but we do not use those of Statistics Canada. Again we go in and 
count the numbers on site. This is the way it is done. The 
Statistics Canada figures are a tool that I use to check what we 
are doing, but no more or no less than a tool.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the 
minister admitted himself, he uses statistics for certain 
programs.
<P>
	Can the minister explain why eight months have gone by since 
he agreed that adjustments should be made, yet no corrective 
measures have been taken to ensure that the calculation of grants 
for bands are based on exact population counts of aboriginal 
people?
<P>

	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern

	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last June I asked the justice minister to undertake a 
national study to determine the source of firearms used in 
criminal activities. Despite assurances by his parliamentary 
secretary eight months later Canadians are still waiting.
<P>
	Three months ago I put a question on the Order Paper asking 
how many registered gun owners used their guns in the 
commission of a crime anywhere in Canada.
<P>
	My question for the Minister of Justice is simple. By its own 
admission the government has no comprehensive statistics on 
which if any of the more than 1.2 million registered guns in the 
country were used for criminal activity. Therefore how can he 
defend spending millions of dollars on gun registration as a 
solution to crime when he has no proof that the legal owners of 
firearms are part of the problem?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when Canadians want 
advice on matters of health they go to physicians. When they 
want to know about the law they go to lawyers. When Canadians 
want advice on what to do about crime and community safety 
they go to the police.
<P>
	The police in the country have for 10 years been calling upon 
the federal government to introduce a national system of 
registration. As recently as last summer the Canadian 
Association of Chiefs of Police passed a resolution exactly to 
that effect. I take that as pretty solid advice.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the justice minister for the answer.
<P>
	I do not know whom he has spoken with but over past months I 
have spoken with and listened to a number of police officers 
both in my riding and across the country. I have yet to find a 
police officer below the rank of superintendent or chief of police 
who believes universal gun registration will do anything to 
prevent crime.
<P>
<B>(1450 ) </B>

	For the minister's plan to work it must have the support of 
rank and file police officers whose lives are on the line. Could 
the minister provide the House with evidence of their support?

the hon. member that in the past the Canadian Police 
Association has passed resolutions favouring universal 
registration.
<P>
	May I also point out that in Edmonton last fall when this very 
controversy broke out and the police force, the constables, not 
the chiefs, were asked, 60 per cent in a plebiscite favoured 
registration of all firearms.

	Almost a year ago, the Government of Vietnam threw Tran 
Trieu Quan, a Canadian citizen, in jail without laying any 
charges against him. Last December, Hanoi, through the good 
offices of Canada's Department of Foreign Affairs, put a price 
on Mr. Tran's freedom by demanding that his family pay what 
amounts to a $100,000 ransom. Two weeks ago, the Vietnamese 
government withdrew this offer.

	How can the minister explain his decision to give Vietnam 
several millions of dollars in Canadian aid when that country

	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):

	Furthermore, I can assure Mr. Quan's family that the 
Government of Canada, through its ambassador and through the 
Prime Minister himself, who made direct representations to 
Vietnamese authorities during his trip, is pursuing this matter 
and trying to convince Vietnamese authorities to either bring 
specific charges against Mr. Quan or let him return to Canada.

	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, are we

	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Secretary of State for Science, Research and 
Development.
<P>
	In these difficult budgetary times I am deeply concerned 
about the risk of erosion of national institutions and processes. 
One example is our ability to do research and to train researchers 
in our national centres and ministries and in our colleges and 
universities.
<P>
	Can the minister assure us that he will nurture Canada's 
capacity to conduct creative research and to train young 
researchers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jon Gerrard (Secretary of State (Science, Research 
and Development), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in this age of doing 
more with fewer resources, our government has already 
provided leadership in launching initiatives like the Canadian 
technology network, the Canadian medical discovery fund, the 
technology partnerships program, the environmental industries 
initiative, phase II of CANARIE and PRECARN. These 
initiatives use very limited government resources to lever very 
substantial efforts in science and research and technology; 
efforts which meet the needs of Canadians, which provide 
exciting careers for young Canadians.
<P>
	I want to reassure the hon. member that even if our federal 
government resources are constricted in the short term, we shall 
not flag or fail in our efforts to be innovative, in our efforts to 
work with all Canadians to ensure a strong future.

	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise before this House on day six of this initiative to present 
petition No. 6 on behalf of constituents who wish to halt the 
early release from prison of Robert Paul Thompson. His date for 
parole hearing is set for April 11, 1995.
<P>
	The petitioners I represent are concerned about making our 
streets safer for our citizens. They are opposed to the current 
practice of early release of violent offenders prior to serving the 
full extent of their sentences.
<P>
	The petitioners pray that our streets will be made safer for

over 2,000 people from several communities in my constituency 
of Cariboo-Chilcotin.
<P>
	My constituents are of the opinion that existing controls on 
law-abiding, responsible firearms owners are more than enough 
to ensure public safety. They therefore call upon Parliament to 
support laws which will severely punish all violent criminals 
who use weapons in the commission of a crime and support new 
Criminal Code firearms control provisions which recognize and 
protect the rights of law-abiding citizens to own and use 
recreational firearms; support legislation which will repeal or 
modify existing gun control laws that have not improved public 
safety or have proven not to be cost effective or have proven to 
be overly complex so as to be ineffective or unenforceable.

this House amend the the laws of Canada to prohibit the 
important, distribution, sale or manufacture of killer cards in

destined for Canada will be seized and destroyed.

	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon 
(Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, Lib):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have three petitions, one of which calls upon Parliament to act 
quickly to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act to prohibit 
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and to adopt all 
necessary measures to recognize the full equality of same sex 
relationships in federal law.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today pursuant to Standing Order 36 on a 
petition with 44 signatures from my riding.
<P>
	The petitioners in my riding request that under the Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms we guarantee that everyone has the right to 
protection against discrimination and that the Government of 
Canada has recognized this including discrimination on the 
basis of sexual orientation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
pursuant to Standing Order 36 to present a petition on behalf of

	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
my great honour today to table in this House a petition bearing 
1,080 signatures from my riding.
<P>
	This petition denounces the government's proposal with 
respect to voice mail boxes. I am pleased to join with these many 
petitioners in the conviction that services must be adapted to 
users and not to bureaucratic machinery.
<P>
	Thus the people of Quebec City wish to draw the attention of 
Parliament to the following: Whereas senior citizens are 
naturally less experienced with the technology of voice mail; 
and whereas senior citizens are entitled to appropriate service, 
particularly in response to their income security inquiries, these 
petitioners call upon Parliament to ask the government to 
abandon its plan to install voice mail for senior citizens.

	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36, it pleases me to offer three 
petitions today. The first two come from in and around the city 
of Winnipeg, Manitoba with 300 signatures on pink paper from 
women who would like to draw to the attention of the House that 
the proposed amendments to firearm control legislation by the 
justice minister are unduly harsh and will waste dwindling 
financial resources while attacking the rights of law-abiding 
citizens without affecting crime.
<P>
	They request that the provisions be separated and that 
Parliament proceed to strengthen border patrols and strengthen 
measures to deal with the criminal use of firearms but not 
proceed with the proposed enhanced controls on legal ownership 
of firearms.
<P>
	There are 300 signatures on this petition from the women of 
Manitoba and I have an identical one with nearly 900 signatures 
from men.
<P>
	The third petition from Calgary requests that Parliament 
support laws which will severely punish all violent criminals 
who use weapons in the commission of crime, support new 
Criminal Code firearms control provisions which recognize and 
protect the rights of law-abiding citizens to own and use 
recreational firearms, and support legislation which will repeal 
and modify existing gun control laws which have not proved

pursuant to Standing Order 36 to present two petitions.

	The first states that the majority of Canadians respect the 
sanctity of human life and the majority of Canadians believe that 
physicians in Canada should be working to save lives, not to end 
them.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	Therefore the petitioners pray that Parliament ensure that the

<P>
	The petition states that public safety is the number one 
priority of the criminal justice system and that the target for all 
gun control laws in the Criminal Code of Canada must be that 
criminals are a danger to that public safety.
<P>
	These petitioners make three requests to Parliament. They ask 
Parliament to support laws that will severely punish all violent 
criminals. They ask Parliament to recognize the right of all 
law-abiding citizens to own and use firearms. They ask 
Parliament to support legislation that would repeal or modify 
existing firearms legislation that does not improve public

Canadian Human Rights Act or the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms in any way that would tend to indicate societal

including amending the Canadian Human Rights Act to include 
in the prohibited grounds of discrimination the undefined phrase 
sexual orientation. I table that with my approval.

my second petition requests that Parliament amend the Divorce 
Act to include a provision similar to article 611 of the Quebec 
Civil Code which states that in no case may a father or mother 
without serious cause place obstacles between the child and 
grandparents.
<P>
	Failing agreement between the parties, the modalities of the 
relations should be settled by court; further, an amendment to 
the Divorce Act should give a grandparent who is granted access

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="AGRICULTUREANDAGRI-FOODADMINISTRATIVEMONETARYPENALTIESACT">AGRICULTURE AND AGRI-FOOD ADMINISTRATIVE

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-61, an act to establish a system of administrative monetary 
penalties for the enforcement of the Canada Agricultural 
Products Act, the Feeds Act, the Fertilizers Act, the Health of 
Animals Act, the Meat Inspection Act, the Pest Control Products 
Act, the Plant Protection Act and the Seeds Act be read the 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues, the hon. member for 
Cumberland-Colchester was into questions and comments. I 
understand that eight minutes remain.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in response to the question that was put before 
question period by the hon. member concerning the regulatory 
process, it is the hope and expectation of the government that 
after consulting with industry the regulations would be 
designated as infractions, whether they were an offence of a 
minor nature, a more serious nature or a very serious nature. 
Those would be decided on in combination with the private 
sector of the resource that we are referring to, as well as 
government regulators. It would be dealt with in a very fair and 
reasonable manner and, as indicated earlier, would prohibit 
taking every single infraction to the courts, thus saving time and 
money.
<P>
	In response to the hon. member's second question regarding 
how regulators will be kept fair and honest, it is my assumption 
that public servants try to put in a fair day's work for a fair day's 
pay. In no way would they look aside or turn a blind eye when 
there may be infractions such as unsanitary conditions in a meat 
inspection plant, for example. In no way would they disregard 
that infraction when tainted meat could appear on supermarket 
shelves, which in turn might land on their own family's supper 
plate.
<P>
	I have every hope and expectation that the regulators of the 
Canadian public service will pursue this with all sincerity to 
ensure that we have a safe and quality food supply for all 
Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will go back 
to the question that was posed before question period. The hon. 
member did not answer it for me. It was a two-part question.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9540"> 9540 </A></B>
<P>
	Since an appointment by order in council has never been 
turned down in Canada's history, since a single individual has 
never been turned down, could the hon. member please 
comment for me on whether it would be better to review these 
appointments at the nomination stage rather than the 
appointment stage on committees.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brushett:</B> Mr. Speaker, again as I reiterated prior to 
question period, it is my understanding that many Canadians 
desire to serve in the public domain of Canada. They are sincere 
when taking on the responsibility of serving their communities, 
municipally, provincially and federally.
<P>
<B>(1520 ) </B>
<P>
	It is a grave responsibility but the people appointed desire to 
serve. It is to the benefit of the public. Canadians are responsible 
people. Look at volunteerism, the responsibility that they take 
for their communities. It would be a great burden to the country 
to pay for the work done through volunteerism.
<P>
	I believe the government is willing to listen to any name 
coming from any party as to who may be a responsible serving 
citizen.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, I know that sometimes a 
political answer is the only appropriate one. However, this is 
such a straightforward question.
<P>
	I would ask my question for the third time. I am not trying to 
be cute or tricky. Would it not be more appropriate to have the 
committee review the names that are to be presented at the 
nomination stage? Then the names go to the PMO and the PMO 
would pluck from that group of names to make the process 
useful.
<P>
	If there has never been in history a single person turned down 
for an order in council appointment, surely it is a sham. Should it 
not be nomination, review; appointment, no need to review.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brushett:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have one brief comment. I 
believe it is an insult to the integrity of the Canadian people. If 
their names are put forward at any level of government, they 
should participate in the democracy of the country.
<P>
	It has been in our interest throughout the history of this 
government to listen to those names.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in the House this afternoon to 
address this bill.
<P>
	I was looking at my notes and I realize they were written last 
October. We do not work very fast. I will try to refresh my 
memory as I speak from my notes.
<P>
	I will outline the concerns I have with this bill and how I see it 
affecting farmers in my region. When I am talking to farmers 
and tell them the fines will be $100,000 to $250,000 for 
non-compliance, they throw up their hands and say: ``Hey, 
we've never had money like that. How are we ever supposed to 
pay a fine?'' I always reassure them. ``Look at the positive side 
because you haven't had to pay the fine. At the speed this  
government works the Canadians dollar will probably be worth 
less than a Mexican peso, so it won't amount to too much''. That 
reassures them things are not going to go too fast.
<P>
	For instance, if the fine exceeds $2,000, the person named in 
the notice of violation can request a compliance agreement. The 
minister may request a security payment as a guarantee that the 
person will comply with the agreement. It will be returned when 
the minister deems the person has satisfactorily complied with 
the agreement.
<P>
	It really does not matter whether the violator feels he has 
complied. The minister will make the decision. That worries me 
somewhat.
<P>
	If the minister subsequently decides the person who has 
entered into the compliance agreement has not complied with 
the agreement, the minister can impose a penalty of twice the 
original amount and can retain any security given by the person 
who is deemed to be in violation. That is a very powerful tool. I 
cannot see how that can be accomplished in this bill or why it 
should be unless there is an agreement between the violator and 
the board that he did not comply.
<P>
	The board of arbitration appointed by the minister and the 
review tribunal appointed by the Governor in Council will settle 
disputes between buyers and sellers. The tribunal hears reviews 
of the minister's decision at the request of a person who has been 
deemed to be in violation of the act. I think that is a good 
procedure and could probably work, but I am very worried about 
when compliance is deemed to have been carried out and when 
not.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-61 greatly increases some of the fines for offences. 
These should not be confused with violations which will be dealt 
with through the agriculture monetary penalty contained in 
various agriculture acts. For example, it amends the Feeds Act 
to increase fines for an indictable offence from $1,000 to 
$250,000. That seems to be a huge increase and I hope I never 
have to pay one of these penalties because it would break me. It 
is intended to discourage someone from committing a 
contravention that would likely be pursued as an offence.
<P>
	One of the main areas of contention seems to be the board of 
arbitration and the review tribunals. Each of these bodies 
currently consists of between three to five members but Bill 
C-61 removes the limit to the number of board members. I feel 
this is a very grave error. It should have a cap on it because it can 
create another bureaucracy and could go to 20 or 30 members. 
We know what the costs would be for operating a board or a 
tribunal of that size. It also makes it very possible that we could 
have some more political appointments for people with close 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9541"> 9541 </A></B>
<P>
political ties who are out of jobs. It would be a nice place to find 
another job for them. I do not think we need that.
<P>
	The selection process does nothing to dissuade the patronage 
appointments. I believe that has been stressed this afternoon.
<P>
	A great deal of power is given to the minister. He can decide 
whether to pursue a contravention as a violation or as an offence 
and has leeway in setting or reducing or increasing fines. There 
is not much accountability built into this legislation.
<P>
	It really worries me when I see this kind of power given to a 
board or to a minister. The court system does not seem to be able 
to deal with some of these matters in a very efficient manner and 
it is a lengthy debate sometimes whether it is a violation that is 
serious or whether it is a violation that is moderate or maybe just 
a minor one.
<P>
	Clause 23, which is an amendment we proposed, would at 
least retain the violations to a 10-year period. I think it is of 
major importance that this amendment be passed if this bill does 
pass.
<P>
	Clause 28 is an amendment to remove the ceiling on the 
number of members on the board of arbitration. The amendment 
would propose to retain this ceiling. I support the amendment 
that there be a ceiling because we do not want another board or 
another review tribunal with about 30 people who we find are 
very expensive to maintain.
<P>
	An amendment proposed that would disqualify a public 
servant from being a member of the board of arbitration is a 
must. When a public servant ruled on an arbitration or sat on a 
tribunal board I would hesitate to go before a tribunal because 
the violator has very poor chance of getting a fair hearing.
<P>
	Illegal and undeclared importation of plant products, meat or 
meat products is a serious concern because the introduction of 
plant or animal diseases into Canada could cost millions of 
dollars for control or elimination. We had a very good example 
of what could happen when the Grandin issue come before the 
courts or before the government. When Grandin wheat was 
brought illegally into this country, for some reason the 
Department of Agriculture overstepped its bounds and took 
away the responsibility from excise and customs officers and 
allowed it to continue. That was a very serious violation of what 
the Customs Act should have been doing. It is an example that 
shows us very vividly how a minister or a department with too 
much power overrides issues and makes bad decisions.
<P>
	The current process involves prosecution in courts of law and 
has not been all that effective. There are limited alternatives in 
the current system to enforce compliance with the law outside of 
criminal prosecution which involves court costs and delays.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	The bill proposes implementation of a ticketing procedure at 
ports of entry into Canada in the hope of increasing efficiency 
and effectiveness in dealing with this problem.
<P>
	When the courts cannot address this issue effectively how will 
a ticketing process by this act resolve the problem? Penalties 
will be imposed, fines and offences under eight related acts. 
This will be a tremendous burden for the minister or the 
department to administer.
<P>
	When I see under the Fertilizers Act a fine going from $500 to 
$50,000 and for an indictable offence to $250,000, it scares me. 
I am wondering who will be falling under the compliance act. It 
cannot be farmers because it will break them. It will have to be 
somebody with the multinationals or huge corporations who can 
really be addressed through this act.
<P>
	Overall streamlining of the regulatory process is a worthy 
goal as it is reducing court costs and the associated regulatory 
burden. But will this extra power of a minister be exercised 
fairly? That is a concern I have about this act. If the minister, the 
department or the tribunal favour large violators, multinationals 
or large corporations as opposed to individuals, we are going to 
be addressing a huge problem of unfairness and probably 
discrimination.
<P>
	It is only fair that we look at this act very seriously and 
address some of the issues which have been pointed out today 
concerning the setting up of a tribunal and also the arbitration 
board.
<P>
	Examples of contraventions likely to be treated as violations 
include unsanitary facilities in a meat processing establishment. 
This raises another issue which we talked somewhat of this 
morning. Is it a provincial or a federal jurisdiction? We could 
find that we have a dispute between this act and some of the 
provincial regulatory processes or bodies. Mislabelling of 
agriculture products is very simple. It is more or less a major 
federal jurisdiction, but the other one could cause us some 
problems.
<P>
	Taking an animal out of quarantine and marketing it and 
thereby endangering the health of consumers and maybe the 
health of certain industries is another grave concern. This is 
becoming more and more of a concern when we see new 
enterprises springing up in wildlife animal farming or bringing 
in ostriches, emus or whatever specialty enterprise is 
considered.
<P>
	The main goal of compliance instead of punishment seems to 
be agreeable. I would however warn that we do not make 
compliance too easy because it can just become a matter of 
paying an extra few dollars in fines and continuing with the 
non-compliance.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9542"> 9542 </A></B>
<P>
	Transport Canada and employment and immigration use this 
type of process. I do not think it has been very responsive to 
some of the issues, especially if we look at the Western Grain 
Transportation Act.
<P>
	The powers granted to this minister are extensive. The 
minister may make regulations, not just enforce them. When we 
have an act where we can change regulations and the compliance 
during the life of the act I think it becomes very suspect.
<P>
	That decisions can be either designated as a violation or an 
offence is another thing I am worried about. Whether it is a 
minor, a serious or a very serious offence or non-compliance is 
also given to the minister or the boards. These things seem to set 
up a system with which we could have more problems than 
solutions. I do not think that is what we want.
<P>
	The minister is given the power to decide whether it is a 
contravention or whether it should be treated as a violation. That 
is totally wrong. We need a better guideline, a better system of 
defining what is an offence or non-compliance.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	I would warn this House very strongly that we do not want to 
pass an act or regulations that will more or less give the 
individual fewer powers or less of a chance to be heard than the 
corporations or multinationals. We see that too much today 
already.
<P>
	The railways had a non-performance clause in the Western 
Grain Transportation Act. It provided for monetary penalties. 
That act has been in force for over 10 years. There has never 
been a monetary penalty assessed to any railway for 
non-compliance of the act.
<P>
	This points out very strongly why we in this House should be 
very cautious about passing this bill before we make some 
definite amendments to it. It is almost as if we are trying to do 
away with democracy and trying to enlist a sort of dictatorship.
<P>
	I have said in my speeches in the House before that sometimes 
when I look at the agriculture policies we are making it seems 
that this Liberal government is lost in the dust. It cannot really 
see what the results will be, how it will affect the farmers or the 
producers.
<P>
	It is better if we start clearing the dust, waving our hands 
around a bit and saying that the individual producer is the one 
who is going to be affected. Let us give him a break and let us see 
that he stays healthy and productive. Otherwise we do not have 
much of a chance in turning this country's monetary or financial 
situation around.
<P>
	I hope the hon. minister has listened this afternoon and knows 
that the farmer is always dear to my heart. The farmers are the 
ones who put me here and the ones I am going to speak up for.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Prince Albert-Churchill River, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to speak today in 
support of Bill C-61, a bill to introduce an administrative 
monetary penalty system, or AMPS as it is more commonly 
know. This bill will provide a broader range of enforcement 
options to Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada's inspection 
officials by allowing them to levy monetary policies for 
non-compliance with the regulations.
<P>
	As it now stands a criminal prosecution is relied on too 
heavily. It is often the only option available to inspectors with 
the department's food production and inspection branch when 
they are faced with a violation of this country's statutes 
regarding food and animal health and safety.
<P>
	By introducing AMPS, inspectors will have at their disposal a 
range of monetary policies. They will not have to rely on seizure 
and detention of a product and prosecution through the courts 
with the attendant delays and costs to the taxpayers that 
involves.
<P>
	Technically, administrative monetary penalties are not fines 
but I will use that word for simplicity. Initially, fines will range 
from $50 to $6,000 depending on the seriousness of the 
violation. This legislation will however give the department the 
ability to impose fines of up to $15,000 for very serious 
non-compliance to our regulations.
<P>
	These fines or monetary penalties are not levied without any 
recourse. Anyone who believes the fine is unjustified will be 
able to make use of an appeal process. This process will include 
a departmental review, a review by an independent tribunal and 
if necessary will proceed to the Federal Court of Canada.
<P>
	It should be noted that this initiative emphasizes obtaining 
compliance by offenders and not simply punishment. AMPS 
will allow the department to negotiate solutions to 
non-compliance with the offending parties. Fines can be 
reduced or waived if corrections, for example, processing 
modifications, are made by the industry.
<P>
	Immediate corrective action results in a better product, 
improved health and safety, more effective enforcement and the 
protection of Canada's reputation for high quality control 
standards in relation to agri-food products. In today's highly 
competitive market, there is no doubt we must do all we can to 
enhance our reputation for quality and in fact deliver high 
quality food to the world's consumers.
<P>
<B>(1540 ) </B>
<P>
	In order to ensure that the system operates as effectively as 
possible and to avoid frivolous appeals, the government is 
making available a fine reduction option. Offenders who pay 
their fines without asking for a review will receive a 50 per cent 
reduction in their penalty.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9543"> 9543 </A></B>
<P>
	Reviews cost money and this option is used by other 
departments in other jurisdictions quite successfully. While this 
may seem counterproductive to some, let me remind everyone 
that the administrative monetary penalty system stresses 
compliance and not punishment. The department does not see 
this initiative as a money making venture. It will gladly reduce 
or even waive a fine if the offender is willing to show 
compliance with Canada's regulations.
<P>
	While criminal prosecution will still be an option, AMPS will 
lead to better compliance rates and more effective enforcement 
action taken by the branch. The administrative monetary 
penalties will enable greater enforcement of compliance among 
importers, thereby helping to create a level playing field for the 
domestic industry.
<P>
	This move by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada is 
consistent with the initiatives being taken by other departments 
and with the entire regulatory framework in Canada. Transport 
Canada currently has an administrative monetary penalty 
system. The one being proposed for this department builds 
significantly on the transport model, and other departments are 
considering the adoption of this system.
<P>
	This system has been developed in conjunction with the 
Department of Justice through the regulatory compliance 
project. One of the goals of this project is to look at alternatives 
to criminal prosecution of regulatory violations. In many cases 
criminal prosecution is considered too severe as this course of 
action can lead to a criminal record and even the possibility of 
imprisonment. This is another step in our goal of 
decriminalizing regulatory infractions.
<P>
	Federal regulatory policies encourage the use of the least 
coercive alternative models. AMPS will provide the department 
and the food production and inspection branch with a less 
coercive alternative.
<P>
	It pleases me to note that this administrative monetary penalty 
system not only has the support of a number of federal 
departments, but it has the solid support of industry associations 
as well. This latter support is, in my mind, the most important 
since it is the industry and our farmers who have not only asked 
for this but it is the industry that will have to work with it as 
well.
<P>
	During recent consultations industry associations 
recommended the active enforcement of domestic standards to 
imported products. This is because Canadian industry needs to 
be able to compete on a level playing field if it is to remain 
competitive in the global market.
<P>
	It is important also for Canada to protect its international 
reputation for high quality health and safety standards when it 
comes to agriculture and agri-food products. The introduction 
of AMPS was also one of the recommendations of the 
department's regulatory review undertaken in 1992.
<P>
	The goal of the federal approach to the regulatory system is to 
create a regime that is not just cost effective but is flexible and 
addresses the realities of doing business in a new way. The 
government and the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food 
require a system that is more cost effective and more 
appropriate.
<P>
	To my mind, the administrative monetary penalty system 
meets all of these criteria. I must point out that the AMPS is also 
used by the United States department of agriculture where it has 
been shown to be very successful in increasing compliance. Our 
system will allow us to harmonize our regulatory enforcement 
with the United States and also with some of our trading partners 
in Europe who also use this type of system.
<P>
	Better regulatory compliance will help industry not just at 
home but it will improve its global competitiveness as well. 
Increased compliance will help ensure that Canadian export 
products maintain their high reputation internationally. It will 
do so by enabling the department to take effective action against 
importers or domestic companies marketing products that do not 
meet Canadian health, safety or quality standards.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	Business will welcome clear rules that will help to increase 
compliance and remove unfairness from the system. The 
agricultural community will welcome any activity that 
strengthens our enforcement at border points, increases equity 
of enforcement between commodities and promotes the 
marketability of Canadian products.
<P>
	The system highlights the joint responsibility that 
governments and industry share for ensuring compliance. By 
consulting with industry the government has devised a system 
that will benefit everyone. It will give government inspectors a 
wider range of enforcement options when they are faced with 
regulatory violation. It emphasises compliance, not 
punishment, by permitting monetary penalties to be waived or 
mitigated if the violator takes corrective actions to ensure future 
compliance.
<P>
	It will improve the competitiveness of industry at home by 
applying consistent standards to both imported and domestic 
products and abroad by helping to ensure Canada's protects its 
high reputation internationally.
<P>
	I commend our minister of agriculture who has done a terrific 
job in identifying problems and going through extensive 
consultation on this issue and many other issues. As is typical, 
once this process is completed a very sensible, workable 
solution comes out the other end. I thank and congratulate the 
minister.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am particularly interested in one aspect of the proposed 
legislation that deals with the tribunal. I gather it is a dispute 
settling mechanism to clear any violations that may be made in 
some sort of judicial setting.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9544"> 9544 </A></B>
<P>
	In the interest of natural justice there has to be some sort of 
a fair procedure set up such as an unbiased adjudicator and the 
opportunity for a hearing. Given the track record of the 
quasi-judicial bodies that exist in the government today-and 
I use the example of the Immigration and Refugee Board and 
the parole board-can we consider them to be that of unbiased 
adjudication when individuals who are appointed through the 
process and orders in council reflect patronage, are friends of 
ministers and friends of others who sit within the Liberal 
government?
<P>
	My concern and the reasons why I would be very hesitant 
about supporting the bill are based on these particular points of 
concern, and I refer to subsection 4.1(2):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A person is not eligible to be appointed a member of the Tribunal unless the 
person is knowledgeable about or has experience related to agriculture or 
agri-food and the Chairperson of the Tribunal and at least one other member of 
the Tribunal must, in addition, be a barrister or advocate of at least ten years 
standing at the bar of any province or a notary of at least ten years standing at the 
Chambre des notaires du Quebéc.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In the appointment process for individuals sitting on this 
board, how much of a guarantee will we have that we will not run 
into the same problems as those of the Immigration and Refugee 
Board or the parole board? They apparently had qualified people 
on them, yet when it came to the actual decision making process 
they differed vastly from the concerns of the public and the 
decisions rendered were very questionable. That aspect dealing 
with concerns has not been addressed in this piece of legislation.
<P>
<B>(1550 ) </B>
<P>
	I am not a lawyer but I know there are many on the other side 
of the House who seem to relish the thought of putting together 
legislation that only lawyers can understand. One thing of 
concern to me deals with some process of natural justice, that is 
that a fair procedure be introduced.
<P>
	I am looking at some of the clauses in Bill C-61 wherein the 
rules of evidence do not apply to the hearing. Again I ask 
members on the government side why the rules of evidence 
would not apply in any hearing if we are looking for a fair and 
just procedure to solve or settle any of the concerns that may 
come before it.
<P>
	When I consider some of the concerns in this document and 
look at the Immigration and Refugee Board I see that the process 
is not driven by the concerns of Canadians through the minister 
or through the member but rather by special interest groups that 
may want the decision making process structured in their favour.
<P>
	With all these issues, when we ask for quasi-judicial bodies 
are we actually promoting something fair and unbiased that will 
benefit society as a whole?
<P>
	The minister of immigration and the Solicitor General have 
been very evasive in dealing with the specifics. When situations 
or complaints have arisen they stand back and make this 
comment: ``No, I cannot interfere in the process because that 
would be interfering with a quasi-judicial body and would be 
outside the realm of my jurisdiction''.
<P>
	My question to all members on the government side is: Should 
not the minister be accountable for everything that goes on in his 
department? Why should it be taken from him and passed on to a 
quasi-judicial body to take the heat off himself? I do not agree 
with some of these dispute settlement mechanisms.
<P>
	I am particularly interested that they talk about the tribunal. 
So often it divorces itself from the minister. It takes 
accountability away from much of the decision making process 
and takes responsibility and accountability away from the 
minister. On that basis alone I could not support the bill.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member has asked a number of 
questions in his intervention. It may be confusing for people 
watching us, but the minister may respond to the questions 
under the umbrella of asking a question or making a comment 
himself.
<P>
	I see the member for Cumberland-Colchester has risen first. 
I will have to recognize her first and then the colleague to her 
right.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as we discussed the bill in the House today, on 
repeated occasions the hon. member referred to interference by 
the minister: ``What protection does the bill give us that there 
will not be interference?''
<P>
	I would like to suggest that hon. members are talking out of 
both sides of their mouths. On one question they want no 
interference. On the next question the hon. member asks why the 
minister does not take full responsibility and interfere. They 
cannot have it both ways.
<P>
	I have a question for the hon. member. There has been 
reference to the parole board and the Solicitor General 
repeatedly today. How many times has the hon. member heard of 
interference by the Solicitor General of Canada in the parole 
board?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Mr. Speaker, if the parole board or some other 
quasi-judicial body makes a serious blunder I would hope 
somebody would be held accountable and heads would roll. 
However that does not happen.
<P>
	The parole board has made terrible decisions in the past that 
have jeopardized the lives and safety of Canadians. I am not 
saying this quasi-judicial body will necessarily do that, but we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9545"> 9545 </A></B>
<P>
must remember that we are talking about heavy fines being 
levied against businesses. Someone somewhere should be held 
accountable.
<P>
	Under the quasi-judicial system the board makes the decision 
and the minister stands back and says: ``No, I am not 
accountable. They are responsible. They have been given the 
sole authority''. Where does the buck stop? Is the board held 
accountable? They are not elected officials. I am saying that the 
minister or the criminal courts where often these matters are 
resolved should be the bottom line.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murray Calder 
(Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the hon. member for Calgary Northeast as well, in 
particular when he started talking about subsections 14(1) and 
14(2) and the credible people who would sit on the tribunal. I 
listened to the hon. member across the room say many times that 
he would like to see credible people on the parole board. I have 
to agree with him; I would like to see that too.
<P>
	However, what could be more credible than a person on this 
tribunal with extensive agricultural background and legal 
background? Maybe the hon. member could tell me who would 
be more credible than that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Mr. Speaker, let us look at the track record of 
both the parole board and the Immigration and Refugee Board. 
They are people who have been placed within the system and 
supposedly have qualified backgrounds.
<P>
	Yet, what is happening? They are friends of ministers. They 
are friends of the Liberal Party. Prior they were friends of the 
Conservative Party. In some instances they were unqualified but 
were placed on that board. What is to prevent that from 
happening with this particular board by order in council 
appointments? Nothing.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, from the comments made in the 
course of the debate today I take it there is recognition, given the 
process being established by the legislation, that there needs to 
be as a part of the process a tribunal to adjudicate upon disputes 
and alleged offences.
<P>
	The whole purpose of establishing such a tribunal as a 
quasi-judicial body is to remove the adjudicative procedure 
from my office, which is a political office, and to put it in the 
hands of a body, an organization or a tribunal that can be at arm's 
length and not influenced by the day to day flow of political 
events. The whole reason for having a quasi-judicial tribunal 
assume that responsibility is to separate responsibility from any 
kind of appearance of political interference. I would think my 
hon. friends in the Reform Party would agree there ought to be 
that arm's length relationship and in fact that the functioning of 
this kind of tribunal should not be subject to day to day political 
considerations.
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	Finally, I would point out, as my friend from Prince Albert did 
earlier today, if there is a concern about a decision rendered by 
the adjudicative tribunal, it can in fact be appealed to the Federal 
Court of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for his clear 
explanation. It is not unlike, as I suspected, the quasi-judicial 
Immigration and Refugee Board which is fraught with all kinds 
of problems and a minister who is reluctant to step in when he 
should and steps in when he should not. The Federal Court, 
already backlogged when it sits with immigration cases, will 
now undoubtedly be backlogged even further with agricultural 
problems.
<P>
	I suggest that the agricultural tribunal as proposed is going to 
be just as flawed as the Immigration and Refugee Board and the 
parole board.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues, the time is up unless there 
is a unanimous desire to continue. I take it there is not.
<P>
	Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt 
the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those in favour of the motion will 
please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those opposed will please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> In my opinion the yeas have it. I 
declare the motion carried.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="WESTERNGRAINTRANSPORTATIONACT">WESTERN GRAIN TRANSPORTATION ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (for Minister of Transport, Lib.)</B> 
moved that Bill C-66, an act to amend the Western Grain 
Transportation Act, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the government and in 
particular on behalf of my colleague the Minister of Transport, I 
am pleased to open debate on Bill C-66, an act to make certain 
short term amendments to the Western Grain Transportation 
Act, commonly known as the WGTA.
<P>
	This bill deals with three specific changes to the current 
legislation. Two amendments address problems in the move-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9546"> 9546 </A></B>
<P>
ment of grain to port for export. The third removes the WGTA 
subsidy on shipments of wheat to Mexico and is intended to 
facilitate our continued access to a very important market for 
Canada in Latin America.
<P>
	At the outset I should note that the amendments in Bill C-66 
are no substitute and are not intended to be a substitute for the 
major reforms of the grain handling and transportation system 
which will be brought before this House later on in this session. 
Rather, this bill fulfils a commitment that the government has 
made to farm leaders and to the grains industry that we would 
deal with certain particular issues that have caused significant 
delays and other problems in Canada's grain transportation 
system, especially over the course of the last year or so.
<P>
	Because it is essential procedurally that these amendments 
are in place before the beginning of the 1995-96 crop year in 
western Canada which begins on August 1, the government 
tabled the legislation which is now before us in December. We 
are urging its quick passage through the House so that the 
legislation can be in effect in time for the beginning of the next 
crop year.
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	On the broader reform issues, we will be moving forward with 
them just as soon as possible after the upcoming federal budget.
<P>
	One of the specific changes in Bill C-66 will end the practice 
of backhauling, that is the so-called scenic route backhaul 
subsidy on U.S. bound grain which has been moving from the 
prairies to Thunder Bay and then back to either Fort Frances or 
Winnipeg before finally heading south toward its final 
destination.
<P>
	This practice has arisen because the existing transportation 
subsidy in fact makes it cheaper for shippers to move their grain 
to Thunder Bay at subsdized rates before moving it to 
destinations in the United States at commercial rates, rather than 
moving it directly at commercial rates for the whole distance.
<P>
	Using Winnipeg as a reference point, backtracking or 
backhauling increases the length of hauling grain by about 450 
miles in the case of Canadian National Railways and about 860 
miles in the case of Canadian Pacific railway. Obviously this 
practice is inefficient and has led to longer car cycle times and 
much less effective use of the grain car fleet. The WGTA was 
never intended to foster this kind of backhaul situation and 
everyone agrees that it must be terminated.
<P>
	With the passage of Bill C-66 the amendment to end 
subsidized backhauling would take effect no later than August 1, 
1995, that is, the beginning of the next crop year. It could be 
brought into force earlier by order of the governor in council if 
there is a consensus in the grains industry that an earlier 
implementation date would be desirable.
<P>
	I must point out that the opinion of virtually all of the players 
in the industry I have spoken to with some exceptions is that the 
most convenient and expeditious date for the implementation of 
the change would be coincident with the beginning of the new 
crop year on August 1.
<P>
	Another change included in Bill C-66 will implement a 
system of demurrage and storage charges on railcars carrying 
grain, other crops and products under the WGTA when they are 
in fact misused by shippers for storage purposes. This will be 
coupled with a despatch system to encourage the expeditious use 
of cars.
<P>
	Demurrage refers to charges that are levied when a shipper 
does not load or unload a railcar, a ship or a truck within the 
specified free time at either the origin or the destination point of 
the railcar. Car storage is similar to demurrage but refers to 
excessive time that a car spends on railway property before 
being positioned for unloading. Despatch refers to benefits that 
a shipper can earn by loading or unloading a car in less time than 
that which is considered normal or reasonable in the 
circumstances.
<P>
	Under this bill the railways would be able to implement 
demurrage and car storage charges for delays in loading and 
unloading. This measure would encourage faster turnaround in 
the use of railcars. This is obviously important in our grain 
transportation system which is stretched to the limit with no cars 
to spare.
<P>
	This amendment would also come into force for the beginning 
of the next crop year, no later that August 1, 1995. Or again, it 
could be implemented earlier by an order in council.
<P>
	On the flip side of the storage, demurrage and despatch for the 
use of railcars equation, we have to focus upon the issue of 
railway performance. The WGTA already provides for sanctions 
to be applied against the railways if they fall short in their 
obligations in grain transportation. That provision has been in 
the WGTA since the act was first enacted about 10 years ago. 
Therefore it is not necessary for us to amend the legislation to 
put in the law the provisions with respect to sanctions having to 
do with railway performance.
<P>
	What has been missing in terms of enforcement of any such 
sanctions is a precise government regulation to give practical 
effect to what is already in the WGTA about railway 
performance. I am pleased to inform the House that the 
necessary research and analytical work has been done. The 
drafting work has been done pertaining to such a regulation. 
Such a regulation could be brought forward very quickly if one 
is needed in respect of railway performance. I mention this point 
just for the sake of balance.
<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	If there are to be demurrage charges and storage charges in the 
system of despatch applying to the shippers in order to ensure 
that they conduct themselves properly in terms of the use of 
railcars and other aspects  of the grain handling and transporta-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9547"> 9547 </A></B>
<P>
tion system, we must also point out there needs to be a 
corresponding system affecting the activities of the railways. 
Should a regulation be required, it will be brought forward 
quickly.
<P>
	The two proposed amendments in Bill C-66 to which I have 
referred aimed at reducing inefficiencies in the grain 
transportation system have very widespread support from 
industry. They are a direct result of industry-government 
collaboration and consultations over the last number of months, 
a period which began in May 1994.
<P>
	During the first half of 1993, all of the best brains in the grains 
industry in Canada were looking forward to the 1993-94 crop 
year as what everybody expected would be a fairly normal grain 
shipping season. Then it started to rain in the Mississippi valley. 
The colossal flooding that resulted was the worst in 300 years. It 
caused the United States to use up all available railway rolling 
stock, including that which would otherwise have been available 
for leasing, as was the normal practice, into Canada.
<P>
	In addition to that shortage of railcars, our harvest in the 
1993-94 crop year was complicated by very poor quality. Added 
to that was a severe winter which limited unloading at country 
elevators and slowed movement through the system. The winter 
season through the Rockies was particularly difficult.
<P>
	The port of Vancouver was tied up for a short while in an 
industrial dispute and we were stuck with one big transportation 
backlog. At one point there was a backlog of 41 vessels on the 
west coast waiting for grain. This situation cost Canadian 
producers about $35 million in ship demurrage charges imposed 
by the ship operators who were waiting in the harbour.
<P>
	These factors along with others led many of our grains and 
oilseeds customers overseas to question Canada's reputation as 
a reliable supplier in the marketplace. In China, Japan and Korea 
last spring I heard those complaints firsthand. Our customers 
were not happy.
<P>
	To avoid any finger pointing, buck passing or stalling, I called 
all the major operational players in the system together for a 
face to face meeting. It was held on May 16 in Winnipeg. They 
were to work out practical solutions to alleviate the immediate 
backlog problem and to prevent, as much as humanly possible, 
that situation from happening again.
<P>
	The issues were also studied by subcommittees of the House 
of Commons standing committees on transport and agriculture 
and agri-food. Joint hearings were held in the spring of 1994. 
Again I want to commend those subcommittees for their very 
good work and for the production of a useful report.
<P>
	I discussed the report in detail with all the private sector 
players involved in our grain handling and transportation 
system at the meeting in Winnipeg on May 16 and thereafter. I 
am pleased to say that not quite all but virtually all of the 
recommendations that came forward from those subcommittees 
have now been implemented.
<P>
	The amendments before the House today have the support of 
the group of industry and labour leaders who are now referred to 
as the May 16 group. I hope they also have the support of the 
House committees that studied these issues last year.
<P>
	At my invitation, the May 16 group of farm and industry 
leaders continued to meet about every two months or so through 
1994. They were to deal with the immediate issues of getting our 
grains and oilseeds to port and to do a little brainstorming about 
the future direction of the grains and oilseeds industry in 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	At one of the meetings of that May 16 group held in October 
there was general agreement that the two amendments I have 
mentioned so far in my remarks today should be in place for the 
1995-96 crop year. This would allow time for grain marketers 
and shippers to adjust sales and supply programs accordingly 
and to get used to the changes that are coming.
<P>
	In a perfect world I would have preferred an earlier 
implementation date. However, it was broadly agreed that 
implementation of these two amendments part way through a 
crop year would add to congestion problems and thus aggravate 
the very kind of situation we were trying to solve. Therefore, we 
have selected August 1, 1995 as the implementation date unless 
there is a prior consensus in the grains industry that we could 
move more quickly than that.
<P>
	Today we are more than half way through delivery of the 
1994-95 crop. I am happy to report that we have made very 
steady progress in dealing with our grain handling and 
transportation situation. We caught up on that 1994 backlog 
during the summer. So far in this crop year the situation has 
improved.
<P>
	I remember in the late winter and early spring of 1994 reading 
the newspaper stories and seeing the clippings of the situation 
that was developing in terms of that backlog at the west coast. 
The clippings were not very positive. Today we see newspaper 
stories from the Regina <I>Leader-Post</I> on February 2 talking 
about how the grain trains are rolling.
<P>
	Another story on February 2 in the Saskatoon <I>Star-Phoenix</I>: 
``Grain cars are hopping''. This is a much more positive 
scenario in the winter heading toward the spring of 1995 than we 
saw a year ago.
<P>
	As of the end of January, half way through the current crop 
year, our grain transportation system has shipped some 16 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9548"> 9548 </A></B>
<P>
million tonnes of grain, with 10 million tonnes through the west 
coast and 6 million tonnes through  Thunder Bay. In the 
movement going both east and west our performance this year is 
43 per cent better than at the midway point in the previous crop 
year.
<P>
	Even more important, our grain handling and transportation 
performance to date in 1994-95 is also 20 per cent better than 
the long term five-year average. So far, so good. However, we 
are by no means out of the woods yet. We have half of the crop 
year yet to go. No one can take anything for granted or rest on 
any laurels. For the balance of this year we are going to need full 
co-operation and flat out top performance from all of the 
players in the system to get the necessary volume of grain 
through our ports and into export position.
<P>
	Bill C-66 also proposes to eliminate the WGTA subsidy on 
wheat shipments to Mexico. This is obviously a separate issue 
from the other two I have been discussing so far this afternoon.
<P>
	Last April the Mexican government, concerned that 
subsidized wheat imports from both the United States and 
Canada were having an adverse effect on its domestic market, 
launched a countervailing duty investigation. Canada 
participated in the Mexican government's investigation in order 
to ensure that all of the relevant facts were brought forward.
<P>
	For example, we wanted to ensure that our Mexican friends 
and customers were fully aware of the fundamental differences 
between Canadian programs and policies like the WGTA and the 
far more insidious and damaging American trade distortions 
caused by things like the U.S. export enhancement program.
<P>
	Our move now in Bill C-66 is to eliminate the WGTA subsidy 
on wheat movements to Mexico. It is intended to help resolve 
this outstanding countervailing duty investigation in Mexico as 
far as Canada is concerned and help ensure continued access to 
that very important market for Canadian farmers.
<P>
<B>(1620 ) </B>
<P>
	In the 1993-94 crop year Canada exported 909,000 tonnes of 
wheat to Mexico. If a countervailing duty were imposed by 
Mexico the potential cost to Canadian wheat exporters of losing 
that market could be over $22 million a year. It is obviously very 
important that we work hard to alleviate the Mexican concern.
<P>
	It is very important to note, though, that this is not a case of 
unilateral disarmament on the part of Canada. The United States 
has voluntarily agreed to withdraw its use of its export 
enhancement program on wheat exports to Mexico. In addition, 
in order to safeguard the Canadian position we retain the option 
of reinstating the WGTA subsidy by order in council if that 
should be necessary and appropriate at some future date. 
Payment of the subsidy would end whenever Bill C-66 is 
proclaimed.
<P>
	As I close, let me remake two points. First, the amendments 
contained in Bill C-66 are short term measures flowing from the 
circumstances experienced last year in the Canadian grain 
handling and transportation system. They have broad support 
from farm organizations and industry leaders. They are intended 
to take effect at the beginning of the next crop year or earlier if 
possible and reasonable. I hope the House will deal with them 
promptly and positively.
<P>
	However, the important but relatively minor changes 
proposed in Bill C-66 will not be sufficient in themselves to fix 
everything that ails our grain handling and transportation 
system today. Broader reforms are necessary for four very 
strong reasons.
<P>
	First, we must deal with the harsh reality of fiscal limitations 
and the battle against debt and deficits. Second, we must comply 
with the requirements of the new GATT agreement with respect 
to the disciplines that apply on trade distorting export subsidies. 
Third, we need to unlock new grain handling and transportation 
efficiencies, leading to a lower cost and faster system overall. 
Fourth, we need to foster greater agricultural diversification and 
a trend toward more value added processing and further 
processing.
<P>
	To accomplish these objectives and to lay the foundation for 
the needed broader reforms, the Minister of Transport and I have 
been conducting two sets of comprehensive consultations with 
all of the players in the Canadian grain handling and 
transportation system over the last number of months.
<P>
	For my part I have been concentrating on the issue of how the 
so-called Crow benefit under the WGTA can best be paid to 
western farmers themselves rather than indirectly through the 
railways.
<P>
	For his part, the Minister of Transport has been focusing in his 
consultations on a broad range of transportation efficiency 
issues. In the next short while we will bring these two sets of 
inputs together in one set of comprehensive and inter-related 
grain transportation reforms. These will obviously go 
substantially beyond the short term measures that are put 
forward in Bill C-66.
<P>
	While I am sure members will be anxious to debate Bill C-66 
in great detail, I hope that will just whet their appetite for the 
larger debate that is to come a few weeks down the road.
<P>
	My second and last point is to express my thanks to all of the 
farm leaders, farm organizations and grains industry 
representatives that have been intensely involved over the past 
several months in all of the various consultative processes I 
have referred to today. They have been involved since May 16 
last year in the work that has led up to Bill C-66. The group of 
people who worked very hard at the May 16 meeting and in a 
series of meetings since that original encounter deserve a lot of 
credit for bridging their gaps and differences and working 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9549"> 9549 </A></B>
<P>
constructively together to arrive at practical  solutions to keep 
the grain moving and never mind the fights over turf.
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	The process that will lead to the broader reforms with respect 
to the WGTA that I just referred to has also been a process in 
which consultation has been extremely important. In that 
process with respect to the broader reforms very close to 100 
different individuals, groups, organizations, private firms and 
levels of government have been involved in the consultative 
effort. They have worked very hard and very conscientiously to 
bring forward the best possible advice to address what all of us 
in this House know are some very thorny issues in terms of 
western transportation policy.
<P>
	To all of those who have participated in this consultative 
process in the House of Commons committees that were 
involved, in the May 16 group as it evolved over the course of 
1994 and most recently those who have been involved in the 
broader consultations about the future of the WGTA, on my own 
behalf and I am sure on behalf of the Minister of Transport and 
the government I want them to know that their efforts are very 
much appreciated.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to rise and speak on behalf of the official opposition 
regarding Bill C-66. This bill to amend the Western Grain 
Transportation Act, Bill C-66, has two main objectives.
<P>
	The first is to implement measures to make rail shipments 
under the Western Grain Transportation Act, the WGTA, more 
efficient, in order to avoid the grain transport problems that a 
lack of railway cars caused last year. The problem was, in fact, 
that the railway cars were being rotated too slowly. The second 
is to eliminate subsidies on wheat movements to Mexico, which 
is on the brink of taking retaliatory measures against Canada.
<P>
	I doubt that Canada will meet these objectives. First of all, the 
bill's scope is too limited and it is far from certain that it will be 
sufficient to prevent a situation such as that which arose last 
year regarding the lack of railway cars. We must also ask 
ourselves why the federal government has tabled this bill 
containing urgent measures. Does the government intend, in the 
near future, to table a much more substantial bill to substantially 
amend the WGTA? The draft bill on major reforms to the WGTA 
has been around for more than a year.
<P>
	The WGTA has had a destabilizing and unhealthy effect on 
rail transport. Its effect has been to considerably distort the rail 
market. Take for example the subsidy of over $550 million that 
rail carriers receive for shipping western grain. This subsidy 
was distributed among all the rail carriers in addition to the very 
profitable network in the west, while a large part of the 
secondary network is in the east, and remains in a deficit 
position. It is understandable, under such conditions, that 
pressure by  rail carriers to rationalize their network is strongest 
in the east.
<P>
	In addition, the government considers preserving the rail 
network used to transport western grain an issue of national 
interest. In fact, the federal government has imposed a 
moratorium on abandonment of railway lines used to transport 
western grain. Many of these lines are nevertheless under-used 
and the western rail network has never really been rationalized.
<P>
	From the viewpoint of privatizing CN, and given the 
mounting competitive pressures on the Canadian rail network, it 
is imperative and urgent that such a rationalization take place. It 
must, however, be carried out on the entire network of both 
national carriers.
<P>
	Rationalizing the eastern network would only undermine the 
competitiveness of western carriers which would be stuck with 
an inefficient network. This is why the Bloc Quebecois has 
proposed a motion to lift the moratorium on the abandonment of 
western rail lines. Perhaps I may repeat it here.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	To allow for fair and effective restructuring of the Canadian 
railway system and to ensure that our national railway carriers 
will be competitive in the future, the House urges the 
government to proceed with the following:
<P>
	Cancel the order in council concerning the moratorium on 
abandonment of railway lines used for grain transportation in 
western Canada.
<P>
	Revise the Western Grain Transportation Act and procedures 
for allocating grain transportation subsidies, so as to avoid 
distortion on the railway transportation market. It is the opinion 
of this House that allowing the railway transportation sector to 
operate on a more commercial basis would be beneficial for 
Canada.
<P>
	Ensure that the criteria used by the National Transportation 
Agency to determine the merits of applications by railway 
companies to abandon railway lines are applied uniformly 
across Canada and to the entire railway network.
<P>
	We make this request because the criteria used by the federal 
government to allow the abandonment of railway lines are 
extremely narrow and show a lack of vision with respect to 
transportation.
<P>
	This government takes a dollars and cents approach to a sector 
that is crucial to economic development, especially in the 
regions. For instance, when reviewing applications for 
abandonment, it fails to consider the economic impact of 
operating a railway line. It is only concerned about the 
commercial viability of the line for the carrier. It is clear that 
negative economic impact of the abandonment of certain lines in 
Canada has been 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9550"> 9550 </A></B>
<P>
more significant than the operating losses incurred by the 
carriers.
<P>
	We realize that the railway network of Canada's two major 
railway carriers must be restructured if they are to be viable 
once again and able to compete with other carriers. Unless our 
railway carriers increase their productivity, they will not have 
the resources to update equipment and maintain a first class 
network.
<P>
	However, the railways are vital to the national interest, and 
the government cannot afford to dismantle certain lines if it 
means losing major economic spin-offs. It is essential that the 
government take into account all possible economic 
repercussions when considering the application to abandon a 
railway line. Unfortunately, the financial vision of the federal 
government and its Department of Transport is simply too 
short-sighted to provide us with a modern and efficient 
intermodal transport system.
<P>
	A sovereign Quebec would be better able to establish an 
effective intermodal transport policy reflecting the real needs of 
its people, as it would have control over all modes of transport. 
In particular, it would be in a better position to understand 
regional transport problems. We have no objection to the federal 
government withdrawing from the transport sector but it should 
do so completely by transferring regulatory powers and without 
destroying existing facilities simply because of financial 
considerations.
<P>
	Let us take the example of the 
Chibougamau-Chapais-Chambord line in the Lac-Saint-Jean 
region. Many thousands of jobs are at stake in the softwood 
lumber, mineral, newsprint, pulp and precision cutting sectors. 
Eliminating train service, with or without transfer to a railhead 
in the Lac-Saint-Jean region, would have dramatic 
repercussions for 10 out of 15 businesses without a transfer and 
would affect profitability and result in eventual closure for 12 of 
them with or without a transfer.
<P>
	In Abitibi, diverting all rail traffic to the road system would 
generate additional revenues of $830,000 the first year for the 
Quebec government, while the federal government's tax 
revenues would go down by $510,000 a year over the same 
period. On the other hand, increased road use in the Abitibi 
region would cost at least an extra $4.8 million a year.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	As we can see, a traffic shift from rail to road would result in 
major cost increases especially since the local road system is in 
pitiful shape.
<P>
	In spite of Transport Canada's efforts, roads, the bearing 
capacity of which is not even known, continue to wear down. 
Increased road traffic would not only make the road surface 
grind away faster, but it could jeopardize the road base in a very 
short time.
<P>
	The government will indeed have to look at several issues in 
developing the future national rail transportation policy that 
Transport Canada had promised for this year. Unfortunately, 
nothing in the bill before us today addresses these substantive 
issues.
<P>
	All this bill does is eliminate backtracking from Thunder Bay 
and impose storage charges on cars used for in-transit grain 
storage.
<P>
	Bill C-66 makes only minor changes to the Western Grain 
Transportation Act, changes that will only marginally improve 
rail transportation in Western Canada.
<P>
	Eliminating this practice of backtracking, where it was often 
most cost-effective for the shipper to ship Prairie grain to 
Thunder Bay and have it backtrack as far west as Winnipeg than 
shipping it directly to the United States at commercial rates, will 
save an estimated $4 million.
<P>
	This amount, released by the Department of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, will be used, however, to reduce average freight 
rates, that is to say the price paid by producers to ship wheat and 
barley.
<P>
	No cuts will be made before the budget is tabled. The 
government is careful not to make any major or significant 
changes, changes which are nonetheless essential if we want to 
have an efficient transportation system.
<P>
	The government is motivated by fear, the fear of a debate on 
the principle behind this issue. It is not only deplorable but also 
worrisome that the government not attempt to rectify a situation 
that could have a major negative impact on the Canadian 
transportation network and the Canadian economy. That is why 
we have presented a motion to force the Liberal government to 
act as soon as possible on this.
<P>
	Over a year ago, on January 24, 1994, the Grain 
Transportation Agency made recommendations to expedite the 
streamlining of sidings. The information I am providing you 
comes from these recommendations.
<P>
	First of all, regarding the Crow rate, the report suggests 
paying the subsidy to western grain producers and not to the 
railway companies, a position that is garnering increasing 
support. However, this is a form of assistance to western 
economic diversification that would be acceptable if the 
transition period is a reasonable one-the report mentions four 
years-and if after the transition period, the subsidy is 
transferred to an income support account to which all Canadian 
and Quebec producers would have access. That is, in fact, the 
position taken by the Quebec coalition on western grain 
transportation.
<P>
	To speed up the restructuring process, the agency suggests 
expanding the definition of class 1 lines-those that can take 
loads of up to 220,000 pounds or whose shipments are not in 
excess of 500 tonnes of grain per mile, with the restriction that 
this would apply only to lines from where grain shipments 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9551"> 9551 </A></B>
<P>
originate. This would  exclude the CN line linking the Port of 
Churchill to the network. However, the agency recommends that 
the government assess the future of the silo in Churchill and its 
role with respect to grain exports. At the present time, class 1 
lines extend over nearly 1,000 miles or 17 per cent of the 6,060 
miles of grain branch lines, and carry 4 per cent of the total 
shipments.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	Second, the report suggests allowing the inclusion in class 1 
of lines judged to be no longer viable, where the cost of 
maintenance or renovation would be prohibitive. Assessments 
would be done by independent inspectors. Third, the report 
suggests immediately eliminating protection orders concerning 
unused lines, which may or may not be grain transportation 
branch lines. Fourth, it suggests setting the time limit for 
evaluating applications for operating alternative services at 
thirty days from the date of receipt of the application.
<P>
	Many other recommendations could have been added to this 
bill which, I repeat, only deals with the most important issues.
<P>
	Let us turn now to the second main objective of Bill C-66, the 
elimination of subsidies for Canadian wheat exports to Mexico. 
The government is taking this step because the Mexican 
government is preparing to impose countervailing duties on 
Canadian exports.
<P>
	We know that the United States has not used its subsidy 
program-the Export Enhancement Program-for exports to 
Mexico since March 1994. Mexico is now asking Canada to 
follow suit. Yet American subsidies exist in other forms. Such 
subsidies may not be known as direct export subsidies, but they 
nevertheless give rise to unfair competition with Canadian 
exports.
<P>
	I would like to know why this aspect is so strikingly absent 
from the bill to amend the Western Grain Transportation Act. 
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada has provided the following 
explanation in a background paper: ``An investigation of 
countervailing duties applicable to Canadian and American 
wheat exports has changed wheat exports to Mexico. The United 
States has eliminated sums paid under the Export Enhancement 
Program for wheat exported to the United States, and Canada 
has proposed to refrain from applying subsidized rates in 
accordance with the Western Grain Transportation Act for wheat 
exported to Mexico.
<P>
	Eliminating the subsidies applicable for wheat exported to 
Mexico will help achieve compliance with the maximum 
volumes stipulated in the GATT provision on subsidies and 
exports, for the category of wheat and wheat flour. This will 
allow us, the department asserts, to meet the goals of the North 
American Free Trade Agreement in respect of the gradual 
elimination of export subsidies by member countries. By 
changing its exports to Mexico, Canada will ensure continued 
access to this important market''.
<P>
	I would die laughing if I were American and, indeed, 
Americans often die laughing at our expense. In 1994, the 
United States imposed a ceiling on Canadian wheat exports. 
This measure was intended to control Canadian exports which 
had reached record highs. The Bloc Quebecois denounced this 
measure, given that Canada was not guilty of anything in the 
matter of the wheat, since it had dropped the export subsidy for 
grain destined for the United States. The Canadian government 
agreed to the ceiling set by the United States, deeming it an 
acceptable compromise and less expensive for grain producers 
than the American countervailing duties.
<P>
	Since then, a study group has been set up to look at the 
question and to evaluate domestic subsidies in Canada and the 
United States. The results of the study will, I hope, mean a return 
to fairer trading rules. However, we do not believe that Canada 
is equal to the task in these bilateral negotiations with the United 
States on agricultural trade. Canada bows and scrapes, even 
when it has an airtight case. As we can see, this defeatist attitude 
is now having disastrous results for our trade with Mexico.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	We are concerned about western grain producers who now 
will have to compete directly with American wheat exports to 
Mexico, knowing full well that they are receiving assistance 
from within. The Canadian government should have included 
this point in its discussions with Mexico. No, instead, Canada 
keeps quiet, says nothing and drops its export subsidy without 
hesitation.
<P>
	Furthermore, I read with my own eyes that the bill would 
allow the Canadian government to reinstate, if necessary, the 
subsidy on exports to Mexico. Public servants specified that it 
would be possible to do that if, for example, the United States 
decided to reinstate its export enhancement subsidies on 
shipments to Mexico. This logic is surprising: Can we be sure 
that Mexico will resort to ``fair'' countervailing duties, both 
against Canada and against the United States? Have there been 
negotiations on this issue?
<P>
	I invite the government to table as quickly as possible its more 
substantial bill, since one does exist-correct me if I am wrong. 
I find it hard to believe that the government hatched Bill C-66, 
which has a very limited scope, whereas a draft bill on a major 
reform of the WGTA has been around for a year.
<P>
	It is true that the government, which is getting a lot of 
pressure from the west, the east and various interest groups 
affected by the WGTA, is in a difficult political situation, but is 
that a reason for tabling a bill that falls far short of remedying 
the situation? Is that a reason for giving in to the United States 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9552"> 9552 </A></B>
<P>
and Mexico? That, nevertheless, will be the outcome of Bill 
C-66.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was kind of blind-sided here today. I did not realize 
Bill C-66 was coming up for debate so I have been-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Goodale:</B> I hope you will do better than the last one.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> I will sure throw some junk at you if nothing 
else, hon. minister. I will take some time.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> During this session of Parliament all 
the Speakers have been asked to make doubly certain that 
members put their comments through the Chair only, not 
because we are not going to sleep if you do not but it is because 
we are trying to avoid exchanges and tempers getting aroused 
across the floor. Therefore, I would ask the hon. member and all 
hon. members to please put their remarks through the Chair. If 
they are going to say the word ``you'' they must be referring to 
whoever is in the chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Mr. Speaker, through you I will say to the 
minister that I will probably throw some junk, some garbage or 
maybe dockage, whatever you call it in the farm industry, 
because I was really surprised at some of the comments that I 
heard here today when I see how well we have done in this 
transportation system with this backtracking issue.
<P>
	I would like to read what Mr. Ted Allen said to the standing 
committee on agriculture on our grain handling system on 
November 29, 1994: ``We measure performance in this country 
against our transportation constraints. We say how much better 
we are doing because we had an abysmal year, so we do quite a 
bit better than in a really poor year. We never measure our 
performance against what the opportunity was and how close to 
maximizing the opportunity we came, which every other 
marketer I know of does''.
<P>
	Why have we not taken the opportunities when the 
subcommittee on transportation a year ago said to stop the 
backtracking, it is costing us millions and millions of dollars? 
Every member on that subcommittee said now. Every member 
on the agriculture committee said now. This is a violation of the 
Western Grain Transportation Act. This was a loophole that the 
grain companies and the railways found. We could not stop it.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	It has cost us $15 million since last July 31 for this 
backtracking. Not only the backtracking has been the cost but 
the car allocation. We have failed to meet commitments again 
and again.
<P>
	I will read another comment that Mr. Allen made. This was 
last year in November: ``Yesterday I was talking to an elevator 
manager from Hargrave, Manitoba, who happened to be in my 
office. He was telling me that he has 25 orders for cars that he 
was supposed to have received a long time ago. The other day he 
finally got three of them''. That is performance. I cannot 
imagine  how much better we can get if that is the way we are 
running our railway system.
<P>
	When I looked at the log book today from Vancouver for last 
October, November and December and saw that a ship sat there 
for 27 days waiting for grain to be loaded, I think we have room 
for improvement. It does not seem to me that if we made 40 per 
cent improvement in the last six, seven or eight months why 
these ships are waiting that long. We want to congratulate each 
other when we do make improvements but let us not overdo it. 
We could become very complacent in this House.
<P>
	The other thing I would like to address is the Mexican issue. I 
was not aware that there was a trade action against us until we 
were briefed by the agriculture people the other day on Bill 
C-66.
<P>
	I asked why we are stopping backtracking to Mexico. Are we 
shipping grain to Mexico? I thought this was a backtracking bill. 
They said: ``There could be a few loads going in that direction. 
We will have to find out. We do not know''. That is how 
knowledgeable the people were who briefed us on this.
<P>
	After a few phone calls I finally found out that Mexico had a 
trade sanction against us for shipping subsidized wheat to it; not 
just to us, also to the Americans.
<P>
	If the members will read the Canada-U.S. free trade 
agreement they will start to realize that the Americans promised 
not to dump EEP wheat into our markets, of which Mexico is 
one. That is where the problem started. That is why there was a 
trade sanction against us.
<P>
	If this government is trying to tell us that Mexico can take 
action against us with a trade sanction, I want to ask under what 
kind of clout or under what kind of conditions it can do that.
<P>
	Mexico has a trade surplus of almost $3 billion with Canada. 
Where in the heavens can a trading partner tell me that I am not 
trading fairly when I import four times as much as it takes from 
us?
<P>
	Statistics Canada says that out of a $37 billion trade surplus 
that we have with the U.S. we dwindle that down by $20 billion 
with other countries like Australia and New Zealand which 
bring in boneless beef by the thousands of pounds. Our farmers 
are going bankrupt.
<P>
	Is this the way our government is trading? Is this how we get 
trade actions against us? It sure seems like good business to me. 
No wonder we are going bankrupt.
<P>
	The trade surplus it has with us is $2.77 billion in total 
products. It could be other than agriculture. These are Statistics 
Canada figures that I am using. If they are not correct maybe we 
can get rid of Statistics Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9553"> 9553 </A></B>
<P>
	It is time Reform starts throwing a few of these figures 
around. When I see Australia with a trade surplus of $181 
million wanting to bring in more boneless beef, and I see New 
Zealand with a $126 million trade surplus wanting to bring in 
more beef, where do we finally go with our beef? Where do we 
finally get the jobs that we were promised in that nice little red 
book? We have to start milling our wheat, we have to start 
milling our pasta, we have to start doing something.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	As a farmer I know that if I continually buy more than I sell I 
am going to have a big problem. This is what has happened to 
this country. It is not just interest rates. If we take $20 billion 
trade deficits and borrow that at 8 per cent, just figure that out.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Goodale:</B> We have a trade surplus, what is the problem?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> With Mexico? I would like to see it. We have 
a trade deficit. Mexico has its trade surplus. I am afraid that the 
Liberals are completely lost in the dust and they have even lost 
the field. They are somewhere in the neighbour's. When they 
cannot take Statistics Canada figures and read them that shows 
what is happening. Something is wrong.
<P>
	I will give the hon. minister a minute to look at that and see 
whether my eyes are that bad or whether I am that old that I 
cannot see what a surplus or a deficit is. While he is looking at 
that, I would like to talk about another item, the Churchill issue.
<P>
	This is what Mr. Allen said about a boatload of grain to 
Mexico. Tell me whether we are giving it a bad deal or not. We 
had a 25-tonne vessel going to Mexico in November 1994. The 
Mexicans bought number three red wheat. We loaded 9,000 
tonnes of number one red, 5,000 tonnes of number two red and 
the balance, which was less than half the cargo, was number 
three red which they bought. I would sure like to throw a trade 
action against the partner that gives me number one wheat 
instead of number three.
<P>
	Where does the trading sense of this government come in? It 
amazes me that these things go on and we sit idly and say 
everything is good in this country, we are only $540 billion in 
debt, so why not a few hundred billion more?
<P>
	I look at Bill C-66 and look at three little clauses that took a 
lawyer a whole year to draw up, that has cost us $50 billion in 
backtracking costs, delayed cars for I do not know how many 
days. We are behind in canola shipments months and we are still 
doing a great job? Why do we not pat each other on the back?
<P>
	I went up to Churchill last July. I wanted to see how efficiently 
the agriculture department was running everything. I was there 
the last day in July. There was a ship coming in that wanted to 
load 40,000 tonnes of grain and there were 4,000 tonnes in that 
whole terminal, five million bushels. That is performance?
<P>
	We have ships sitting for three weeks waiting to pick up grain 
out of Churchill, of all places, where nobody wants to buy grain 
from. That is performance and I am supposed to be quiet here 
and sit silently by and let these things go on and pat hon. 
members across the way on the back?
<P>
	I am sorry, hon. members, I was elected to start things moving 
in this House. I hope I can accomplish that. I hear giggles and I 
hear screams. They must be listening so I must be 
accomplishing something. We will have to paint these ships a 
faded red so that they will start getting a little more action into 
their process and loaded a little faster.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	I went over to Robert's Bank when I was in Vancouver and I 
saw a 150,000 tonne coal ship loaded within a day. Then I saw 
what the consequences were. That company paid the terminal 
$5,000 to load that ship within the three-day limit. We wait 27 
days to load a ship with grain. We have a tremendous system 
going for us. I cannot comprehend the amount of stress, 
disappointment and disillusionment in the farm community with 
this kind of system.
<P>
	For 10 years now the WGTA has held the railway system and 
the grain companies hostage so that the system cannot be 
revamped. The Minister of Transport said the United States 
railway system is 64 per cent more efficient as far as labour is 
concerned. Are we doing a tremendous job in Canada? When are 
we going to face the facts? When are we going to take charge of 
these problems and do something?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Goodale:</B> What about the freight rates?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> I do not know what the freight rate is. But I 
can tell the member what the handling charges are. If I ship a 
bushel of grain from my point to Seattle, compared to my point 
to Vancouver I will save $16.50 per tonne. If 20 million tonnes 
are shipped out of Canada that is $320 million that came out of 
the pockets of farmers, just in the elevator system. That is 
without the transportation system.
<P>
	Someone tell me why farmers need subsidies. It is because 
somebody is pulling it out of their pocket faster than they can 
put it back in. That is not going to last forever.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Be careful. They will ask for examples.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to read another 
statement by Mr. Hehn, chief commissioner of the wheat board. 
When I asked him about the backtracking he said: ``It is not a 
wheat board issue''. The chairman of the agriculture committee 
said: ``Thank you''. Mr. Hehn replied: ``Our job is to maximize 
returns for farmers and if the backtracking option is there, we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9554"> 9554 </A></B>
<P>
are going to use it''. He does not care a hoot how long it ties up 
cars or how inefficient it makes the system as long as he can 
move a bushel of wheat that  is worth $3. Forget about the canola 
that is worth $8, $9 or $10. That is efficiency. That is the kind of 
efficiency this Liberal government is promoting.
<P>
	It is time for somebody to take the bull by the horns and do 
something. There is a lot of bull on that side. We hear a lot of it. 
We are not short of that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> The backbenchers are getting restless, Jake.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Maybe it is time they got restless. Maybe it is 
time for them to get a few ants in their pants and start moving on 
some of these issues. When I hear that it takes a whole year to 
draw up a bill like this, I have a feeling we will be all dead before 
it is implemented.
<P>
	Maybe I have said enough. I do not want to wake the hon. 
members up too much because they might not be able to sleep 
very well tonight. We would like to see them back here 
tomorrow morning and go at them again.
<P>
	It is real pleasure to address these people. We know they try 
their best. There is not much they can accomplish in a year so we 
will give them another year or two.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernie Collins (Souris-Moose Mountain, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this very 
important issue, the amendment to the Western Grain 
Transportation Act tabled by the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-food, dealing with Bill C-66 as put forward on December 
15, 1994.
<P>
	Bill C-66 is a short term response to problems that have 
arisen in our grain handling and transportation. It will help 
ensure speedier delivery of Canadian grain to our customers 
around the world. Bill C-66 is not intended to be a substitute or a 
reform to the system.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	I am convinced the short term amendments presented to the 
House today will benefit all those concerned. These changes 
will see an end to the system of backhauling through the U.S. 
and allow grain to qualify for WGTA subsidies. The 
amendments will implement a system of demurrage and storage 
charges on rail cars that are misused by shippers for storage 
purposes. They will end the WGTA subsidy on grain shipments 
to Mexico and ensure continued access to important markets.
<P>
	These corrective measures were initiated by a group 
assembled by the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food on 
May 16, 1994. We all realize the WGTA has some weaknesses 
that need to be reformed that can no longer wait to be dealt with.
<P>
	As the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food said, 
maintaining the status quo is an option that makes less and less 
sense. Longer term reform is essential and it is essential to 
achieve a compliance with the new World Trade Agreement. It is 
essential because the current subsidy distorts markets, 
encourages producers to ship grain to markets rather than 
processing it. It is essential to respond to the country's fiscal 
responsibilities with  fewer government dollars. It is essential to 
promote the economic growth and diversification across the 
prairies.
<P>
	I would like to discuss these long term reforms today. As 
members know the federal transport minister is now in the 
process of concluding extensive consultations on a package of 
grain transportation efficiencies. At the same time, the Minister 
of Agriculture and Agri-Food is concluding productive 
consultations with major key players of the sector on the future 
method of paying the WGTA benefit.
<P>
	Throughout these consultations leaders of farm groups and 
industry have been given the opportunity to make significant 
contributions by going over specific questions on how best to 
allocate WGTA funds. The intent of these consultations was and 
still is to elaborate effective and viable solutions that will fit the 
long term needs, be comprehensive in nature and be progressive 
for the industry.
<P>
	The question is not about whether to change the WGTA but 
rather the best way to deliver the program to Canadian farmers. 
If the WGTA is left unchanged, the GATT could have significant 
impacts on certain crops such as canola.
<P>
	We basically have two choices. We can change the WGTA so 
it is no longer within the definition of an export subsidy, or we 
can continue to pay the railways, but do so only with volume and 
monetary limits allowed by GATT. If we choose to continue to 
pay the railways, there will be immediate and severe restrictions 
on the volume shipped through the west coast and Churchill. 
That will be a problem with regard to the eligibility for subsidy.
<P>
	For the first few years, the monetary limitations are not a 
significant problem, because the value of the WGTA has 
declined over the years from its peak amount.
<P>
	However, the volume limitations are the major problem. 
Volumes have gone up dramatically, specifically in the new 
crops like canola and other specialty crops. The GATT value 
limiting oilseeds and special crops will very likely be reached 
sometime during the first part of the 1995-96 crop year.
<P>
	That means sometime during that year shippers will suddenly 
run out of subsidy. As the volume exceeds that level, they will 
have to pay the full cost of the WGTA to the ports of Churchill 
and the west coast. Once those volume triggers are reached a 
tremendous problem will be created for them. That is obviously 
untenable and unacceptable.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9555"> 9555 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	There have been suggestions that if we were to subsidize all 
the grain movements into British Columbia, not just those for 
export, we might be able to disguise the situation. This would be 
called a domestication argument. It is an interesting concept but 
in reality it would likely not work.
<P>
	The GATT agreement states that the export subsidy 
provisions shall not be applied in a manner which threatens to 
lead to circumvention of export subsidy commitments.
<P>
	The notion of domestication is clearly and admittedly an 
attempt at circumvention. Canada cannot expect other exporters 
to allow that to go by unchallenged. The U.S. and the European 
Community would most certainly complain and probably win. If 
we were to expect them to honour their GATT commitments, 
which we do, then certainly it is incumbent upon us to be 
prepared to do the same.
<P>
	Three options on the future method of paying the WGTA 
benefit are now being considered. One was put forward by the 
producer payment panel in June of 1994 and one by the Alberta 
government one month later. The third alternative consists of an 
upfront buyout plan. This type of option has been discussed and 
there will be a process worked out in the very near future. I know 
that the University of Saskatchewan has professors putting 
forward ideas.
<P>
	Let us look at the producer payment panel recommendation. It 
suggests that across the prairies the benefits of the WGTA be 
distributed directly to producers. Producers would initially be 
paid on a cultivated acreage and then phased into an arable 
acreage payment. The panel also recommended that some of the 
funds be put into safety nets.
<P>
	For its part, Alberta proposed allocating each prairie province 
their historic share of WGTA funds and allowing variations on 
how the payments would be paid to producers within a set of 
principles. The Alberta government proposal recommended 
against putting WGTA funds into safety nets. That was also 
supported by the Government of Saskatchewan.
<P>
	In the near future the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food 
will bring all of the input received together in a reform to be 
presented to Parliament for its final consideration. The proposal 
will have to be consistent with the new rules of the World Trade 
Organization and will have to fit with our fiscal realities.
<P>
	We still have some work to do before we reform the WGTA. 
The major amendments to be addressed on long term issues will 
be introduced soon. In the meantime, I urge all members to 
support the short term amendments contained in Bill C-66.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened to my colleague from Saskatchewan talk 
about the initiatives which the government is undertaking, but 
there are a lot of things that he neglected to mention. Perhaps I 
might take a minute to remind him of a couple of them.
<P>
	First, the government caved in on protecting durum 
producers, and maintaining the most rapidly expanding market, 
which is the market in the United States. Mr. Speaker, can you 
imagine if half of our car exports to the United States were 
suddenly cut off. There would be a hue and cry. The government 
did nothing to oppose the cut in the export of durum to the 
United States.
<P>
	It is one of the most disastrous policies undertaken by the 
government and by the current minister of agriculture. It has the 
potential to be devastating to durum producers if they lose such 
a strong market. In this market, the buyer pays cash and the 
producers do not have to work on loan programs and offer credit 
to the purchaser. The producers are receiving good dollars for 
their product, which is the best in the world.
<P>
	Also the potential is there for the government to cave in as far 
as the sugar industry is concerned. The minister of agriculture 
has not come out strongly and said he would stand up to the 
Americans in their rumblings about taking trade actions against 
us on sugar.
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	We know the current government has been pitifully slow at 
reforming and reorganizing the department of agriculture and 
producer support programs. We know that the government has 
wasted a year on this backtracking issue. We are talking about it 
in February 1995 and the Liberals took power in 1994. Of course 
the Conservatives before them balked at fixing one of the most 
stupid problems we have ever faced in western Canada.
<P>
	I am now wondering what steps the member's government is 
taking to prevent another serious disaster in the western 
Canadian grain economy that would take place if there were a 
disruption in grain movement to port created by a rail strike. 
What steps is the government taking to prevent a potential 
disaster?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collins:</B> Mr. Speaker, concerning a number of the 
observations made by the member opposite with regard to the 
minister of agriculture, I think his dealings on many issues, 
whether it be on sugar, barley or durum, have been very concise 
and accurate. They reflected the needs and wishes of the 
agriculture community of Saskatchewan and of Canada.
<P>
	With regard to the problem that may be confronting us at the 
end of this month concerning rail companies and whether they 
will continue to provide service through their unions, I along 
with the member opposite have real concern about what will 
happen.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9556"> 9556 </A></B>
<P>
	However, I can assure the member that the Minister of 
Transport and the minister of agriculture will deal with those 
situations in a very proper, efficient and significant manner to 
look after the farmers of Saskatchewan, Alberta and any other 
province. I appreciate the member's concern, but I think he will 
see that they will deal with those matters very quickly as they 
have with all other matters.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a question for the hon. member for 
Souris-Moose Mountain. I know he supports the government 
quite fully and he is a good Liberal. I congratulate him and pat 
him on the back for that.
<P>
	We had a trade agreement signed by the agriculture minister 
with a peace clause in it that we would not be harassed by the 
Americans any more. I see now they are starting to use the end 
user certificate against us. This is a real detriment to farmers.
<P>
	What could the member do to influence the agriculture 
minister to get a little tougher on some deals that he has made to 
make the Americans, the Japanese, the Mexicans or whomever 
live up to the agreements that were signed?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collins:</B> Mr. Speaker, with regard to end user certificates, 
the hon. members knows that we have them. I understand what 
he is saying. Certainly we want to be assured that we are playing 
on a level playing field with our counterparts whether they be 
the United States or any other country.
<P>
	I share the concern that when we enter into an agreement we 
expect that those people are going to live up to and honour the 
agreement. I have some problems when they use the export 
enhancement program improperly. It is a program that will have 
to be reviewed and they will have to be accountable in the world 
they trade in.
<P>
	They are going to be challenged by all of us, Canadians and all 
other countries, to play on a level and fair trading field. You will 
see that they will be forced to reduce their export enhancement 
program. That is something all of us share. We want to deal with 
all our counterparts throughout the world in a fair way.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I would ask all hon. members not to say 
``you'' when referring to other members.
<P>
	The hon. member for Vegreville is not the culprit; he has not 
spoken.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I also 
have a few comments and a question for the member.
<P>
	The member was talking about the proposed changes to the 
WGTA. I would like to ask a broader question with regard to 
future reform of the WGTA. In particular I would like to ask the 
member if he believes when the National Transportation Act 
replaces the WGTA that reform is necessary to the National 
Transportation Act to make it work in the grain business.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	As the WGTA has changed there are other restrictions that 
will have to be removed to make the whole transportation grain 
handling industry work, particularly the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	I would like to ask two questions with regard to the Canadian 
Wheat Board. First, does the member favour a board of directors 
elected by farmers to replace the appointed commissioners? 
Second, does the member support the use of a plebiscite to allow 
farmers to decide what they want the Canadian Wheat Board to 
be in the future?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collins:</B> Mr. Speaker, with regard to the questions 
directed to me concerning the Canadian Wheat Board, the 
member will find that our party is on record as being in support 
of the farming community at large wanting to make some 
changes. That is the direction in which we would want to go. The 
farming community should be able to do that. We are certainly 
not in opposition to that kind of approach.
<P>
	With regard to the Canadian Wheat Board and the structure 
that is in place now, I feel the process is a good one in terms of 
those who are elected and serve.
<P>
	The hon. member is right, though. Those members who served 
on the Canadian Wheat Board have a commitment. We know 
that their job will be carried out properly. We feel as well that the 
Canadian Wheat Board like all boards needs to be reviewed from 
time to time and improved.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Glen McKinnon (Brandon-Souris, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to support Bill C-66, an act to amend the Western 
Grain Transportation Act, the WGTA. The bill received first 
reading on December 15, 1994, just prior to the House rising for 
its Christmas break.
<P>
	I would imagine all hon. colleagues are well advised that the 
minister has been consulting with all sectors of the agri-food 
industry and all political colleagues in neighbouring provinces 
on these major reforms to the WGTA.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, Bill C-66 deals with three issues. I 
intend however to speak only to the issue of exports to Mexico, 
which is very important to NAFTA and other trading 
arrangements Canada has recently entered into.
<P>
	On April 4, 1994 the Government of Mexico launched a 
countervail duty investigation of both Canadian WGTA wheat 
shipments to that country and U.S. exports under its export 
enhancement program or its EEP. At that time Mexico had 
concerns that wheat imports from Canada and the U.S. were 
affecting its domestic market. It believed that the WGTA was a 
subsidy which along with U.S. EEP subsidized wheat sales into 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9557"> 9557 </A></B>
<P>
Mexico. This was affecting the price of wheat received from 
Mexican farmers and grain companies.
<P>
	Over the following months our federal government 
participated in the investigation of the Government of Mexico 
and wanted to ensure that all facts were brought forward 
explaining Canada's grain marketing system. After much 
discussion the federal government reached a negotiated 
resolution to Mexico's concerns about the impact of Canadian 
WGTA supported wheat exports to that country. Under the 
agreement Canada will refrain from making payments under the 
WGTA on Canadian wheat shipped to Mexico. In return, 
Mexico's current countervailing duty investigation of Canadian 
wheat exports will be terminated.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	The federal government has always indicated its preference 
for a negotiated solution to this matter rather than run the risk of 
having excessive countervailing duties in place.
<P>
	I know there are some people in Canada, indeed some in the 
House today, who will cynically see the agreement as a loss. 
These people will point to it as an example of Canada making 
concessions while receiving nothing in return. As usual this is 
not the case.
<P>
	First, the agreement will in no way interfere with or limit the 
amount of high quality wheat Canada can export to Mexican 
customers. The Canadian Wheat Board has already indicated to 
the federal government that it will continue to have a major 
presence in the Mexican market even with the voluntary 
withdrawal of WGTA.
<P>
	Second, perhaps the greatest benefit is that the U.S. has 
voluntarily agreed to withdraw use of the export enhancement 
program from Mexico. Mexico was not included in the recently 
issued list of countries eligible for U.S. EEP allocations for the 
1994-95 marketing year. In the previous year, 1993-94, 
Mexico's EEP allocation for wheat was some 1.4 million tonnes. 
This move by the U.S. to rein in its EEP restores a level playing 
field in that market with the result that prices will increase to 
North American levels.
<P>
	Should the U.S. at some point decide to revert to its trade 
distorting subsidy program and resume using EEP on a large 
scale in the Mexican market, Canada will use NAFTA 
provisions to request the Government of Mexico to resume its 
countervail duty against the EEP.
<P>
	The hon. Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food has often 
referred to the EEP as ``the most trade distorting program on the 
face of the earth''. Anyone who is even remotely familiar with 
Canada's recent bilateral agri-food trading relations with the 
U.S. will attest to the accuracy of the remark. By agreeing to 
remove WGTA payments on wheat to Mexico, Canada has in 
effect restored a level playing field or contributed to such in the 
Mexican market. I might add that this is a growing and 
promising market for Canadian wheat in the future.
<P>
	Bill C-66 will permit Canada to continue to sell wheat into the 
Mexican market without having to worry about possible 
excessive countervailing duties. It will also be able to do this 
without having to worry about competing against EEP and the 
billions in the U.S. treasury.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to ask the hon. member for 
Brandon-Souris whether he is not a little concerned about 
Thunder Bay since wheat going to Thunder Bay is not declared 
an export subsidy. How is he going to keep wheat from 
Brandon-Souris going to Thunder Bay? I am sure the Mexicans 
are going to refuse it if there is a subsidy on it. Could the hon. 
member answer that question?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McKinnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, our wheat from 
Brandon-Souris will be going everywhere.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
few comments and questions for the hon. member for 
Brandon-Souris.
<P>
	The first one is to ask the hon. member what impact removing 
the WGTA subsidy on shipments to Mexico will have. What 
kind of an impact will it be? How many tonnes or how many 
dollars are we talking about in that regard?
<P>
	Second, I would like to ask the same questions I asked the last 
speaker from that side of the House concerning the Canadian 
Wheat Board. It fits in with the WGTA because of the restriction 
that comes into play due to the Canadian Wheat Board Act. 
There are two things in particular. Does the hon. member 
opposite favour replacing the appointed commissioners who 
now control the Canadian Wheat Board with a board of directors 
that would be elected by farmers? Would the hon. member 
favour a plebiscite which would allow farmers to determine 
exactly what the wheat board would be and how it would work?
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. McKinnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will work in reverse on the 
questions. In terms of a plebiscite and getting membership on 
the wheat board, I have concerns to some degree about the 
political process that may come into play by having people 
seeking the appointment, perhaps currying favours in some 
areas geographically, somewhat like the advisory committees to 
the wheat board.
<P>
	I believe the first question was on the impact of the WGTA 
subsidy being removed. The minister indicated that there were 
909,000 tonnes or $22 million in place. I have no reason to 
believe that is necessarily going to change. However, I do not 
have any data at my disposal to honestly answer the question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I know the hon. member for Brandon-Souris is good 
with figures. He was in the teaching profession for a long time. 
The data I have are from the Grain Transportation Agency. I 
seem to be getting data that are no good. I hope these are good. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9558"> 9558 </A></B>
<P>
They point out that a  rail car going to Vancouver travels at a rate 
of 5.05 miles per hour and one going to Thunder Bay travels at 
3.62 miles per hour.
<P>
	I wonder if he thinks this was excessive speed for these rail 
cars or whether somehow the Liberals could speed up that whole 
transportation system a bit.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McKinnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is simply because of those 
high mountains. Once we climb to those heights, it runs 
downhill all the way to the west. To the east it is because of the 
high air density that is created from Winnipeg that blows in that 
direction.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the hon. member 
a question. It has to do with the Canadian Wheat Board again.
<P>
	The first question was whether the hon. member favours an 
elected board of directors to replace the appointed 
commissioners. Second, following the election of a board of 
directors would the hon. member favour the use of direct 
democracy plebiscite, and it can be controlled, as a mechanism 
for determining what the wheat board would be in the future?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McKinnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, if I may be so bold concerning 
plebiscites, having served as a mayor of a community for many 
years I have had great concerns about engaging in the plebiscite 
game. Once you start, where do you stop?
<P>
	In terms of elected representation, I have no problem if the 
farm community feels that is the most applicable means of 
putting a knowledgeable board in place. I sense that the majority 
of appointed commissioners have a very strong agricultural 
background that makes them very effective.
<P>
	In terms of whether elected they could do a better job, I do not 
feel I can evaluate that kind of question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Prince Albert-Churchill River, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise again 
today to speak in support of Bill C-66, an act to amend the 
Western Grain Transportation Act.
<P>
	I wish to sincerely thank and congratulate the minister of 
agriculture for bringing forward more legislation to assist the 
prairie farmer in a very positive way.
<P>
<B>(1735 ) </B>
<P>
	This legislation is the result of identifying a longstanding 
problem that has existed within our nation for many years, 
bringing together all of the stakeholders who were affected by 
the existing circumstances or will be affected by the proposed 
changes and by working together with them to find an 
appropriate and fair solution.
<P>
	Our minister is a problem solver and has already contributed 
much to assist the economic well-being of our prairie farmers. 
The successful completion of the Uruguay round of the GATT 
was good for Canada. By agreement the Americans and the 
Europeans will be forced to reduce unfair subsidization of 
agricultural products, thereby making Canadian agricultural 
products more saleable and competitive on the world market.
<P>
	The minister-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The bill, as the member will know, is 
summarized in two sentences. There is a rule we are all expected 
to obey in this House called relevance. In borderline cases the 
member should be given the benefit of the doubt, although the 
Speaker has frequently admonished members who have strayed 
in debate.
<P>
	I would respectfully bring that to my colleague's attention and 
ask him please to remember the relevance rule in his further 
comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> Mr. Speaker, if I might, this is a preamble very 
much fitting in and leading up to the bulk of my statement. 
Further, with respect to other speeches I have heard today I 
would submit this line of discussion is perhaps far more relevant 
than others that have existed. I wish to continue this line.
<P>
	The minister also found a solution to the troubling durum 
wheat dispute with the United States, retaining for Canada an 
upper limit of shipments of wheat well above historic levels, 
thereby allowing Canadians farmers to continue shipping our 
high quality product to the United States.
<P>
	Our minister of agriculture has developed a very predictable 
pattern to resolve problems in agriculture. He identifies the 
issue, he consults broadly with all stakeholders and in 
consultation with these stakeholders he puts forward concrete 
solutions to help our farmers.
<P>
	Bill C-66, an act to amend the Western Grain Transportation 
Act, follows that successful approach. The purpose of these 
amendments is to eliminate the WGTA subsidy on movements to 
Thunder Bay of grain subsequently moved westward by rail to 
destinations in the United States.
<P>
	Second, these amendments will provide the railways with the 
authority to implement demurrage and storage charges and 
dispatch rail cars carrying grains, crops and products under the 
WGTA.
<P>
	Third, these amendments will eliminate the WGTA subsidy 
on wheat shipments to Mexico. In respect of the Thunder Bay 
backtracking, the way the present WGTA subsidy operates is to 
encourage the rail companies to ship grain to Thunder Bay from 
the prairies. When they wish to ship it to the United States, they 
ship it all the way back to either Fort Frances or Winnipeg before 
it is shipped to the United States.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9559"> 9559 </A></B>
<P>
	The problems with this approach are many. It increases the 
time grain cars are in use, therefore reducing the speed at which 
grain can be shipped to market. It costs the government money 
to send the grain the extra miles. I do not think the grain really 
appreciates the extra scenery the taxpayers are paying for.
<P>
	This amendment will reduce the cost to the Canadian taxpayer 
and will enhance the reliability of Canada as a shipper and seller 
of high quality grains. An improved reputation as a supplier will 
increase the demand for our product. No doubt because of its 
very high quality, when we have this very stable and enhanced 
reputation as a dependable supplier the buyers are going to 
come. All of this will be good for the Canadians farmer. 
Certainly that is very good news.
<P>
	Presently under the WGTA storage and demurrage costs 
cannot be charged against cars hauling grain qualifying for the 
subsidy rates. This has resulted in grain cars being used for 
storage of grain, sitting there holding the grain, but not moving 
it.
<P>
<B>(1740 ) </B>
<P>
	Grain cars were built to move grain. With this type of 
amendment that is what they are going to be doing. Allowing for 
storage to merge and dispatch will ensure quick transfer of grain 
to market and will further enhance Canada's reputation as a 
prompt supplier of high quality grains.
<P>
	This bill will alleviate the countervail duty investigation 
currently lodged against Canadian wheat exports by Mexico. 
The removal of the subsidy will be beneficial in meeting the 
volume limits of the export subsidy provisions of the GATT for 
wheat and wheat flour categories. Canada, therefore, will 
maintain access to the growing Mexican market.
<P>
	I wish to once again thank our minister for acting, after 
consultation, in a very prompt fashion to get the grain moving in 
western Canada. He is doing a great job. One problem at a time, 
our system is improving.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
wondering if the previous speaker could tell us why the Liberal 
government waited for 18 months before introducing this very 
minor piece of legislation which is going to have a great effect 
on the way we ship grain around on the prairies.
<P>
	He mentioned that he could only see that we were going to 
save a little time and a little money. He forgot about efficiency 
and I think he forgot about straightforward common sense. I 
cannot imagine why we would be moving grain to Thunder Bay 
and back again for 16 months before this government gets 
around to doing anything after ``W5'' highlighted the program 
and basically acted as its eyes and ears.
<P>
	What about fairness? The Minister of Finance tells us he 
wants to be fair. Why should the Canadian taxpayer be paying 
taxes to move wheat to Thunder Bay and back for 16 months 
while this Liberal government sat around saying there is no 
problem with the way it spends money in this country? It took a 
television program to point out to the government that it was a 
ludicrous waste of money. The Reform Party is saying multiply 
that a thousand times. We have identified $10 billion in savings, 
this being one.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member why the government has 
waited this long to save this amount of money when it could 
have been done a year ago and we could have been further ahead.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister of agriculture and the 
government have been aware of this problem and have acted 
with all the haste possible in order to fix the problem.
<P>
	Hon. members opposite only learned about this problem from 
a television program. The people on this side of the House were 
aware of it before it was televised and publicized.
<P>
	This government believes that in order to get an effective 
settlement and an effective solution we need to discuss these 
types of issues with all of the stakeholders involved. There are 
many people who will be affected by the changes which are 
being brought forward. The government and the minister of 
agriculture needed to have full discussion with these people to 
devise the best solution possible for the people of Canada.
<P>
	People on this side of the House believe in consultation and 
long term effective solutions, not solutions which will come 
unravelled overnight because of lack of preparation and lack of 
thought, which is what the Reform Party would like to see 
happen.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Western Grain Transportation Act was instituted in 
1984. This loophole has been there for 12 years and the 
government knew about it. Why did it have to wait this long?
<P>
	I would suggest that special interest groups had a lot to do 
with it because the railways were milking the system, the grain 
companies were milking the system, and the cow has gone dry. 
We have a debt problem and finally we are starting to realize it.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member why the government did 
not realize this faster when the problem was there 10 years ago.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> In 1984 there was a different government in 
place, one that you no doubt supported. With respect, our 
minister of agriculture has moved forcefully and quickly in 
bringing people together to get a solution that is going to work 
for all Canadian taxpayers, including the Canadian farmers.
<P>

<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, clause 2 
of this very short bill deals with the issue of allowing under the 
WGTA for demurrage and storage charges for grain that is being 
stored on rail cars to be levied against the railway. How does the 
hon. member opposite see this being implemented? Will it be 
used? If so, how often?
<P>
	We know that rail cars are used for storage in many cases and 
certainly the system is not efficient. There is an average 
turnaround time of 20 days or more, the same as 80 years ago. 
How does the hon. member see this part of the bill being used to 
ensure quicker turnaround and more efficiency in the rail 
system?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> Mr. Speaker, the portion of the bill dealing with 
demurrage and storage charges will encourage the rail 
companies to utilize the grain cars to move the grain as opposed 
to letting it sit there, storing them, or leaving the cars sitting 
around.
<P>
	There have been many problems identified on this issue. Each 
one of these little pieces goes together to make for a more 
efficient grain system. That is what the minister has set out to 
achieve. That is what he will achieve by utilizing this type of 
system to encourage the people to move the grain. It is better for 
us to pay for grain to be moved than pay to have it sit.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murray Calder 
(Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure for me to take part in this debate on Bill C-66, an 
act to amend the Western Grain Transportation Act.
<P>
	As the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food has already 
indicated, this bill covers short term amendments aimed at 
addressing inefficiencies that have been identified in our grain 
transportation and handling system.
<P>
	Specifically, Bill C-66 would authorize the railways to 
implement demurrage, car storage charges, and despatch. It 
would also eliminate the WGTA subsidy on grain movement to 
Mexico and end the practice of routing U.S. bound grain to 
Thunder Bay and backhauling it to Fort Frances or Winnipeg 
before finally sending it into the United States.
<P>
	Until now the railways' inability to levy demurrage charges or 
car storage charges has led to the use of rail cars for storage 
purposes, as was just stated by the member across the floor. It 
obviously reduces the efficiency and effectiveness of the grain 
car fleet. We do not know where our cars are. They are all over 
the place. They could be in the United States. They could be 
anywhere. We end up putting more cars into the system.
<P>
	As a result, we need more cars to move our grain than what we 
should need. The backtracking practice has evolved because it is 
cheaper for a shipper to send U.S. bound grain to Thunder Bay in 
order to qualify for the WGTA subsidy and then backhaul it to 
Fort Frances or  Winnipeg before it is moved at commercial 
rates to destinations in the United States than it would be to ship 
it directly at commercial rates.
<P>
	Using Winnipeg as a reference point, this practice increases 
the length of grain haul by about 450 miles over CN lines and 
about 860 miles over CP tracks. This practice is clearly 
inefficient and results in longer car cycle times and less 
effective use of the grain car fleet. In the 1993-94 crop year, 1.1 
million tonnes of grain were shipped to the U.S. via this scenic 
route.
<P>
	Regarding the removal of the WGTA subsidy on wheat 
shipments to Mexico, we expect that the amendments in this bill 
will resolve the current countervailing duty investigation in 
Mexico and ensure our continued access to an important market 
for Canada.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	It is important to note that these proposed changes are short 
term amendments only. They are not intended to replace 
comprehensive reform of the WGTA. I should also point out that 
they have received widespread industry support.
<P>
	In fact, these changes were suggested by and have support in 
principle from the subcommittees of the House standing 
committees on transportation and agriculture and agri-food, as 
well as the May 16 group which includes representatives from 
grain companies, the railways, labour and management.
<P>
	Both of those forums have suggested a number of initiatives 
to reduce inefficiencies, improve the capability of the grain 
transportation and handling system and facilitate the movement 
of grain to markets. Many of their suggestions have been 
implemented. However, some of the proposed changes require 
legislation, hence the bill we are debating here today.
<P>
	The government would like to proceed with these short term 
amendments now in order to eliminate the subsidy on wheat to 
Mexico as soon as possible and to ensure that demurrage and 
backtracking issues are dealt with before the 1995-96 crop year 
which begins August 1, 1995.
<P>
	As I indicated earlier, there was agreement in principle to 
eliminate these inefficient practices. After further 
consultations, a consensus emerged among the May 16 group 
that the WGTA amendments should take effect at the beginning 
of the crop year. The group favoured this timing because it 
would allow time for grain marketers and shippers to adjust 
sales and supply programs accordingly.
<P>
	It is important to note that although August 1 has been 
selected as the implementation date for some of these changes, 
the amendments dealing with demurrage, storage charges and 
despatch as well as backtracking could be implemented earlier if 
the government is satisfied that there is sufficient agreement 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9561"> 9561 </A></B>
<P>
between the railways and the shippers on the commercial details 
of the changes.
<P>
	I would like to make it clear that this proposed legislation in 
no way lessens this government's commitment to making 
decisions on broader WGTA reform in the near future. The 
passage of this legislation will enable the government to 
continue with the consultations that are so vital to the 
development of the long term solutions for problems in our 
grain handling system. At the same time, it will address the 
immediate problems which members of government and 
industry representing the grain companies, the railways, labour 
and management have identified.
<P>
	Members of the House, I ask for your support in the rapid 
passage of this legislation. The measures proposed by Bill C-66 
will help make Canada's grain transportation more efficient and 
better able to meet the needs of our customers around the world.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I always enjoy the hon. member's comments. We have 
served on the standing committee for awhile and I have always 
appreciated him and know he is also a good farmer.
<P>
	The only thing I am surprised at is that he forgets we have 
calendars. There was a crop year on August 1, 1994. In the 
spring of that year the standing committee stated that it should 
be stopped, that it was illegal and it was costing us money. I 
would suggest that if this government is not going to work faster 
in implementing legislation, some day in the hon. member's 
chicken business all the eggs will be hatched and nobody will 
have eggs for breakfast, putting his whole industry in jeopardy.
<P>
	I hope he will urge the minister to move a little faster because 
we need some action. I wonder how he would comment on that 
because this has been delayed a whole year.
<P>
<B>(1755 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Calder:</B> Mr. Speaker, they are making poultry jokes here.
<P>
	In all my years as a farmer, and I grew up on a farm and have 
been actively farming since 1973, I know the hon. member 
across the floor who shares the same background in agriculture 
that I do knows that haste makes waste. If you are going to fix it, 
fix it right the first time because the second time it costs you a 
lot of money.
<P>
	Basically what we are saying right now is that the railways, 
the shippers and the wheat board all have to become responsive 
to the changes we are making.
<P>
	The challenge through you, Mr. Speaker-I do not want you to 
feel like the Maytag repairman-is that we have to look at how 
wheat is hauled down into the United States and the rate that is 
applied to it. Is it going to cost the same to move a car of potash 
into the United States as what it does to move a carload of wheat 
into the United States? We have to watch that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, earlier 
on you talked about relevance. We have been into poultry and 
now we are into potash. I thought we were talking about moving 
grain down into the United States and Mexico.
<P>
	The member's comment was that by stopping this movement 
of grain back and forth from Thunder Bay it was going to 
eliminate the countervailing duty investigation by Mexico. I ask 
myself, how on earth can we do this to ourselves? How can we 
pay to move grain to Thunder Bay, move it back to the prairies 
on subsidized lines and find out that because we do that Mexico 
is going to investigate us for subsidizing grain? Whereas if we 
stop shooting ourselves in the foot there is no subsidy and we 
can put it down to the United States more efficiently, as they 
admit, in a more timely fashion, as they admit, and the whole 
market system would just work so much better.
<P>
	I cannot imagine why the government is trying to mess up the 
whole market system entirely through these rules which just 
make no sense whatsoever. I still come back to this concept of 
why it takes so long. I thought when this bill was passed that it 
would come into force. Now I find out it will not be until August 
1.
<P>
	Can the member please explain to me why it is going to take 
another six or eight months before it comes into effect? Why 
would we subsidize grain that-I am at a loss for words, but I 
want to know why we are going to wait until August.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Calder:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very heartened to hear that the 
Reform Party across the floor is going to support us in the 
speedy passage of the amendments to the WGTA. It heartens me 
greatly.
<P>
	The member has already said, which I agree with, that it does 
not make sense to transport grain to Thunder Bay and back to 
Winnipeg and down into the United States. We have to make 
sure we find the most effective way to ship it down at the best 
price. We want to make sure that the railway companies are 
honest about this. Also we want to make sure that Mexico does 
not look on WGTA the same way it looks on the export 
enhancement program. I think we are going to avoid it with the 
amendments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
couple of questions for the hon. member opposite.
<P>
	I congratulate the transport minister for bringing these 
changes forward. We have been pushing for these exact changes 
since we started meeting in the agriculture committee and in the 
House. Of course we will support these measures but we would 
have supported them a year ago more happily.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9562"> 9562 </A></B>
<P>
	How does the hon. member see the demurrage charges and 
the storage charges that are allowed now under the second 
clause in this bill used? There certainly is a need for this 
measure, but how is this government going to use them? Is it 
going to use them? The powers are there in the WGTA right 
now and they are not used. Will they be used now?
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I suppose you are not going to let me ask my 
questions about the Canadian Wheat Board. Are are going to 
rule them irrelevant? I will not ask those then.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Calder:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the reason for the demurrage 
and the storage charges for these rail cars is the fact that they 
were being used before as rolling warehouses with no charge 
attached.
<P>
	With the demurrage and storage charges now it will make the 
shippers much more responsible to make sure they get those cars 
in, get them unloaded, get them back out on the track and 
heading back to-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Thunder Bay.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Calder:</B> -be filled up with more wheat. It is a more 
efficient way of doing it. If there is a cost penalty behind it, it is 
another incentive to make it work better.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to, bill read the second time and referred to a 
committee.)
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think you would find unanimous 
consent to call it 6.30 p.m.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous agreement in the 
House for calling it 6.30 p.m.?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>

<P>
