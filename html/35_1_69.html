	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby)</B> moves:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House urge the government to respond to the evident lack of 
confidence that has arisen from Canadians over the Young Offenders Act, and 
recommend modification to the definition of ``young persons'' in section 2(1) of 
the act to mean a person to be ten years of age or more, but under 16 years of age.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I rise today on a matter of national 
importance. Our country is hurting. The basic foundation of 
what we have known as peace, order and good government has 
been called into question by Canadians. Specifically in relation 
to the juvenile justice system there is anger in the land.
<P>
	The community is divided and there is much fear and 
mistrust. Our youth, the promise for our future, are seen by 
many not as our hopeful legacy for tomorrow but as strangers to 
be feared.
<P>
	Youth speak differently, they do not want to dress anything 
like the rest of us, they do not seem to value or give due regard to 
what we hold dear. It has been that way since the second world 
war, since the emergence of a youth subculture.
<P>
	Now there is a fundamental difference. Young people are 
getting an unfair bad rap for our lack of courage as a community 
to expect and demand standards of behaviour and mete out 
balanced consequences when the social order is threatened by 
the violent young. And when some young people excessively 
display their youthfulness there is immediate fear and 
resentment from the bystander, a sense of helplessness.
<P>
	There is a backdrop of community perception that there is no 
accounting for any behavioural excess. The right to live in peace 
has evaporated and the fear of violence from the few becomes 
transferred on to all good kids. Instead of fondly regarding our 
young, the image of delinquent is what too frequently comes to 
mind. The good many are categorized by the bad few.
<P>
	Indeed there is an innate sense that the fundamental social 
order of the community has broken down when the average 
Canadian thinks of youth crime, for we have a justice system 
that has devolved to one of being merely a legal system that 
seems unresponsive and unaccountable to the community.
<P>
	The Liberals gave us the Young Offenders Act. The 
Conservatives tinkered with it. We have now lived with its 
consequences for 10 years and I have heard loud and clear that 
voters in my riding and all across Canada do not like the YOA. 
They will no longer tolerate the YOA in its present form.
<P>
	I do not need to remind my colleagues in this House that the 
buck stops here. We have brought forward our motion today on 
behalf of the millions of Canadians who said clearly to 
candidates in the last election that specifically the Young 
Offenders Act is not what the country wants.
<P>
<B>(1015 ) </B>
<P>
	This national concern involves a sense of public security and 
the ability of the government to fulfil its most fundamental duty 
to protect and defend the citizenry.
<P>
	My motion before the House today says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House urge the government to respond to the evident lack of 
confidence that has arisen from Canadians over the Young Offenders Act, and 
recommend modification to the definition of ``young person'' in section 2(1) of 
the act to mean a person to be ten years of age or more, but under sixteen years of 
age.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is simply put but I am all too aware of the issues that are not 
simple. Changing one statute is not going to solve all the 
problems of youth crime and social conflict but we must make a 
start and the Young Offenders Act is itself a reasonable place to 
begin justice reform.
<P>
	Through change we can set a climate of balance and 
reasonableness that appropriately understands human nature 
and the propensities for greed, selfishness and personal denial of 
accountability.
<P>
	The Young Offenders Act reflects an unrealistic view of 
ourselves as a society and it also has rejected the wise parent 
model of the preceding juvenile delinquents act. There was a 
mistaken belief that grand schemes of top down, social 
do-goodism would reform human nature. When the community 
experienced in real terms the pragmatic results of what had been 
done to it by this House, the reaction of revulsion began to build.
<P>
	While the Young Offenders Act formalized old informal 
practices, guaranteed access to legal counsel and made a more 
litigious process, the essence of the act sent the wrong message 
to the community. To verify and bolster those notions to the 
doubting Liberals who are loathe to admit that they were sorely 
wrong, Reformers are trying other measures to check 
perceptions of what the community appears to want.
<P>
	We now have the technology to have universal suffrage on 
individual issues of the day. MT&amp;T Technologies televoting 
service makes universal suffrage a reality. It enables all citizens 
to vote in an election or respond to a question of the day by using 
the telephone.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4235"> 4235 </A></B>
<P>
	Voters call a special telephone number to access the 
teledemocracy system and enter their own personal 
identification number, or PIN number. After hearing the survey 
questions, voters press a key to vote yes or no and, then press the 
pound key to confirm their vote.
<P>
	It provides a cost effective way to poll a large group of people 
on an issue. It is an ideal process to gather information, confirm 
proposals and it provides an additional check on attitudes 
beyond opinion sampling and traditional methods. The accuracy 
of what polling companies produce is always a problem of 
sample size, structure and other things. The MT&amp;T 
Technologies televoting service provides the largest possible 
sample size even beyond what traditional paper balloting and a 
general election might provide.
<P>
	My colleague, the member for North Vancouver, has signed a 
contract to experiment with this technology on the questions of 
the Young Offenders Act. When Reformers set aside one of their 
few allotted days to bring a motion of debate to this House, we 
are following the bottom up community accountability model 
that is at the heart of the Reform Party.
<P>
	We are prepared to test in scientific terms with the real broad 
base data what the community mood is and verify what we have 
already come up with through traditional methods. If anyone 
wants to learn more about this process, call anytime to area code 
(604) 666-8378. I will repeat that number again in a moment.
<P>
	In addition to the specific televote that will take place in 
North Vancouver in June, there will also be a more general style 
of phone in opinion poll at the same time available to the whole 
country. If the media has the social responsibility to report it, 
people across the country will hear the number and be able to 
participate.
<P>
	One need not only take the Reform Party's word that the 
community is fed up with the Young Offenders Act. We will be 
checking again through the method of teledemocracy. The 
Young Offenders Act is the title of it and I say let it live up to its 
name and be amended so that it truly deals with young offenders, 
not youthful adults.
<P>
	There are many ideas for changing the statute. I heard scores 
of them from criminologists, program analysis bureaucrats of 
provincial ministries, from police, street workers and above all, 
young people themselves. I am speaking from years of 
experience working within the juvenile justice system and I ask 
who runs the justice system anyway, the criminals, the lawyers, 
the courts, correctional authorities, probation and parole 
officers? That seems to be how it has operated.
<P>
	There have been some partial attempts here and there to keep 
the community involved but the broad community must have 
ownership in the operations of the justice system. It should not 
operate solely in a delegated sense, what government does for us 
in what we cannot do for ourselves.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	While the social order begins at the family unit and should be 
supported and enhanced by our institutions, schools and 
community organizations, at some point the buck stops.
<P>
	For juvenile crime community accountability arises in the 
formal court proceedings. When the bottom line is too diffuse 
there is unnecessary hurt and injury to the innocent. The 
community must have the tools to publicly denounce behaviour 
that is unacceptable.
<P>
	Canadians want action. We can move beyond just a desire for 
peace, order and good government to a land that is just, that 
cares for its victims and casualties. We must protect the weak 
and innocent as we deal courageously with offenders. There are 
many ways to teach productive conflict resolution. We must 
break the cycle of kids who are hurting who go on to hurt others.
<P>
	I have heard a bulging briefcase full of reasons why we should 
not do this or that with the Young Offenders Act. I bring to this 
House some personal experiences. I will recount how the Young 
Offenders Act did not serve them when they somehow became 
involved as victims.
<P>
	I recall Darrel who at 11 years old was lighting fires at school 
and in the neighbourhood. The school had some difficulties 
handling him. The social worker from social services had 
nothing to offer the parents other than a parenting course and a 
medical referral through their doctor for a six month wait to see 
a child psychiatrist.
<P>
	He was too young for the Young Offenders Act. Group homes 
could not not accommodate a pyromaniac. The impulsive lad 
wanted help, he wanted controls and those who knew him were 
in fear of what he might do next. As a probation officer all I 
could do was assess and refer.
<P>
	Despite the best efforts of loving parents, when subsequently 
showing off to friends Darrel started a fire in the elementary 
school in the evening. When the fire was noticed by the 
neighbours they saw kids running. When all was said and done, 
$1 million later half the school and burned down and 600 
students were displaced for a year.
<P>
	As he was not a child in need of care and protection social 
welfare had no mandate. Mental health had no mandate other 
than providing community family therapy as the lad was not 
mentally disturbed. Darrel needed the cycle of his anger and 
self-centredness broken by a formal court denunciation. He 
could have also benefited from a court ordered correctional style 
wilderness camp program. That did come later when he was 12. 
The YOA did not serve him or the community.
<P>
	I remember Brent. He had always been wilful, taking things 
that did not belong to him. He worked his way through the YOA 
diversions, restitution orders, community work service hours, 
very short term custody and the extensive probation order 
conditions. He was given break after break. His juvenile file I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4236"> 4236 </A></B>
<P>
called one of  those 10-pounders. At 17 he murdered an 
acquaintance with a stab to the chest.
<P>
	Brent was a time bomb waiting to go off as he dared the 
authorities to knock the chip off his shoulder. He took a life 
instead. That is not the end of it. He was placed on remand in 
custody in the youth detention centre. His girlfriend was 
allowed to visit with his mother and many friends. Visiting in a 
youth custody centre especially for someone only on a remand 
before any guilty finding was fairly lax. He and his girlfriend 
quarrelled and he hanged himself in the shower. When they cut 
him down he was brain damaged. Forever now he will be 
supported by the province as an invalid who cannot look after 
himself, hardly able to say a word, barely recognizing anyone. 
The YOA did not serve him nor the dead victim nor the extended 
family members.
<P>
	He planned his hell raising until he turned 18 like the bad 
example of his brother before him, but this time it did not work 
out. A different law would have made a difference. These are 
just two examples from my personal experience that would have 
turned out very differently had the YOA been constituted the 
way I am recommending today.
<P>
	We have some specific proposals. If Reform were government 
today we would have already acted. The motion today of course 
is the most fundamental. I can just imagine the reaction from the 
Prime Minister to what we will be saying today from this corner 
of the House-a shrug, a recounting that some want a little of 
this and some want a little of that; but we are not going to panic, 
just trust us, stress the positive, do not worry, be happy, this is 
really what the Canadians want to hear.
<P>
	However, let Canada remember this day who was the justice 
minister when the Young Offenders Act was passed. It was the 
Prime Minister. What a legacy he has left us. If people want to 
blame someone for the juvenile justice system the blame can 
rightfully be laid at the cabinet door of this government.
<P>
	The east-west cold war is over. The major threat to our 
communities now is from within, our own inaction to preserve, 
protect and defend.
<P>
<B>(1025 ) </B>
<P>
	Sadly our laws and mores have been driven by the cultural 
conceits that took hold during the heyday of counterculture, 
including a denial of personal responsibility and the fantasy that 
coercive power of big government can produce an uplift to the 
spirit, cure poverty and bigotry, legislate economic growth and 
stamp out any number of individual and social inadequacies.
<P>
	In the 1980s the Young Offenders Act initially took up and 
formalized the best of what we in British Columbia had already 
been doing for years with diversion strategies, alternative 
measures, forest camps, borstals, volunteer probation programs, 
open custody units and local level innovation.
<P>
	Then the spirit of innovation was bargained away at the last 
minute against the best advice just to get a deal with the divided 
provinces. If we did nothing else to this act than change the age 
of application it would go a long way to an efficacious result and 
assuage public concern.
<P>
	The Young Offenders Act should apply to 10 to 15-year olds 
inclusive, not the current 12 to 17 years inclusive.
<P>
	Next, provision 3.1 of the declaration of principle section 
should include the needs and rights of victims equally with the 
concerns of the offender. Section 9.7 should include provisions 
to have victims formally notified of court proceedings as well as 
the parents of a young offender. Section 16, transfers to adult 
court, should be possible for any youth under the act not just 
those 14 years and over.
<P>
	The crown prosecutor should have the prerogative to proceed 
directly in adult court without transfer hearings against youths 
14 and over where the crown believes circumstances warrant. 
There is no need for a long trial to decide where the real trial will 
be heard in such circumstances.
<P>
	Section 17 should simply be repealed. The public has a right 
to know about young offender transfer hearings. Although youth 
court is usually open to the public one cannot publish or report 
any part of the proceedings that would identify the offender.
<P>
	Under section 22 related to mental health treatment the judge 
should not need the permission of the offender he is sentencing 
to impose an order to attend a program.
<P>
	Section 24, when a judge sentences to custody, should be just 
that, custody. The correctional authorities administer what kind 
of custody, assigning offenders within the range of open and 
closed facilities as the changing needs arise as in the adult 
sector. Let the jailers do the jailing and the courts do the 
sentencing.
<P>
	Section 38 should be repealed and nothing should be 
substituted. When the law is broken an offender's right of 
privacy about their offence should not exist. Crime needs to be 
exposed, not hidden.
<P>
	Section 44.1 should permit as well appropriate dissemination 
of youth records and materials also to school board authorities. 
Section 46 against prohibition of disclosure of identifying a 
youth should also be repealed. There should be no restrictions. 
Justice must be seen to be done as well as done.
<P>
	Section 45.1 should be repealed and not replaced with any 
other measure. A youth court should be a criminal record and the 
rules dealing with those records should be one and the same as 
adult records.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4237"> 4237 </A></B>
<P>
	A new measure should be added to section 50.1 and it should 
be that if a parent fails to reasonably exercise parental duty the 
court should be able to order the parent to pay a victim 
compensation for property loss for vandalism.
<P>
	Section 56 should be repealed as the common law practice and 
current court rules in regular courts are more than sufficient to 
deal with statements made by offenders for evidence. If it is 
good enough for the regular court system it should be good 
enough for young offenders.
<P>
	Finally, the operation of show-cause hearings and the interim 
release on bail for offenders must be tightened up to stop the 
revolving door. There is nothing more disheartening to citizens 
than to see charged offenders on the street the next day after the 
arrest.
<P>
	There must be a surety that offending will be reported and 
denounced by a formal process. Both the offender and the 
offended must be responded to. The offender must realize and 
feel the impact of their criminal behaviour on victims and 
receive consequences commensurate to the crime.
<P>
	Victims must be helped and restored as far as that is possible 
by both a caring community and a justice system that will defend 
them.
<P>
	In closing, I summarize by saying I have outlined today 
specific proposals that are needed to bring confidence back to 
the juvenile justice system. Canadians want sweeping change 
now not another study, commission or round of extensive 
consultations. The minister has in his hand over 1,000 recent 
submissions from Canadians. We have done more than enough 
of that sort of thing.
<P>
	If the community wants to be involved to directly share its 
views, call the telephone number I am about to give and learn 
how to use MT&amp;T Technologies televoting service. Send this 
government a message. Call area code (604) 666-8378 and 
interact with the line to learn more about how the televoting 
service will be used in June. The evidence is in on what the 
public wants. It remains to be seen if the government has the will 
to respond.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
enjoyed the comments of the hon. member and I share his view 
that Canadians are most dissatisfied with the Young Offenders 
Act.
<P>
	However I am somewhat concerned that on the eve of a 
re-examination of the Young Offenders Act, or a first 
examination of the Young Offenders Act on its 10th anniversary, 
it would appear the member has his mind closed before we have 
even begun to examine and test the 10 years' experience we have 
under the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	The Young Offenders Act is not a creature that was spawned 
out of nowhere. This is the successor act to the Juvenile 
Delinquents Act of 1911. Many of the things that the hon. 
member is complaining about were dealt  with in the Juvenile 
Delinquents Act. When Parliament in the mid-eighties decided 
to bring the treatment of young offenders into the eighties, 
instead of into the early 1900s, certain decisions were made.
<P>
	I understand the hon. member's comments, and he was very 
specific in the sections of the act, but I want to be more general. 
The general philosophy is that there is a difference between a 
young offender, particularly a first time young offender, and an 
adult who has committed an offence against the Criminal Code. 
I am not talking here about repeat offenders.
<P>
	This is my question for the hon. member. I wonder if he has a 
problem with the philosophy that a young person, perhaps 12 or 
13 years old, who for whatever reason, whatever economic 
circumstances may be, walks into a local convenience store and 
steals a chocolate bar or some other small item, perhaps a pen 
for school, and is apprehended. Does he think that young person 
should be treated in exactly the same way as an adult criminal? I 
do not think so.
<P>
	As a society we believe that young people make mistakes. 
They are not adults. They do things wrong. I am not talking 
about murder. I am not talking about violent offences. I am not 
talking about people who thumb their noses at the court system 
because they have been in it 15 times. I am talking about the 
person who makes a mistake and should in my view be given a 
chance to rehabilitate himself without having the stigma of a 
record and without having the stigma of classmates, et cetera, 
knowing what happened.
<P>
	I speak from personal experience. I will not go into a long 
speech. I had a friend that this exact thing happened to under the 
juvenile delinquents act. His name was never published. 
Nothing ever came out. He did not appear in adult court. He was 
treated under the juvenile delinquents act. It was a humiliating 
experience for him. He is a fine, upstanding citizen today, has 
never been in trouble with the law since the age of 14. I hate to 
think what would have happened if we had been spreading his 
name all over the place.
<P>
	Is there not room in the Young Offenders Act for first 
offenders and treating young people differently on their first 
offence than adults?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Forseth:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond. 
Certainly this is not the first examination of juvenile justice. 
The Young Offenders Act has been amended since first passage. 
I also remind him that I was a part of trying to administer the old 
juvenile delinquents act in the field and was a part of 
federal-provincial conferences that went on for years, round 
and round.
<P>
	I am saying perhaps our mind is closed, but others have 
resisted the response from the community. The basic example 
that he provided was of a first-time young person who makes a 
mistake and steals a chocolate bar. In my experience in the 
practice in British Columbia, that person would not be charged 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4238"> 4238 </A></B>
<P>
but they would be dealt  with through alternative measures of the 
Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	Similarly an adult, a first-time offender, who steals a 
chocolate bar in the adult system would not be charged either but 
would also be referred by the crown for adult diversion.
<P>
	There is more than enough discretion at all levels of the 
justice system for it to operate and accommodate the extreme 
examples cited.
<P>
<B>(1035 ) </B>
<P>
	My point is that we need some balance and proportionality. It 
is not a matter of social philosophy coming from a particular 
political point of view. It is the experience of communities right 
across this nation that has arisen from the practical application 
of the act in the community. If it was the appropriate balance, 
one would expect that the community would be responding in an 
appropriate way with some measure of confidence. However, 
the lack of confidence related in our motion is what we have and 
that is the empirical evidence of results in the field.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened closely both to the speech of the member who 
moved the Reform Party motion and to the comments of the 
other member, and I am not convinced, as has just been stated, 
that all Canadians are dissatisfied with the current Young 
Offenders Act. I think that as far as the public is concerned, this 
is a highly emotional issue. It is a subject ideally suited to long 
philosophical debates and above all, I do not feel that the 
average joe should have the final say on this matter merely by 
picking up a telephone and registering his views.
<P>
	Young people are treated differently by the print media and we 
are seeing this more and more, precisely because we are dealing 
with a young person. Stories involving youths make the front 
page in all of the tabloids. Recently, one particular case in the 
region received front-page coverage for an entire week, and it is 
still being talked about today. I think that the newspapers make a 
big issue of it when a typical case arises and that their coverage 
directly influences how people feel.
<P>
	I am somewhat disappointed with the comments of the 
member who moved the motion, in that he never quoted 
statistics to support his proposed amendments. He never once 
mentioned if indeed the crime rate among young persons 
between the ages of 10 and 12 had increased dramatically, to the 
point where drastic action was required to deal with the 
situation.
<P>
	Well, I have some statistics which I would like to share with 
him and I would be interested in getting his comments.
<P>
	The most telling figures are those concerning the homicide 
rate among young people. I think this is the issue which the 
motion before us wants to address. In 1981-I do not have very 
recent figures but I was told yesterday in response to my 
inquiries that the data is being compiled and that I would get it 
eventually- thirteen murders were committed by young people 
in Quebec, and thirty-four elsewhere in Canada. In 1982, nine 
such cases were reported in Quebec and twenty-three elsewhere 
in Canada, and for 1983, there were three cases in Quebec and 
twenty elsewhere in Canada. The most recent figures I have are 
for 1986 when six murders were committed by young people in 
Quebec, and twenty-two by young people elsewhere in Canada.
<P>
	Furthermore, the general crime rate among young people has 
declined by 8 per cent in the province of Quebec, and by 34 per 
cent in the metropolitan Montreal area. There were 34 per cent 
fewer crimes in 1993 than in 1992. Does the member have 
statistics to the contrary? If so, I would ask that he disclose them 
so as to justify the motion put before us this morning.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Forseth:</B> Mr. Speaker, I certainly question the statement, 
``where Canadians are coming from''. I believe the motion 
today represents a nation's outcry of dissatisfaction with the 
Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	As far as the statistics that he quotes are concerned, I would 
have to examine them. We are not saying that we have a massive 
crime wave from young offenders. We are saying that the 
community is basically at a disadvantage with the operations of 
the juvenile justice system.
<P>
	Beyond just quoting statistics, the law must be educative. It 
also must send the right message to the community. When you 
ask young people where I come from what is their view of the 
Young Offenders Act, they think it is a soft touch, that it is 
inappropriate. The act must represent what is socially 
appropriate in our nation.
<P>
	We say the title of the Young Offenders Act truly must deal 
with young offenders.
<P>
<B>(1040 ) </B>
<P>
	In this age of social sophistication, certainly someone who is 
old enough to get a driver's licence and aim that weapon of a car 
down the street should be held accountable for their driving 
offences, their drunk driving or whatever it may be in a regular 
adult court system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me a great deal of pleasure to speak on this 
motion this morning because it is a very important topic.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4239"> 4239 </A></B>
<P>
	As the member who presented the motion has said, it is of 
concern to a great many Canadians. However this concern is not 
necessarily for the reasons that he said. There is a great deal of 
concern in Canada for our youth, for our next generation; where 
they are going and what they will have when they become adults 
and lead the actual direction of the country.
<P>
	We in the Liberal Party will be bringing forward legislation in 
June to deal with some of the concerns that the hon. member has 
brought forward. Whether these changes will meet with his 
approval or not, no one can say until he actually sees them. We 
will, however, be bringing forward a first phase in June that will 
deal with changes to the Young Offenders Act and to some 
degree will harshen penalties for young offenders.
<P>
	The second phase is a study beginning in the fall of the Young 
Offenders Act. This complete review of the Young Offenders 
Act will determine what changes should be made to the act in 
light of the changes that were being recommended in June, and 
other changes which need to be made to accommodate the 
concerns of the people of Canada.
<P>
	We will be hearing witnesses and the committee, I presume, 
will be travelling. It will be a complete and detailed study. The 
concern of course is that we must look at this act not from the 
point of view of a concern of the people of Canada-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No?
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacLellan:</B> -but also from the concern of the young 
people themselves. We must look at the young people as being 
part of the people of Canada.
<P>
	There is tremendous concern in the public but it is a concern 
for the safety of Canadians. It is concern with the youth and it is 
concern about where we are going as a country. We need to look 
at this question completely.
<P>
	The hon. member who presented the motion states that we 
should reduce the maximum age of the young offender from 18 
to 16 and the minimum age from 12 to 10. This is a dramatic 
change and one that will come up in our study of the Young 
Offenders Act in the fall.
<P>
	Let me take the first part, the reduction of the maximum age 
from 18 to 16. We are saying that there has to be punishment for 
young offenders but we are not saying that young offenders are 
going to be put away for the rest of their natural lives. Even if we 
have transfers and these young people serve the full 25 years, 
someone who is 17 will be out before even middle age.
<P>
	We have to acknowledge that these young offenders will be 
back on the street. What kind of people are we going to put back 
on the street? We send some young offenders, 16 to 18, to a 
maximum security penitentiary. Some might have to. Some 
might be considered as incorrigible.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	As a rule of thumb, if we take away the Young Offenders Act 
for that two year period we will be sending young people 16 and 
17 years old to penitentiary, not necessarily for murder and not 
necessarily for violent crimes. That is not going to be in the act. 
There is no way of saying we have to restrict these young people 
going to maximum security because they committed a murder or 
a violent crime. We are taking them off the Young Offenders 
Act. They will have to forage for themselves if they are in the 
system in the same way as somebody 35 or 40 years old. They 
will be in a penitentiary and open to sexual and physical abuse.
<P>
	If that is what the hon. member and the Reform Party wants, 
then they should come forward and say it. However, that is not 
going to give us the type of person we want in our society upon 
release after they have paid their debt to society. What we want 
to do is try to put somebody back in society who is not going to 
reoffend, not somebody who is so mad and bitter at society and 
what it has done that they will want to reoffend to get back at 
society.
<P>
	Sure, there has to be protection. Certainly we have to protect 
the victims. There is no question that legislation first and 
foremost has to be concerned with that, but we also have to have 
rehabilitation. There are people who say that rehabilitation is 
just soft peddling the treatment we are going to give to the 
offender but that is not the case.
<P>
	Rehabilitation is going to be a vital part of our society 
whether we like it or not. If we do not have rehabilitation for 
children at risk in one form or another we are going to have 
chaos in our society. Our young people are going to be the source 
of criticism for all of the adults in Canada.
<P>
	Why should this be? Why should we in Canada be at war and 
at loggerheads with our own youth? Why should we say we are 
making young people the objects of concern and fear in our 
country? Young people are committing crimes and we say they 
have to be punished. They have to be punished with the victim 
and the Canadian public primarily in mind, but remember also 
the fact that the youth will be back in our society.
<P>
	That is just one aspect and it is not the one which is going to 
have the utmost importance in the long term. We have to punish 
the offenders now. More important and for a more sweeping 
benefit to society, we have to do everything we possibly can to 
stop crime from happening in the future.
<P>
	That is why the main thrust of this government in justice and 
public safety has to be crime prevention. That is not just crime 
prevention of those who have already committed crimes; it is to 
prevent crime from happening.
<P>
	As we learned in the justice committee in the last Parliament, 
the older a young person is, the less likely rehabilitation is to 
have an effect. It is vitally important that rehabilitation start at 
the very moment children are determined to be at risk. A 
psychiatrist who appeared before the justice committee told us 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4240"> 4240 </A></B>
<P>
that the most important age for preventing children at risk and 
dealing with this concern is from the day the child is born to his 
or her third birthday. That is a very young age.
<P>
	We have to look at this. We have to look at custody. We have to 
look at foster homes. So many young people are moved from one 
foster home to another. There is no bonding with any one family. 
That is a concern we will have to deal with.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	We are concerned that there are single parents who have to 
work but do not have anybody to look after their children after 
school because they cannot afford daycare. That is something 
we will have to consider. We may not like it and we may not 
think we should be bothered with it but we have to consider it 
and deal with it.
<P>
	There is divorce in this country and there are single parents. 
We have to recognize that these things are in our society and we 
have to work together. This is one community. We have to bring 
the provinces onside about rehabilitating young offenders, 
about diversification programs and community work instead of 
putting them in detention.
<P>
	We also have to do something in the schools. The federal 
government cannot tell the provinces what must be done in the 
schools; it is a provincial jurisdiction. Sure we have the Canada 
food guide and we tell young people what they should and 
should not be eating, but we have to respect the Constitution. 
However we have to work with the provinces on spotting these 
children at risk while they are in the schools to try to deal with 
them. We have to support our teachers and one another 
provincially and federally in this very important area. If we do 
not, we will surely lose many of our young people.
<P>
	Young people do commit crimes and it is a tragedy for the 
victims. The victims are going to lose their children who in 
many cases have been murdered by young offenders. The 
parents will never get over this ultimate tragedy. Surely there is 
no greater tragedy for a parent. I do not think anyone in this 
House would minimize that. Every time I think about this it 
sends chills through me. That is something we are going to have 
to deal with regarding young offenders and a punishment will be 
needed.
<P>
	However we also have to try to spot these young people who 
may commit murder or other crimes in the future, and 
rehabilitate them before they actually commit a crime. That is a 
vital aspect of the society in which we live.
<P>
	The most important area is one we keep covering up and that 
is child abuse. It is now being determined that as high as 80 per 
cent of adults who commit child sexual abuse were themselves 
sexually abused. The studies show no differentiation indicating 
that a child who is sexually abused one time as opposed to 20 
times that the child is going to be more of an abuser or less of an 
abuser.
<P>
	The fact remains if a child is sexually abused we can say 
without any hesitation that child stands a greater than 50 per 
cent chance of abusing a child. That is a frightening statistic. 
However, if we do not start dealing with crime prevention, it is 
going to escalate. Child sexual abuse will be with us in at least 
the proportions it is now.
<P>
	We have to address this concern. We have to because it is 
ruining children's lives. We have to look at the question of child 
prostitution. There are pimps who use children of any age now, 
12 years or younger, but certainly under the age of 18 and they 
profit financially from their prostitution.
<P>
	What is that doing to those young people? What kind of 
punishment are we giving these pimps? Some would say it is 
absolutely devastating the lives of those young people. It is 
psychologically hurting and damaging them beyond repair. 
Their adult lives will not have anywhere near the meaning they 
would have had if this had not happened to them.
<P>
<B>(1055 ) </B>
<P>
	These are questions society has to deal with. How are we 
going to deal with them? Sure, we are going to deal with crimes 
by punishing the offenders, but we as Canadians have to 
examine this whole question of children at risk in our society.
<P>
	This has to be done by bringing forward a national council on 
crime prevention, as the Minister of Justice is proposing. It will 
have representatives from various federal and provincial 
departments and other organizations. It will look at this whole 
question and at legislation to see if it deals with every aspect that 
could lessen and prevent crime in our society.
<P>
	As communities we have to get people working together: the 
police, Children's Aid, Elizabeth Fry, John Howard, drug 
dependency, and Alcoholics Anonymous. As individuals in our 
community we have to look at this question from the point of 
view of children in our neighbourhoods and stop crime before it 
happens. We have to help young people, not as parents, uncles, 
aunts or other relatives, but as members of the community. We 
have to realize that unless we do that we are going to have 
escalating offences by youth.
<P>
	We have to look at it from that point of view, but the fact is we 
are not. In some of our cities there are young people of colour 
who have come to Canada from other countries with minimal 
education. They may be 16 or 17 years old. They are not going to 
sit in a classroom with children 10 years younger than they are. 
They do not have jobs. There is still a lot of prejudice out there. 
There is also the fact that we are not employing our young 
people the way we should. There are things against these young 
people.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4241"> 4241 </A></B>
<P>
	What are they going to do? They want those things young 
people feel they can aspire to, so a lot of them turn to drugs and 
crime. We have to examine that. We cannot ignore that in our 
inner cities. It has been ignored in the United States and look 
what has happened. There are certain parts of cities in the United 
States the police will not even go into. Is that what we want? No.
<P>
	We have to salvage these lives not only for the benefit of the 
individuals themselves, but for all Canadians so that they will be 
contributing to our country's future. This country is going to be 
in the hands of these young people in a few years.
<P>
	I want members of the House to talk to young people. I do not 
want them to forgive their crimes. I do not want them to say the 
crimes they are committing are right or that they are 
misunderstood. That does not help them. It does not help to put 
them in detention and have them play pool and watch television. 
They have to realize this is a harsh world. They know this, but it 
is from a different perspective.
<P>
	Young people are really scared. They do not see a future for 
themselves. They do not see the jobs. A lot of them have 
problems in school and at home. A lot of them feel society is 
mixed up. We are not concerned with one another and that 
bothers young people. Young people do not become cynical and 
uncaring until they become adults. Young people are concerned 
that we are not looking out for one another and that we are not 
listening to their concerns. We must listen.
<P>
	We have to start with identifying children at risk. We have to 
look at our society and ask how as Canadians we can help these 
young people. If we do that we will reduce crime. If we can stop 
sexual child abuse we will help future generations. We will be 
working with Canadians of the future. We have to bring forward 
changes to the Young Offenders Act because society is ahead of 
us; we have not kept pace with the situation out there right now.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	It gives me no pleasure to say that we have to create harsher 
penalties for young offenders; but we have to because of the 
situation that exists right now. We have allowed the situation to 
get out of hand. We as parliamentarians cannot allow it to 
become worse. We cannot allow the situation to escalate.
<P>
	We have to deal with crime. We have to deal with the causes of 
crime. We have to say to our young people: ``We want to work 
with you for the benefit of Canada. You obey the laws and we 
will do our best to understand what you are going through and 
what your problems are''.
<P>
	Eighteen is the age used throughout the world. It is the age 
recognized by the United Nations. Rolling the age back from 18 
to 16 will not help youth in our society. The government will 
address changes to the Young Offenders Act beginning in June. 
We also have to address the causes of crime and understanding 
our youth.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville):</B> Mr. Speaker, frankly I have 
sat through this presentation just shaking my head. I have heard 
a lot more of the same: what we have heard from bleeding heart 
Liberals over the past 10 years. I am really concerned about that.
<P>
	It was reflected in the hon. member's statement about 
16-year-olds ending up in the prison system and being abused 
by 30 and 40 year old prisoners. Instead of dealing with the 
problem directly by fixing up the prison system, he used that as 
an argument against our changes in age in the Young Offenders 
Act. Again and again I have seen problems being dealt with in 
any way but a direct, head on approach. I think we need more 
direct dealing with problems head on.
<P>
	I have a comment and a question for the member. I think he 
argued in favour of the change we are proposing when he talked 
about pimps. The hon. member asked what kind of punishment 
we were giving to pimps. Does he not think that there are more 
and more 16 and 17 year old pimps who are covered under the 
Young Offenders Act and cannot be dealt with properly?
<P>
	That question and the answer to that question support the 
argument in favour of the changes we are proposing today. I 
would just ask the hon. member if that is the case.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacLellan:</B> Mr. Speaker, prostitution and juvenile 
prostitution in society are escalating. We could say there are 
more pimps under and over the age of 18 years than there were 
ever before. That is a fact in our society; that is happening.
<P>
	To say that this is a reason for toughening the Young 
Offenders Act does not make sense to me. There are laws to deal 
with pimps and those who profit from youth prostitution. We 
have to look at those laws. We have to examine them to see if 
they are strong enough. There is no question. That is why I 
raised it.
<P>
	The fact of the matter is that we have to look at why we have 
16-year old pimps. How does this happen in society? Will 
punishing them stop it? It has never stopped it before. The only 
way we can stop it is to try to get to the root of the problem in 
society. We have to do that.
<P>
	To say it is simplistic and we are glossing over the problem is 
the furthest thing from the truth. Crime prevention and citizen 
participation in crime prevention are everybody's business.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Tremblay (Rosemont):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to the hon. parliamentary secretary to the Minister of 
Justice and I must say that I agree to a great extent with his 
diagnosis and the values on which his position is based. Having 
worked with him for several months on the issue of gun control 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4242"> 4242 </A></B>
<P>
when he was in opposition, I recognize today both his 
open-mindedness and his concern.
<P>
	There is one aspect of his approach however that leaves me 
wondering about what will happen in the communities in the 
future. While I agree on the whole with his position on youth in 
general, we know young repeat offenders present specific 
problems. I think special attention should be paid to that aspect, 
particularly to adults using young people to commit crimes.
<P>
	We have seen it happen in the context of cigarette smuggling. 
It was obvious in that case, but it also exists elsewhere and there 
are no provisions on this at present. We should look not only at 
young offenders but also at the adults who exploit them. Perhaps 
that aspect of the legislation is the one that needs the most to be 
changed, to ensure that adults who use young people to commit 
crimes be given punishments commensurate with their actions. 
So, the problem is not only with the Young Offenders Act, but 
also with the law as it applies to the adults who exploit them.
<P>
	We are well aware, in the present belt-tightening climate, and 
that is my main concern, that public services for the young 
people in general will not be expanded. Let us face it, public 
services are undergoing cuts. But at a time when public services 
do not expand, a special effort must be made to strengthen the 
mechanisms and tools of community spirit.
<P>
	Take the current situation in a riding like mine where we have 
youth centers and, in neighbourhoods where there is more 
violence or prostitution, we also have streetworkers from 
community organizations. Do you know what these 
organizations live on? They live on temporary job creation 
programs, commonly called DEPs or section 25s.
<P>
	Right now in Montreal, do you know what the situation is 
since April 1? We are told there will be no more regular DEPs, 
and operating funds for section 25 programs will be cut. We are 
talking about insignificant amounts in the scheme of things, a 
few million in a $20 billion budget. Can the parliamentary 
secretary at least undertake to send a clear message to the 
Minister of Human Resources Development so that, in an urban 
area like ours, such inexpensive programs be maintained to 
support community spirit because these are being chipped away 
as it is? The very means on which we are supposed to build a 
better society are being taken away.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacLellan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments of 
the hon. member. I must say I agree with a lot of what he has 
said.
<P>
	It is a concern. In the province of Quebec a year or so ago they 
advertised publicly for women who were being abused to come 
to the shelters or to the available facilities to receive treatment 
and help. Within a matter of a few weeks the facilities were so 
overloaded they had to stop the advertising. That gives us an 
idea of the problem there.
<P>
	With respect to assistance, assistance has to be maintained. 
The Minister of Human Resources Development understands 
that. I have spoken with him on this matter. I made another 
suggestion which the provinces could maybe deal with. We have 
a pilot project in New Brunswick where a thousand or so older 
members of society who are 55 to 65 years of age but not retired 
are guaranteed so many weeks work in the community. There is 
no reason the work in the community could not be with young 
people, dealing with children at risk. We have people with 
knowledge of computers and various sports organizations who 
could perhaps work with some young people in society.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	There are ways to do it. If all members of the House come 
forward with suggestions and we work together we can do it. 
With the co-operation of the provinces we can make a 
meaningful contribution.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough West):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Reform Party motion is rather specific in what it is proposing, 
namely the reduction of the age limits from 12 to 10 years and 
from 18 to 16 years. We know the tragic case of the young lad 
who was killed in England by two people under the age of 12 
years. If that case had happened in Canada absolutely nothing 
could have been done.
<P>
	My question for the parliamentary secretary is rather specific. 
We know the Minister of Justice will be referring the entire 
Young Offenders Act to the justice committee. Is he aware 
whether there will be any restrictions placed on the 
examination, or will it be a completely wide open ability for the 
committee to look at everything including the reduction of age 
limits?
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacLellan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
that question because I think it is very helpful.
<P>
	The examination by the justice committee will be without any 
kind of bounds or governors, whatsoever. The committee is free 
to make whatever recommendations and proposals it wants. 
There will not be any attempt to try to restrict the thinking or the 
activity.
<P>
	I would go so far as to say that the legislation the Minister of 
Justice will be bringing forward in June and will be passed prior 
to the report of the justice committee is open for review, even 
though it would be passed before the actual study by the 
committee.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4243"> 4243 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Moose Jaw-Lake Centre):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the member's statement he outlined his concerns for 
the fact that we may send young people under 18 years to 
penitentiary or to prison. I do not think that is the issue here. I 
think crime is the issue and the Young Offenders Act is the issue.
<P>
	If they are prepared to commit the crime they ought to be 
prepared to do the time. That is the penalty or the price they pay 
for antisocial behaviour in this country.
<P>
	What does the member say to victims of young offenders' 
crime? The case that comes to mind very quickly is the 
Martensville case in Saskatchewan. I know personally some of 
the victims. What does the member say to the parents and the 
grandparents of two and three year old children? Does he say 
that we cannot send young offenders to prison because they may 
get sexually abused or that it is not a nice place? How would the 
member handle that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacLellan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not think we are saying 
that at all. I said that when we take 16 and 17 year olds out of the 
young offenders system we are taking them not only for violent 
crimes. We are taking them out of the system for theft and 
vandalism. We are taking them out of the system for everything.
<P>
	For purposes of murder and other serious crimes that is 
something we have to deal with in the legislation the minister 
brings forward. Hopefully there will be changes. If not, there 
will be the ability of the committee to determine any changes.
<P>
	Sending 16 and 17 year olds to prison and having them 
sexually and physically abused will not help society when those 
young people get back on the streets. Punishment has to happen. 
When we talk about parents who have lost their children because 
of murder by a young offender, there is no one in the House who 
has a lock on sympathy and downright remorse for what 
happened. Anybody in the House, particularly myself, would 
love to do something that would be helpful to those parents.
<P>
	This is why I say crime prevention to stop it from happening 
to somebody else has to be something that we have first and 
foremost in our minds. Eighteen is an internationally recognized 
age. Sixteen, eighteen or whatever will be before the justice 
committee. Every member on the committee will have a chance 
to examine that aspect of the legislation.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert):</B> Mr. Speaker, once 
again, a reactionary roar full of sound and fury has risen up from 
the Reform Party benches. This motion tabled by the hon. 
member for New Westminster-Burnaby is one more skirmish 
in a hysterical and perverse crusade by the Social Panic Party.
<P>
	Who are these Prairie crusaders ganging up on now? Young 
people who are not eligible to vote and who are represented in 
this Parliament by adults, adults who are running scared and 
who want young offenders to be punished like adults-who are 
their role models-for the same crimes. It is clear from all the 
statistics that juvenile delinquency is marginal in proportion to 
the general crime rate. However, it takes only a few isolated and 
unfortunate cases for a pack mentality to develop and demands 
to rise for exemplary punishments for young offenders. The 
focus is on punishment.
<P>
	Reactionaries are swept up in an irrational thirst for 
retribution. Why? To appease their own adult consciences 
because they realize these crimes are committed by young 
people who imitate them. They tell us: These young people have 
committed adult crimes, so they are adults and should be 
punished as adults. They tell us: Forget 30 years of research on 
the treatment of juvenile delinquency. They say: The statistics 
on the genuine and positive rehabilitation of the vast majority of 
young people supervised by youth protection agencies are so 
much garbage. Forget social clemency for children whose 
criminal tendencies are usually the result of disintegration for 
which adults are largely responsible.
<P>
	Echoing this hysteria, the Panic Party is now calling for 
exemplary punishment under the Criminal Code for young 
people over 16, for penitentiary terms and even life sentences.
<P>
	I am shocked and appalled by this motion, a motion that was 
communicated to us on very short notice, although its tone and 
substance is what we have come to expect.
<P>
	I spoke previously on a motion by the Reform Party which 
stated that criminals enjoyed privileged treatment before the 
courts and that victims were ignored by the judicial system. At 
the time, I said that this statement was not supported by any 
verifiable statistics and reflected a complete ignorance of the 
facts.
<P>
	On the same occasion, I reproached the mover of the motion 
for lending her voice to reactionary groups and for playing along 
with the media. I also remember how the Reform Party 
responded to my statements in this House on gun control and the 
provisions in the Unemployment Insurance Act that 
discriminate against married women. I must conclude that the 
Reform Party is entirely consistent in its ideology.
<P>
	The motion before the House this morning is part of a 
disturbing trend. I hope that all Canadians will see what Reform 
Party members perhaps do not see in their political positions. I 
see all the signs of a nostalgic fascism still unaware of its 
implications. I see a desire for reverting to a society that our 
democracy rejects. I hear a call for ``an eye for an eye, a tooth for 
a tooth''. But if it were ideological-
<P>

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. I wonder if the 
word or the joining of the words ``nostalgic fascism'', 
particularly ``fascism'', with respect to the Reform Party is not 
unparliamentary language.
<P>
<B>(1120 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> In reply to the point of 
order raised by the member for Kootenay East regarding words 
used in debate, first let me make a comment that when remarks 
are made of a general nature and not specific to any one member, 
that being one criterion, I would say no, it would not be deemed 
unparliamentary.
<P>
	However, I will seize the occasion to remind all members that 
of course when language and tones sometimes cause disorder 
the Chair is apprised of that and I would ask all members to keep 
that in mind in the selection of their words or their statements or 
their tones.
<P>
	In conclusion to the point of order raised by the member for 
Kootenay East, at this time this is not deemed unparliamentary.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne:</B> Mr. Speaker, some people's sensitivities must 
certainly be spared. So I will continue talking about the Reform 
Party's motion.
<P>
	I said that I thought it was calling for the law of retaliation.
<P>
	By the way, Mr. Speaker, I would like to know if the time you 
took to think it over will be given to me to continue after?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Let us say that I will use a 
rule from the game of soccer. I will take that time and charge it 
to my account, so I will not take it from you.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne:</B> Mr. Speaker, I admit my ignorance of soccer, so 
I will have to trust you.
<P>
	We were talking about the law of retaliation. If it was 
ideological, I would say that such positions are disturbing 
because they arise from convictions that might one day result in 
laws that could not be enforced. I do not believe that it is 
ideological. The Reform Party's motion has much more to do 
with electioneering than with philosophy.
<P>
	Anyway, just saying that the Reform Party's positions might 
be philosophically motivated would shock them, I am sure. They 
are not philosophers but politicians. The basis of this motion is 
nothing but public sentiment that the Reform Party is trying to 
use to its advantage. That is very easy.
<P>
	Riding the wave of public feeling, the Reform Party is 
declaiming that young people are not charged for the crimes 
they commit, that young people commit more crimes than adults 
do, that the sentences imposed on young people are ridiculous 
and that most violent crimes are committed by young people. 
That is the rumour.  Even if the hon. member does not say so 
openly, his whole argument is based on these propositions.
<P>
	One can present such a motion without believing that juvenile 
delinquents are a large enough criminal group in society to 
really threaten public safety.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	On the contrary, all the statistics available so far show that 
young people are charged more often than adults for their 
offences.
<P>
	According to the 1991 report of the federal Department of 
Justice, the charge rate for young people was 61 per cent 
compared with 25 per cent for adults, and the data shows that 
16- and 17-year-olds are treated more severely than adults.
<P>
	On the other hand, according to the same figures, the 
conviction rate on charges laid against young people is still 
much higher than for adults. Finally, since it is the most serious 
offence, young people who commit murders may be tried in 
adult court.
<P>
	A young person convicted of murder in a superior court of 
criminal jurisdiction is liable to life in prison. It is only when the 
individual is not tried in adult court that the maximum sentence 
for murder is five years.
<P>
	If the Crown does not ask that he or she be referred to adult 
court, he or she will be tried in juvenile court. And even if the 
Crown makes that request, it will be up to the judge to decide 
depending on the circumstances of the case. This system works, 
Mr. Speaker. Unless we systematically challenge the judicial 
system, we must admit that the judges are in the best position to 
assess the objective and subjective circumstances of an offence.
<P>
	I think the law is quite adequate in letting judges decide 
whether or not the case should be referred to adult court. That is 
why I think the law should not be amended in any way in this 
regard. All the parties concerned with juvenile delinquency say 
that the current system works well. Not perfectly, of course, but 
well.
<P>
	That is not good news to the Reform Party, which urges us to 
focus on isolated cases. Canadian figures are generally 
consistent from one province to another. I therefore can say 
without a doubt that juvenile crime is not more prevalent in 
Western Canada than in Quebec or the Maritimes.
<P>
	At this point in time, nothing can reasonably justify the 
hysteria of those who blame young people in their fight against 
crime. On the contrary, everything shows that crime is a reality 
of adult society. The proportion of teenagers guilty of Criminal 
Code offences is quite marginal compared with adults.
<P>
	I have before me the latest figures from the Quebec public 
security department, and the same ratios can be applied to the 
Canadian population as a whole. In 1993, only one out of 51 
qualified murders may have been committed by a young person. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4245"> 4245 </A></B>
<P>
The ratio is 6 out of 25 for second-degree murder and 0 out of 4 
for manslaughter.
<P>
	On a grand total of 90 murders committed in Quebec in 1993, 
young people may have committed 7, or less than 10 per cent. Of 
241 attempted murders, 25 or about 10 per cent may have been 
committed by young people. As far as crime against property is 
concerned, young people committed 644 out of 3,177 robberies 
or about 20 per cent and 2,244 out of 21,592 offences against 
persons or a little over 10 per cent.
<P>
	With respect to drugs, the facts are overwhelming. The vast 
majority of drug offenders are adults. Less than 5 per cent of 
offences for heroin possession, trafficking or smuggling are 
committed by young people. For cocaine offences, the rate is 8 
per cent. Who can argue that the crime rate is higher among 
young people? Or that the proportion of criminals is about the 
same among young people as it is in the adult population? Let us 
face it: While adults represent 75 per cent of Canada's 
population, they commit over 90 per cent of crimes. Mr. 
Speaker, the reality is clear. Young people are not criminals. In 
their teens, that short period from 12 to 18 years of age, a very 
small proportion of them, less than four per cent in fact, will 
commit an offence, and that includes any incident, from the 
most ordinary to the most serious one. The majority of these 
offences will be assaults following arguments, as well as acts of 
vandalism and statutory offences.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	The current Young Offenders Act is based on a long study of 
juvenile delinquency. We cannot talk about juvenile crime, 
because the reality does not support that false perception. The 
overwhelming majority of young people will reach adulthood 
without any problem, while two adults out of three could one 
day become part of the statistics on criminality.
<P>
	Faced with such evidence, what is the relevance of a motion 
such as the one which is before us and which we will vote on? If 
the hon. member for New Westminster-Burnaby looked at the 
issue carefully, he knows that amending the Young Offenders 
Act as proposed in his motion would have the immediate effect 
of making that act almost useless. Since juvenile courts almost 
always hear cases involving young people aged 16 to 18, why 
does the hon. member not simply suggest repealing the act? It 
would be simpler, more honest and more direct. Such a measure 
would not be hidden behind a pretence of good intentions.
<P>
	On what philosophical view of human nature is this notion of 
criminal responsibility based in the case of ten-year-old 
children? I agree that a ten-year-old child knows the difference 
between good and evil, but does the hon. member truly believe 
that a ten-year-old understands the nature of what is evil? Does 
he think that a child of that age is already corrupted and bad to 
the point of purposely doing something wrong and drawing from 
it a gratuitous satisfaction related to the fact that he is copying 
adults?
<P>
	Who does the member represent? Does he speak on behalf of 
these paranoiac groups who have nothing better to do than throw 
the population into a panic? Or those individuals who flood us 
with hysterical correspondence reeking of hate? Or those new 
right-wing extremists who think that a jail sentence is still the 
best solution for young offenders?
<P>
	In 1984, the new Young Offenders Act was based on a humane 
approach to juvenile delinquency. Realizing that young people 
were not criminals and that the dependency on their parents had 
the effect of reducing the risks, the legislator, after countless 
consultations, passed a law which favours a helping relationship 
between the various officials and the young person guilty of an 
offence.
<P>
	The purpose of the law-and I repeat it again in case the 
member for New Westminster-Burnaby did not catch all the 
subtleties and nuances-is to help the young offender become a 
responsible person, by ensuring an effective intervention by all 
the professionals involved.
<P>
	Instead of imposing a judicial sentence which would 
immediately turn the young offender into a criminal with a 
record, the law favours the effective rehabilitation of that young 
person through a series of actions. And if you read the act 
carefully, you will see how generous its provisions are in that 
respect. If that law helps only one young offender stay away 
from a life of crimes, it will have achieved its goal. The 
Criminal Code, on the other hand, serves no purpose other than 
to punish those who are guilty of an offence. If you make a guilty 
offender out of a young person, he will remain guilty for the rest 
of his life. However, if you give that person a chance to see what 
his options are, you will probably save him.
<P>
	I realize that such a solution is not acceptable for someone 
who is bent on revenge, but if adults seek revenge, let them first 
use that solution on themselves. Let them build social, family 
and political structures adapted to the young before avenging an 
isolated offence committed by a young person to whom they 
were unable to teach honesty. This motion is simply deplorable. 
It might have afforded me the opportunity to discuss the 
amendments that the Minister of Justice gave us notice of some 
months ago, if it had had the merit of proposing something 
substantial in the administration of the Act. I know that there is a 
strong temptation among the Liberals to yield to certain 
pressures to make the Act more severe. I know that some day we 
will have to examine certain situations that the Act did not make 
provision for when it was adopted because the social reality at 
the time did not demand it.

<P>
	I am prepared to admit that the system should be adjusted to 
new realities, particularly regarding organized crime. I am 
aware of the danger from bands of young people in certain urban 
areas. I believe that this is a phenomenon with which we must 
come to terms specifically, but we will certainly not do so by 
changing the focus of the Act, by stripping it of all its impact on 
the practical level and by lowering the age of criminal 
responsibility. I do not believe that bands of young people have 
many members between the ages of 10 and 12.
<P>
	The problem of bands of young people is related to that of 
adult organized crime. In this regard, we will take a position at 
the proper time. For the present, I ask this House to reject the 
motion of the member for New Westminster-Burnaby.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have listened carefully.
<P>
	I want to make this very clear. By our motion today we are not 
asking for increased penalties particularly. We are not 
discarding the social help side for those offenders who can take 
it up. We are asking that the Young Offenders Act, under the 
concept of diminished capacity for handling young offenders 
somewhat differently than adults, simply apply to the right 
group.
<P>
	Why does the member misrepresent what I have said? Why 
does she feel it necessary to misrepresent our motion today? I 
ask what philosophy she has that in view of obvious national 
concern of what is not working she would essentially defend the 
status quo.
<P>
	The big debate in the House the last time when the Young 
Offenders Act was passed was largely about the upper age, 
whether it should be 16, 17 or 18 and what the cut-off age should 
be. The House was essentially divided 50-50 at the time. A 
decision was made and for the last 10 years we have lived with 
the consequences of that decision.
<P>
	I say to the member that she should ask her constituents what 
they want rather than telling them what they should want. The 
data is in from the national mood, from what we have been living 
with. The people have asked for our motion today.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sorry, but I have in no way 
distorted the motion put forward by the Member for New 
Westminster-Burnaby. I commented on his motion. I did not 
say anything about extending sentences, contrary to what he 
says. I mentioned the fact that he wants to lower the age from 12 
to 10 and from 18 to 16. That is what I talked about.
<P>
	When he asks me to talk to my constituents about what they 
think about his motion, I can tell him that right now. We know as 
a result of many surveys that have been conducted throughout 
Quebec, and I imagine  throughout Canada, that people are 
reasonably satisfied with this legislation. As I said, it is not 
perfect, and there is room for improvement. However, 
Quebeckers are not currently in a panic over the Young 
Offenders Act.
<P>
	You hear a great deal about it, as I understand, in the West and 
in the English-language press. Why exactly are they panicking 
so? Is the press exaggerating? Or is it the work of a few paranoid 
people? I am not sure, but people are not paranoid in Quebec. 
The Member must be aware of what is happening elsewhere, and 
not just in his area, where he claims there is a general sense of 
panic.
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
enjoyed listening to the hon. member but with great respect I 
caution that it is not helpful to a reasoned debate to have 
inflammatory rhetoric.
<P>
	I represent a riding in the metropolitan Toronto area, not in the 
west. As recently as May 2 of this year I held a public forum as I 
do every month. The issue was public safety. I want to tell the 
hon. member that in the five and a half years that I have had the 
privilege of representing the people of Scarborough West I have 
discussed many issues with them and in particular crime issues.
<P>
	I want to refer specifically to the actual wording of the 
opposition motion, not what various people think it says. The 
opposition motion urges a response to the ``evident lack of 
confidence that has arisen from Canadians over the Young 
Offenders Act''.
<P>
	As far as I am concerned that is a fact in Scarborough West. I 
believe that the majority of my constituents have an evident lack 
of confidence in the Young Offenders Act. As recently as May 2 
they asked me, in no uncertain terms and in nothing less than a 
clear majority what the government was preparing to do about it.
<P>
	The government is quite aware that there is a problem with the 
Young Offenders Act. That is why in the red book the 
government proposed amendments and that is why the Minister 
of Justice is going to be bringing forward amendments and is 
going to be putting the entire act to the justice committee for a 
complete review.
<P>
	I am satisfied with that action by the government. In fact I 
applaud it. I have told the people of Scarborough West what we 
are doing and they are prepared to wait because there is no panic. 
But make no mistake about it, there is an evident lack of 
confidence. We have seen motions not from alleged fascists out 
west but from people on my side of the House bringing forward 
private member's bills co-sponsored by Liberals dealing with 
the age restrictions.
<P>
	I want to ask the hon. member, are the good people of 
Saint-Hubert so different from the good people of Scarborough 
West? Is the hon. member telling me in good conscience that 
everything is okay as far as they are concerned with respect to 
the Young Offenders Act? If  so, does she still support the justice 
minister's suggestion that the act be reviewed by the justice 
committee?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4247"> 4247 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne:</B> First of all, Mr. Speaker, I would like to say that 
when I mentioned panic earlier, I did say in the West. I also 
mentioned the English-speaking press. What I mean is that this 
panic does not exist in Quebec. It just does not. This is a fact. 
Again, it may be due to our distinctiveness.
<P>
	I also wanted to say there is no point causing people to panic, 
even in regions where, as you indicated, lack of confidence is 
already evident over the Young Offenders Act. You said lack of 
confidence had arisen over this legislation. It may be the case, 
but I do not think that proclaiming it from the rooftops will solve 
anything. I think a better way may be, as I said earlier in my 
speech, to open up the act. I said that it needed improvement, not 
that everybody was telling us all was well with the world. I said 
changes were required.
<P>
	For one thing-I did not mention this earlier and this is a very 
personal point of view-I think the Young Offenders Act should 
be amended to provide that offenders between the ages of 16 and 
18 have to go before adult court when they are charged with 
murder and only then. That is my own position, and I want to 
make that clear.
<P>
	So, I did not say there was general jubilation over the Young 
Offenders Act, but I did say that it did not produce the same 
panic reaction as it did in your region.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to the speech by my colleague from the Bloc 
Quebecois and I agree with most of what she said.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	Since we in Quebec have a definite position on the 
amendments that could be made to the Young Offenders Act, 
could she tell us in this House what the consequences would be if 
Parliament adopted the motion now before us concerning age? 
What would be the consequences for the whole system that we in 
Quebec spent years putting in place and which now gives very 
good results? What would be the consequences of adopting the 
Reform Party motion on the whole system as far as young 
offenders in Quebec are concerned?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne:</B> Mr. Speaker, as I pointed out in my speech, in 
Quebec at the present time all the parties involved favour the 
status quo.
<P>
	So if we change the whole system by modifying the definition 
of ``young person'' to mean a person between 10 and 16 years of 
age instead of 12 and 18, we will certainly clog the courts and 
the already overcrowded jails. Furthermore, we will not 
rehabilitate young people by turning them into hardened 
criminals, as we know very well that prisons are not schools.
<P>
	So, to give my colleague a quick answer, I think this would not 
be a solution for us in Quebec, as all the parties involved really 
favour the status quo.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to take exception to a couple of things 
the member for Saint-Hubert mentioned.
<P>
	Yes, we are here as politicians and not philosophers. We do 
not live in a dream world that there is a perfect society and a 
separate nation. The member accuses the Reform Party of being 
hysterical, of being paranoid, of having knee-jerk reactions to 
isolated incidents.
<P>
	I would suggest to her that there is a bit of hypocrisy here with 
an isolated incident in Montreal that the whole country was 
horrified about that they are now demanding strict gun control 
legislation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think that the term ``hypocrisy'' 
is unparliamentary.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The term ``hypocrisy'' in 
general is not in itself unparliamentary. If an hon. member is 
unhappy because another hon. member called him or her a 
hypocrite, I would certainly take the opportunity to remind that 
hon. member that it is unparliamentary.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Resuming the question, the hon. member had the floor.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to know why the 
member feels that because we are reacting to a public concern 
that was indicated by a survey I took with over 3,000 responses 
received that 90 per cent of my constituents support lowering 
the age because they are concerned about young people who are 
falling through the system because they are too young to be 
given any help because they have made some poor decisions.
<P>
	How does the hon. member feel that these young people below 
the ages of 12 will be helped to change the direction they are 
going if they do not fall under this act?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne:</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all I would like to say that I 
did not say directly that the Reform Party was paranoid or 
everything that she says. I just said that they may have such 
tendencies, which is quite different.
<P>
	Besides, when people say now that society is really disturbed 
about the Young Offenders Act, I do not think that using forums 
like this, the House of Commons, the media and so on and 
emphasizing what some say is the weakness or laxity of the 
Young Offenders Act will help the debate; I do not believe that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4248"> 4248 </A></B>
<P>
saying everything is wrong in society and in our legal system 
will help us and move the debate forward, not at all.
<P>
	I think that we must look at the law, as I said earlier, because 
basically it satisfies those concerned and the public, but in some 
cases perhaps it can be improved. I do not think we have to 
panic.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> Mr. Speaker, on behalf of 
the whip of the Reform Party I would like to advise the House 
that pursuant to Standing Order 43(2) our speakers on this 
motion will be dividing their time.
<P>
	When I came to Parliament I came with the belief that as a 
member of Parliament I should be reflecting my constituents' 
wishes to Ottawa, not the reverse. For far too long the people of 
Canada have had the impression, much of it correct, that when 
they elect politicians in their constituency somehow they come 
down here and take on a particular aura, that somehow Ottawa 
ends up engulfing them.
<P>
	I am committed to representing the views of my people in my 
constituency and they are starting to know that and believe that.
<P>
	I believe the future of Canada resides in our young people. 
The young people of Canada truly are the future of Canada 
because as great and as magnificent as this country is physically 
with all of the assets that we have from the Atlantic to the Pacific 
to the Arctic, we are still no more than the spirit of the people of 
Canada.
<P>
	I have been going out and making presentations to schools 
throughout my entire constituency as a first priority. Every day 
that I have been in my constituency since January I have made it 
a priority to be in a school because this is where the future 
citizens of Canada are and our young people are our country's 
future greatness.
<P>
	At Fernie Senior Secondary School, Mr. Randy Rae teaches 
Law 12. In addition to being a teacher he is a rancher and also a 
director on the regional district of East Kootenay. Randy 
understands democracy and believes in democracy. Coming to a 
consensus with his class that the Young Offenders Act is flawed, 
he directed them to construct a process to try and make some 
changes to the act. He also told them that it would not be a waste 
of time because he believes that he has a member of Parliament 
who will go into the House of Commons and represent his and 
his students' wishes to Ottawa. He is right.
<P>
	The assignment identified the present Young Offenders Act, 
explained what it is and how it works. They got copies of various 
changes that have been proposed to the act and finally conducted 
interviews, had discussions and surveyed at least 10 different 
people each and then summarized their views.
<P>
	It is interesting that the survey results reflect much of what 
the Reform Party has been proposing in terms of changes to the 
Young Offenders Act: stiffer penalties for young offenders, 
lowering the age at which a youth is considered to be a young 
offender, holding parents financially responsible for the actions 
of their children in some cases, and allowing the media to 
release the names of repeat young offenders.
<P>
	Within the survey we came across two people who were 
talking about the inclusion of corporal punishment in the 
penalties of the Young Offenders Act. This is indicative of the 
responses that I have been getting on the street.
<P>
	However, understand clearly this is not the Reform Party 
position nor is it necessarily my position. All I am saying is that 
because the present system of justice for young offenders is not 
working, my personal opinion is that we should be prepared to 
take a look at corporal punishment after a thorough objective 
review of all pertinent information gathered from around the 
world.
<P>
	As I pointed out before, it was interesting to see that some of 
the points brought up in the survey were reflective of what the 
Reform Party has been promoting. This reminded me of 
something that took place in last year's federal election. The 
editor of one of our local newspapers slammed our belief that 
the Young Offenders Act should be amended so that parents and 
guardians of young criminals should have the legal 
responsibility to exercise parental control over youth. In fact a 
great deal of our media attacked the party for this view.
<P>
	However, this survey conducted by the students supports this 
line of thinking.
<P>
	I believe that society has responsibilities, responsibilities to 
the young people of our community and to their parents. Clearly 
there has been a fork in the path. The politicians who have come 
to Ottawa have been going down the fork of permissiveness, 
whereas society as reflected in the comments gathered by the 
young people in this survey and comments made by people I 
come across daily, whether it is at trade fairs I attend or clubs or 
organizations or in our schools, as people come up to me and 
communicate to me it is very clear that people who come to this 
House historically have been co-opted by the system. They have 
been co-opted by Ottawa and they have ended switching from 
the path that people in the constituency wanted to the path that 
was established by the Liberal Solicitor General, Jean-Pierre 
Goyer, 23 years ago in 1971.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	My only question is will this government listen? It has 
promised and promised, but will it listen? Will it actually turn 
around and start to bring in what needs to happen or will it get 
engaged in a review of the justice system that is going to take 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4249"> 4249 </A></B>
<P>
another 18 to 24 months? Will it meet the demand of the people 
of Kootenay East and indeed all Canadians?
<P>
	No one can argue there is not a need for change to the Young 
Offenders Act. It is clear there is something wrong when we 
consider statistics from recent years as reported by Statistics 
Canada in January this year. In 1992 youths accounted for 13.7 
per cent of all persons charged with violent crimes, up from 10.5 
per cent in 1986. That is a jump of 3 per cent in just six years.
<P>
	Of the 135,348 youths charged in Criminal Code incidents in 
1992, 15 per cent were charged with violent crimes and that 
figure was up from 10.5 per cent also in 1986.
<P>
	Even more shocking is the rate of increase in violent youth 
crime compared with that of adults. Since 1986 violent crime 
among our youth has risen at an average annual increase of 14 
per cent compared with an adult increase of only 8 per cent over 
the same period of time.
<P>
	Recently the Liberal member for London West who is also 
vice-chairman of the committee for justice and legal affairs told 
this House that when it comes to youth crime we should divorce 
perception from reality. She went on to say that Canadians 
would be able to tell their concerns to a committee when the 
legislation undergoes a thorough 10-year review. If that is going 
to take another 18 to 24 months that is not soon enough and that 
is what our motion is all about.
<P>
	With respect to the vice-chairman of the justice committee 
and her attempts to dilute my party's thrust and concern about 
the Young Offenders Act there are many victims and families of 
victims hurting because of this inept legislation and quite 
frankly they are not interested in a 10-year review. There are 
problems we have to confront now.
<P>
	I would like to read the following incident as was reported by 
Canadian press news wire this week. The vicious assault which I 
am about to relate took place in Oyama, a small community of 
about 500 homes located 30 kilometres north of Kelowna in the 
Okanagan:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A man whose head was caved in with an axe after he scolded a teenage driver 
for running a stop sign was in critical condition today and might be permanently 
paralysed.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Rodney Bell was hit in the head with the blunt edge of an axe in front of his 
horrified wife and children. Eight teenagers showed up to confront Bell at his 
secluded lakefront home on Friday just before midnight, a day after he chased 
them when they sped through an intersection, narrowly missing his car. Bell 
tried to reason with the teens, one of them grabbed an axe from a nearby 
woodpile and swung it full force at Bell's head. The gang then fled.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Police have arrested two 16-year olds in connection with the assault but they 
cannot be named under the provisions of the Young Offenders Act.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As Mr. Bell lies in a hospital clinging to life, and if he does 
survive with the possibility of some form of paralysis ahead of 
him, the greatest injustice is probably the last line of the story:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>One teen was charged with aggravated assault and remains in custody while the 
other was charged with assault and released-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He has gone back to school:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-but of course they are too young to be named under the protection of the 
Young Offenders Act.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I am committed to the concept that the youth are the future of 
Canada, that they are Canada. The minimum they should expect 
is protection by law for themselves, their persons, their property 
and protection for their parents.
<P>
	I commend the students in my constituency. I commend 
Randy Rae and the Fernie Senior Secondary School and I thank 
them for their diligence, for their project and for the effort they 
made to communicate with me. It is this kind of communication 
from my constituents that gives me confidence that I am 
speaking for them when I speak about the Young Offenders Act. 
It is this kind of communication that I want from people in my 
constituency. Your Reform MP truly is different, I am listening.
<P>
	I want to represent the views of the people of my constituency 
in this House. I hope the Liberal government gets it through its 
head that is what we are doing and that is what we are here for. 
We might not be using the correct political words. We might 
even be doing things that are politically incorrect. We do not 
care about political correctness; we want results. Above all we 
care about representing the views of the people of Canada. In 
this particular case we demand that the government move 
immediately so that we protect our youth and our parents by 
force of law.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	I implore all members of the House to support the motion to 
start the momentum toward changing the Young Offenders Act. 
Our young people, the future of Canada, demand our support and 
our protection.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
listened with great interest to the debate this morning. I do not 
normally agree with my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois, but I 
want to stress the point that the member for Saint-Hubert 
stressed.
<P>
	If we listened to the questioning in the House during question 
period over the past several weeks we would almost get the 
impression that we are in a panic situation in Canada and that 
crime was escalating. That is generally not the case throughout 
the area. That is why I agree with the member for Saint-Hubert. 
In Quebec we are taking a calmer approach. I caution Reform 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4250"> 4250 </A></B>
<P>
members opposite. I find some of the questioning very 
judgmental and causing a bit of panic where there is no cause for 
panic.
<P>
	Let us take a look at what our party is committed to. On the 
government side we are committed to reviewing the Young 
Offenders Act. Since the beginning of Parliament the opposition 
side has requested that it wants to be more participatory in the 
drafting of legislation. We are going to refer the matter to 
committee for its recommendation.
<P>
	I find the motion a bit premature. I am having a hard time 
understanding how reducing the age to 10 years old or 
preventing the disclosure of the names of some young offenders 
will improve the statistics the member opposite quoted. How are 
we going to improve the 15 per cent or the 135,000 by reducing 
the age? Is the brunt of the motion to reduce the age to a lower 
level so that we have more people involved in the statistics? Are 
there not other ways of addressing the problem?
<P>
	It is going to committee stage so why do we not wait for the 
committee to report? Members opposite are part of the 
committee. What is the panic?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is a consciousness on our part 
when 3,000 people turn up in Alberta on a sunny afternoon. I 
believe it was the member for Mississauga West who indicated 
that this was an issue. It is not a panic issue. It is just that 
Canadians are demanding changes.
<P>
	The specific change we are proposing is an indicator that in 
fact there will be some momentum. With the greatest of respect 
to the member, to the Solicitor General and to the justice 
minister, I suggest when we get into this review we all know that 
Parliament moves at glacial age speed. We are going to be in a 
12, 18 or 24 month process. The people who are talking to me are 
demanding change now. We are simply requesting that members 
of the House of Commons recognize that people are demanding 
change quickly, are demanding change now.
<P>
	I am speaking on behalf of the students whose report I 
presented in the House of Commons today. In my judgement it is 
the young people in society who are the most severely 
inconvenienced and put under pressure by an inefficient, 
incompetent Young Offenders Act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a short 
question but first I want to make a brief comment. This morning, 
I have the impression that Reform Party members have, in their 
press clippings, a lot of articles taken from <I>Photo Police</I>. I do 
not know if this kind of weekly exists in Western Canada, but 
this is the impression I get when I hear these descriptions of the 
terrible things that are happening.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	I cannot agree with them. The Bloc's position was presented 
earlier and will later be explained in further detail by the hon. 
member for Berthier-Montcalm. As far as I am concerned, 
making criminals of younger children will not solve the 
problem. Does the member agree that we should have a 
proactive approach and provide support to young people, so that 
they do not end up doing things like that?
<P>
	The question raised earlier by the hon. member was a call for 
the Liberal government to provide assistance and create direct 
employment programs to keep our young people busy and give 
them jobs. Again, I do not think that we will solve the problem 
by making criminals of younger children. I would like to see the 
two opposition parties work together and convince the Liberal 
government to take proactive measures instead of sending 
young people to jail.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, in the original presentation of the 
motion my colleague from New Westminster-Burnaby came 
up with some excellent examples of how young people under 12 
years of age had fallen through the cracks when they could have 
been helped by the process. A whole group of people are 
currently abusing that end of it. They are involving young 
children because they cannot be charged.
<P>
	There has been a change in our society. Looking at the upper 
end, at the 16-year old end, on behalf of the people in high 
school I say the problem is that the straight kids need protection 
and the Young Offenders Act is not doing it.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I wish I had more than 10 minutes. I would like to 
start by reading the declaration of principle in the Young 
Offenders Act:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(1) Young persons should bear responsibility for their contraventions, but should 
not be held accountable in the same manner, or suffer the consequences for their 
behaviour as adults.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) Society must be afforded the necessary protection from illegal behaviour.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(3) Young offenders have special guarantees of their rights to due process.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(4) Young offenders have special needs and require assistance that is not available in 
the adult system.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Young Offenders Act has given young offenders more 
protection of their rights, but in no measurable way has it 
provided society with any protection. Our concern is that the 
balance is not there.
<P>
	It is time we started talking about reality. The reality is that 
society has changed. When I was younger we may have had 
fights but they were not with weapons. We used our fists or 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4251"> 4251 </A></B>
<P>
pushed each other around but we did not pull out knives. The 
reality today is that our children feel the need to arm themselves.
<P>
	The motion today dealing with age is, as my hon. colleagues 
have suggested, a reflection of the feelings of Canadians. 
Although they have heard a lot of talk about changes to the 
Young Offenders Act and Parliament studying it, they also 
realize that the deadline of January 16 for proposals is long past 
and they are no closer to a decision having been made.
<P>
	Our motion gives Parliament an opportunity to give some 
indication to Canadians that we are listening, that we care and 
that we will act to do something to protect society, particularly 
our children because that is what is being demanded.
<P>
	I would like to share an example of why we feel we need to 
lower the age limit to 10 years. I received a letter from a 
constituent involved in an accident. On Sunday, April 24, he was 
driving home. He proceeded through a major intersection on a 
green light but was hit by a stolen car that was running a red 
light, being pursued by the police. It sounds like a crime was 
being committed. Actually it was more than one crime, but 
because of the Young Offenders Act no crimes were being 
committed. His car was sideswiped by the speeding vehicle. It 
was just lucky that no one was killed: not the driver of the stolen 
vehicle and not himself.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	The driver of the stolen vehicle was 11-year old Michael 
Smith. Mikey, as he is known, has admitted to stealing over 30 
cars. He boasts that he will continue to do so until he is 12 years 
old. His mother, Bonnie Hartwick, has asked authorities to 
arrest her son in order to do something about it. She says she 
does not know what to do with him and has begged for help. Our 
system does not allow Mikey to receive that kind of help.
<P>
	What are we waiting for? Are we waiting for the Mikeys of the 
world to kill somebody before we can help him? We are talking 
about lowering the age limit so that offenders who are going in 
the wrong direction at such a young age can be brought into the 
system and dealt with, so that we can turn them in the right 
direction before it is too late.
<P>
	Let us not forget those two ten-year-olds in England who 
murdered a two-year old child. In Canadian society absolutely 
nothing could be done in that situation. The problem is with the 
act and the age limits. It is time we reacted and changed it so that 
we can address the issues.
<P>
	Another concern is upper age limits. Sixteen and seventeen 
year olds know the difference between right and wrong. I speak 
with considerable experience, being a mother of four boys. My 
youngest is 14 years old. When we are talking about 16 and 17 
year olds like Huenemann, Lord and Gamache, we are talking 
about 16 and 17 year olds who are not innocent children. They 
are vicious, cold-blooded murders. They are not petty thieves. 
They are not kids or young people who have been charged with 
shoplifting, stealing cigarettes or even stealing cars. These 
cold-blooded individuals viciously murdered another human 
being. As 16 and 17 years old  they knew what they were doing 
and they should be treated as adults committing adult crime. I 
also suggest that our courts have the flexibility to move 16 and 
17 year olds to adult court but they seem very reluctant to do so.
<P>
	I share again a case in my constituency. Two years ago 
16-year old Jesse Cadman of Surrey was murdered by another 
16-year-old. He was viciously stabbed in the back during a fight 
because his murderer did not like the hat he was wearing. Jesse's 
killer was apparently told by his friends not to worry, that he was 
a young offender and could only be incarcerated for a couple of 
years. That almost happened. Jesse Cadman was viciously 
assaulted by a 16-year old kid who knew what he was doing and 
almost got away with a couple of years.
<P>
	The youth court judge refused to raise Jesse Cadman's 
murderer to adult court. It was only because Jesse Cadman's 
parents, specifically his father, organized a group called CRY, 
Crime Responsibility Youth, and pressured the justice system 
that Jesse Cadman's murderer was raised to adult court.
<P>
	CRY has been circulating letters demanding, asking, begging 
the House of Commons to change the Young Offenders Act. In 
just three weeks my office received over 300 letters. I went out 
into my community to see if it agreed with Mr. Cadman's 
position, a position expressed by others, that the Young 
Offenders Act needed to be changed specifically with respect to 
age limits. I wanted to know whether my constituents felt that 
the age limits should be lowered. In 3,000 responses over 90 per 
cent of my constituents have said yes, we feel the time has come 
when we need to change the ages, to lower them to allow the 
younger offenders to be brought into the system so they can be 
turned around and lowered at the upper end so the murderers of 
Jesse Cadman and the murderers of the little Shawns over on the 
island can be dealt with as adults who are responsible for their 
actions, knowing what they did.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	The public is demanding that the House of Commons do 
something and not just study, not just continue to look at 
legislation. They are asking, they are begging us to show some 
sense of concern, some sense of urgency in dealing with this 
issue.
<P>
	That is the reason we have put this motion on the floor. It 
gives us the ability to show Canadians that we are prepared to 
listen to them, that we are prepared to consider their concerns 
and that we are prepared to take action, not just to talk about it, 
not just to study it, but to take action and do something about it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4252"> 4252 </A></B>
<P>
	I believe it was very unfortunate that last week when the 
member for York South-Weston introduced Bill C-217 debate 
was limited to only one hour and it was not votable.
<P>
	That bill was to change the Young Offenders Act. It is very 
important that we start giving these kinds of bills the attention 
they deserve. I do not think we are over reacting. I do not think 
we are being paranoid. I think the member for York 
South-Weston and the members of the Reform Party are being 
sincere when we say we should do something now in the interim 
before the review of the Young Offenders Act is completed. Why 
do we not do them? Why not do just a few things to show that we 
can do something and do it now?
<P>
	I ask this House, I beg this House, here is an opportunity to 
show Canadians that we are concerned, that we are prepared to 
do something concrete. It is not the answer to everything. There 
are other changes that need to be made. We do need to focus on 
crime prevention. Nobody is arguing that. However those are the 
things that will have results in the long term.
<P>
	Canadians are asking to be given something in the short term. 
Give us something that will give us hope that changes are 
actually going to be made so that we can feel that the 
government believes in the protection of society and the 
protection of our children.
<P>
	I have shared a letter with the Minister of Justice from a 
13-year old in my constituency. This 13-year old was 
confronted by a 15-year old who stole his hat. His parents 
supported him in making that 15-year old accountable. When 
they confronted the 15-year old he pushed the father aside and 
said: ``Hit me. I will charge you''. That 13-year old is terrified. 
He is terrified that this 15-year old is going to find out where he 
lives and is going to come after him. He is terrified to go to 
school. He is terrified to go out on the street because he knows 
that this kid is going to get even with him.
<P>
	I received a letter from the mother of a 13-year old girl who 
was beat up at school by 15-year old girls. She told her mother 
and because the mother told the school these kids are out to get 
her. She is no longer going to school because she is terrified that 
she is going to be victimized again. We have to protect our 
children and we can only protect them by doing something now.
<P>
	I beg this House, please support this motion. Let us show 
Canadians that we are sincere and that we are prepared to do 
something and not just talk.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would just like to make a couple of comments on the 
hon. member's speech.
<P>
	I know about the concerns she has with respect to the children 
in school. I believe we have all encountered them and we have 
all heard about them, sometimes from our own children.
<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	The problem is that what she is saying is not going to, even if 
we agreed with her, make any difference as far as the Young 
Offenders Act is concerned because we cannot incarcerate those 
children for threatening and intimidating other children. What 
we have to do is work in the community.
<P>
	There is a lot of hypocrisy by the provinces on this. They want 
changes to the Young Offenders Act but what they do not 
mention is that they are responsible for children under the age of 
12. They would like to have people believe that there is nothing 
they can do to help those children through the Children's Aid 
and other means such as education through the school system. 
They would like to blame the fact that these children are at risk 
and not being helped because the federal government will not 
lower the age. It is the provinces who refuse to do what they 
should be doing for these children under 12.
<P>
	I want to ask the hon. member one question. I ask her in good 
faith because I really want to know and it would be helpful. 
When we talk about 16 and 17-year olds the examples used are 
always with regard to murder and violent offences. Does the 
hon. member feel that is where the changes should be made 
while keeping 16 and 17-year olds who commit offences that are 
non-violent within the Young Offenders Act? Is that a 
possibility? Is she saying that is something that could be done?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Mr. Speaker, no, I do not think that is enough. 
The courts have discretion as to what kind of sentencing they 
give. They do not have to send everybody to maximum security 
prisons for minor offences. The courts have that discretion 
already.
<P>
	I think what the member is saying is that only the most vicious 
of the 16 and 17-year old offenders should be taken into adult 
court. What we are suggesting is that the courts should have 
discretion. If they feel that a 16 or 17-year old does not have the 
capacity to understand what they have done or does not 
appreciate right from wrong, the courts can lower them to youth 
court. However, as a 16 and 17-year old they know right from 
wrong and automatically should be held accountable for their 
actions.
<P>
	The courts have the discretion to give them suspended 
sentences or whatever if the offence is of a more minor nature.
<P>
	Even in an adult court, the flexibility is there to deal with 
them in a different manner so that the punishment does not have 
to be harsh or not fair. The discretion is there in adult court and 
that is where 16 and 17-year olds should be treated.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Send the right message.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4253"> 4253 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I want to indicate that I will be sharing this time with the hon. 
member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce.
<P>
	I am pleased to have a chance to address this important issue. 
The Young Offenders Act has been recognized as one element of 
our criminal justice system that is in need of some change and 
some reform. I know I have heard voices somewhere in different 
parts of the country saying: ``Let's get rid of it altogether''. 
However, I am certainly not one who believes that and I do not 
think that many members in the House feel that way.
<P>
	The level of crime committed by young offenders appears to 
have increased marginally. What is more important about that 
area of crime is that the violence associated with that category of 
offender appears to have increased perhaps more than 
marginally. These types of offences are very disturbing to 
society at large and to the communities where they occur. They 
feel particularly handicapped in responding appropriately when 
young offenders commit serious offences because of the shelter 
from normal criminal procedures given to young offenders, 
things like non-publication of name and disposition away from 
the normal criminal court process in young offender courts.
<P>
	I am one of those who concedes that we have to pay some 
serious attention to the increase in violent offences among 
young offenders.
<P>
	Most of us here have not directed much of our attention to the 
petty crimes of young offenders. They have been a problem and 
always will be but we have petty crime problems with adults too. 
It is the more serious crimes that disturb us.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	The government agrees there have to be changes in a number 
of areas of the criminal justice system. Our election platform 
indicated that in the last election campaign. The Minister of 
Justice has told the House-I know members opposite have 
listened-that he will be introducing a bill to amend portions of 
the Young Offenders Act within the next few weeks. This bill I 
gather has been a long time in preparation, reaching back into 
the previous Parliament and he is committed to doing that.
<P>
	Second, the government is prepared to refer the whole issue of 
the Young Offenders Act to the justice committee which will 
review it and report back probably recommending additional 
changes. They may be sweeping, they may be modest, I do not 
know, but the decision as to what will be recommended to the 
government will be in the hands of the members of that 
committee. I look forward to playing a part in that exercise as do 
all members of the House.
<P>
	One of the most important facets of the Young Offenders Act 
regime is the belief, it is really a premise, that young offenders 
have an opportunity to salvage the rest of their lives if society 
will permit them an  opportunity to do that. The young offender 
is before the court because he or she has made a serious mistake. 
The premise that somehow society must intervene and provide 
an opportunity for the young offender to get his or her act 
organized is very much a fundamental part of the Young 
Offenders Act.
<P>
	One of the things that the government has recognized is that in 
many cases the sentencing of young offenders is too short to 
enable them any kind of access to treatment. A two or 
three-month sentence is simply not enough time for the 
agencies and corrections professionals to offer to that youth 
some kind of a framework that would permit the youth to get his 
or her life properly organized.
<P>
	I met a young offender at Camp Dufferin in Ontario about two 
years ago. I remember this vividly. I asked him what he would be 
doing when he got out, having served three or four months. He 
said: ``I guess I'll just go back to the pool hall''. That is where 
the problems all began. He had no place to go. The three or four 
months in the facility were nice, structured, organized. It was a 
bit like a boot camp, it was organized, it was disciplined. When 
it was over so was the regime of treatment.
<P>
	There are some other perceptual problems with the Young 
Offenders Act and I want to bring this one to the attention of the 
House if members have not mentioned it already. Every time an 
adult says the Young Offenders Act is useless, it is not working, 
it is not tough enough, that is the message our youth are getting. 
This is not helpful.
<P>
	First of all I do not think it is entirely accurate. A lot of the 
young offender sentencing or dispositions under the Young 
Offenders Act are quite significant but the youth are not getting 
the message that it is disciplined, it is significant. They are 
simply accepting the message that the Young Offenders Act is a 
zero on the Richter scale of punishment or of responsibility or 
accountability.
<P>
	There are a number of areas that we have to look at in the 
Young Offenders Act. The motion today deals principally with 
revising the age group from 12 to 17 down to 10 to 15. I have 
introduced a bill in this House recommending reducing the age 
to 10. I have done that, having looked at it closely.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	Different provinces across this country have different types of 
legislation for those under 12. I was surprised to find that while 
some provinces have good legislation which can enable the child 
welfare authorities to intervene for the protection of the public, 
in Ontario they can only intervene for the protection of the child.
<P>
	For the young offender who commits a relatively serious 
offence, sexual assault or robbery-and these things happen 
involving 10 and 11-year olds now-I am told that all the police 
can do is take the child home to the parents. That does not do any 
favours for the child, especially when the parents are not at 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4254"> 4254 </A></B>
<P>
home, which is often the reason the problem began in the first 
place. There are urban dysfunctional families.
<P>
	There is no ability on the part of the provincial authorities to 
take care of our 10 and 11-year olds. The young offenders 
regime in each province should be able to accommodate an 
offender who is 10 or 11 years old in the same way it 
accommodates an offender who is 12 years old. I certainly 
support that. On the issue of the 16 or 17-year old, I have not 
made up my mind. I tend to think the issue should be reviewed 
by the committee, as envisaged by the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	There are different views on sentencing and on the issue of 
publication of the names of young offenders. This is a complex 
area. It involves the interface among privacy, the public interest, 
the media and information exchange between institutions. Even 
those institutions which help young offenders are sometimes 
handicapped by the existing barriers to publication and 
disclosure in the Young Offenders Act. This area has to be 
reorganized and I hope it is done at the committee level.
<P>
	The category of dangerous young offender does not need 
much justification. I believe the minister's bill when introduced 
shortly will direct attention to that category of young offender.
<P>
	I want to indicate from my perspective of sitting on this side 
of the House, the Minister of Justice and this government are 
``on the case''. There will be ample opportunity to address the 
issues raised today in the opposition motion and many of the 
other issues in the Young Offenders Act. I look forward to 
working with other members in that exercise.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when I read this Reform Party motion last night, I 
could not believe my eyes. Here we have a party, the Reform 
Party, which for several weeks has been standing up in this 
House proposing prompt and comprehensive action to deal with 
youth crime. As a matter of fact today the two previous speakers 
for the Reform Party said we must have prompt action now to 
deal with youth crime.
<P>
	What did we get? The Reform Party had an opportunity. It had 
an opposition day and it could put its specific proposals to the 
House, but all we get is a simplistic proposal to change the age. 
That is going to deal with youth crime? That is the kind of 
prompt, comprehensive action it wants to deal with youth crime, 
one simplistic proposal to change the age? It is true that in his 
speech the member for New Westminster-Burnaby referred to 
other matters which should be changed, but why are they not in 
this votable motion, if the Reform Party thinks we need action 
now?
<P>
	Perhaps the reason we are getting this simple one line 
proposal is that the Reform Party is not really sure what should 
be done about youth crime. Maybe it is because it has no real 
commitment to any other proposal but this one simple change.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	Perhaps it is because the Reform Party really does not know 
what should be done about youth crime that we are getting such a 
simple one proposal motion. Maybe this one point resolution is a 
sign that Reform members are beginning to realize this matter is 
more complex than they originally thought. Maybe they are 
beginning to realize there is no simplistic solution that we can 
simply take off the shelf and youth crime will go away.
<P>
	The tough hard line approach to criminal justice has been 
tried in some of the United States. Florida, Georgia, Texas and 
Louisiana have the tough hard line approach proposed by the 
Reform Party and what are the results?
<P>
	Florida has 9 murders per 100,000 population; Georgia has 11 
murders per 100,000 population; Texas has 12.7 murders per 
100,000 population; and Louisiana has 17.4 murders per 
100,000 population. In Canada, where we have a more humane, 
rehabilitative and comprehensive approach to deal with crime, 
we have 2.5 murders per 100,000. And the Reform Party wants 
to move in the direction of Louisiana, Florida, Texas, Georgia, 
and other states. I hear that from Reformers every day in the 
House.
<P>
	We in the Liberal Party have said that some amendments are 
required to the Young Offenders Act and we are going to 
introduce them. The Minister of Justice said he is going to 
introduce them within a couple of weeks. But we have also said 
that this is not the comprehensive solution to youth crime. 
Merely changing a few words in the Young Offenders Act is not 
going to stop youth crime.
<P>
	It misleads the public. I believe certain members of the 
Reform Party are sincere, but they are really misleading the 
public when they say they want prompt action now, and they 
give us a one line proposal to simply change the age in the Young 
Offenders Act. They mislead the public if they think that is 
really going to deal with the problem of youth crime.
<P>
	People who are familiar with the problem say over and over 
again that if you really want to do something about youth crime 
you have to address its many, many causes. Whether it is the 
breakdown in families, whether it is the lack of jobs, whether it 
is the lack of recreation, or whether as some of my colleagues 
have said it is that many young people have no home to go to, 
there are many causes. Unless you address those causes you will 
not get real solutions.
<P>
	It appears the Reform Party has based this motion on the 
presumption that there has been a considerable increase in youth 
violent crime. That is not the case. There has been an increase in 
certain categories, but the impression Reform members give is 
that the situation is out of control.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4255"> 4255 </A></B>
<P>
	It is much worse in some parts of the country than in others. 
But if we look at the statistics, offences resulting in the most 
serious personal injury, that is the offences of homicide, 
attempted murder, assault, sexual assault and so on, account for 
2.4 per cent of youths charged with a violent offence, and 0.4 per 
cent of all youths charged with Criminal Code offences. The 
majority of charges, 62 per cent of those charges against youth, 
are for property offences.
<P>
	With respect to murder, the highest rate of murder with 
respect to young offenders 12 to 17 years old was in 1975 when 
there were 68 youths between 12 and 17 who committed murder. 
The lowest was in 1987 when there were 35. There really is no 
discernible trend. Thirty-five are too many. Sixty-eight are too 
many. They are all too many. But this sort of panic approach that 
everything is out of control is completely wrong.
<P>
	The Reform Party is proposing in its motion that the age be 
reduced from 12 to 17 years inclusive, which is the age for a 
young offender under the Young Offenders Act, to 10 to 15 
years.
<P>
	Under the present law persons who are 18 or more are treated 
as adults and they go before the adult courts. Those under 18 
down to 12 years go to youth courts and are covered by the 
Young Offenders Act. As most of us know, a youth between 14 
and 17 years can be transferred to the adult court on a motion 
presented by the crown to have that individual transferred to the 
adult court because the crime has been serious, a crime of 
violence and so on.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	Let us repeat over and over again that those under 12 years are 
left to the jurisdiction of the provinces. It is up to the provinces 
to do something to protect the public and to rehabilitate and take 
care of those persons under 12 years.
<P>
	Why did we pick 12 and 18 a few years ago when we did the 
Young Offenders Act? We did so because 18 was considered the 
general age of majority, not only in Canada but around the 
world. Therefore we said that once you were 18 you would be in 
adult courts and if you were under 18 you would be in the youth 
courts. We picked the age of 12 because that was the generally 
recognized age of puberty, and under 12 years you were 
considered not to have the same characteristics as a person 12 
years and older. That is why we picked those ages.
<P>
	As I said, the Minister of Justice is going to bring in a bill in a 
few weeks dealing with very specific changes to the Young 
Offenders Act. It will go much beyond this simplistic motion 
presented today by the Reform Party. He has also said he is 
going to refer the entire Young Offenders Act to the justice 
committee of which I am the chair for a complete review, no 
holds barred. Every part of the act will be looked at. Action will 
be taken, but action will be taken in a deliberative way.
<P>
	Again this morning I heard Reform Party members 
continually asking whether we favour the rights of the offender 
or the rights of the victim, or do we favour the rights of the 
offender or the safety of society. These are not exclusive things. 
This is a false proposition.
<P>
	It is not a contradiction to be concerned for the protection of 
society and for the offender. As a matter of fact if we are really 
interested in protecting society, we have to believe in 
rehabilitation because the overwhelming number of offences are 
limited offences and those people will be returned to society. 
Therefore we have to care about what happens to offenders when 
they are under our control, whether it is in a prison, on probation 
or parole, or whatever. If we do not show concern for the 
offender we are ignoring the safety of society.
<P>
	We have to be extremely concerned and improve our 
programs for victims of crime and for protection of society. 
Sure, we must do that. But to pretend that you do one or the other 
and you ignore the offender and the offender's rights and the 
rights of society to make sure that the offender returns to society 
a safer person is wrong. We must do both. Rehabilitation is in 
the best interests of society.
<P>
	In conclusion let me say this. We must deal with the Young 
Offenders Act and youth crime and the Minister of Justice will 
present us with a bill in a few weeks. We are also going to get a 
complete review of the Young Offenders Act. We must do that.
<P>
	However, we should not deal with youth crime in the 
simplistic manner suggested to us this morning by members of 
the Reform Party. It will have no effect on the youth crime rate 
in this country. It will not solve the problems they refer to and 
they have raised some pretty serious problems.
<P>
	They keep raising these individual cases which are horrible 
examples of crime by young people. Everybody will agree that 
these are horrible examples. By the way, because these crimes 
are reported in a spectacular way in the press the public has the 
perception that the youth crime problem is more widespread 
than it is. However we admit there are serious problems but we 
do not deal with them in the simplistic way the Reform Party 
suggests today.
<P>
	We are going to get a bill in a few weeks. We are going to have 
a complete and thoughtful review. We are going to hear from 
individuals and organizations from all parts of the country.
<P>
	That is the way to do it. We hear from all sides. We get input 
from experts and ordinary citizens. We get input from the police. 
We get input from correctional officers, social workers, teach-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4256"> 4256 </A></B>
<P>
ers, psychologists, the whole gambit of people who have some 
interest in this matter.
<P>
	We will do it that way. That is the way we should do it. I invite 
the public during that review to work with us in Parliament to 
improve the situation and have better laws and a better situation 
with respect to youth crime.
<P>
<B>(1245 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to my hon. colleague opposite. Members 
would know that my hon. colleague opposite has a long history 
in this Parliament and has been involved in the criminal justice 
system as far as Parliament is concerned for many, many years.
<P>
	As a matter of fact as my hon. colleague mentioned he is at 
this time the chair of the Commons justice committee, a very 
important and powerful role within the Commons. I would point 
out that the chair of the justice committee has a particular 
perspective on crime as evidenced by the fact that recently the 
member is on record of having suggested that perhaps 15 years 
is the maximum that anybody should be in jail for any crime no 
matter what that crime might be, no matter what their age.
<P>
	The member opposite will also recall that in this Parliament 
on October 7, 1971 as a continuation of changing the 
incarceration system, the jail system, a very needed change, the 
government of the day directed the emphasis away from the 
protection of society to the rehabilitation of criminals, which is 
just fine. The Solicitor General of the day is on record of having 
said: ``From this day forward we will put rehabilitation ahead of 
the protection of society''. That was October 7, 1971. This was a 
quantum shift in direction of the correctional service. It was a 
quantum shift in direction of attitude of this Parliament.
<P>
	Perhaps after 23 or 24 years we might revisit this and say 
``Wait a minute. Let us back up. Maybe we should ensure that we 
have a concentration on rehabilitation because we know how 
important that is and we do not want people to reoffend. We also 
have to protect society''.
<P>
	At any rate, the hon. member asked: ``Since we have this 
opportunity to present a votable motion, why would we make it 
so mild?''. The reason we made it so mild is that it was only by 
having the mildest of possible motions that there was any hope 
at all of getting any support from the Liberals who got us into 
this mess in the first place. We want to move this debate 
incrementally down the road. We wanted to make this motion so 
mild that it would be virtually impossible for anyone in this 
House to disagree with it.
<P>
	How wrong we were. If the hon. member opposite does not 
like this motion, would the hon. member opposite, the chair of 
the justice committee, tell this House and Canadians what is his 
number one priority? If he were going to introduce a motion 
today what would that motion be?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allmand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to answer the 
questions of the hon. member. First of all, the proposal he is 
putting before the House today is not mild. It is harsh and 
ineffective. He is including 10 and 11-year old children under 
the Young Offenders Act who should be dealt with because they 
are below the age of puberty under child protection acts and 
other legislation under provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	We are against it because it is a harsh piece of legislation and 
it will be ineffective and it will not solve the problems he is 
referring to.
<P>
	Second, with respect to the quote attributed to Mr. Goyer, the 
Solicitor General on October 7, 1971, all I can tell him is that I 
was appointed Solicitor General in 1972 and I took the 
completely opposite point of view. If he wants quotes I can give 
him many quotes in which I said over and over again that our 
principal goal and our priority is protection of the public in 
everything we do in the Solicitor General's department. That 
was the policy from 1972 right on. I can put on record if he 
wants-not today but any day he wants-speeches made in this 
House, legislation, speeches outside the House which are totally 
contrary to the quote attributed to Mr. Goyer. I do not know 
whether that quote is complete or not. Let us forget about the 
quotes of Mr. Goyer. I can give him quotes from myself, Mr. Fox 
and Mr. Blais, many Solicitors General over the years who have 
not supported that simple quote that was cited in the House 
several times.
<P>
	The members of the Reform Party talk about bringing a new 
approach to Parliament and taking a more honest and fair 
approach with respect to things. Yet today the hon. member has 
accused me of saying that 15 years should be the maximum for 
criminals of all kinds. I never at any time said that and I would 
never support such a proposal, never. However, I see there is a 
letter campaign going around Parliament to all members which 
accuses me of saying murderers should be released 
automatically after 15 years. It is completely false.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	What I said was that for first degree murder the parole 
eligibility date should be 15 years and we should do away with 
article 745 which gives the possibility of release after 15 years 
and that for second degree murder it should be 10 years. There is 
quite a difference from what the hon. member said and what that 
letter says. He should correct that. He should apologize for 
suggesting that I said there should be automatic release or 
release for all prisoners no matter what their crime after 15 
years. He is wrong.
<P>
	When we had parole eligibility at 10 years less than 50 per 
cent got released on that date. If he looks at the statistics, parole 
eligibility does not mean that you are released automatically. As 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4257"> 4257 </A></B>
<P>
a matter of fact you have to prove that you are rehabilitated and 
no longer a danger to the public. That is not easy to do.
<P>
	The purpose of parole eligibility is to ensure that those who 
are really rehabilitated and are not a danger to society can go 
back into society, pay their own way, take care of their families 
and not be taken care of by the state.
<P>
	Let us make sure that when you cite me or you quote me that 
you quote me correctly. I do not mind your disagreeing with me 
on what I really say, but do not distort what I have said.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I know that members have 
very strong views on a very important subject, but in wanting to 
give everyone the opportunity to speak, as many as possible 
during the course of the day, I have to respect the timeframes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. To the 
member opposite, I unreservedly withdraw that remark in 
impugning his character. I thank him for the opportunity of 
setting the record straight.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allmand:</B> I appreciate it.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I thank the hon. member 
for his assistance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the opportunity to join the debate on the Young Offenders Act 
today.
<P>
	In starting out, my party and my constituents and I look 
forward very much to seeing the results of the bill being drafted 
by the justice minister to be tabled in this House. I would 
express the idea that it is unfortunate that the extensive review 
process and recommendation process that the former speaker 
spoke of would not take place before the drafting of the bill so 
that there would be some real opportunity for change.
<P>
	I believe the Young Offenders Act was an attempt to balance 
the approach of the socialistic juvenile delinquents act and the 
demand to protect society from crime.
<P>
	I am not advocating the repeal or the abolishment of the 
Young Offenders Act as some members in society are today. 
After consulting with individuals within the RCMP and 
corrections field it is my belief that the fault lies more in the 
administration of the legislation than in the legislation itself.
<P>
	Perhaps legislated sentencing grids or mandatory minimum 
sentences providing less discretionary powers to the courts 
might be more of a deterrent to young offenders.
<P>
	I am here to advocate amendments to the act to deal with the 
20 per cent of the young offenders this act does not work for. 
One of the better aspects of the juvenile delinquent act was the 
ability to charge individuals who contributed to the delinquency 
of youth. If we brought this measure back it would bring back 
the responsibility to the parent and would not allow adult 
criminals, i.e. drug offenders or car theft ring leaders, to hide 
behind young offenders.
<P>
	There have been a lot of statistics thrown around here today in 
the debate and I have a few of my own that I would like to throw 
into the pot. According to Statistics Canada in 1991, 22 per cent 
of all federal statute charges were laid against youth. Of the 
146,000 charges against youth, 13 per cent or 18,800 of the 
charges were violence related. Since 1986 the violence related 
charges have increased by 102 per cent despite a 1.8 per cent 
decrease in the population of this age group. I think there is a 
crisis here.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	Of all the youth charged approximately 53 per cent were over 
16 years and approximately 46 per cent had prior records. Of 
this 46 per cent 19 per cent had five or more prior convictions. It 
is this 19 per cent that are the problem we really want to address. 
This particular group appears to be flaunting the law and hides 
behind the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	The victims of youth offences have been left out in the cold 
and are not included in the legal process. We all would agree that 
the victims and families of victims suffer greatly and feel 
violated, abandoned and unprotected by the Canadian justice 
system.
<P>
	I can only ask the previous speaker for the Bloc and a number 
of other speakers I have heard today how they would feel if their 
own family were torn apart and destroyed by a repeat young 
offender with no respect for authority.
<P>
	I think the recent introduction of youth justice committees 
and victim service units in parts of my constituency in Alberta is 
making a difference. For the first time the victims and the 
community are having a say in the process. I would strongly 
encourage more victim service units to be developed throughout 
the country as victims have the ability to have their voices heard 
in the sentencing of their assailants through the use of victim 
impact statements and it is making a difference. Victims as well 
should be financially compensated by their assailants, the guilty 
party, to the greatest possible extent. It is Reform Party policy 
that the Young Offenders Act be amended to include: the 
lowering of the age of eligibility of being charged from 12 to 10 
years of age as stated in our motion; offenders aged 16 and 17 
would be considered adult offenders; offenders aged 14 or 15 
who commit serious offences should be transferred to adult 
court; the release of names of offenders to the public and to the 
news media; the holding of parents responsible where it can be 
shown that a lack of parenting control is evident; that offenders 
in custody should be required to enrol in adult life skills 
upgrading programs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4258"> 4258 </A></B>
<P>
	The justice minister and some members opposite suggest that 
to solve the problems of youth crime we must attack the root 
causes. These root causes are poverty, permissive social 
attitudes and the perceived lack of opportunities. I say certainly 
we must continue to work to resolve these problems but these 
problems will be not solved quickly if ever.
<P>
	Society more and more is losing faith in our justice system 
and demanding immediate change. This demand for quick 
action is becoming more and more urgent as we witness the 
dramatic increase in the instances of brutal violent crime like 
the recent stabbing of a young mother in her home in the city of 
Edmonton, or the stabbing death of a 16-year old youth in Hull 
only last week, or the series of drive-by shootings at locations 
all across the country.
<P>
	Only two days ago the theft of a large semi-trailer truck by a 
young offender who went on a joy ride ended in the killing of a 
mother and daughter right here in Ottawa after trying to escape 
from the police.
<P>
	I would wager that almost every member here today knows an 
example in which an overlenient treatment of a repeat young 
offender allowed uncontrollable youth to thumb their noses at 
the system.
<P>
	Last summer I travelled through my constituency. I recall a 
particularly alarming example of a juvenile habitual property 
offender who was sentenced to do community work as 
retribution for his crimes. This youth was escorted to the 
community cemetery with a lawn mower and a can of gas and 
was instructed to cut the grass. When the supervisor returned 
some time later to check on the progress, not only was the young 
offender gone, but so was the lawn mower and gas can which 
was later found to be sold some piece down the road. Sometime 
later rumour has it that in an expression of frustration this youth 
was last seen leaving the community bound and towed behind a 
pick-up truck. This youth went on to reoffend and eventually 
moved on to adult court, but he never did reoffend in that 
particular community again.
<P>
	This example not only demonstrates in a real way the 
disregard many of these repeat offenders have for the system but 
I believe it is also an ominous sign of the direction communities 
and individuals might go if they continue to lose confidence in 
the criminal justice system to protect their property and their 
families.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	I am sure all members here would agree that vigilante justice 
is not something that we want to see. Therefore I urge the 
government to respond to this growing public concern as 
demonstrated by the huge criminal justice rallies taking place 
across the country and to move quickly in order to restore public 
confidence in this most vital criminal justice system.
<P>

	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to the speech of my colleague from Athabasca and I 
think that it was made with sincerity and honesty.
<P>
	I note, however, that the examples given concern specific 
cases, and the member asked what would be the reaction of Bloc 
members or Government members if their child had to 
experience particularly painful situations caused by young 
offenders.
<P>
	No doubt the reaction would be one of outrage and it would be 
a strong reaction concentrating on punishment and resentment. 
It must be noted, however, that as members of the Parliament of 
Canada, we have the responsibility to look at things in 
perspective and a little more coldly, perhaps.
<P>
	I note with interest that the member for Athabasca pointed out 
that it is necessary to attack the roots of the problem, which are 
poverty and the problems of drugs and poor schooling. There is 
no doubt that the often excessive reactions or the crimes 
committed by young offenders can be explained by a particular 
sociological context. But I particularly liked what the member 
for Athabasca said at the start of his speech.
<P>
	He implied that the problem may not be the Act, but the 
administration of the Act. It is indeed my impression in looking 
at the Act and, frequently, in looking at what judges do, it is my 
impression that it might, in some cases, be applied with more 
severity.
<P>
	For example, unless I am mistaken, young offenders may be 
brought before adult courts under the current Act. So, I would 
like to ask the member for Athabasca this question: Does he not 
think that if judges, those who apply the Act, and also the people 
who apply it in the prisons, those who are concerned with issues 
of parole, if these people paid a little more attention to the 
concerns of some and applied the Act with more severity, 
perhaps we would not be obliged to amend the present Act?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chatters:</B> Mr. Speaker, it would appear that the member 
and I are in agreement in much of what he said.
<P>
	I very much agree that more vigorous enforcement of the 
regulations that are there now would be a giant step in the right 
direction. Certainly having said that, there is a small percentage 
of offenders the legislation now is not working for. I would 
suggest from my statistics that would be some 25 per cent of the 
offenders who are repeat offenders. A number of them repeated 
many times and the legislation simply is not working for them. 
There has to be a real deterrent put in the system to deal with 
those offenders.
<P>
	Let us not lose perspective. The legislation that is there is 
working for 70 per cent or 75 per cent of the offenders who go 
before the courts. I really hope that we do not throw out the 
whole act, that we bring in amendments to the act that will deal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4259"> 4259 </A></B>
<P>
severely with the percentage of young offenders the act is 
working for.
<P>
	I would not go so far as perhaps some of my colleagues or 
constituents who made some remarks lately about the youth in 
Singapore who got caught writing graffiti on cars and the 
punishment that was applied to him is perhaps severe in most 
Canadians' eyes. However, that particular youth I am sure will 
never write graffiti on cars in Singapore again.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> I thank you 
very much, Mr. Speaker, and I thank the House for the 
opportunity to speak to this very topical and important debate 
today.
<P>
	What we are talking about today is the confidence that 
Canadians have in their legislatures to be aware and to be part of 
what is going on. For instance, we cannot have rallies in 
Edmonton and Calgary of 5,000 people and then our 
parliamentarians here in Ottawa pretending that there is not 
outrage in the land over the perception of the Young Offenders 
Act, or criminality in general.
<P>
	The debate today is focused on one aspect of the Young 
Offenders Act. In reality what we are talking about here today is 
whether or not Canadians feel safe in their own homes, whether 
or not Canadians have security of the person, whether or not 
Canadians have a sense of safety with their property. When you 
leave your home and come back, what is left?
<P>
	All of us knocking on doors in the last election can recall 
walking down street after street where people are hostages in 
their own homes, paying monthly remittance to burglar alarm 
companies. Why? Because people can break into a home, walk 
down a street, break into another home, and if they are under 
certain ages all they ever get is a slap on the wrist.
<P>
	The statistics that we have had here today will show that crime 
by those who have been accused and convicted is not 
particularly high. Let us talk about the number of crimes 
committed, not the number of convictions. Let us talk about the 
number of people who are convicted on one crime but who have 
done perhaps a half dozen or 15 or 20, or perhaps two.
<P>
	Statistics are not always the measure of the security that 
people feel in their homes. Perhaps better security would be the 
growth of the private protection agencies in Canada, growth of 
the industry in providing protection in people's own homes and 
their own businesses.
<P>
	We have to have balance in this debate. As we go forward over 
these next weeks and months as the government introduces its 
Young Offenders Act and the changes thereto, we need to have 
balance. To do so we need to know where we started and have 
some idea of where we are going to go.
<P>
	I will read the motion for those viewers who might have just 
tuned in.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House urge the government to respond to the evident lack of 
confidence that has arisen from Canadians over the Young Offenders Act, and 
recommend modification to the definition of ``young person'' in section 2(1) of 
the act to mean a person ten years of age or more, but under 16 years of age.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The effect is to lower it by two years. This, as other hon. 
members have mentioned, would serve on the upper end to 
ensure that there is a venue for more strict retribution, and on the 
lower end to bring people into the system so that they can be 
helped at an earlier age.
<P>
	This motion responds to a very evident concern in my 
constituency. Fully 80 per cent to 90 per cent of my constituents 
are calling for a strengthening of the Young Offenders Act; fully 
80 to 90 per cent of my constituents want stricter penalties and 
harsher penalties in the courts.
<P>
	We are talking in this House about gun control laws, the 
potential changes to gun control. Yet our courts do not enforce 
the rules we have now. That is the primary problem, the primary 
cause of the crime that we have in our society today.
<P>
	If we are going to do anything about crime, young offenders or 
adult offenders, there must be three certainties. These are the 
three certainties that we have when raising our own children: the 
certainty of detection, the certainty of a swift and fair trial, and 
the certainty of retribution.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	I would submit that many Canadians feel that our criminal 
justice system, particularly as it applies to young offenders, not 
only does not have one of these pillars to make it successful, it 
has none of the pillars.
<P>
	When your home is broken into, when the police finally get 
there they do a report and you submit it to your insurance 
company and that is the end of it. Once again we are hostages. 
We are paying increased premiums for insurance because we 
accept the fact that our homes are going to be broken into. A 
swift and fair trial-how many of these instances ever come to 
court? And retribution, give me a break.
<P>
	Here we have a criminal justice system particularly as it 
applies to young offenders which has none of the pillars that 
would be required to change attitudes, not one. It is not the way 
we would respond or react in our own homes with our own 
children.
<P>
	If our children did damage to our own property and came 
home would we be upset? Would there be detection? Would 
there be a swift and fair trial? Would there be retribution? You 
bet there would. Why is it then that while we would take this 
responsibility personally as a nation we absolve ourselves of 
this responsibility and we say because a child may have wet the 
bed, they therefore have the right to do whatever they want to do 
to society, it is society's fault.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4260"> 4260 </A></B>
<P>
	An extension of that argument, logical or illogical as it may 
be, could well be that every child who is born and lives in 
modest circumstances would naturally go on to be an offender of 
some description and every child born into more privileged 
circumstances would never get into trouble. We know that is not 
the case. Offences, whether young offenders or not, cut across 
all demographic lines, across all racial and linguistic barriers. It 
has to do with societal values and what we as a society have 
decided is okay and what we as a society have decided is not 
okay.
<P>
	My colleague who just spoke said that he does not agree with 
the fact that this young fellow in Singapore doing whatever he 
was doing, abusing the law, ended up getting the punishment of 
the day in Singapore which is caning.
<P>
	I would submit that there is one heck of a lot less crime in 
Singapore than there is here. I would question where people 
would feel safer, in downtown Ottawa, downtown Toronto, 
downtown Vancouver, downtown Edmonton or downtown 
Singapore.
<P>
	I am not suggesting we go all one way or all the other but I can 
remember from my personal experience a brush with the law. I 
got involved with the Reform Party at a very young age. I went 
to reform school I think when I was about 11. I was at a camp 
with other young boys and we decided we had had about enough 
of that so we ran away. I guess we were 11 or 12 or something 
like that. We were on the loose for three or four days.
<P>
	I can look back at it now and imagine the pain and suffering 
that caused to everyone associated. I would have gone crazy if 
one of my kids had done that.
<P>
	In any event, we sort of lived off the land. If we had had the 
brains we would have been able to figure out how to steal a car 
but we could not, which is not to say we did not try. What we 
were doing was mischief. It would be perceived as mischief 
today.
<P>
	I will never forget walking along a street and feeling the hand 
of the law on the back of my neck as he picked me up. He could 
probably be arrested for that. There I was walking along the 
street. The next thing I knew my feet were off the ground and I 
had this hand around the back of my neck holding me up, a voice 
saying: ``Get in the car, kid''. To this day I have trouble eating 
Shreddies because that is what they served us at the detention 
home. That is not to say that every kid who gets in trouble as a 
youth is going to turn out all bad. They may end up being 
members of Parliament, perhaps a logical extension. I throw no 
collar on hon. members opposite. I am speaking strictly about 
myself.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	How are we as parliamentarians going to get somewhere with 
this perception, not just of youth crime but criminality in 
general? I submit it goes much deeper than changing or applying 
the law. It has to do with the values that we treasure in our 
society. It has to do with things like family values, with a sense 
of community. It has to do with accepting personal 
responsibility. It has to  do with leaders leading. It has to do with 
people who are responsible taking responsibility.
<P>
	We have heard today of students in school being wild and 
doing whatever they want to do. Do the teachers like that? I 
submit they do not. The teachers will tell you time and time 
again that they are handcuffed. We have put them in handcuffs 
so they cannot do anything. They cannot touch the children. 
They can say: ``You are a bad little Johnny, you are a bad little 
Sue. You should not be doing that''. Saying that is not going to 
change a thing.
<P>
	We have to change our values. We have to make personal 
responsibility and personal accountability, whether you are a 
young offender or a mid-sized offender or an adult offender, the 
primacy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member for 
Edmonton Southwest took the liberty of relating a story which, 
in my opinion, shows how a young person who commits a minor 
crime or offence can turn himself around and become a model 
citizen. Not only can he do so, but we must make every effort to 
ensure that this happens.
<P>
	My colleague, the member for Saint-Hubert, indicated to us 
this morning that young people commit 10 per cent of all crimes, 
regardless of their seriousness. This means then that adults are 
committing the other 90 per cent. I feel that we must always 
keep in mind the fact that crime is primarily the work of adults, 
and it is often organized.
<P>
	As the Bloc Quebecois's spokesperson for young people, I 
think we have to send a very positive message to our young 
people, and tell them of our intention to crack down on crime. 
Figures provided by the Library of Parliament indicate that 
despite the addition of police officers and security personnel 
over the past 30 years, things have not improved.
<P>
	A short while ago, I repeated what my colleague, the member 
for Saint-Hubert, had said, namely that in Quebec there were 
few protests and few movements and no mobilization of people 
demanding major changes to the current legislation. However, 
we are led to believe on listening to the members of the Reform 
Party that this is not the case elsewhere.
<P>
	I would like to ask the honourable member if he can give us 
statistics or survey results from his region or even crime rate 
statistics to support his own position and his party's position on 
this legislation, because we confess that we, from Quebec, do 
not understand.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, in my presentation I spoke 
briefly about statistics, their value and what they say or what 
they do not say. The statistics we received at the justice briefing 
had to do with the number of charges and convictions but it had 
nothing to do with the number of offences and break-ins. If the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4261"> 4261 </A></B>
<P>
number of break-ins and  the number of offences are combined, 
those statistics are up dramatically.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	What I am responding to and the statistics that I quoted came 
from surveys in my constituency of people who are specifically 
concerned about the effect of crime.
<P>
	It is absolutely essential, as we proceed with this debate, we 
do not make the blanket statement that all young people are bad. 
They are not. The vast majority of them are great. The vast 
majority of them are inspirations. We see them coming through 
here on tours and we are involved with them. It is something that 
we need to be very cautious about as we get into this debate and 
as we proceed down the road that we do not suggest for a 
moment that all kids are bad.
<P>
	However there is a time when we have to recognize things as 
they are, not as we wish them to be. There comes a time when 
young people, regardless of age, show by what they have done 
that they need special treatment, that they need the care that 
society has to give them or that society needs to be protected 
from them.
<P>
	In my view we need to draw a distinction between people who 
make a mistake and people who make the same mistake over and 
over again and do not learn from it. If you make a mistake once 
and learn from it that is experience. If you make the same 
mistake over and over and over again that is character. We have 
to make the distinction between those who need a nudge to get 
themselves on the right track and those who are a danger to 
society. We have to be very careful that we do not paint everyone 
with the same brush.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Georgette Sheridan (Saskatoon-Humboldt):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Pierrefonds-Dollard.
<P>
	I rise today to respond to the motion under debate respecting 
the Young Offenders Act. The government is very much aware 
of Canadians' concerns respecting youth crime.
<P>
	During the election we campaigned on the need for reform of 
the Young Offenders Act. Since the election the Minister of 
Justice has indicated on several occasions his desire to proceed 
expeditiously to respond to some of the key concerns in this area 
with an amending bill in the very near future.
<P>
	In addition, the minister has also indicated his commitment to 
a review of the entire act. This will be undertaken by the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs over the 
course of the coming year.
<P>
	I am a member of the justice committee and I am particularly 
pleased to be part of the committee that will be doing the review 
of the Young Offenders Act. The act is now 10 years old. As it 
happens I had just finished law school at the University of 
Saskatchewan when the Young Offenders Act was introduced. 
Our class was among the first to do a very detailed study of what 
was  then a new act so I am pleased to be part of the group that 
will be reviewing the act after 10 years of practice.
<P>
	One aspect of the committee will be to listen to the viewpoints 
of all Canadians, to listen to the concerns that are certainly very 
real.
<P>
	The Young Offenders Act creates a separate system of justice 
for young people. It has a unique spirit and philosophy which 
seeks both the protection of society and takes into account the 
special needs of youthful offenders.
<P>
	The Young Offenders Act provides for a balance between the 
imperatives of assuring public protection and meeting the needs 
of our young people who run afoul of the law. We should not 
forget that the interests of society do include the objective of 
rehabilitation of young people as well as for the protection of 
society itself.
<P>
	The interests of society also dictate that we should allow 
young people to mature and, as the hon. member just mentioned, 
to learn from their mistakes and that is a need for a separate 
juvenile justice system. We believe that the protection of society 
entails two obligations: preventing young people from 
committing criminal offences and helping young people who 
commit crimes to become law-abiding citizens again.
<P>
	As a parent I subscribe to the principle that young people are 
responsible for their actions. I am also cognizant of the fact 
however that young people are not on an equal footing with 
adults in terms of their degree of responsibility and if they were 
I would probably not need to be a parent.
<P>
	Owing to their state of dependence and the level of 
development and maturity of young people they have special 
needs. These needs include counselling and support as well as 
supervision, discipline and guidance. The adequacy of the 
Young Offenders Act for youth involved in very serious offences 
however has become a major public issue in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	From a public perspective there is a strong lobby for increased 
sentences in the belief that they would offer enhanced protection 
to the public, provide general deterrents and reaffirm 
fundamental norms regarding the sanctity of life and societal 
repudiation of the crime of murder. Canadians must have 
confidence in the laws designed to protect them.
<P>
	One of the major concerns of the public relates to minimum 
age of criminal responsibility which under the present 
legislation is 12. Many would like to see it lowered to 10. Under 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4262"> 4262 </A></B>
<P>
previous legislation, the juvenile delinquents act, the minimum 
age of criminal responsibility was seven years of age.
<P>
	Support for lowering the age to 10 is not new. In the 
consultations and debates leading up to the passage of the Young 
Offenders Act, some observers made much the same argument 
we are hearing now, that we should have a lower age of 10. 
Others suggested it should be as high as 14. The age of 12 finally 
received broad support in the belief that, generally speaking 
children under 12 would not have the knowledge and experience 
to appreciate fully the nature and consequences of their actions, 
nor would they be able to participate meaningfully in the 
proceedings against them. These capacities of course are 
fundamental to a fair and just criminal prosecution.
<P>
	Another concern of the public relates to the maximum age of 
criminal responsibility, the upper end of the scale under the 
Young Offenders Act. It has been suggested to lower to 16 years 
the maximum age under the Young Offenders Act. The issue 
surrounding the maximum age also received a great deal of 
attention in the debates that preceded the passage of the Young 
Offenders Act in 1982. The inclusion of 16 and 17-year olds in 
the juvenile system was done in the belief that it was in the best 
interests of youth and Canadian society that young persons be 
dealt with in this manner.
<P>
	For the vast majority of young offenders, particularly those 
committing less serious offences, the current age limit allows 
them the time to mature away from the influence of older, more 
hardened adult offenders. I think this is the point that was being 
made by the member from Edmonton.
<P>
	The government is committed to a juvenile justice system 
which will effectively seek to provide protection for our 
communities, to hold young people responsible for their illegal 
acts, but also to take into account any special needs a youth may 
have which are pertinent to the youth's offending behaviour and 
therefore relevant to the goal of rehabilitation.
<P>
	The issues of minimum and maximum ages are very important 
to the operation of the act and Canadians' belief in it. 
Consequently this issue will be looked at in the context of the 
broad based review of the juvenile justice system. This will 
allow all views on the issue to be examined in the context of an 
overall examination of the act.
<P>
	Another public concern has to do with the publication of the 
name of the young offender. It has been suggested that the name 
of the young person who has committed or who is alleged to 
have committed an indictable offence where this youth has been 
previously convicted on at least two separate occasions be 
published. There is scope under the current Young Offenders 
Act to allow for the details of an offence or a trial to be reported. 
Broad coverage of the youth justice system, the trends, the 
profiles of youth and successful programs is permitted under the 
present act.
<P>
	It is important however to distinguish between perception and 
reality. The current emphasis, particularly in the media on 
extreme or exceptional cases, creates a distorted picture of 
juvenile crime and its treatment by the justice system. In view of 
that it is important to understand that there are a number of 
reasons that support the prohibition on publication of 
information serving to identify young accused, including such 
things as the protection of innocent siblings of offenders from 
shame and possible ostracism, encouragement to youth to 
comply with a disposition and to remain free from further 
involvement in crime, prevention of barriers arising that may 
stand in the way of a youth becoming more positively involved 
in a community, including employment and educational 
opportunities.
<P>
	We must also remember the families of young offenders are 
often part of the rehabilitation process and the prohibition on 
publication may enhance their capacity to move forward 
positively for the benefit of the youth, the family and the 
community.
<P>
	In the context of public safety the publication of a youth's 
identity may foster an illusion of public safety. The media 
however can only offer selective publicity rather than full 
reporting of all cases to a limited segment of the population.
<P>
	Balanced against this however is the protection of society. 
The Minister of Justice has indicated in his response to the 
throne speech that he is in favour of a greater sharing of 
information about convicted young offenders with those who 
need to know for reasons of safety. He has also indicated that he 
intends to include provisions related to information sharing in 
the June bill.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	I would like to comment quickly on an important election 
proposal to increase the maximum penalty available in youth 
court for first and second degree murder. Again the Minister of 
Justice has indicated he is committed to increased sentences for 
certain violent crimes, including murder.
<P>
	In the June bill, the Minister of Justice will develop his 
proposals in a way that will seek to improve the juvenile justice 
system and to promote more effective and efficient measures to 
help young offenders while providing protection for the public.
<P>
	In many cases the criminal behaviour of youths appearing 
before the youth courts constitutes an isolated and often not very 
serious act. For a much smaller percentage of youth however, 
their criminal behaviour is part of a pattern of more serious 
difficulties. It is essential to understand the special needs of 
these youths if their interests and indeed the long term interests 
of society are to be met.
<P>
	Canada's Young Offenders Act has received international 
recognition by the United Nations as a model for juvenile 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4263"> 4263 </A></B>
<P>
justice. It clearly takes a bold step by delineating the parameters 
of criminal law for youth and  permitting resort to criminal law 
sanctions only for behaviour which is clearly criminal.
<P>
	In doing so however, it has firmly entrenched the recognition 
that adolescents are to be distinguished from adults because 
their needs are distinct and therefore warrant a distinct response. 
This distinction must not however detract from the principle 
that society is entitled to protection from the criminal activity of 
youth.
<P>
	Canadian courts have interpreted interests of society to mean 
both protection of the public and rehabilitation of offenders. 
This dual interpretation places a very heavy onus on the juvenile 
justice system to deliver on both fronts. The magnitude of this 
task is best illustrated when youths are involved in violent 
crimes or chronic reoffending. These classes of offenders reveal 
the multidimensional nature of the challenge facing those 
involved in the juvenile justice system and the challenge that 
lies ahead of us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member in referring to our motion of lowering the age from 12 
to 10 under the law said that many people support this. My 
question is how many?
<P>
	In a situation like that which happened in Britain where two 
10-year olds murdered a two or three-year old, how would she 
suggest we deal with that situation in our society under our law?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sheridan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe what I said was that 
prior to the passage of the original bill there had been arguments 
on both sides as to whether the age should be 10, 12, 14 or some 
other age. The consensus was that 12 would more adequately 
meet the needs. Therefore I cannot answer directly the 
member's question of precisely how many supported 10 years, if 
I understood the member's question properly.
<P>
	On the tragic situation in England with children of that age 
involved in a brutal murder of a baby, I would like to be able to 
tell the hon. member that simply by cranking up the Young 
Offenders Act we can prevent that kind of thing but that simply 
is not true. It is not possible for that sort of abhorrent behaviour 
to be legislated away.
<P>
	What we must keep foremost in our minds is the dual aspect of 
our juvenile justice system which is to have a system that will 
protect people from repeat offenders and at the same time to 
look at the underlying causes of the kinds of behaviour we saw in 
the tragic British case. Only by dealing with it as a complete 
package can we provide any solutions to these kinds of things.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. 
member is a member of the justice committee would she not 
agree that when this matter is referred to the committee there is a 
fairly high probability we will not see any recommendations 
from the justice committee at least until 1995?
<P>
	There seemed to be some references earlier in this debate that 
everything is wonderful in Quebec according to the Bloc 
members and that we are talking about a regional matter. As the 
member comes from western Canada perhaps we do not have 
that communication barrier.
<P>
	Would she not agree that on the basis of the representations 
she has had with her own constituents, is there not a real 
groundswell of concern on the part of her constituents as there 
are on the part of mine? This very simple thing of doing 
something that very logically is going to happen, would she not 
agree it would be a good strong indicator to the people of Canada 
and her constituents that the House really was serious about 
doing something?
<P>
<B>(1335 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sheridan:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Canadian public will realize 
this government is very serious about doing something by the 
fact that the justice minister has moved swiftly to introduce 
immediate changes in June. That is something he has committed 
to do from the beginning. Also the entire act will be turned over 
to the non-partisan parliamentary committee for a thorough 
review which will involve a careful study of what works and 
does not work in the act and what can be improved upon.
<P>
	I know the hon. member opposite enjoys giving us his views 
on how we should listen to the constituents by referendum and 
other measures. I can think of no better way than to ensure that 
the parliamentary committee system is following that process 
by permitting Canadians to bring forth their views, people who 
are involved in the criminal justice system from all aspects. 
Canadians will be reassured to know that the justice minister is 
committed to providing a process by which their concerns can be 
heard and action taken.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Young Offenders Act is extraordinary because its 
application is not general.
<P>
	It is extraordinary because it provides for different conditions 
for young people. It is extraordinary because its approach and 
philosophy are unique. And finally, it is extraordinary because it 
recognizes the specific needs of our young people.
<P>
	The Young Offenders Act strikes a balance between 
protecting society and meeting the needs of the young person. 
We must remember that the rehabilitation of young offenders is 
as important to society as protecting society itself. Society also 
has an interest in letting a young person acquire the maturity he 
needs to cope with the realities of life.
<P>
	Protecting society, to us, means two things: an obligation to 
prevent the young person from committing criminal offences 
and an obligation to provide the help he needs. Of course, young 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4264"> 4264 </A></B>
<P>
people are responsible for  their actions, but they cannot be 
expected to assume the same level of responsibility as adults.
<P>
	Because of their dependent status and their level of 
development and maturity, they have special needs and requuire 
not only counselling and support but also monitoring, discipline 
and supervision. The treatment of young people who are in 
trouble is something we should not just accent but actively 
promote, approve and support.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the question of youth rehabilitation is not an 
easy one. It is clear that the existing legislation has its 
shortcomings, and the tragic incidents that occurred recently are 
an indication that it must be improved. Criticism of this 
legislation is becoming increasingly vocal and widespread. 
Many factors contribute to a general lack of public confidence, 
including a poor understanding of the phenomenon of youth 
crime and of the provisions of the legislation.
<P>
	For instance, the public does not realize that in youth court, 
sentences may be for the same period as sentences given in adult 
court for a similar offence, and proportionally speaking, more 
offenders are convicted in youth court than in adult court, and 
this applies to practically all types of offences.
<P>
	I agree there is a very genuine public concern about the 
increase in violence among young people, but when we talk 
about youth violence, we must also consider the broader social 
and cultural context in which it occurs. Poverty, low self esteem, 
unemployment, little education, isolation, lack of decent 
housing and early exposure to abusing treatment, often in the 
young person's family, are all factors that in many cases will 
cause a young person to become violent.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	Throughout the election campaign, the Government promised 
to proceed quickly with reform of the Act. It adopted a 
comprehensive and balanced approach to criminality among 
young people, with a number of leading ideas, including 
recognition of the importance of preventing the particular 
problems of Aboriginal youth and the defence of a separate but 
strengthened system of justice for all young people, except the 
most dangerous.
<P>
	In order to adopt the best approach to reform, the Government 
is taking into consideration a number of factors that are deemed 
important. It is clear that the system of justice for young people 
cannot be assessed in isolation from other systems, that is, youth 
protection, health and education, which are essential to the 
prevention of crime among young people and which interact 
with the justice system when an adolescent commits an offence.
<P>
	The confidence of the public must be re-established, but the 
federal government will not achieve this on its own. It is useless 
to blame the Act blindly without taking a look at the 
shortcomings of its application and the inadequacy of services.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Minister of Justice announced recently the strategy 
chosen to reform the Young Offenders Act. The proposed new 
justice strategy has two phases: first, a bill which shall be tabled 
during the month of June; and second, a parliamentary review 
which will examine the nature and extent of youth crime.
<P>
	The review will also look at the age limits, parental 
involvement and alternatives to criminal responses. In fact the 
old justice system applicable to youth will be under review. The 
review will examine ways the federal government can better 
prevent child and youth crime and promote integrated responses 
to child and youth problems at the federal level with health, 
immigration and employment.
<P>
	The bill will focus primarily on murder and other serious 
personal injury offences. Other changes to the act are also under 
study to better respond to youth who are involved in criminal 
activities. These changes may include amendments to court 
provisions, custody provisions, and the evidence provisions of 
the act.
<P>
	The government wants to strengthen the effectiveness of 
intervention in the interests of greater protection and enhance 
rehabilitation in the youth justice system. The government is 
also looking at alternatives to custody for less serious offences.
<P>
	These changes will represent important improvements to the 
act. They target two distinct categories: youth whose behaviour 
shall be addressed by the youth system in the community; and 
youth involved in the most serious offences who may require 
longer sentences.
<P>
	The proposed changes remain true to the ideal of an 
individualized approach which permits the youth court to make 
the most rational choice in the individual circumstances of each 
case. I believe that the modifications will be well balanced, will 
recognize the principle of rehabilitation and will encourage 
community based sentences.
<P>
	It is true that Canada is having problems with a minority of 
youth who are involved in serious and violent crimes. But we 
must not lose sight that the vast majority of youth who are dealt 
with in the juvenile system do not reoffend; they become 
contributing members of our society.
<P>
	Our youth justice system is geared to dealing with the 
particular needs of young people who are still developing and 
maturing. The youth justice system benefits from a specialized 
judiciary with expertise in dealing with young persons. It allows 
pre-sentence reports which allow for a more holistic approach 
than that pursued in the adult system. It also allows for 
specialized medical and psychological reports which may be 
ordered when the judge is of the view that the young person may 
be suffering from problems such as learning disabilities or emo-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4265"> 4265 </A></B>
<P>
tional disorders. It has the capacity to involve families at all 
stages of the process.
<P>
	It is obvious that youth crime requires a multifaceted 
response. Legislative change alone will not solve the problem, 
but it is an important first step to restoring public confidence.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
make a few comments about the remarks by the member for 
Pierrefonds-Dollard. I would also like to make a few 
comments, because I personally have the pleasure of having 
teenagers who say things sometimes that I find a little annoying, 
such as ``You know, Dad, if I'm arrested, no problem. They 
won't do anything to me until I'm 18.''
<P>
	That reflects to a certain extent what young people are saying. 
They say that even if they do things that are wrong, the police 
cannot arrest them in any case or charge them, because they are 
minors. This is one of the aspects, when we talk about 
enforcement, as the member for Pierrefonds-Dollard 
mentioned, that I feel we should consider, in this respect in any 
case, without penalizing young people unduly. We should at 
least inform them of their responsibilities.
<P>
	He also mentioned the fact that young people often behave the 
way they see adults behave. If we misbehave, chances are our 
children will do the same. In my opinion, we should maybe think 
a little about changing the laws as they apply to adults and the 
way in which adults are judged in order to create a better society 
and to ensure that our children can behave as well as possible 
when they have to accept responsibility. We should ensure that 
we adults set a good example.
<P>
	We should also talk about violence on television. We should 
also talk about giving young people hope. As long as young 
people do not have any hope, they will more likely tend to give 
up on life, not really care and not show any respect for society. It 
is in this spirit that, in my opinion, we have to respect these 
young people who, basically, are not really guilty of these 
crimes. This does not mean that we have to let them do as they 
please, but I feel we have to be very open, as the law stipulates. I 
feel that we have to be very open-minded in the way in which we 
judge these young people.
<P>
	I would like the member, since I have the opportunity to ask a 
question, to tell us what he thinks we could do to improve the 
way in which we mete out punishment to young people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patry:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Longueuil for 
his question. As a parent, I too am always being told, even by my 
own family, that parents should never strike their children 
because they could be hauled off to youth court.
<P>
	In answer to your question, I think the problem today is the 
fact that the current legislation is poorly understood. Young 
people often rationalize that if they commit a crime, a minor 
one, it will not be a problem for them because when they turn 18, 
they will not have a criminal record and they can do whatever 
they like.
<P>
	That is the impression young people have. The reality of the 
legislation is, however, quite different. Which is not to say that 
this government is unwilling to make changes to the act. I am 
sure that the changes will be aimed first at broadening people's 
understanding of the legislation as it will be defined in the future 
and second, at ensuring that young offenders face up to the 
reality of what they have done.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am not sure whether the hon. member is trying to defend the 
Young Offenders Act or not judging from his speech.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member a few questions here. 
First, does the hon. member know or could he tell this House 
what the sentence is right now for a young offender, say age 16, 
committing rape or murder? He says that they may consider 
longer sentences. I certainly hope they would do more than just 
consider it.
<P>
<B>(1350 ) </B>
<P>
	The vast majority of youth are very respectful, hard working 
and are trying to get ahead. I wonder if the member realizes that 
the majority of children going to school today and trying to learn 
are going there in fear of the minority creating these problems. I 
would hope they would also take into account and listen to some 
of the youth today about the problem that the minority is 
creating before they make any decisions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patry:</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to the hon. 
member's question. It is not a matter of defending the Young 
Offenders Act as it now stands, but rather of amending it and 
improving it. There are problems in this country today and we 
must deal with them. As was mentioned, gangs of youths are 
terrorizing other young people in primary schools, high schools 
and CEGEPs, and they must be brought into line. The answer, 
however, is not simply to drag them into court and sentence 
them. I am a bigger believer in social reintegration with the help 
of psychologists, doctors and experts. If we do nothing but send 
young offenders to jail, we will end up with hardened criminals 
on our hands.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, for once this House cannot be said to lack consistency; 
it has shown great singleness of purpose. About ten days ago, the 
hon. member for York South-Weston, a government member, 
introduced Bill C-217, a public bill to lower age limits for the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4266"> 4266 </A></B>
<P>
purposes of the Young Offenders Act, to increase maximum  
penalties and allow the publication of the names of young 
offenders.
<P>
	Today, the opposition motion moved by a Reform Party 
member from British Columbia calls upon the House to urge the 
government to respond to the evident-as far as they are 
concerned-lack of confidence over the Young Offenders Act by 
recommending a change to the definition of ``young offender'' 
in Section 2(1) of the said Act to mean a person to be ten years of 
age or more, but sixteen years of age or less.
<P>
	Again, we are falling back on lowering the minimum age. I 
say it is somewhat similar to what Bill C-217 called for because, 
as indicated earlier in this debate, lowering the age to 16 does 
not change the rigour of the act. They said: ``We simply lowered 
the age limits'' but the fact of the matter is that lowering the 
maximum age of young offenders to 16 means that those 
between the ages of 16 and 18 who will be tried by adult courts 
will incur adult sentencing. That is where the change will hurt, 
in terms of sentencing.
<P>
	Why? Why an approach reflecting such intolerance, an 
intolerance that seems to come mainly from English Canada but 
which unfortunately is echoed in this House? As I said earlier, 
by dint of being alarmists, you end up colouring facts. Some 
members have been crying wolf for so long that they are seeing 
its tail. Let us stop telling ourselves horror stories and face facts. 
The sad reality is that delinquency is probably here to stay. We 
will always need legislation to crack down on actions society 
considers as unacceptable but in a civilized state legislation 
must also seek to have a positive effect.
<P>
	In the young offenders' case, we need an act that will not turn 
this young offender into an old one and this, for the rest of his or 
her life because such is the wish of an intolerant society. A 
modern state must search for the causes of this criminal 
behaviour and if possible, try to eradicate them from the young 
offender's heart. Could we not do this in a non-partisan way, 
without shaping the entire act around a senseless murder, 
focusing instead on striking a balance between punishment, in 
the form of the sentence, and rehabilitation, that is to say the 
young delinquent or offender's social reintegration?
<P>
	To do so, we must look at the statistics, which mirror reality 
back to us. We must not settle for the headlines on the front page 
of sensationalistic papers or their legal columns. I believe that 
this feeling of insecurity is magnified by the information widely 
disseminated by the press. Reassuring statistics are seldom 
published. But statistics can be reassuring and indeed they are, 
particularly in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	According to a study by Jean Trépanier, criminology 
professor at the University of Montreal, only one out of six 
offenders is a minor. That is a far cry from the 50 per cent 
suggested by today's debate and the emphasis on amending the 
Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	According to the study, juvenile crime even fell to about 8 per 
cent in Quebec in the last 15 years, and even in Montreal there 
was a substantial decline over the same period. The number of 
young offenders in Montreal went from 10,145 in 1979 to 6,679 
last year. I will be honest with the members of this House and 
say that what is a problem is that the proportion of crimes 
against persons committed by young people, which are more 
visible and get more media coverage, climbed significantly 
during the same period.
<P>
	Despite the higher figures, the number of crimes against 
persons committed by young people is still small in absolute 
terms. That is why I think that the motion presented today by the 
Reform Party is wrong. The perception in Quebec is quite 
different. What do we do differently for young offenders in 
Quebec so that our perception of this problem is apparently 
different from that of the other provinces?
<P>
	In Quebec when a youth commits an offence, his case is 
immediately taken over by social services and not by the judicial 
system. We immediately and completely de-criminalize the 
legal process. It is important to remember this because Quebec 
seems to be the only place in Canada where young offenders are 
looked after by social services from the beginning of the legal 
process to the sentences handed down by the courts.
<P>
	Quebec has a list of offences. When a crime is not on this list, 
it is up to the police to decide whether or not charges should be 
laid. If the offence is listed, law-enforcement authorities must 
refer the case to the judicial system by lodging a complaint 
against the young offender. The youth protection director then 
becomes responsible for the minor. As I told you, if I am not 
mistaken, only Quebec does things this way.
<P>
	In Quebec, and this may surprise some people, the maximum 
sentence is three years plus two years on parole. Having studied 
the problem of young offenders, I can tell you that even in 
Canada the majority of juvenile crime workers recognize that 
Quebec does things differently. And this distinctiveness is felt 
in the way it treats its young offenders.
<P>
	With the Young Offenders Act in effect and the whole system 
serving young offenders in Quebec, things are working out quite 
well. I think that the figures are encouraging. One only has to 
look at the report to be convinced-

masquerade. The Canadian government must stop waffling on 
the Haitian issue. Has Canada obtained all the assurances it 
wanted from the Dominican Republic that that country will 
respect the total embargo and how much longer must we wait for 
Canada to take a clear and unequivocal position? Canada must 
stand ready to intervene, in co-operation with the international

	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
today I join my colleague from the Bloc to pay tribute to nurses 
on this International Nurses Day in National Nursing Week.
<P>
	Since the days of Florence Nightingale the nursing profession 
has improved upon the knowledge base and standards of bedside 
nursing as well as expanding the nursing practices and 
principles into health care areas such as research, education, 
counselling and administration.
<P>
	Nurses are the backbone of health care by participating in 
nearly all aspects of health and providing service seven days a 
week, 24 hours a day. Nurses continue to meet the challenge of 
providing their services with less funding. They extend the extra 
effort needed to help maintain the excellent nursing service 
standards we enjoy.
<P>
	Let us on this occasion not only recognize the invaluable work 
of nurses but also pledge to take the necessary steps to solidify 
financing of health care in Canada.

May 12, 1994, is International Myalgic Encephalomyelitis Day, 
a disease better known as chronic fatigue syndrome. This 
terrible disease generates more and more interest because of the

society. This syndrome is very difficult to define. Indeed, there 
is no definite criteria to diagnose this condition.

	<B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma):</B> Mr. Speaker, all Canadians 
should know that the small business sector in Canada is 
responsible for the creation of well over 80 per cent of all new 
jobs. Clearly the renewal of our economy depends on strong and 
vibrant small businesses.
<P>
	Our government has recognized this fact and is working 
toward a stable climate so small business can grow and thrive. 
We will achieve this by improving the Small Businesses Loans 
Act, working with the banks to make capital more accessible, 
and lowering payroll taxes. Further we will reduce the burden of 
government red tape that chokes small business growth. After 
all government must work in partnership with the business 
community, not pretend to be its master.
<P>
	Small business owners in my riding have often told me they 
are anxious for the day when the onerous bureaucratic load 
imposed on them by government is a thing of the past. For 
example, the government remains committed to the goal of 
replacing the GST with one that is more efficient and fair, easier 
to administer, and much more convenient for small business. 
The government takes its commitments seriously and will fulfil 
its promises.

	Railways make a positive contribution to our country's

<P>
	Recently CN indicated that it wishes to abandon yet another

known to Revenue Canada staff, let alone to taxpayers.
<P>
	Revenue bureaucrats acknowledge that Mr. Arling tried to be

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Public 
Works.
<P>
	As various observers sound the alarm on the disturbing state 
of public finances and the federal deficit, the government 
announced that this year, it will blithely spend $67 million on 
polls to which Canadians will not have access although they pay 
for them through their taxes.
<P>
	Considering the present state of public finances and the 
federal deficit, what justification can the minister give us for the 
fact that his government will squander as much as $67 million 
on polls conducted by friends of the government, since the 
contracts will be awarded at the discretion of the ministers?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the 
Leader of the Official Opposition for his question, but he is 
factually incorrect.
<P>
	The $63 million that he refers to is an expenditure of the 
Government of Canada which will be made for the purposes of 
advertising and polling. It is something that governments, since 
the beginning of Confederation if you will, have spent money on 
in order to inform Canadians of the various programs that they 
have and how Canadians can take advantage of those programs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think the minister would be more factual if he told us 
that the government's real reason for deciding not to reveal 
polling results is that it does not want Canadian taxpayers to 
know it has already started on a massive series of polls in 
Quebec in preparation for the referendum on sovereignty. Will 
the minister admit as much?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed that 
the Leader of the Official Opposition would not find favour with 
the new guidelines that the government has produced.
<P>
	I want to quote for the Leader of the Opposition as well as 
other members of the House: ``I am delighted to note that the 
processes and the review of the principles to provide openness 
and transparency and to avoid concentration of an excessive 
amount of business in one region or to one supplier is good 
news''. That comes  from Claude Boulay, president of the 
Association of Quebec Advertising Agencies.
<P>
<B>(1420 ) </B>
<P>
	I say to the Leader of the Opposition that it is important for 
governments, whether they be provincial or federal, to have the 
benefit of providing information to Canadians across this 
country on the variety of programs and the various things they 
are doing on behalf of their constituents.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the problem is that things are not what they seem. The 
government claims that its policy is to inform Canadians. In 
fact, it made a commitment during the election campaign to 
promote transparency in government, but now this policy, which 
is apparently so transparent, will let the government keep the 
facts and information under wraps.
<P>
	Specifically, I want to ask the minister how he can reconcile 
with previous commitments the government's decision to hide 
from the taxpayers the results of countless polls that will be 
conducted to fight Quebec's sovereignty.
<P>

	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and

examination of the guidelines that the previous administration 
had and I want members to know that is the extent of the 
guidelines-

Opposition that this is the first time that a cabinet, federally or 
provincially across this country, has dared to put in place 
guidelines procedures which address the fundamental issues of 
accountability, competitiveness, openness and transparency.

he stand in his place and say he wished to apologize, that he 
wished he could have done it when he was a member of the

less, the government insists on turning down requests for a much 
needed examination of all public spending.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Minister of Finance. 
Considering that Canada's debt represents 84 per cent of GDP, 
while in other G-7 countries, with the exception of Italy, the 
debt represents less than 33 per cent of GDP, would the minister 
agree that the government should clean up public spending by 
eliminating waste and duplication?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, we certainly agree that 
waste and duplication should be eliminated. In fact, that is one 
of the reasons why we asked the minister responsible for public 
service renewal to initiate a program by program, line-by-line 
analysis of government spending.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
would the Minister of Finance agree that the way to stop wasting 
public funds-and I am thinking of the government's decision to 
spend $67 million on polls-would be to have a special 
committee analyse public spending item by item, as we have 
been asking since the beginning of the election campaign?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, a system already exists, 
and I am referring to the committees of the House when they 
consider the Estimates. If the hon. member were sincere about 
what he is asking, he would ask his colleagues to go to 
committee meetings and, as part of the process of considering 
the Estimates, analyse the budgets of all government agencies.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Committee by committee there is a way of looking at 
government expenses. It is called the estimates and what I would 
suggest to the hon. member opposite is that if his colleagues 
would go to committee and do their job maybe they can examine 
these expenses.

minister told my colleague for Calgary Southwest categorically: 
``In the legislation that will be before the House dealing with 
aboriginal people he will see clearly that the Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms will apply''.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	Yesterday, however, the Minister of Justice said that 
application of the charter within self-government remains an 
open question.
<P>

minister guarantee this House that the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms will apply under self-government for aboriginal 
people, yes or no?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me make it plain that the 
federal government believes that the Canadian Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms should apply to all Canadians, including 
aboriginal Canadians, under self-government arrangements.
<P>
	I emphasize that this government remains committed to 
ensuring that the individual rights and freedoms of all 
Canadians will continue to be protected even under new 
aboriginal self-government arrangements.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
supplemental is for the same minister.
<P>
	Yesterday the Minister of Justice said that the question of 
human rights is a priority for federal negotiators. There is a big 
difference between a guarantee and a priority.
<P>
	Does the minister consider the charter rights of aboriginal 
people to be a bargaining chip in the process of self-government 
negotiation or will he offer an ironclad guarantee that the 
government will not enter into any arrangement that does not 
ensure full and complete charter rights for all Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I cannot add to what I have 
said. I think it was very clear that this government remains 
committed to the proposition that the charter applies to all 
Canadians.
<P>
	As we embark upon the negotiations for the implementation 
of the inherent right of self-government our intention, our 
resolve, will be to assure and guarantee that human rights are 
available to all Canadians including aboriginal persons in any 
self-government arrangement.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have been 
assured over and over again of that fact and yet we seem to be 
getting a mixed signal from this government. My final question 
is for the minister of Indian affairs.
<P>
	Yesterday the minister admitted he does not fully understand 
self-government, he does not know where it is going and that 
many aboriginal people including chiefs do not approve it. In 
spite of this minister has said that once the machinery of 
self-government gets rolling there will not be any way for 
anyone to stop it.

us whether it is a new provision of his code of ethics that led his 
Minister of Public Works himself to send a draft letter in which 
BioVac should express its satisfaction to him with regard to his

vaccines, and does the Solicitor General support such a 
procedure?
<P>

in terms of what the Government of Canada did on a particular 
contract which provided a vaccine primarily for the purposes of 
provincial governments across this country.
<P>

bring it to the attention of the House. If that is the case, we will 
examine it. I have no information before me to suggest that.
<P>
	The member knows that the contract that was let was fair, 
equitable for the participants and all the stakeholders. Yes, I can

<P>
	Many Canadians will remember that the Liberals protested 
when the Tory government kept poll results secret and many 
Canadians will remember the Liberal election promise of open 
government. Unfortunately the government does not seem to 
remember any of these things.
<P>

specific criteria other ministers must follow when contracting 
polls in secret? What specific criteria will determine whether 
poll results are to be kept secret or is that information secret as 
well?
<P>

whether the results of the polls would be kept secret. According

that the guidelines say very clearly that the bulk of polling 
information will be made available to the public. The hon.

Supreme Court of Canada has ruled repeatedly that there are

the public interest, to protect Canada's interests.

people, that it could never, ever offend the best interests of the 
public, he is living in a fairy tale world.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	The Ontario Legislature yesterday passed, almost 
unanimously, a resolution calling on the federal government to 
negotiate with the provinces concerning its reform of social 
programs. In addition, the Premier of Ontario, who is concerned 
about the budgetary impact of reform on his province, said that 
many of the programs targeted by the federal initiative come, for 
the most part, under exclusive or shared provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	In view of the major objections raised by Quebec and now 
Ontario concerning the centralizing objectives of the 
government's reform proposals, when will the Minister of 
Human Resources Development finally sit down with the 
provinces and negotiate directly with them? When will the 
meeting slated for April 18 finally take place?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member knows, the 
commitment to full discussion and consultation with the 
provinces was our idea, not that of the provinces.
<P>
	When we first announced this initiative in January we said 
that we wanted to do it in full partnership with provincial 
jurisdictions as well as with a wide range of Canadians and all 
the stakeholders and interest groups. I am certainly pleased that 
the Ontario legislature endorsed the principle of sitting down to 
have a fair and open discussion.
<P>
	As an example of that, about two weeks ago I met with the 
Ontario ministers of education and community services to have 
a close, direct discussion concerning the very important 
initiatives we want to take.
<P>
	I am very pleased that the Government of Ontario, along with 
all other provincial governments, are prepared to co-operate 
with us in undertaking a major forum. I just wish the Bloc 
Quebecois would be as co-operative.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> The question asked was: 
When will the meeting slated for April 18 be held with all of the 
provinces to initiate a process?
<P>
	Can the Minister, under these circumstances, and because the 
meeting did not take place and a new date has not been 
announced, confirm that his action plan, originally slated to be 
ready at the end of April, will be tabled before Parliament 
recesses as scheduled on June 14?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is very important to ensure 
that before there is a full meeting of all the ministers involved 
that we are able to agree on agendas and work on a number of the 
initiatives.

<P>
	As a consequence I have asked the deputy minister of my 
department to be in touch with his counterparts across the 
country and to sit down and arrange those agendas. That meeting 
will be taking place at the end of the month, I believe the date is 
May 30, at which time all the deputy ministers of all the 
provinces will come together so that we can work out the kind of 
agenda and program that will be required for federal-provincial 
discussions and consultations.

for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Since the federal budget in February things have changed. 
Real and nominal short and long term interest rates have risen. 
This and next year's growth projections are down. 
Unemployment has remained dismally high and, in short, every 
economic indicator has turned rather sour.
<P>
<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
	Yesterday we learned the true reason for this. According to a 
recently released study, Canada places below Poland, Ethiopia, 
Brazil, New Zealand, and even war-torn Rwanda-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Would the hon. member please put his 
question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> My question is for the Minister 
of Finance. Now that we have classed ourselves among the third 
world nations of indebtedness, will the finance minister admit 
that the debt problem of Canada is the number one economic 
problem we face.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member seems to have a set of 
statistics which may well have been written by Lewis Carroll but 
they certainly have very little relationship to reality.
<P>
	In the last three months we have created 115,000 jobs, the 
help wanted index is up by 2 per cent in both April and March, an 
increase of .7 per cent in the leading indicator, consumer and 
business confidence is up more than 13 per cent in the first 
quarter, housing starts are up 5.9 per cent in April, retail sales 
are up .9 per cent.
<P>
	The International Monetary Fund has said that next year in 
terms of employment, productivity, growth and confidence 
Canada is going to be either first or second of all the G-7 nations 
and I will take the IMF.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I thought for a minute there we were going to 
get into quotations again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister of 
Finance certainly can be optimistic but Canadians are very 
concerned about the deficit and the debt and I am sure the 
minister is as well.
<P>
	The minister has acknowledged that the number one item at 
the finance ministers' meeting in June is to be a national 
strategy on deficit reduction. Is the minister willing to do that 
with the intention of emerging from that meeting to set national 
targets for deficit reduction?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I indicated in the House-I believe 
to a question from the same member last week-I am certainly 
prepared to suggest to my provincial counterparts that the 
deficit and debt reduction be an important item for discussion at 
the forthcoming finance ministers' conference.
<P>
	However, I would like to remind the hon. member opposite 
that when we made the deficit projections for the year just ended 
we set out a target of $44 to $46 billion, a very unfortunate and 
very high target. That was based on a continuation in January, 
February and March of the unfortunate figures that the nation 
suffered in terms of employment and growth in the months of 
October, November and December of the previous year.
<P>
	I am delighted to say that as a result of the very large scale job 
growth which is much higher than we projected that the deficit 
will come at the lower end of that scale. In fact it may well come 
in lower.
<P>
	What that demonstrates is that while cutting government 
spending is certainly a very important objective of the 
government and is an essential part of deficit reduction, what it 
also demonstrates is that getting Canadians back to work is the 
most important thing we can do.

	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister

	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board

the short answer is no.
<P>
	If the member is referring to the fact that additional coverage 
is provided for members of our health plan, it is provided for all 
employees in the public service. There is an extra $10 charge for 
people who want supplementary service, the same as is done in 
the private sector. Therefore we do not believe in that two tier 
system the member is talking about.

<P>
	To answer the question: Should they go to court? That is an 
option. If the aboriginal people do not feel we are addressing 
their concerns in a prompt and efficient manner, then perhaps 
the courts might be the option but they are not mutually

	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney

considering an appeal of the judgment of the Federal Court of 
Appeal in the Thibaudeau case primarily for practical reasons.
<P>
	The government wishes to make it clear and emphasize that 
we do not repudiate the result in the case in the sense that tax 
equity particularly for single parents and those providing for 
children is among our principal priorities. As we made clear in 
the budget documents and as we have made clear in the policies 
of this party, the government is committed to ensuring we have 
tax policies which get the maximum amount of dollars into the 
hands of parents who are looking after children, which is our 
ultimate concern.
<P>
	The judgment last week came at a time when the policy is 
being developed. We are concerned that the situation at the 
moment in Canada has been destabilized by this judgment in a 
sense that those who are paying support and those who are 
receiving it are not certain of  their rights. The judgment was 
unbalanced in the sense that the result dealt with those who 
received the money but not those who deduct the payments. We 
have those practical concerns.
<P>
	Let me say in closing that we are dedicated to a tax policy and 
a fiscal approach that will properly provide for children and for 
single parents who look after them. At the same time we are 
considering an appeal so that indirectly this judgment does not 
redound to their detriment by causing confusion about their 
rights.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, as is the 
custom, at this point I would like to ask the hon. Leader of the 
Government in the House to tell us what is on the agenda, not for 
the next few days but, rather, for the weeks to come.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have to confirm that the House will not sit tomorrow 
and will not sit next week. In fact it will resume on May 24. The 
work that hon. members do-and I am sure they have work to 
do-will have to be done outside the Chamber during that 
period.
<P>
	On May 24 and May 25 the House will begin work on Bill 
C-28 regarding student loans followed by Bill C-27, the income 
tax technical legislation. If there is time we will also call Bill 
C-26, to amend the National Library Act.
<P>
	Pursuant to special order on May 26 the House will consider 
report stage of Bill C-17, the budget implementation 
legislation.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
	After the House leaders meet again the week we are back, we 
will have further information for them and for the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> I rise on a point of order, Madam Speaker. I 
think you will find unanimous consent for the following motion:
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the 21st report of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs tabled in the House today be concurred in.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Does the hon. 
parliamentary secretary have unanimous consent of the House to 
move the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4280"> 4280 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Madam 
Speaker, before carrying on, could you tell me how much time I 
have left?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Thirteen minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Madam Speaker, before Question Period, 
I was explaining the Boscoville report to the  House. For those of 
you who are not familiar with it, Boscoville is an institution for 
young offenders in Montreal. You probably knew that, Madam 
Speaker.
<P>
	From 1968 to 1983, a very serious study was conducted with 
25 young people who had committed homicides. It was found 
out that those 25 young people, thanks to the treatment and help 
they received in Boscoville, were rehabilitated once they left 
that institution and did not commit other offences. Moreover, 
the study shows that these results were obtained over a period of 
about three years.
<P>
	So, it took three years for young offenders treated in 
Boscoville to be turned into responsible persons.
<P>
	In Boscoville, a great deal of emphasis is put on rehabilitation 
and reintegration. I used that institution as an example because I 
have here with me this very serious study which was used by 
several committees. Statistics and details are available. There is 
a definite trend in the rehabilitation process of young offenders 
in Quebec. This study is an extremely important document. I 
could have chosen another institution, since there are several 
similar ones in Quebec.
<P>
	This rehabilitation effort is a team effort involving educators, 
as well as the family, which plays an extremely important role 
when a young person has committed a crime such as an 
homicide, but also young offenders themselves, because a lot of 
work is done by these young people in the course of the 
treatment.
<P>
	The objective is to rehabilitate the young person, who must 
recognize that he has changed by accepting those whom he will 
meet following his stay in the institution.
<P>
	Rehabilitation means first and foremost the explicit 
recognition of a profound moral transformation which makes 
the young offender feel that he has regained his dignity as a 
person. It also means that he must reassert himself on a social 
level, so as to deserve to be accepted everywhere, without any 
reservation, as an honest and responsible citizen.
<P>
	Can that objective be reached by lowering the legal age of 
young offenders?
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	To ask the question is to answer it. I can understand that the 
perception of juvenile delinquents in English Canada is 
different, since they do not have the whole protection system 
that we have set up in Quebec in recent years.
<P>
	In some provinces, we can even say that young people are 
practically treated as adults once they are found guilty of an 
offence, except that there is one wing for young people and 
another for adults. Nevertheless, the fact remains that the young 
offender spends time in prison, which is a school for crime.
<P>
	It is to be expected that people in western Canada see things 
differently than we do. The whole approach to young offenders 
is completely different. Only in Ontario have they really begun 
in the past few years to acquire facilities similar to those that 
exist in Quebec for looking after juvenile delinquents. But even 
so, Ontario's experience is fairly recent; they still do not have 
the full program and do not have complete results from setting 
up such a system.
<P>
	You must understand that stiffer penalties such as those called 
for in this motion or lowering the age limit for the Young 
Offenders Act is not a solution to the problems facing society 
today. Instead, we must take a very clear political option, 
namely giving the whole legal system facilities for treating 
juvenile delinquents. That is what we must realize and that is the 
way to go.
<P>
	I have already said that Private Member's Bill C-217 is 
simplistic. Of course, it is much easier for society to try to crush 
or wipe out the rebelliousness of a young offender by 
imprisoning him, isolating him and putting him out of 
circulation for a period of time. That definitely solves the 
problem while he is in prison, but what happens to the young 
person after? What does he become?
<P>
	I think that we must instead really look at the young person's 
problem. We must know why that individual committed the 
crime of which he is accused and how he can really be helped to 
return to society.
<P>
	I think that most citizens of Quebec and of Canada are 
prepared to listen to those who have spent their career, their life, 
in this cause, those who have received training in this area, who 
have met with offenders every day and try to help them. We must 
listen to them, but we must also ask ourselves the right 
questions. We, as legislators, have the obligation to ask the real 
questions. Such as, what can I do with them? Not for them, but 
what can I do with them, with the young offenders? Why has this 
offender committed these crimes? What can I do to ensure that at 
some point he or she will be able to re-enter society as an honest 
citizen who does not require constant supervision?
<P>
	The motion that we have before us invites the Government to 
lower the age for considering a young person a young offender 
under the Act from 18 years less a day to 16 years less a day.
<P>
	I do not know whether the proponents of this amendment are 
aware that nearly 80 per cent of the clientele who are currently 
treated and monitored in the reception centres under the 
authority of the Quebec director of youth protection are 
precisely 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4281"> 4281 </A></B>
<P>
between the  ages of 16 and 18. These figures are surely not 
different in the other provinces of Canada.
<P>
	What is dangerous to Quebec, and that is why I am fiercely 
opposed to any amendment of this nature, is that such 
amendments directly affect the philosophy and the entire system 
of rehabilitation that we have developed in Quebec.
<P>
	By lowering the age to 16 years less a day, the desire no doubt 
is to ensure that young people are automatically referred to adult 
courts. But such referral already exists in the present Act. If the 
Crown prosecutor believes that the young person should be 
brought before the adult courts, he can do so when the person is 
between the ages of 16 and 18, and this is not done. The system 
hardly ever does it. According to the statistics, only 5 per cent of 
referrals are made to adult courts. This means that we must not 
attack the consequences of a disastrous social phenomenon, but 
rather attack the cause, the root of criminality. That is what is 
important and that, I believe, is what the motion has completely 
ignored.
<P>
	The causes must be attacked, as I just said. But perhaps we 
may wonder what are the causes, because today I rarely heard 
reference to the causes of criminality.
<P>
	There was a discussion panel that examined this question, and 
I will list some of them for you. Crime is caused, among other 
things, by the weakening of the social fabric, unemployment, 
poverty, the disintegration of the family, social isolation and the 
loss of community spirit, the lack of a collective sense of 
responsibility, violence in the media and on television, drug and 
alcohol use, the slowness of the judicial system and uncertain 
sentences.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	Those are all the true causes of crime, and that is what we are 
trying to forget with the kind of motion we have before us this 
morning.
<P>
	I said a few moments ago that I was opposed to changes of the 
kind being proposed in the motion. I am opposed as a member of 
the Bloc Quebecois. However, it goes farther than that, because 
the Quebec National Assembly took a stand on this issue on May 
4 and 5 in a debate that was non-partisan and sincere. During the 
debate, the government and the opposition parties tried to 
determine what should be changed in the Young Offenders Act 
and what should remain the same.
<P>
	In this non-partisan debate, the members unanimously passed 
a motion, which reads as follows: ``This motion is to the effect 
that this Assembly insists that any amendments to the federal 
Young Offenders Act comply with the laws and policies of 
Quebec with respect to youth protection''. Through this short 
but explicit motion, Quebec has made its position very clear. 
From now on, no one in this House can claim to be unaware of 
Quebec's position in this regard.
<P>
	In conclusion, I will summarize the Bloc's position with 
respect to this motion in these terms. I have ten points that I will 
make very quickly.
<P>
	First, we are against the motion presented by the Reform 
Party, because the motion is basically repressive. With it, we 
forget the ultimate objective of the criminal justice system, 
which is the rehabilitation of the offender. Second, crime 
statistics do not justify the lowering of the age from 12 to 10. 
Third, the motion does nothing to deal with the problem of youth 
crime. Fourth, the increase in criminal offences by young people 
is largely due to acts of minor assault against peers. Fifth, in 
1992, according to the latest figures, the crime rate rose less 
than in previous years, which may indicate that the changes 
suggested in the motion would be unnecessary.
<P>
	Sixth, an increase in crime statistics and media interest in 
crimes committed by young people have amplified the problem 
of juvenile crime. Seventh, a general increase in the number of 
violent crimes, largely due to minor assault. Eighth, many 
intervenors maintain that the problems concerning the referral 
of young people to adult court are caused by the attitudes of the 
various parties, not by the legislation. Ninth, the motion 
overlooks the whole issue of rehabilitation and social 
reintegration, and tenth and last, according to the information 
we have so far, there is no indication that more severe 
sentencing and lowering the age under the act have any deferrent 
effect whatsoever.
<P>
	For all these reasons, Madam Speaker, as you may have 
guessed, I am against the motion and any bill that would 
ultimately undermine the entire rehabilitation and social 
integration system we set up in Quebec years ago for the benefit 
of young offenders.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the dissertation just given deals quite succinctly with 
many of the areas in dealing with some of the problems of young 
offenders.
<P>
	I am wondering whether the hon. member would consider that 
perhaps a reduction of the age from 18 to 16 would be reasonable 
so long as the young offender who is of the age of 16 or 17 could 
still apply to the courts to be placed in young offenders court, 
thus eliminating the repeat offender from being able to be in 
young offenders court but allowing the young person who 
seldom gets into trouble to remain in young offenders court.
<P>
	If I am not clear on that, perhaps I can put it a different way. At 
present the crown must apply to elevate young offenders into 
adult court. Would perhaps the reversal of that onus be more 
appropriate by having the young offender apply to be placed in 
young offenders court?
<P>
<B></B>

<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Madam Speaker, as I said earlier, 
according to the statistics I analysed, more than 80 per cent of 
young people in youth court are between the ages of 16 and 18. 
The reversal of the onus, which make it incumbent on the young 
offender to apply to be tried under the Young Offenders Act 
instead of in adult court, would have two implications. First, the 
considerable number of applications will increase the burden of 
the courts. All, or at least 80 per cent of young offenders will ask 
to be tried under the Young Offenders Act, which will put an 
additional burden on the courts.
<P>
	Second, at the present time a young offender may be referred 
to adult court, but only 5 per cent of such cases are actually 
referred. So this would create an additional burden and more 
work all around for nothing, since we know that 95 per cent of 
the applications by these 80 per cent will be approved by the 
judges who make the final decision on the basis of the 
jurisprudence, their own experience and the merits of the case 
and the available evidence, and decide not to transfer these 
young offenders to adult court.
<P>
	I think that putting the onus on young offenders between the 
ages of 16 to 18 to apply for a referral to youth court instead of 
the reverse, which is the case now, is not the answer. I do not 
think that is a good way to deal with the problem.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Georgette Sheridan (Saskatoon-Humboldt):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I would like to begin by making the following 
comment. I am concerned that my hon. friend is operating under 
certain false premises in terms of his feeling that the motion put 
forward by the Reform Party is speaking for all westerners.
<P>
	As a westerner I would like to tell the House and my colleague 
that the policies that underlie the motion we have heard from the 
Reform Party which seem to favour punishment over any kind of 
analysis of the problems facing our young offenders are 
certainly not the policies or the approach favoured by western 
Canadians and certainly not by me or my other western 
colleagues in the government.
<P>
	I would like to invite him to visit us in the west and I 
personally will tour him to meet various people who will show 
him another side of western viewpoints on this issue.
<P>
	Second, I can understand why my hon. friend would come 
away with this notion, assuming he sees the Reform Party as 
speaking for some westerners, given the nature of the motion put 
forward which are debating today. I say that because this motion 
offers simplistic solutions to complex problems. It reflects the 
Reform Party's obsession with cuts and saving a penny no 
matter what the cost. It also reflects a rather slogan approach to 
solving very complex difficulties that face us as a society.
<P>
	I come from the west and I also have a Scottish background. 
No one could be more concerned with saving a few pennies than 
my ancestors from Scotland. Therefore, I would like to say to 
this House and my friends in the Reform Party that I would put 
to them three slogans for their consideration of this very serious 
problem. One is that we consider the old comment about being 
penny wise and pound foolish.
<P>
	I would also ask them to consider another slogan dealing with 
money, pay me now or pay me later. The third slogan is haste 
makes waste. I feel quite qualified to speak on all three of those 
and to expand on why I mention those.
<P>
	On penny wise and pound foolish, certainly we may throw a 
few young offenders into prison today and maybe that will make 
us feel that we are saving money in some ways because we do 
not have to bother rehabilitating them, but we will ultimately 
pay the price because, as my learned friend points out, they go to 
the university of crime in prison and they learn very well. If 
there is no money to help with their difficulties we end up with 
more serious criminals.
<P>
	Pay me now or pay me later is on the same theme. I will not 
bother repeating myself.
<P>
	Finally, on haste makes waste, we are dealing here with young 
offenders who have a multitude of problems. As my friend from 
Quebec has pointed out it is not a simple matter of saying this 
person wanted to steal a car, lock him up. To proceed in an 
analysis of this issue in a hasty manner, possibly a knee-jerk 
response to such things as the tragedy in Britain which was 
brought up earlier today will only make us pay a much higher 
price down the road.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	I congratulate my friend from Quebec for his thoughtful 
analysis of the root problems. I agree with him that careful study 
is warranted. I congratulate the Minister of Justice on taking this 
kind of approach to the young offenders. I urge the minister and 
this government and all thoughtful members of this House to 
proceed on a slow and steady course to analyse the root 
problems, to balance the dual concerns of protection of society 
and dealing with the problems facing our young people.
<P>
	I would conclude by saying I am pleased to have my friend 
from Quebec on the justice committee with me and I look 
forward to working with him to provide solutions to all of these 
very complex problems.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am extremely pleased to 
speak after such laudatory comments from a government 
member. We do not hear that every day, and I will take it with 
pleasure today. I am also pleased to know that there are people in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4283"> 4283 </A></B>
<P>
Western Canada who think differently from the Reform Party. I 
congratulate the member for rising to say so.
<P>
	Currently, what is heard in this House is amplified by all the 
media attention surrounding the issue that we see in the 
newspapers and the whole issue of young offenders. I see that in 
Western Canada there may be people who think somewhat as we 
do in Quebec. I therefore invite the Minister of Justice to pay 
attention when he wishes to amend the Young Offenders Act. It 
seems there is a position in Quebec that may in some respects be 
reflected in Western Canada.
<P>
	The Young Offenders Act can be amended if there is felt to be 
a need to do so. As for me, in Quebec, we do not see the need to 
amend the Young Offenders Act, but the need the apply it fairly 
and provide the resources for it to be applied throughout 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Madam Speaker, I found it 
interesting when the hon. member for Berthier-Montcalm 
spoke about the Boscoville Institute. I would like him to say a 
little more about this institute which plays an important role in 
Quebec. It could serve as an example for the rest of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Madam Speaker, I had planned on talking 
about it in my speech but as I was interrupted, I skipped a few 
passages dealing with the Boscoville Institute. What is 
interesting about this institute is that individuals are assessed as 
soon as they arrive. A case study was done to draw a profile of 
young offenders.
<P>
	I think it is important for Reform members and those who 
support lowering the age limit to know what the 25 young 
offenders treated at the institute were like. There were very few 
repeat offenders; it was usually their first time in court.
<P>
	Second, the offence seems to be the result of a set of 
circumstances rather than of a life focused on crime. Most 
young offenders come from a very deprived environment at 
every level. Again, bells rang when I heard some members deny 
that most young offenders come from poor families. The 
statistics say otherwise. Let us look at the statistics and we will 
see what the situation is. Of course, there will always be black 
sheep but the vast majority come from underprivileged 
backgrounds.
<P>
	Third, the motivation to go to an institute such as Boscoville 
is very high. People know one another. Young offenders think it 
is to their advantage to be treated under the Young Offenders Act 
when they can be re-integrated. It is extremely important to 
them, which may explain why in the end there are almost no 
repeat offenders.
<P>
	There are roughly two treatment phases at Boscoville. I think 
I will eventually have the opportunity to discuss it in greater 
detail. I see that my time is running out. I will eventually have 
the time to describe the two phases. I think I will submit this 
document to the Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs 
because it is extremely important.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	If the federal government wants to intervene, if it has money 
to invest in young offenders, it should perhaps consult with the 
provinces in order to invest in the right places, like the 
Boscoville Institute, where it is extremely important to 
emphasize self-respect and make young people acknowledge 
their actions.
<P>
	After the second phase-the process is actually much 
longer-, they acknowledge their actions and learn to live with 
the consequences. In the end, however, they can re-integrate 
society as better and anonymous citizens who pay taxes and 
support the system.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Madam Speaker, allow me to congratulate 
the hon. member on his speech.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
If I may say so respectfully, it was a very helpful analysis of the 
issues we face in respect of this legislation and in the debate 
today.
<P>
	As we discuss this resolution, Canadians have made it clear 
that community safety and crime issues are high on their agenda. 
Concerns about youth crime particularly in light of the tragic 
events in recent months have made this subject one of particular 
importance for the House of Commons.
<P>
	I know that members of all parties would want me to observe 
at the outset that when we speak of youth crime and young 
offenders, we speak about a small segment of young people in 
Canada today. By far the vast majority of young Canadians are 
dedicated toward improving themselves and leading productive 
lives as citizens of this country.
<P>
	Nonetheless, members of the public have expressed growing 
concern about how the Young Offenders Act works and how it 
deals with youth who do commit crimes. I believe in the act; I 
believe in its fundamental principles and the model of juvenile 
justice it creates for Canada. And while I believe in the focus on 
both public protection and youth rehabilitation, I recognize and 
this government recognizes there is a need for changes in the act 
now.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As I said, I will be introducing a bill to amend the act in this 
House in June. This bill will reflect the commitments made 
during the election campaign to improve the act's provisions as 
they pertain to youth crimes, particularly violent crimes of a 
serious nature.
<P>
	Let me just say, however, that amending the legislation is not 
in itself a solution to youth crime in Canada. To say so would be 
to mislead Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4284"> 4284 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It must be clear that progress in dealing with youth crime 
means not only initiating more effective criminal justice 
responses but it also means crime prevention in a broad and 
constructive sense. It means addressing the causes of crime as 
well as an acceptance of the need to address the culture of 
violence in which our children and youth are growing up in 
Canada today.
<P>
	In my capacity as Minister of Justice I co-ordinate on the 
Prime Minister's behalf the efforts of nine ministries of 
government which are addressed to the question of violence in 
Canadian society. It is a broad effort which includes ministries 
as disparate as: Heritage Canada, with responsibility for 
broadcasting and which deals with violence on television and in 
movies; the Ministry of Health, which deals with programs for 
young people, programs for pregnant women, and government 
undertakings to ensure the provision of social services in the 
health context to deal with some conditions that breed crime in 
this country; and the Ministry of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, because the criminal justice system fails so 
profoundly in dealing with the needs of the aboriginal peoples.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	These efforts are made in recognition of the fact that we must 
not only make the Young Offenders Act more effective, we must 
also adopt a wide ranging approach to the entire question of 
crime and youth crime in particular.
<P>
	I am fond of speaking of the root causes of crime. I respond to 
questions in the House about crime in that way and I stress a two 
track approach to the challenge of crime in Canadian society: 
Amend statutes like the Young Offenders Act and the Criminal 
Code to ensure they send a stern message that there is to be 
accountability, that there is punishment and it will be certain and 
effective. At the same time acknowledge and communicate that 
the criminal justice system by itself is not going to be able to 
overcome this problem in our society.
<P>
	If the answer to crime was simply harsher laws, longer 
penalties and bigger prisons then the United States of America 
would be nirvana today. Surely that is an abject lesson for us all 
that that approach alone will not and does not succeed. Surely it 
is plain that the causes of crime must be addressed.
<P>
	When I am asked about the causes of crime, I surprise no one 
when I refer to dysfunctional families, to the abuse of children, 
to the fact that some children do not have a hot meal once a 
week, to the fact that schools and their curricula have become 
irrelevant for many children. Young people in large numbers 
feel they do not have a stake in our economic system and have no 
future to look forward to. They lose an interest in preserving and 
enhancing the status quo because for them it is something in 
which they have no part.
<P>
	Therefore I say that the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, the Minister of Finance and the Minister of 
Industry have as much to do with crime prevention as the 
Minister of Justice. We are only ever going to be able to have 
long term and effective results if we create a society in which we 
minimize the conditions which breed crimes.
<P>
	Almost 30 years ago Lyndon Johnson became President of the 
United States of America. I was reminded recently by someone 
who made reference to a study done I believe it was by the 
Eisenhower Foundation, in respect of the great society. This was 
the program of legislation President Johnson introduced in 1964 
or 1965 by which the Government of the United States of 
America undertook a broad initiative in terms of education for 
young people, strengthening of the health care system, headstart 
programs for the disadvantaged, the kind of integrated 
comprehensive approach of which I speak today.
<P>
	The study done some 25 years after the programs of the great 
society were introduced demonstrated the effect of those 
initiatives and the positive consequence of putting the emphasis 
on that aspect of government as well as criminal justice.
<P>
	Those studies showed that for the beneficiaries of the great 
society, for those kids who were brought up with the advantage 
of those programs, the contrast between their lives and the lives 
of those without those programs was very stark. There was a 
higher degree of employment, a lower crime rate, a greater 
degree of stability among families, a greater degree of health. 
These are demonstrable consequences of enlightened 
approaches which recognize the linkages between social 
programs effectively designed and administered in the criminal 
justice system.
<P>
	In developing our responses to young offenders we must also 
keep youth crime in perspective. Let us bear in mind it is adults 
in this country who continue to commit the majority of crime. 
Seventy-nine per cent of crime is committed by adults. Adults 
commit 86 per cent of all violent crime in this country.
<P>
	While there is no doubt that some youth crimes of violence are 
on the increase, the increase in youth violent offences is for less 
serious offences. The number of youths charged with homicide 
and attempted murder for example has remained relatively 
stable over the years.
<P>
	The vast majority of crimes committed by youth are property 
crimes. Sixty per cent were property crimes in 1992. More than 
half of those crimes were for theft and most of those involved 
property with a value of less than $1,000. Only 14 per cent of 
young people charged in 1992 were charged with crimes of 
violence, including homicides. That is an increase of only 6 per 
cent since 1986.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4285"> 4285 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	Let us not lose sight of those facts when we propose changes 
to the law. But we do propose changes and let me speak to those 
now.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As far as amending the legislation is concerned, we are 
considering the possibility of increasing the maximum 
sentences handed down by a youth court for the crime of murder. 
Judges would also be allowed to hand down longer sentences if 
they felt such action was necessary to ensure reintegration and 
to better protect the public. Maximum sentences would include 
periods of reintegration into the community to ensure that 
youths receive some supervision and support when they return 
to the community. This is a determining factor both for the 
young person and for the safety of the public.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We also believe that the adult system may be more 
appropriate for dealing with some 16 and 17-year olds who 
commit violent offences causing the most serious personal 
harm. In addition, public safety concerns may require that the 
act be clarified to allow for information to be shared with 
professionals such as police and schools and with select 
members of the public when violent offenders are involved.
<P>
	We are looking as well at longer retention of records in the 
cases of young people convicted of personal injury offences. 
Furthermore we acknowledge that crime victims often feel that 
the justice system fails them. One response to that concern 
would be to allow victim impact statements to be considered by 
the court in sentencing a youth, similar to the adult system.
<P>
	May I observe that too many of Canada's young people, 
disproportionately aboriginal and minority youths, are ending 
up in custody. Currently one-third of youth cases with guilty 
decisions result in custodial sentences and nearly half of those 
sentences involve property offences.
<P>
	When we put lower risk youths in custody, we use up 
expensive and limited resources that are better directed at youth 
posing a danger to the public. It may also increase the likelihood 
that those persons will reoffend upon their release. Where 
appropriate, such youths should be held accountable to 
communities and to victims through community based 
sanctions, away from the influence of more antisocial offenders.
<P>
	I should emphasize that in designing the changes that I will 
introduce in the House in the coming weeks, I have attempted to 
take into account the views of the provinces and the territories. 
The provinces and territories administer the statute. The federal 
government shares the cost, but it is primarily their obligation to 
administer it.
<P>
	At the same time as we introduce the changes to which I have 
referred, I have also made it clear that the government proposes 
to initiate a broad public review of the Young Offenders Act in 
this its 10th year since proclamation. The review which will 
involve Parliament will be comprehensive in scope. Speaking to 
the resolution which is before the House today, may I say it is the 
view of the government that the age at which the application of 
the statute should begin is a matter which should be considered 
by the justice committee when it undertakes its broad and 
comprehensive review.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I hope that with this in-depth review, we will succeed in 
achieving a much broader consensus on the most effective way 
of resolving the numerous, difficult problems associated with 
youth crime.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to say a few words about the 
importance of crime prevention, particulary as it concerns 
young people.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I emphasize, as I have already, that we approach our task from 
a broad based perspective acknowledging that our traditional 
response to crime by itself is inadequate. We are committed to a 
comprehensive and an integrated approach that looks to 
reducing opportunities for crime, improving enforcement 
efforts and addressing social factors.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	I call upon all members of the House to work with the 
government to improve the Young Offenders Act so that we can 
ensure that our youth, the nation's greatest resource, grow up as 
law-abiding and fully participating members of Canadian 
society. That is a challenge for all of us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> Madam Speaker, I think 
the minister knows that I and all the rest of us on this side of the 
House are very respectful of his approach to many of these 
issues and I wish to phrase a question in that spirit.
<P>
	It has been said there are lies, damn lies, and statistics. When I 
use statistics I recognize that as being a problem. The statistics 
that I have which seem to be somewhat reflective of what the 
minister has used, although giving a different impression, are 
that in 1992 youth accounted for 13.7 per cent of all persons 
charged with violent crimes, up from 10.5 per cent in 1986. That 
represents a 30 per cent increase in that very short period of 
time.
<P>
	Of the 135,348 youth charged in Criminal Code incidents in 
1992, 15 per cent were charged with violent crimes and that 
figure was up from 10.5 per cent also in 1986 which represents a 
50 per cent increase.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4286"> 4286 </A></B>
<P>
	Even more shocking is that although there have been 
increases in terms of the percentage of violent crime charges by 
adults which was an increase of 8 per cent in that period of time 
the average annual increase has been 14 per cent among youth.
<P>
	I feel that perhaps there has been a reflection today on the part 
of some Liberals and certainly many of the people from the Bloc 
who have spoken on this issue that perhaps, and the word has 
been used, the Reform Party is panicking or the Reform Party is 
not being reflective, or the Reform Party is exaggerating the 
issue. I suggest with the greatest of respect to the minister that 
the people in my constituency, and I believe all across Canada 
including the great province of Quebec, are deeply concerned 
about what is going on.
<P>
	I ask the minister if there might not be some place in the way 
in which this Parliament of Canada works for there to be 
something such as we have suggested in our motion, at least one 
thing that this government, this Parliament, would go ahead 
with as a hard and fast solid indicator to the people of Canada of 
just how seriously we respect their opinion, that in fact there are 
changes coming.
<P>
	I respect that there has to be a full look at it by the justice 
committee. I respect that and I would not want the full 
legislation to be anything other than well thought out. Is there 
not some way such as we have suggested that we could take at 
least one small step in good faith to the Canadian public and say 
we do see this as being serious and yes, we are going to do this 
and regain the confidence of the people of Canada as I am sure 
the minister and the government would like to have.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Madam Speaker, dealing first with the concern 
that the hon. member refers to, I acknowledge and I respect the 
concern and I make every effort to communicate that to 
Canadians and indeed to members of this House.
<P>
	I do not suggest for a moment that there is not concern out 
there. There certainly is. I think that the changes we are going to 
propose reflect this government's awareness of and response to 
that concern.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	I ask the hon. member to bear in mind that in the campaign 
document on which we saw an election last fall we expressly 
said that changes were needed to the Young Offenders Act, 
including longer maximum sentences for crimes of serious 
violence, adjustments to the transfer provisions and a greater 
sharing of information between police forces, school boards and 
other appropriate authorities as well as greater treatment and 
rehabilitation efforts and other specific measures.
<P>
	This is not something to which we come at the eleventh hour. 
It is an awareness that we reflected in our campaign documents 
and these are changes to which we are committed.
<P>
	I acknowledge the concern and I respect it. The changes we 
will propose not only to the Young Offenders Act but to the 
Criminal Code and in the crime prevention council will be 
intended to address those concerns.
<P>
	I do think, though, as I said in my speech, that it must be kept 
in perspective. The perspective to some extent is furnished by 
facts and some of those facts are statistical. The hon. member 
has referred to some statistics of his own in response to mine and 
I can only tell the hon. member that the best information 
available to the Department of Justice is reflected in the 
statistics I gave which include for example that 14 per cent of 
those charged with violent crimes in 1992 were in the age 
bracket 12 to 17 and that is an increase over 1986 of some 6 per 
cent.
<P>
	The hon. member has different statistics, as least they 
sounded inconsistent when he gave them, and perhaps we should 
compare our sources and find out just how one explains the 
disparity. Regardless of the statistics, surely we have enough 
evidence for concern and its concern that we are going to 
address.
<P>
	My hon. friend asked about two other specific matters that I 
would like to deal with. The first is what can we tell the public 
about concrete changes we propose. I tried to do that in the 
course of my remarks and perhaps too obscurely. In the course of 
my speech today I mentioned that we perceive the need for 
longer maximum sentences for crimes of serious violence; that 
we perceive that for some 16 and 17-year olds charged with 
crimes involving serious bodily harm or death adult court might 
be the more appropriate place for the trials to occur.
<P>
	I mentioned as well the sharing of information, by which I 
mean that when a young offender has been convicted of a crime 
of serious violence the community should protect itself by being 
aware of that fact. We should provide responsibly for the 
dissemination of that information from police forces to school 
boards and others who need to know for the protection of 
society. I mentioned victim impact statements in the youth court 
among other things.
<P>
	I offer those as some indication of the directions in which this 
government intends to go in the changes it will introduce.
<P>
	Let me address the other thing that the hon. member raised 
which is process. The hon. member asked how is it that we can 
reassure Canadians that these changes and the initiatives of 
which I spoke are going to be undertaken at a reasonably early 
time.
<P>
	I propose, as I mentioned, to introduce this legislation in June. 
In the regular course of events it will be referred to the justice 
committee for consideration and then it will be brought back to 
the House for debate and for a decision.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4287"> 4287 </A></B>
<P>
	I see that process as something quite separate from the long 
term review. A long term review may take six or eight months of 
committee hearings during which they will entertain witnesses, 
they will gather evidence and take the views of Canadians and 
they will report back in due course after a methodical and 
intensive examination of Canada's juvenile justice system. That 
may not be back before the House with recommendations until 
some time next year. That is separate and apart from the short 
term bill, the concrete proposals for specific changes in the 
statute that I will propose in June.
<P>
	I fully expect that legislation will go through the process of 
the committee and back to the House without delay, without 
awaiting the longer term review.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	With the collaboration of parties opposite, this week we 
passed a piece of legislation in two days and sent it to the Senate 
for consideration. I am not suggesting that is going to happen 
with this bill, but I use it as an example of parliamentary action 
which is directed and which is effective in producing early 
results.
<P>
	I see the bill which I will propose in June being considered 
and returned here for a decision I hope by early in the fall so that 
it can be put into place. Then, in the fullness of time, the 
committee will conclude its methodical examination and report 
with its recommendations.
<P>
	I hope that responds to the points made by the hon. member.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I will allow a short 
question from the member for Matapédia-Matane.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would have a question for the hon. minister.
<P>
	Having been a teacher all my life, I have spent a lot of time in 
juvenile court. I have come to the conclusion, and you said so 
yourself a moment ago, that unless prevention is undertaken 
very early on, at the elementary or secondary level, drastic 
legislation, much too drastic legislation has to be passed, the 
price of which society will have to pay sooner or later.
<P>
	In my region, politicians have visited schools and worked 
very hard. But then, the funding-provincial funding of 
course-was cut. I have also heard that the RCMP's prevention 
budget was cut as well.
<P>
	Should we not put emphasis, much more emphasis, on 
prevention, in fact give it all we have got in terms of money as 
well as highly qualified staff to try to nip this problem in the 
bud, so to speak?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The hon. Minister of 
Justice as briefly as possible, please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Yes, Madam Speaker, I will be brief. I respond by 
saying absolutely, I fully agree.
<P>
	There is an organization in my riding called the George Hull 
Centre for children and families. It is a collection of 
professionals, psychiatrists, counsellors and social workers who 
direct their efforts intensively toward intervention with high 
risk children and families in trouble.
<P>
	I visited that centre a month or two ago to meet the people and 
talk to them about their work. They made that very point very 
persuasively, that unless we intervene effectively with children 
at risk at the earliest stages then we are ignoring a problem 
which will blossom into an expensive and tragic one with the 
passage of time.
<P>
	I know time is very short but let me just say to the hon. 
member that I fully agree with the sentiment he has expressed 
that when we create the crime prevention council we may not 
have a lot of money for it immediately but the hon. member will 
find in me a strong advocate for making it effective by funding it 
properly and by using I hope at least in part the proceeds of 
crime and if need be private funding from the corporate sector.
<P>
	We must co-ordinate and refocus efforts across the country 
toward prevention in the fashion that the hon. member has 
described.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North):</B> Madam Speaker, 
last night I listened with interest to an address given by Justice 
Lilles of the Territorial Court of Yukon to a conference 
self-named Youth Justice in Crisis. Judge Lilles used the 
opportunity to argue that in his view the present system is 
working quite well and that tougher measures are not the answer.
<P>
	Indeed, we have heard those sentiments expressed here today 
in this House.
<P>
	The only solution this judicial expert offered was that kids 
should not be taken out of the home and that families in 
communities ought to be empowered.
<P>
	In her summation of his talk, the conference co-chairman 
asked the participants the rhetorical question how do we combat 
the let's get tough attitude.
<P>
	Canadians need to realize that the current youth justice 
system has energetic defenders within the system.  Some of 
these people are so strongly opposed to substantial change that 
the word ``combat'' comes naturally into their discussions.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	The conference is named, Youth Justice in Crisis, but the word 
crisis does not appear to be applied by participants, certainly not 
by Judge Lilles, to describe the failures of the system. Rather the 
crisis seems to be that some people want to change the existing 
system.
<P>
	The demand for change, it is stated, must be ``combated by 
those within the system''. If the youth justice system itself 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4288"> 4288 </A></B>
<P>
really is in crisis, Judge Lilles defence  of the present system did 
not indicate that he felt any sense of crisis.
<P>
	Unfortunately this is the view our political decision-makers 
all too often appear to be influenced by. For too long we have 
bought the line we heard yesterday in the House that, ``crime is 
caused by poverty, dysfunctional families, abused children and 
hopelessness''. Why do we persist in feeding this kind of 
nonsense to rational human beings?
<P>
	Members of the House have personally suffered from degrees 
of poverty, dysfunctional families, abuse and have at some time 
or other in their lives suffered from feelings of hopelessness. 
What made us law makers rather than law breakers? On the other 
hand how can we explain the fact that many offenders are from 
homes where they are comfortably well off, loved and cherished 
and have unlimited opportunity?
<P>
	Simplistic rationales for lawless behaviour just do not help 
the situation we find ourselves in today. Yes, we should work 
energetically to combat poverty, family breakdown, abuse and 
loss of spiritual stability. However these realities have never 
been and will never be eradicated completely. We have to offer 
help to members of our society who have been wounded by such 
circumstances but make it abundantly clear that these factors 
will not make us tolerant of violations of the rights, safety and 
security of law-abiding citizens.
<P>
	What is at the root of the current public concerns about the 
justice system in our country is not the level of crime so much as 
the lack of firm and unequivocal response to it.
<P>
	When my home was broken into and thousands of dollars 
worth of hard earned goods stolen, the police told me: ``It was 
probably juveniles and even if we catch them it will do little to 
solve the problem because we have seen third time convictions 
for break and enter get off with probation''.
<P>
	Canadians are concerned that the message keeps going out to 
our youth that disrespect for the rights of others and resulting 
crime is a low risk activity. Canadians are outraged and now 
frustrated to hear our law makers and law enforcers say openly 
and consistently to youth who threaten others' property and 
safety: ``Do not worry. We are just here to help you, not make 
things unpleasant for you. We really understand it is not your 
fault. If you had a nicer home or parents or community we know 
you would not do those things''.
<P>
	What Canadians want to hear from our law makers and justice 
system is this. ``We know life is tough sometimes and it hurts. 
We want to help. But let us get something straight right off. You 
do not hurt other people or their property. We do not allow that. 
If you choose to violate that simple standard of our society the 
personal consequences to you will be unpleasant. Harming 
others' property or lives is a high risk activity in our society. It is 
something we just do not tolerate''.
<P>
	The present Young Offenders Act sends just the opposite 
message to young offenders. It says: ``Whatever you do we will 
pretty much excuse you and not hold you personally 
responsible. Instead we will challenge your home, family and 
community to meet all your real and perceived needs so you will 
want to be a nice person. Providing of course that they do not 
give you any physical discomfort or do anything to lower your 
self-esteem or interfere with your freedom to act on your own 
opinion and values''. Increasingly young people in our society 
are expressing frustration at the lack of responsible and 
appropriate societal values and limits. Fortunately many, even 
the majority, continue to be given those needed societal 
constraints by their homes and the larger community. Most 
young Canadians are decent, responsible, law-abiding and a 
credit to their families and to all of us.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	As they struggle to make good choices in the stress and 
challenge of a rapidly changing world, we need to affirm our 
approval and appreciation for their hard work and 
self-discipline. An important way to do this is by demonstrating 
the opposite response to unrestrained, disrespectful and 
unlawful acts by their peers. Since they are most at risk from 
youthful criminals, at the very least we owe them simple, 
personal protection and safety.
<P>
	These are the reasons I support the motion before the House 
today. The chief of police for the city of Calgary, my own city, 
Chief Borbridge, has confirmed that the Canadian Association 
of Chiefs of Police supports lowering the age of operation of the 
Young Offenders Act to those under age 16, as has been 
proposed.
<P>
	Over half of young people charged with violent offences are 
aged 16 to 17 at the time of the offence and violent offences 
involving youth have increased significantly since the Young 
Offenders Act was passed into law.
<P>
	I do not believe that the Canadian public is asking for an 
unconsidered swing to harsh, punitive measures that are devoid 
of compassion or uncaring about the need for rehabilitation. 
However it is very clear that they want a great deal more 
accountability in the youth justice system. They want young 
offenders held accountable to society. They want the rights of 
law-abiding citizens protected. They want to take the fun and 
thrill and ease out of threatening the property and safety of 
others. They want the consequences for deliberate lawless 
choices to be strong and unpleasant enough to inject a healthy 
dose of caution and disincentive into the minds of youths 
considering offending the rights of others.
<P>
	We can legitimately debate the nature and quality of such 
consequences. However there is no doubt whatever that the vast 
majority of people we all represent, the people who sent us here, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4289"> 4289 </A></B>
<P>
the people who are footing the bill, want changes in that 
direction.
<P>
	I suggest we do our job as law makers in responding to the 
demand for greater protection. This motion is a small step in the 
right direction. I urge members to give it their support.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I quite appreciated the remarks of my hon. colleague. 
However I must ask her a question.
<P>
	The hon. member said she did not feel that poverty or social 
circumstances were the cause of youth crime and illustrated this 
by saying that there are many people who come from similar 
circumstances, poverty and dysfunctional environments, who 
are honest, and even cited members of the House.
<P>
	I am curious to know if she could explain whether she feels 
that all people are essentially the same. Does she not feel that we 
are all individuals and that as individuals we might react 
differently to the circumstances of poverty, and consequently 
some people might be prone to crime whereas other people 
might be prone to honesty given the same circumstances.
<P>
	Further, I might ask the hon. member if she would explain that 
bit of logic but if she might go further and define what she thinks 
is the cause of young people turning to crime?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate the comments 
of my hon. colleague.
<P>
	It is clear that poverty, family dysfunction, abuse are factors 
in crime. That is not something I would dispute. What I am 
disputing is that it is an excuse for crime. I do not believe that we 
should excuse choices to violate the rights of others based on the 
fact that these elements are present in the life and background of 
a citizen. That is not a legitimate excuse.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	We have to recognize that it is difficult to make good 
decisions when these factors are present but we should still 
demand that those decisions be made. We can point to the fact 
that many people who struggle with those very same 
circumstances still are able and can make good decisions.
<P>
	As for the causes of crime, I would probably be elevated to 
sainthood if I could outline those in a short answer. Rather than 
looking at the causes, we have to look back at a little thing called 
personal responsibility. In some ways, we can all find reasons 
for doing what we are doing but what we have to do as a society 
is say: ``I do not care what the reasons are. Those choices are not 
acceptable'' and that is the focus we have to put on those kinds 
of activities.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West):</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. 
member talked about having her house broken into, probably by 
youths.
<P>
	I have had my house broken into and the person was not 
brought to court. I do not know who did it. It is very important 
when we have these discussions that we not generalize, passing 
the blame on to youth. It could very easily have been an adult. I 
know the member qualified her remarks by saying that it was the 
police but it is important that we these generalizations.
<P>
	We can deal in fact in this instance. We do not know who 
broke into my house, we do not know who broke into the 
member's house. I would like the member to have an 
opportunity to say that, talking about reality and perception.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Madam Speaker, I was not intending to cast 
aspersions on youth. I was simply reporting what the police told 
me. They told me that based on the goods that were taken, on the 
modus operandi of the break-in, they believed it was juveniles 
involved.
<P>
	Based on that belief they went on to tell me that there was 
essentially nothing they could do, even if by some good fortune 
they found the people involved. If they were juveniles, the 
message to me was to accept it, that nothing was going to happen 
that would deter or stop this kind of activity if it has been 
committed by juveniles.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Order. It is my duty 
pursuant to Standing Order 38 to inform the House that the 
questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as 
follows: the hon. member for Bourassa, Refugees; the hon. 
member Vancouver Quadra, Pacific Salmon Treaty; and the hon. 
member for Davenport, Rwanda.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan):</B> Madam Speaker, 
in speaking to this motion on the Young Offenders Act I note that 
there is a difference between the public perception of what the 
problem is and a difference in perception on the government 
side.
<P>
	I think the public perceives that something is wrong and that 
something should be done about it. The government 
acknowledges this to a fair degree. When I listen to the Minister 
of Justice, I get an acknowledgement: ``Yes, something is 
wrong, we will do something about it'' but perhaps not with the 
urgency that some of us would put on it.
<P>
	Between these perceptions, what is the reality? When I look at 
the news media coverage of young offenders and what is going 
on there, I have to wonder if there is not some exaggeration.
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	To try to answer the question of what is the problem I have 
gone back in my life and asked how were things when I was a 
kid. As a child or a young person in Vancouver things were 
different. We did not have many privileges in those days and I 
surely did not see the police very often. If you saw the police, 
wow, that was something to be very apprehensive about. To be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4290"> 4290 </A></B>
<P>
sure we had a few bad kids in the neighbourhood who tended to 
get into trouble.
<P>
	That is my recollection of what actually was going on. There 
must have been offenders, young offenders, in those days as well 
as there are today.
<P>
	I say fine, now project ahead, Bob. Are the children or the 
youth of today any different from what they were in my day? My 
answer to that has to be no, how could they be that different. 
Surely we depend on evolution for differences of any major 
nature so my basic conclusion is the kids must be the same 
essentially, so what is different? The answer to that I reckon has 
to be society. The whole society around the children of today has 
changed and that means all of us. We have changed. We are the 
society that surrounds our children. What are we doing that is 
different?
<P>
	One of the changes of course is with parents. Parents today 
both tend to be working, they are out. Children at home do not 
have the same parental guidance and care.
<P>
	The other big change that I perceive is the view of 
responsibility versus rights. Today it is all my rights, my rights, 
my rights. I do not hear my responsibility is so and so. That I 
presume is partly a question of law, of the charter of rights and 
such like. It is also a perception of society and society has put 
the emphasis on individual rights rather than individual 
responsibilities. I think therein lies part of the problem.
<P>
	In trying to address this whole thing we should not put the 
blame just on government, just on the law, just on the 
predisposing causes in society for young offenders. I think we 
have to look generally at society and ask where the problems 
are, what are the faults that we individually must accept part of 
the responsibility for.
<P>
	Certainly philosophy I put at the top of the list. I do perceive 
that maybe the pendulum of change has swung quite far enough 
and that society generally is ready to see it go back again. I 
dislike extremes and I would not like to see it go one way too far 
any more than the other.
<P>
	The other thing that really came to mind when I looked back 
over my life are the good number of years that I put in the army. 
We had a thing in the army called service detention barracks. 
There used to be a number of them across the country. I think 
there is probably one left today in Edmonton. The SDB was 
quite an institution and is today. Here is the experience that I 
have had with SDBs.
<P>
<B>(1620 ) </B>
<P>
	I have never fortunately been an inmate but if any of my 
young soldiers broke the law to a sufficient degree that they 
would be put on summary trial, not a court martial, the 
commanding officer could award them 30 days in the service 
detention barracks.
<P>
	I am witness to the fact that any young lad who came back 
from 30 days in the digger, in the glass house, in the SDB, was 
changed for life. He never wanted to go back to the detention 
barracks. He would behave. He would change his character if he 
had to to avoid getting that 30 days in the digger.
<P>
	What did they do in the digger? Did they beat him? No, they 
did not. There was no corporal punishment even for privates. 
What they did in the SDB was disciplined the young fellow 
within an inch of his life. When he entered the detention 
barracks his hair was cut to the standards of the provost corps 
that ran the barracks. He was not asked how long he would like 
it.
<P>
	If we do the comparison today of young offenders going in 
they might get six months or whatever, they are allowed to do 
what they want to do. They are allowed to wear their hair long, 
wear their own clothes, speak when they want to, watch colour 
TV. It is a great old thing.
<P>
	Thirty days in the slammer was not like today's six months. 
Thirty days they went in, they got their hair cut, they were told 
when they could speak. They were not mouthing off because 
they were not allowed to. They were told precisely what they 
would do in shining their shoes, including the sole. They were 
told precisely how to shine their brass, how to make their bed. 
Every detail of their existence for 30 days was under a 
microscope and under a sergeant who knew his business in 
administering discipline. They were not beaten, but they were 
made to do everything precisely for that period of time.
<P>
	As I said earlier it changed them for life. They said: ``No more 
of that for me. I will behave''.
<P>
	I suggest to this House, I suggest to society, that if a 
punishment works, and that is what it is, surely we can invoke it 
again. What is to prevent us as a society from saying even if we 
run a test case on it, let us get a platoon of old provost corps 
types and say: ``Boys, run at it''. I bet we would get results.
<P>
	To conclude, in supporting this amendment I would call the 
attention of the House and even of the nation to a referendum 
trial that is going to go on in North Vancouver, British Columbia 
in June. Watch it. It will be a referendum available on official-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry the hon. 
member's time has expired. The hon. member for 
Hamilton-Wentworth on questions and comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth):</B> Very briefly 
through you, Madam Speaker, I believe Amnesty International 
defines solitary confinement as a form of torture. I wonder if the 
member would comment on that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Madam Speaker, it is not solitary confinement 
when they are put through this routine in the detention barracks. 
They are there with other inmates. They are made to go out and 
do the drills and such like. This is just a severe form of 
discipline.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="4291"> 4291 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	If you disagree with it that is fine. I suggest that it really 
worked. I would like us to have a trial and just see if it would not 
work with the young fellows. I bet it would.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York-Simcoe):</B> Madam Speaker, 
while the hon. member on the other side suggested that this was 
not a form of physical abuse, I would suggest that there are many 
forms of abuse such as psychological abuse. It does sound very 
severe.
<P>
	The member also suggested that these individuals were 
changed for life. I would suggest that people who are subjected 
to severe forms of psychological abuse would be changed for 
life. We all know what happens when we beat a dog regularly 
and the kinds of things that can happen with that.
<P>
	There is very strong evidence that is well substantiated that 
many of these young children who get in trouble with the law 
had trauma at birth, are suffering from severe learning 
disabilities, and I am not entirely sure what this kind of 
treatment would do to help these children who are not loved and 
not healthy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Madam Speaker, I would have to agree with the 
last comment of the hon. member. Indeed, if there is illness then 
special account has to be taken of that. Nevertheless, there is 
probably some middle ground that could be found to say: ``We 
excuse you for your illness, we will help you with that. In the 
meantime here are the rules we are going to establish that you in 
your turn must obey''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Prince Albert-Churchill River):</B> 
Madam Speaker, just a quick comment. There probably are some 
distinctions that could be drawn with the situation when people 
are put in army detention and regular detention. One certainly 
being that there would be the desire on the part of those put in 
army detention to get back and to continue serving in the 
military. They have something to lose if they do not obey.
<P>
	I think what has to be recognized is that many of our young 
people do not have anything to lose and would not be helped by 
this type of treatment.
<P>
	Members of the Reform Party are talking about fiscal 
restraint. We are talking about reducing the age to which the 
Young Offenders Act would apply. We are talking about 
reducing the minimum age and we are also talking about 
reducing the maximum age. This is going to put a much greater 
burden on both the adult prison system and the young offender 
incarceration system.
<P>
	I would suggest that if we go across this country we would see 
that the jails are already overburdened. When we talk about 
fiscal restraint how are we going to build many more jails and 
prisons in a society that has difficulty affording what we have 
now? How are we going to afford to staff them? As usual it is a 
case of proposing solutions but forgetting about the cost on the 
other hand. How does the member answer that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Madam Speaker, I answer the question of the 
hon. member with a great deal of pleasure. If you institute a 
system in which there is a form of punishment as I am 
suggesting you reduce the number of inmates. They do not want 
to go back. You can accomplish in 30 days in the digger what six 
months or a year would not accomplish in today's modern 
facility where they are given all the amenities of life. Make it 
undesirable for them to do 30 days time and they will not be 
back. You will reduce the number of people in that facility and 
thereby exercise fiscal restraint. There will be less need for a 
facility in the long run. Give it a try. I am quite sincere in the 
proposal.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West):</B> Madam Speaker, dealing 
effectively with youth crime is a priority of the government. 
Canadians including young people are very concerned about 
their safety. Violence in our nation's schools is of particular 
significance. I have three children attending elementary 
schools, and I am certainly not indifferent to the issue.
<P>
	What is the answer to the problem of young people who 
commit crimes? Is the Young Offenders Act the problem? Does 
a single age change correct the problem as the motion suggests? 
Clearly there is a need to improve the way in which the act 
responds to youth crime, especially serious violent crime. As we 
consider changes to the law, however, it is critical we begin with 
a sound understanding of the law and of the nature and extent of 
the crime. As I stated earlier this week in the House, we must 
divorce perception from reality.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4292"> 4292 </A></B>
<P>
	Many Canadians believe that the Young Offenders Act has no 
teeth, that there are no consequences for a young offender 
convicted of a criminal offence. The reality is actually quite 
different. Depending on the seriousness of the offence, its 
circumstances and the youth before the court-we must 
remember it is the individual before the court-the 
consequences may range from fines, community service orders 
or probation to the deprivation of liberty through incarceration 
for a young person. Roughly one-third of the cases before the 
courts receive a custodial disposition.
<P>
	Transfer to adult court is also a possibility under the act. If 
convicted of murder in adult court after a transfer today, a youth 
could spend his or her life in custody. An example is useful. A 
16-year-old who was convicted of murder in adult court and 
lives until he or she is 75 years of age could spend 59 years in 
jail. Yes, parole is a possibility but it is only a possibility.
<P>
	People including youth do not understand that convictions in 
youth court means a record will remain with the youth for many 
years with implications for both education and employment 
opportunities.
<P>
	At present for less serious offences the record is held for five 
years from the date of the conviction. For indictable offences it 
is a time period of five years after the completion of the sentence 
as long as there is no other intervening indictable offence.
<P>
	Many people also believe that the hands of the police are tied 
when it comes to youth because of the Young Offenders Act. 
That belief goes hand in hand with the belief that youth have too 
many rights. In fact police have all the same powers regarding 
investigation and arrest where youth are concerned as they have 
for adults.
<P>
	The Young Offenders Act actually strengthen police powers 
by making it clear that fingerprints and photographs could be 
taken and criminal records kept. Conviction rates in youth 
courts are considerably higher than those in adult court across a 
range of offences.
<P>
	In terms of the nature of youth crime, it is critical that we keep 
violent youth crime in Canada in perspective. Eight-six per cent 
of violent crime is committed by adult Canadians. Fourteen per 
cent of violent crime is committed by young people under the 
age of 18 years. About half the youth crime that is termed 
violent in our national statistics is for common assault, for 
example a slap, a shove, a push or a punch often in the school 
yard. The average number of youths, though, charged with 
homicide under the Young Offenders Act from 1986 to 1992 was 
46 annually.
<P>
	In the 1970s, when the majority of provinces treated 16 and 17 
year olds as adults, there were 60 cases of young people under 
the age of 18 years charged with homicides. In short, fewer 
charges of homicide have occurred under the Young Offenders 
Act, on average.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	We must realize that many murder charges do not result in 
murder convictions. In 1992-93 youth court heard 40 murder 
cases. There were 16 convictions in youth court for murder and 
six cases transferred. Eighteen cases were stayed, withdrawn or 
dismissed.
<P>
	These comments are not to minimize the importance of 
violent crimes. Any violence is too much violence. Neither are 
these comments to suggest that we cannot improve the act. We 
can and we must do so. We must ensure, however, that changes 
to the law will be meaningful ones in terms of better protecting 
our communities in both the short and long term and in better 
rehabilitating our young offenders.
<P>
	No single change such as is suggested by the motion in 
question will improve our youth justice system. Although I am 
prepared to evaluate all the evidence when the justice committee 
reviews this legislation-and I sit as government vice-chair of 
the justice committee-I am not predisposed to changing the 
ages under this legislation.
<P>
	In my riding of London West, the London Family Court Clinic 
has a 1993 report stating emphatically that the current ages of 12 
to 17 are adequate and appropriate. Dr. Lescheid from the 
London Family Court Clinic advised me that in fact they could 
find no research or clinical support indicating that criminalizing 
10-year-olds through the justice system would ensure 
community safety. Rather, it is the insurance of programs that 
can take place outside the justice system that can promote 
community safety.
<P>
	Canada's youth justice system is at a critical juncture. While 
legislative change is important, it is not enough. We must 
improve our crime prevention efforts. We must improve the way 
our youth justice system operates in conjunction with child 
protection, health and education. We will need provincial 
co-operation to do so.
<P>
	We must carefully study how parents could play a stronger 
role in preventing both their children's involvement in crime 
and in assisting the youth with rehabilitation after a criminal 
offence has come to their household. A multi-disciplinary 
approach rather than surface solutions will be a more 
responsible and responsive reaction to this issue.
<P>
	We must listen carefully to the professionals in Canada who 
are meeting with success. We must pay attention to research 
findings that demonstrate to us that success can be achieved. 
These same professionals are also able to reveal to us patterns 
for youth who engage in violent crime.
<P>
	While there will always be cases that could not have been 
predicted, a great many are predictable and many of these are 
preventable. We must not close our eyes to the facts of these 
patterns of behaviour as they reveal vital insights as to how 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4293"> 4293 </A></B>
<P>
certain problem behaviour could be checked earlier and why 
such behaviour should and must be checked earlier.
<P>
	The signs of unacceptably aggressive behaviour often 
emerges early as preschool and certainly by five, six, seven and 
eight years of age. The most effective way to help children who 
show aggressive behaviour is to respond as soon as it appears. 
Otherwise aggressive behaviour will become established and 
very resistant to change. Aggressive behaviour in childhood, if 
unchecked, will be more difficult to counter once the child has 
reached adolescence. Clearly collaboration by parents, 
educators and, where required, clinicians is key.
<P>
	Core messages must be delivered consistently to Canada's 
children and adolescents. There must be a value basis to these 
messages which promotes racial and gender equality and 
fundamental respect for the integrity of all people regardless of 
age.
<P>
	Our children and our young people are getting the wrong 
messages from family violence and the violence and efforts at 
ownership, control and abuse of authority some adults engage 
in. I look forward to amending the Young Offenders Act. I look 
forward to evaluating the legislation that our justice minister 
will place before us shortly.
<P>
	I also look forward to the thoughtful and broad based review 
of our youth justice system by the parliamentary committee. I 
am very optimistic that one product of this review will be a 
cohesive plan to engage Canadians to collectively work together 
in the interest of our youth, in the interest of our children, which 
will result in safer Canadian communities.
<P>
<B>(1640 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
appreciated everything the hon. member said to us this 
afternoon.
<P>
	I was at the criminal justice rally in Calgary last weekend and 
had an opportunity to spend time with the families of victims. I 
spoke to several of them. One in particular was a new Canadian. 
Her son had just died of a gunshot wound 10 days before, a crime 
committed by a young offender. Her son is no longer with her. 
She has no husband here. There was just herself and her 
daughter.
<P>
	I have a question for this mother in Calgary about some of the 
content of the hon. member's presentation. The member 
mentioned that we needed a multi-disciplinary approach. This 
afternoon the Minister of Justice talked about a two-track 
approach. It seems to me there is some confusion either in the 
semantics or in understanding exactly where the government's 
intentions lie.
<P>
	We have a mother who is asking for action. She is looking for 
answers. She no longer has her son. And we have a government 
response that somehow is not saying the same thing to me.
<P>
	I wish the hon. member would respond to those comments and 
tell us exactly what is the difference between the 
multi-disciplinary approach that she spoke of and the two-track 
approach the Minister of Justice mentioned in his remarks 
earlier this afternoon.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Barnes:</B> Madam Speaker, I am very happy to respond to 
the question of the hon. member opposite. The 
multi-disciplinary approach is the integration of all 
departments of the government and all levels of government. An 
interdisciplinary approach could be health.
<P>
	When I was visiting Vancouver recently I made a trip to a core 
city public school. That school not only served breakfast; it also 
served lunch. I venture to say that was most of the nutritional 
value those children received. It was a very difficult teaching 
environment. It brought home to me the multi-disciplinary 
approaches that were required in the classroom, literacy training 
being one. I saw a divergence of cultural backgrounds. That 
school was very different from many schools in my riding.
<P>
	We must not manage all our problems with individual lines 
where departments do not talk to each other. Health must talk to 
education and education must talk to employment. We have to 
understand that poverty is the link to a lot of crime. Violence 
begets violence. With family destruction and its changing nature 
it is impossible to have the same family picture as a ``Leave it to 
Beaver'' commercial for a TV program when I grew up. It does 
not exist.
<P>
	There are many poor families in the country in which children 
are not properly cared for and are left unattended. There are 
many single parent families where the wife leaves an abusive 
situation and takes her family with her into a poverty situation. 
That is what is happening.
<P>
	It does not matter whether we are talking about guns because 
there are multi-disciplinary aspects to justice. Maybe it is time 
to re-evaluate gun control legislation so that they are not around 
to create devastation for families and victims.
<P>
	I must say no one party in the House has ownership of 
concern. We are all concerned as parliamentarians about the 
victims in society. They are regarded with respect by this side of 
the House.
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	It is important to remember we must deal with all the facets of 
this problem, and there are many. We will have time to deal with 
that in this Parliament. I certainly will be making it one of my 
aims to work very actively in this area.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4294"> 4294 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I congratulate the member on her fine speech. She 
brings up a number of very good points, but I think she is only 
looking at half of the equation.
<P>
	What irritates my constituents and myself very much is that 
nobody apparently wants to speak out for the rights of society as 
a whole. We continually talk about the rights of the accused, the 
rights of the convicted, and we make beautiful speeches about 
the rights of the victim. But unfortunately and tragically, in the 
recent history of this country, the rights of the victim have been 
subjugated to the rights of the criminal.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry, the time has 
expired. Do you wish the hon. member to make a very brief 
response?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to know from the hon. member exactly what she and 
her party are going to do to guarantee that the rights of society 
will be protected over the rights of the criminal.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Barnes:</B> In answer to that question, Madam Speaker, I 
am going to guarantee that the Young Offenders Act will look at 
the rehabilitation of children. When they come out at the end of 
the process they are going to be better citizens than when they 
went in. That is not just by punishment; it is by changing 
behaviour and behaviour modification. If we target our 
resources smartly we can achieve that and not just hold people in 
a pattern.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Madam Speaker, I want to 
thank all hon. members who have contributed to this debate. I 
have some comments I would like to make on this subject. Of 
course I rise in support of this motion.
<P>
	I grew up in a large family. Corporal punishment was used in 
our family. We knew the rules and we knew the consequences of 
breaking those rules. I know today what the consequences are of 
breaking those rules.
<P>
	I do not use corporal punishment in my home. I have four 
children. They know if the rules are violated in our home there 
are consequences to be paid. The rules very seldom are broken in 
our home. Of course, the greatest weapon I use against that kind 
of behaviour on the part of my children is I show to my children 
the love and concern I have for them and I provide for their 
needs.
<P>
	In 1984 the Young Offenders Act came into force repealing 
the Juvenile Delinquents Act. Since 1984 on average 46 
homicides a year have been committed by children age 12 to 17 
years. Figures reveal that in 1991, 22 per cent of the 679,000 
federal statute charges laid were against youth. Of the more than 
146,000 charges against young people, 13 per cent were 
violence related. These 18,000 violent offence charges marked 
an increase of 102 per cent from 1986. However, over the same 
period the size of the youth population decreased by 1.8 per 
cent.
<P>
	I ask those people who advocate that the Young Offenders Act 
is working: Do 46 murders per year represent a victory? Does an 
increase of 102 per cent in violent attacks prove success? If the 
system is working of course there is no need to change it, but if it 
is not working, then we ought to be earnestly engaged in looking 
at ways to reform the system.
<P>
	I do not think this represents a success. Anyone who believes 
it does has no idea of the anatomy of a murder. They do not know 
the fear, pain and anguish inflicted upon a murder victim by the 
criminal. They are unaware of the acts of desperation and the 
pleas for mercy by the victim in their futile attempt to survive.
<P>
	Those figures I have just quoted represent a failure. It is a 
failure to respond to the criminal behaviour of our youth. Those 
figures represent the utter contempt and disregard held by the 
criminal for your right and my right to live. They represent a 
contempt for our laws and our justice system, a system that does 
not hold them accountable for their criminal conduct in any 
meaningful way.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	These figures are why members on both sides of the House 
want action and they want it now. We do not want to wait a year 
because that means perhaps another 46 deaths. We do not want 
to wait six months for another 23 murders to occur. We want to 
move as speedily and as expediently as is possible. We want to 
start now to introduce reforms that will provide greater 
protection to the people of this country.
<P>
	We are asking that the government amend the Young 
Offenders Act to ensure greater responsibility and 
accountability among our youth for their delinquent behaviour. 
We are recommending that the minister give kids a choice and a 
message: Behave or pay the price.
<P>
	We all have the power to make choices. When we make the 
wrong choice there are consequences to pay. That is a fact of 
life, a fact that our justice system has failed to teach many of the 
youth of this nation.
<P>
	The original intent of the Young Offenders Act was to balance 
society's demand for protection with the need to protect the 
rights of the young offender. What right does a young offender 
have? This is a question we must address before proceeding with 
any changes to the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	Convicted murderers, rapists and others regardless of their 
age who take it upon themselves to vandalize or to murder 
another human being throw their rights away the moment they 
launch their deadly attack upon the life of another. This is made 
clear by the fact that we as individuals have the right to 
administer death to an assailant in order to protect our lives. The 
assailant casts away all his rights including his right to life the 
moment he attacks, provoking the defendant to either retaliate 
or give up his own life.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4295"> 4295 </A></B>
<P>
	The Young Offenders Act and other laws have improperly 
restored the rights to the murderer. That should be the guiding 
principle of the Young Offenders Act; that should be the guiding 
principle of our laws and our criminal justice system and for our 
legislators: that the rights of the individual are extinguished by 
their criminal act.
<P>
	The balance that was to be struck by the Young Offenders Act 
has been tipped in favour of the local high school drug dealer 
and rapist and murderer. Lenient sentences, unpublished names 
and the belief that 10 and 11-year olds do not know right from 
wrong are the considerations that have skewered the justice 
system. The Young Offenders Act has allowed the rights of the 
offender to outweigh those of the victim.
<P>
	Let us examine the question of rights. When individuals burst 
into your home and attack you or your family, you have the 
inherent right and responsibility to defend yourself and your 
children. If that requires using deadly force, then you have that 
right within our society.
<P>
	The delinquents who shot and killed defenceless Nicholas 
Battersby did not consider his rights. They did not consider his 
right to life, his right to live in peace in his own home, his right 
to experience the joys of his future. The state failed to protect 
these rights of Nicholas Battersby and they were extinguished 
by his assailants. We cannot say Nicholas Battersby's murderers 
have been denied the same rights. Under the current Young 
Offenders Act they will continue to enjoy the rights they have so 
brutally denied their victim.
<P>
	The question we must ask is: What more must individuals do 
to forfeit their rights and freedoms? If taking the life of another 
does not extinguish all their rights except to a fair hearing 
through our courts of law, then it destroys the meaning of 
individual rights and it extinguishes the meaning of life itself 
within our society.
<P>
	I say with respect, the bleeding hearts in this country who 
have restored the rights of the offender after he has taken the 
rights from his victim do not comprehend, I believe, the rights 
associated with human life. They have erroneously made the 
criminal the victim by suggesting that the criminals are not 
responsible for the choices they make that lead to their criminal 
acts. They read into the circumstances of the criminal's life 
justification for the brutal and sadistic acts committed by them.
<P>
	Regardless of our upbringing, no matter now deplorable the 
conditions of our life, we all have the power to make choices. 
We all know the difference between right and wrong and we are 
all responsible when we make the wrong decision. We cannot 
blame anyone else. We must be accountable for our own actions.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	Millions of Canadians every day make decisions to be honest, 
to be fair and to respect the property and the lives of others. 
Therefore there is no justification in saying that one's past 
experiences or environment is the cause of one's criminal 
behaviour.
<P>
	However our justice system particularly in regard to the 
Young Offenders Act says that young people are not responsible 
for their choices and their actions. This has been a major blunder 
in the creation of the laws protecting the property and lives of 
the people of this nation, that somehow someone else is 
responsible for the choice made by the criminal.
<P>
	What these legislators are saying is that we do not reap what 
we sow. I find this unreasonable and unacceptable. The injustice 
in this country, the major flaw within our justice system is that 
we have legislated to restore the rights of criminals, rights 
which were lost at the time the depraved person launched their 
deadly attack upon the rights and the property of another human 
being.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Judy Bethel (Edmonton East):</B> Madam Speaker, there 
can be no doubt that many Canadians are concerned about youth 
crime and more specifically about how the Young Offenders Act 
deals with youth who commit these crimes. Recent horrifying 
events in Ottawa, Toronto, Edmonton and elsewhere have 
understandably increased the national attention focused on this 
issue.
<P>
	I wish to state clearly that individual events even if there are a 
number of them do not necessarily amount to an epidemic. The 
vast majority of Canada's young people are ambitious and hard 
working young citizens who respect their fellow Canadians. The 
vast majority are maturing into productive and law-abiding 
members of our society. We do a disservice to all young people 
if we cast them in the same light as the minority who turn to 
crime.
<P>
	Over the last few years youth crime in Canada in fact has not 
increased in a significant way statistically. Adults, not youth, 
still commit most of the crimes in Canada. In addition, it should 
be remembered that most of the crimes committed by youth are 
non-violent. They are crimes against property, not against 
people. Nevertheless it is true that some youths do indeed 
commit crimes. It undoubtedly is an issue that is important to 
the fabric of our society and it must be addressed squarely by 
this government.
<P>
	Last fall a major national public consultation paper was 
released by the Department of Justice on the Young Offenders 
Act. This paper was distributed to about 40,000 groups and 
individuals in Canada. It asked for their opinions on several 
issues relating to the act.
<P>
	These issues included: whether the minimum age under the 
act ought to be lowered; whether the maximum age under the act 
ought to be lowered; and whether there ought to be more 
transfers of youth to adult court. The issues also included: 
whether the identities of young offenders ought to be published 
and if so, at what stage of the proceedings; whether judges ought 
to be encouraged to sentence only violent young offenders to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4296"> 4296 </A></B>
<P>
custody; and whether the Young Offenders Act ought to allow 
greater flexibility for youths to get access to treatment.
<P>
	Finally, the consultation paper included a series of questions 
on what changes ought to be made at the community level and 
elsewhere in our society to prevent youth crime. It also asked 
what additional steps ought to be taken to ensure that young 
offenders are rehabilitated and therefore do not become 
reoffenders and go on to a life of adult crime.
<P>
	I have taken some care to explain the content of the 
consultation paper in order to make the following points. This 
paper directly sought the opinions of Canadians on most if not 
all of the key and pressing issues that currently relate to the 
Young Offenders Act, including the subject of today's motion 
which is whether to change the upper and lower age brackets in 
the act.
<P>
	It is encouraging to note that over 1,000 people took the time 
and trouble to send in written responses to the consultation 
paper, all of which were read and are being considered. It is also 
encouraging that the majority of respondents were thoughtful 
and many offered interesting and helpful suggestions for 
change.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	At the same time there is no doubt that the responses indicate 
that Canadians who responded are concerned about the Young 
Offenders Act in general, about how well and evenly it is 
enforced and about whether it is effective against youth crime.
<P>
	More specifically, they are concerned about the age brackets 
in the act, publication of names of young offenders, transfers to 
adult court, length and types of sentences, treatment and 
rehabilitation and about how to prevent youth crime.
<P>
	This government has already made it clear that it intends to 
address the issues relating to the Young Offenders Act. In fact, it 
was just over a year ago in April 1993 that the crime and justice 
package was released. Therein it stated that this government's 
proposed changes in the act include increased sentence lengths 
for young offenders convicted of murder to ensure full 
treatment, improved access to rehabilitation programs for 
young offenders, and increased release of information on the 
identity of young offenders.
<P>
	Not all the changes that may be needed can be made quickly 
and easily. The issues surrounding the Young Offenders Act and 
the youth justice system are difficult and important. 
Furthermore the responses to the public consultation process on 
the act indicated clearly that regrettably on several issues there 
is no consensus among Canadians on what changes should be 
made to the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	Nevertheless I know my colleague, the hon. Minister of 
Justice, agrees that the amendments to the Young Offenders Act 
that are most pressing and can successfully be made at this time 
must be made as soon as possible, indeed before the House rises 
for the summer.
<P>
	Accordingly, I gather that the Minister of Justice intends to 
present this House with a bill in the near future. It will be 
obvious to members that this will leave some issues relating to 
the Young Offenders Act unresolved. To deal with these issues 
the Minister of Justice has already stated publicly that he 
intends to initiate a broad and all encompassing review of the 
Young Offenders Act and the youth justice system.
<P>
	It is expected that this review will be undertaken by a 
parliamentary committee and that the review process will 
include consultations with interested groups and individuals 
from across Canada. In this way Canadians will be able to tell 
Parliament what form they ultimately wish the Young Offenders 
Act and the youth justice system to take.
<P>
	I believe that this is of crucial importance because in the final 
analysis it is those who feel well served and protected by the act, 
those who will be dealt with by the Young Offenders Act and 
those who will help them who must be satisfied with it and with 
the youth justice system.
<P>
	In closing, I cannot stress enough that we must create a Young 
Offenders Act and youth justice system supported by Canadians. 
Otherwise we will fail in our attempt to address the social 
problem of youth crime which is a blot on our society. We cannot 
afford to abandon this small minority of our young people who 
for whatever reasons commit crime. If we do abandon them we 
can be sure that the cost to society will in the end be far greater 
than the cost of helping them while they are still young.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her fine speech. It was very 
eloquent and does in fact address some of the issues of why 
people become young offenders in the first place.
<P>
	However, I will submit to the hon. member that one of her 
statements in the initial part of her presentation was false, the 
statement that crimes committed by youth are in fact not 
statistically increasing at all. Crimes committed by youth are in 
fact increasing at a greater rate than those by other people and in 
fact crimes that are of a violent nature committed by youth are 
increasing at a far greater rate.
<P>
	Many years ago in putting myself through school I was a 
correctional officer in a maximum security detention centre and 
have worked as a doctor in jails. One of the most tragic things in 
working with youth as well as adults is that they find when they 
get out of the system there is nothing there for them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4297"> 4297 </A></B>
<P>
	I remember last summer a youth who was 15 pleading with me 
and saying: ``Please, Dr. Martin, do not let me get out of this 
institute. This is the third time I have been in here. When I go out 
I know I am going to come back in here again''.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	It broke my heart to tell that kid, that poor individual, that I 
had nothing to offer. As a constructive suggestion for members, 
I would ask members to please look at some kind of system for 
these individuals, particularly the youth in the detention centres, 
for some way in which they do not regress into the lives that they 
had before. Tragically, as has been pointed out in this House, 
many of them come from environments that are profoundly 
tragic. They find themselves going back into those situations.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member what specifically-please, I do 
not want any rhetoric-is she or her party going to do in order to 
rectify the problems that we have in young offenders today?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Bethel:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question.
<P>
	First, I should clear up that I was talking about statistically 
significant; that there has been no statistically significant 
increase in violent crime for youth. I would not like to leave the 
member's impression as what he sees as fact to be true.
<P>
	I am quite encouraged to hear of the background of the hon. 
member. I too have spent time with young offenders as a 
member of our Edmonton police services and as a member of our 
city council which developed over a two-year period of time the 
safer cities initiatives which dealt extensively with crime 
prevention.
<P>
	We have always believed in Edmonton that there needs to be 
that balance. Yes, there need to be consequences for the acts of 
violence and offences against people and property. That is what 
we have made very clear here that we are willing to do by 
increasing the length of sentencing in the bill that members will 
see coming forward.
<P>
	When we talk about what we can do for youth, we can be sure 
that they have the kinds of rehabilitative programs that will 
erase the fear that the member has talked about. That is quite a 
heart-rending story about a young person who is in essence 
afraid to leave a jail because he is in fear of reoffending.
<P>
	I would think that with someone who felt that way with a good 
rehabilitative program there would be little risk of reoffending 
because he sounded like he cared and wanted to take advantage 
of a program like that.
<P>
	We need a balanced approach. I am heartened to hear the 
interest of the hon. member in rehabilitative programs and in 
dealing with preventing crime.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Madam Speaker, we 
have an opportunity today to be positive.
<P>
	We can show the youth of our country that we do care and that 
we are willing to make the decisions necessary to benefit them 
in the long run. At the same time, we can show Canadians that 
we are listening, that we not only hear but also care about their 
anguish and anger.
<P>
	We have an opportunity today to take all the pain, all the 
frustration and all the hopes and expectations and act 
substantively. What Canadians want from their members of 
Parliament is action and this motion from my side of the House 
responds to the expectations of Canadians.
<P>
	The members opposite can also show today that they have 
heard and that they do care. I know that they do. They can 
support our motion. It appears that it will take further effort to 
get the members opposite to come to understand the problem of 
youth crime in the same way that we do.
<P>
	Given this, I intend today to make an argument for change. 
My colleagues have provided many constructive arguments for 
ways to change the Young Offenders Act. We are simply 
proposing more vigorously to reform the criminal justice system 
and, most especially, bring change to the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	Despite contrary voices there has been an increase in youth 
crime and there are a myriad of contributing factors to this 
increase. We have heard about those today. It is clear that the 
lack of effectiveness of the YOA is one of those contributing 
factors, but I also want to point out that the Canadian perception 
of an increase in youth crime is not a false perception. Some of 
the members across the floor are quick to dismiss any talk of 
rising crime statistics as fearmongering or some kind of 
knee-jerk response and a reaction perhaps to isolated instances.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	I will provide information a little later showing just how 
wrong minded so many of the members across the floor are. I ask 
them to raise their heads, to listen to Canadians and then they too 
will appreciate the magnitude of this problem.
<P>
	The members of my party are attempting to substantively 
address the problem. During the election campaign, on the 
doorsteps, at town hall meetings, during public debates and in 
the coffee shops people were talking about the Young Offenders 
Act and victims' rights. We heard them and we promised we 
would bring those concerns, the concerns of Canadians, with us 
to Ottawa. And we are living up to that promise. Unfortunately, 
the government has done nothing to date but we hear good things 
in the offing. To date it has done nothing about the Young 
Offenders Act and criminal justice reform. Promises are made. 
Yes, indeed. Soon, we are told and we continue to wait.
<P>
	I know how concerned Canadians have become because on 
Mothers Day I attended the rally in Calgary that was held 
simultaneously with Edmonton and between those two rallies 
over 4,000 people came together to voice their concerns about 
the increase in  violent crime by youths and the commensurate 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4298"> 4298 </A></B>
<P>
lack of judicial action to deter criminal activity. Believe me, it 
was painful to hear their stories.
<P>
	When the Young Offenders Act was introduced it may have 
been well intended but it has failed miserably. After the act came 
into force young offenders quickly came to understand that they 
could commit crimes and that if they were caught the 
punishment they would get would no worse than a slap on the 
wrist.
<P>
	Unfortunately young offenders have become very clever. 
They know that when committing a crime their chances of being 
caught are very slim. Worse than that even if they are caught 
they know that their names will not be published, they know 
their records will be expunged five years after their sentence is 
finished. They know that the maximum sentence they can 
receive in youth court is three years. They know that the courts 
do not even like to try young offenders in adult court. In fact, in 
1990-91 less than 1 per cent of violent cases were even 
transferred to adult court. They know that they can return to the 
community without undergoing any treatment whatsoever. 
Simply put, they know they can continue to get away with it.
<P>
	Those of us who herald this debate have been called alarmists 
by many people in this House today and I wish to dispel that 
misunderstanding. I want to bring the debate even a little closer 
to home with some chilling statistics and we have had a lot of 
those thrown out today.
<P>
	According to the MacKenzie Institute in Calgary, between 
1988 and 1991 the violent crime rate among youth increased by 
179 per cent. When those people rallied on Mothers Day they 
were not reacting in an alarmist fashion to a make believe 
problem. They were reacting to their heartfelt knowledge that 
the instances of violent crimes committed in Calgary and 
elsewhere by youth are increasing at an alarming rate. As well, 
not only is there a statistical increase in youth crimes but a 
Mount Royal criminologist, John Winterdyk, is also concerned 
that the nature of the crimes committed by young people seem to 
be more random, more violent and more senseless.
<P>
	On that unhappy topic I have further statistics to corroborate 
Mr. Winterdyk's concerns. Of the 135,348 youths charged in 
criminal code incidents in 1992, 15 per cent were charged with 
violent crimes. This proportion was up 10.5 per cent from 1988. 
We should be very concerned that there was a 5 per cent increase 
in only four years. As well, the number of youths charged in 
violent incidents increased at a faster rate than the number of 
adults charged with crimes of violence. From 1988 to 1992 the 
average increase in adult violent crimes was 85 per cent whereas 
the average annual increase in youth violent crimes was 14 per 
cent. This demonstrates that as a society not only are we 
becoming more violent but that in particular more youths are 
becoming more violent more quickly.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I do thank you for the time allotted me today. 
I have appreciated very much, along with other members, the 
opportunity to speak on this matter.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It being 5.15 p.m. it is

	The House resumed from April 12 consideration of the 
motion.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to address this motion. I support it in 
principle, but I do have some concerns about the intent and the 
interpretation of the dates.
<P>
	The motion talks about a best-before date in consumption of 
food products and beverages and also an expiry date. This is an 
excellent approach because consumers should have a better 
understanding of the quality both in freshness and nutrition of 
the product that they are getting.
<P>
	However I wonder about the actual interpretation of the dates. 
In the presentation of the hon. member for Winnipeg North on 
April 12, reference was made to the expiry date being the date of 
the shelf life of the product in the shop. Further in the same 
presentation a reference was made to products that have or are 
considered to have a shelf life of 90 days or less having a 
best-before date on them. As there is one date on the package 
this could be confusing to consumers, are they actually looking 
at an expiry date or best-before or a ``what is the difference'' 
kind of thing, as the situation stands now.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	Food and beverages are perishable products and there 
definitely is a time factor involved as to the quality of the item. 
We need to identify that time factor in much more explicit terms 
through our dates, because there really is not any other way of 
establishing it that I can see.
<P>
	If we were to think of the expiry date as it is now as the shelf 
life date, we would be indicating to the proprietors of shops that 
the product must be sold prior to that date, and if not it comes off 
the shelf. On the other hand, if we think of the expiry date as the 
date on which the food product must be consumed, then we are 
setting up a situation concerning the date on which that product 
may get purchased. What happens to it when we get it home? 
Unless we request the manufacturer to start putting things on 
such as ``must be refrigerated when open'' or various other 
kinds of instructions for us, we need to have some sort of sense 
of what that date means.
<P>
	Does the expiry date mean shelf life in a shop, does the expiry 
date mean as long as the product stays in the package that it was 
originally packaged in but once opened the situation is different, 
or does the expiry date mean the date the product is actually 
consumed?
<P>
	Following that same kind of argument, if you look at the time 
of deterioration of a product being from the time it is packaged 
to the time it is consumed, then you can run into standards or 
criteria. Probably debates will arise out of what would constitute 
a valid expiry date.
<P>
	If we see a product that has the two dates on it and the expiry 
date indicates the shelf life date then the owner of a shop must 
sell it before that date or take it off the shelf. Then the 
best-before date would be slotted in there as an earlier time.
<P>
	Are we actually looking at two different situations now which 
could create a marketing system? For example, fresh bread and 
day old bread would be sold at a certain price to the best-before 
date and then at a different price from that date to the expiry 
date. The other thing that would happen from a marketing point 
of view would be to get into debates again as to what really is the 
best-before date and what is the criteria.
<P>
	The other thing that comes to mind on these dates is this. If the 
expiry date is not the shelf life date but the actual consumption 
date, then we are getting into a situation where there would be 
different criteria applicable to different types of food products. 
All these would have to be listed on the packaging to tell us how 
to store it once it is opened.
<P>
	The hon. member for Winnipeg North made reference to a tin 
of tomato sauce, I believe it was, that was put into the frig. Once 
it was opened the expiry date on that tin of tomato sauce was 
irrelevant. The sauce would be no good within three or four 
days. I believe the expiry date was longer, a year and a half or 
something like that.
<P>
	We are dealing with two different sorts of things here that 
have to be clearly addressed in this bill. What does the expiry 
date actually mean? Is it the shelf life in the shop, or is it the time 
that the product must be consumed? RIf it is the shelf life in the 
shop and we slot it in between packaging and the expiry date on 
the shelf life of best-before we may be running the possibility of 
setting up a marketing situation.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	The other possible ramification that comes to mind in relation 
to this approach to the dates would be the guarantee. I would 
think by having the expiry date, the shelf life and the 
best-before date spotted somewhere in between, we are actually 
asking manufacturers to guarantee that their product, if the 
packaging remains unchanged, will be the quality on the 
best-before day that it was on the packaging day. After that there 
would be a gradual deterioration occurring. It is still safe to 
consume between best-before and expiry and can be sold.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="4300"> 4300 </A></B>
<P>
	Those are some of the concerns I have in relation to the actual 
dates. I think we have to clarify them very specifically for the 
public. As it is now, I can go and look at a date on a particular 
product-
