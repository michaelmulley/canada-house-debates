an act respecting advertising services supplied by foreign 
periodical publishers, as reported (with amendment) from the 
committee; and of Group No. 1. 
<P><A NAME="LINK15"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to say a few words on 
this group of motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate coming from certain quarters has puzzled me somewhat. 
The Reform Party has been very strong in its opposition to this 
bill. It has been saying that we have no need to protect culture 
but only to promote it.  That is an interesting observation. I do 
not agree with it but it is a free country and people can hold 
the views they want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are debating the 21 amendments proposed by the Reform 
Party.  In my judgment those amendments delete every clause of 
the bill until nothing much is left.  The amendments to 
methodically delete every trace of the bill seem to reflect the 
Reform Party's approach to Canadian culture, not in terms of 
protecting but in terms of promoting.  In a very methodical and 
clinical way these amendments delete, delete, delete until the 
bill is emasculated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  That is mean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  My friend says it is mean.  Fair enough. 
I am just describing reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  And inaccurate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my friend says that this is 
an inaccurate comment.  I do not think it is inaccurate at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear from the content of this grouping that the essential 
components of Bill C-55 are being deleted.  It is fair to say 
that if we support the general thrust of Bill C-55, we will 
oppose these amendments put forward by the Reform Party.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also fair to say that in the budget plans put forward by 
my Reform Party friends, they would also essentially decimate the 
Department of Canadian Heritage.  I stand to be corrected but 
that is my interpretation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  That would be good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  I was sending up a trial balloon.  I 
could not believe that anyone would want to delete the heritage 
department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Absolutely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  The enthusiasm comes loud and clear and 
emphasizes the point.  I thank my Reform Party friends for the 
firming up of that position.  We are good buddies of course, but 
good buddies can have different views on things.  It is important 
that these positions be clarified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am actually dumbfounded.  When we think about the struggle 
this country has.  It is dwarfed by our friends to the south, the 
United States of America, and the synergy of business promotes 
their cultural industries.  It is an incredible force and from 
day one it has been a continuous battle on our front as Canadians 
to stand up to that onslaught. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look specifically at the film industry.  The American film 
giants have a stranglehold on the theatres across the country. 
Their control is a reality. Think of our struggling film 
industry.  I am proud to say it is now centred in British 
Columbia.  For a number of years the Canadian film industry was 
centred in central Canada but in the last few months, the size 
and the dynamism of the film industry are reflected in British 
Columbia.  We are proud of that.  Maybe it has something to do 
with the fact that we are a lot closer to Hollywood than other 
parts of Canada, I do not know.  Nevertheless, it is a continual 
struggle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has now been clarified beyond any doubt what these amendments 
do to Bill C-55, so I will conclude my remarks and look forward 
to addressing the next round of amendments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK16"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
to clarify, the hon. member for Kamloops suggested that the 
Reform Party would like to decimate the Department of Canadian 
Heritage. It is absolutely true that we want to cut substantially 
the waste in the kind of programs administered by the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that Canadian heritage and our cultural identity can 
better be protected by Canadians than by bureaucrats and 
politicians in Ottawa. We believe that free flag giveaways and 
handouts to interest groups seeking more cash are exactly what is 
wrong with this government. We think the huge subsidies to 
bloated crown corporations with their enormous waste and 
bureaucracy and middle management produce very little in terms of 
concrete results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those things are very low in the priorities of Canadians with 
respect to public spending. We do not apologize for a moment in 
saying that tax relief and health care for hard pressed Canadian 
families come as higher priorities to Canadians than grants and 
handouts to interest groups through Canadian heritage.  We are 
proud to be in line with the public's priorities in this respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stand today to speak to this latest folly by the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage.  She was a very effective member of the 
opposition but she really has become something of an 
embarrassment to the cabinet, the government and I submit, this 
parliament when it comes to the kind of extremism in policy she 
promotes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55 is an effort to draw Canada back decades into the era 
of protectionism, an era when countries looked inward instead of 
outward, an era that is reflective of the kind of campaign the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage led against the North American Free 
Trade Agreement in the 1988 election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberal Party sat on the opposition benches, it told 
Canadians that the free trade agreement would be the end of 
Canada, that it would be the end of our economic sovereignty and 
hence the end of our cultural and political sovereignty. 
I remember the cries of Chicken Little from the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage and her colleagues at that time suggesting that 
to allow free trade between these two great partners, Canada and 
the United States, would lead to economic disaster.  As we all 
know that has been proven to be completely specious.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one element driving Canadian economic growth over the past 
decade overwhelmingly has been our bilateral trade with the 
United States, a country with which we conduct some 80% of our 
trade, about $1 billion in trade a day.  Bill C-55 seeks to 
address one very small element of the huge $350 billion plus 
annual exchange between these two countries, the $400 million 
magazine advertising market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must tell members that since deciding to run and since being 
elected on June 2, 1997 I have spoken with literally thousands of 
people in my constituency as well as thousands of others outside 
my constituency, going door to door, meeting people at town hall 
meetings, listening to their concerns, speaking on open line 
radio shows, and I can say that of the thousands of conversations 
I have had with Canadians not a single one has ever suggested to 
me that they had the least bit of concern about the sovereignty 
of the Canadian magazine industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot recall a single ordinary Canadian outside the strange 
and twisted political hothouse of Ottawa and the Liberal caucus 
who suggested that we need to move decades backwards in economic 
policy to enshrine protectionism, as in this bill, in order to 
create restrictions on freedom of speech by penalizing American 
publications which accept Canadian advertising.  Not a single 
Canadian has said that to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at the priorities that we face as a country, priorities I 
hear about every single day from ordinary Canadians.  Priorities 
such as the need to put health care first in our public spending. 
Priorities such as the need for tax relief for working families. 
Priorities such as the need to democratize this institution to 
make Canada a more vibrant and representative democracy.  Those 
are the priorities Canadians are concerned with.  When I look at 
the government's legislative agenda I do not see those priorities 
addressed anywhere.  Instead I see Bill C-55 which deals with an 
obscure concern of a relatively small interest group of 
enterprises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I have heard from my constituents is outrage that this 
government is proceeding with this bill.  Calgary, which I 
represent in part, has a large and growing plastics industry. 
Our American friends, through their trade representative Madam 
Barshefsky, have indicated that the plastics industry in Canada 
could be subject to countervailing measures were we to adopt and 
implement the measures proposed before us in this bill.  What 
would that mean?  It could mean potentially devastating tariffs 
for the plastics industry and for people who reside in my 
constituency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not had a single one of my constituents call me to ask 
for this kind of protectionism.  But many have called to say 
“Please do not let this crazy effort by the minister of heritage 
destroy our jobs and impair our industry by provoking the 
Americans into a bilateral trade war”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is plainly and simply irresponsible.  The government 
claims it is necessary.  It throws twisted and completely 
inaccurate statistics to the effect that 80% of magazines on the 
stand are foreign magazines, implying therefore that the Canadian 
magazine industry is a marginal part of what is consumed by 
readers, which is completely irrelevant because 75% of all 
magazines read in Canada are received by controlled or paid 
circulation and about 94% of that segment of the market is 
Canadian owned.  That is not an issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But even if it were, I submit that it is a question of freedom. 
I suggest that we need in examining legislation to make reference 
to first principles.  The first principle that I would propose 
for all government action would be to maximize freedom; namely, 
liberty.  I know it is a dirty word.  It sounds like an American 
word to some of my friends opposite.  But I happen to think that 
liberty is a concept deeply rooted in our parliamentary heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think Canadians ought to have the freedom, the liberty, to 
choose which magazines they read, which publications and 
periodicals they patronize, without having the government decide 
for them which of those magazines is acceptable and in which 
format.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is really the classic 1960s retro, back to the past, 
protectionistic, inward looking, parochial liberalism which is 
rearing its ugly head in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the amendments put forward by my colleague from 
Dauphin—Swan River which seek to delete the various clauses of 
this bill because I propose that this is an assault on the 
freedom of Canadians.  Why do we not let Canadians decide for 
themselves what they want to read?  If a Canadian wants to order 
the split-run version of <I>Sports Illustrated</I>, why do we not 
let them buy and read it?  Where is the harm in that?  What 
damage is done to the Canadian cultural fabric by allowing people 
to exercise their free choices in deciding what they will consume 
in terms of reading materials?  I simply cannot grasp the 
rationale for this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To try to impose government sanctions essentially on those who 
would consume such materials, what we are doing is not only 
violating their freedom of expression, we are clearly threatening 
a significant portion of our economy and our economic growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard no compelling response from this government to the 
very serious threats of our American allies to respond through 
negative tariffs and countervailing measures if we proceed with 
this bill as the government now seems to be intent on doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that this bill is very similar in form and content to 
similar legislation which was passed in the last parliament but 
which was found by the World Trade Organization to be contrary to 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.  What I can say is 
that Canada as a trading country ought to be a champion of free 
trade.  We ought to clearly abide by the rulings of the World 
Trade Organization.  We ought not to be trying in bills such as 
this to skirt around the rulings of the WTO and other dispute 
resolution bodies.  By doing so we are impugning our credibility 
as a trading nation in the community of nations.  For that reason 
I think we are doing even greater international damage to our 
economic base as a trading and exporting nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all of those reasons I, on behalf of my constituents, will 
vigorously oppose this bill.  Notwithstanding the fact that the 
government is ramming it through this House with a closure motion 
today, I will oppose this bill and support the amendments of my 
colleague from Dauphin—Swan River. 
<P><A NAME="LINK17"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, when I 
first came to the House earlier today it was not my intent to 
actually speak to this particular bill.  However, I want to react 
to some of the comments made by the previous speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I actually heard a very impassioned plea concerning his support 
of the free trade agreement which first came into effect in 1989 
and which was expanded to the NAFTA in 1993.  He actually pointed 
out something that is very factual.  Canada is indeed an export 
driven economy.  We rely very much on our trade not only with the 
Americans but throughout the world for our economic prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also pointed out the benefits of free trade.  Before free 
trade we had about $80 billion to $90 billion worth of trade 
annually with the Americans.  Today, because of the success of 
free trade, we trade essentially $240 billion worth of 
commodities with the Americans on an annual basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agreement with the hon. member that free trade was great for 
this country in terms of our wealth and growth.  The amount of 
substantial growth which we have seen in this country over the 
last number of years has been largely due to our export driven, 
resource based economies, while our domestic economy continues to 
be stifled because our regime is so overly taxed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In both the FTA and NAFTA we were able to negotiate exemptions 
for culture. 
That is something which I believe Canadians fundamentally 
support. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1310"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is free trade about?  It is about the free exchange of 
commodities.  It is also about fair trade.  I believe that 
Canadians want to establish their own environmental standards, 
their own standards with respect to labour and their own cultural 
standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party is supporting Bill C-55 
because what it represents to us is free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish the hon. member had the opportunity to benefit from 
another history lesson which I will touch upon.  During the acid 
rain debate which culminated in 1987 we had to talk to the 
Americans about their industries and what they were doing with 
their sulphur dioxide emissions.  They were killing our lakes and 
rivers.  The Americans said that they were not so sure the 
science was conclusive.  We showed them the science.  We also 
showed them that they were hurting their northeastern states as 
well.  We negotiated with Ronald Reagan and George Bush, in a 
very aggressive fashion, an air quality arrangement so that 
Canada could protect its rivers and lakes with respect to free 
trade.  We knew it was the right thing to do.  Protecting 
Canadian culture as well is the right thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standpoint of the member who just spoke on free trade and 
who said that it was fundamental to the growth of this country, 
that if we did not have it we would not be as strong as we are 
right now, is a little ironic.  I also want to point out to the 
hon. member that in 1988 his party chose to run candidates 
primarily out west which potentially split our vote and we lost 
some candidates.  By splitting our vote the Reform Party almost 
sacrificed the free trade agreement.  This is an individual who 
now wants us to unite and come together.  It was his party's 
fundamental economic principles that actually attacked— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Ten years of Brian Mulroney. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Yes, the member mentions Brian 
Mulroney.  He actually just defended the free trade agreement 
brought in by former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also find it ironic that the member is now supporting free 
trade when his party jeopardized that particular arrangement.  He 
is backing off on picking out a party that now wants us to unite 
as opposed to not uniting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing I find a little ironic is that this individual 
was speaking about protection for the plastics industry.  We also 
know that this individual is not necessarily a strong supporter 
of the latex industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I want to point out is that Canadians want to be able to 
establish their own cultural, environmental and labour standards. 
We are an exporting nation.  Having said that, every time we get 
into a situation from a trade dispute perspective we cannot 
necessarily back off for the sake of backing off.  We have been 
assured by the Minister of Canadian Heritage and the Minister for 
International Trade that Bill C-55 is NAFTA friendly and that it 
will stand up with respect to the mechanisms under NAFTA.  That 
is why the Progressive Conservative Party is supporting it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK18"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a very real pleasure for me to stand in the House today to 
address the very important Bill C-55.  I do so on behalf of the 
residents of my area of Waterloo—Wellington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new measure will ensure that Canadian magazine publishers 
continue to have access to Canadian advertising revenues by 
regulating the advertising services supplied by foreign magazine 
publishers in Canada.  It is important to note that this bill is 
in keeping with Canada's longstanding policy of promoting 
Canadian culture and that it respects our international trade 
obligations.  We must have Canadian magazines that are vigorous 
and viable.  Unless Canadians stand up for Canadian culture, no 
one else will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For 40 years the federal government has supported our domestic 
magazine publishing industry.  That cultural policy has been a 
clear success.  Today there are more than 1,500 magazine titles 
published in Canada with revenues of over $1 billion.  Eighteen 
of the top twenty magazines available here are Canadian. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1315"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note at this time that the bill that is being 
proposed does not affect the content of magazines.  Publishers 
will continue to produce editorial content that they consider 
attractive to Canadians.  It does not affect the price of 
magazines, for example.  Canadians will continue to enjoy access 
to foreign and domestic magazines that are competitively priced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The advertising revenues generated through the supply of 
advertising services are critical for any magazine publisher. 
Such revenues generate more money than subscriptions or newsstand 
sales combined.  Without this key revenue source, editorial 
content cannot be created or photos purchased.  Canadian 
magazines simply cannot survive without sufficient advertising 
revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government wants to ensure that Canadians continue to have 
access to their own ideas, stories and information.  That is why 
Bill C-55 is important.  It will ensure that Canadian magazine 
publishers have access to the funds they need to stay healthy and 
provide an essential vehicle of cultural expression.  That is 
important to note. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act will prohibit foreign publishers from supplying 
advertising services directed primarily at the Canadian market to 
a Canadian advertiser.  We do not expect, for example, foreign 
publishers to respect the will of parliament and not contravene 
the legislation.  However we need the tools to enforce it if 
necessary, if in fact those expectations are met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These tools are flexible and give publishers a chance to comply 
with the law before more serious penalties are needed.  If a 
foreign publisher is suspected of contravening the law, the 
minister has the authority to send a letter requiring that the 
action be halted or to demand the foreign publisher to prove that 
no offence has taken place.  In other words, they can be let off 
with a warning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However failure to comply with a letter to stop would mean that 
the minister could turn to the courts.  The court can order the 
publisher then to stop publishing advertising services or other 
activities it deems are outside the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides for maximum fines to be levied against foreign 
publishers found by the courts to have contravened the law. Where 
an offence is committed by an individual there is a maximum fine 
as well.  The level of fines must be high enough to be an 
effective deterrent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This measure deals only with the supply of advertising services 
to Canadian advertisers.  It will not affect the importation of 
foreign magazines.  It will not affect any Canadian reader's 
ability to purchase foreign magazines at newsstands or through 
subscription.  The Canadian market will continue to be one of the 
most open in the world.  The act will not apply to foreign 
publishers now operating in Canada that maintain their current 
levels of activity.  Canadian magazine publishers and Canadian 
cultural groups support the bill, which is something we should 
all note. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada will defend its rights as a sovereign country to develop 
measures designed to support our domestic cultural expression. 
We have negotiated rights in international trade agreements and 
we will defend those rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55 does not violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms.  Bill C-55 does not violate the NAFTA or any other 
international trade obligations.  It has never been challenged 
before the WTO or in any other dispute settlement today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>American magazines cross our borders every day and Canadian 
magazines compete successfully for readers, despite our close 
proximity and common language.  This is because Canadian 
publishers produce original content for the Canadian market, 
content which is of interest to Canadians.  The bill is about the 
advertising services market and the massive cost advantages 
foreign publishers would enjoy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the legislation ensures that Canadians continue to have 
the freedom to express and enjoy a diversity of Canadian ideas, 
something we should all be proud of.  The new law will guarantee 
that Canadians will continue to have access to magazines which 
tell their stories to each other in their own voices.  It is in 
keeping with Canada's longstanding cultural policies and will 
ensure that Canadian magazine publishers have access to the funds 
they need to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members of the House to work for a speedy passage of 
Bill C-55.  It is certainly something Canadians want, deserve and 
expect.  We need to move expeditiously on it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak to the amendments to Bill C-55 brought forth by 
the member for Dauphin—Swan River.  I support these amendments 
because I oppose the bill for three good reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first is that on this issue the government and the heritage 
minister are wrong.  In fact they are breaking our trade 
agreements.  The United States in this case has every right to 
bring action against Canada if the legislation should proceed and 
be put into law.  Canada is wrong in this case.  The heritage 
minister is wrong and the government is wrong.  The United States 
would be completely justified in doing that.  That brings with it 
some very serious problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first problem is that it would do an awful lot of damage to 
businesses and to workers in this country.  We do not know 
exactly where the Americans would choose to hit.  I will talk a 
bit about that in just a couple of minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second reason I oppose the bill is that it is not supported 
by Canadians.  The very basic question is who supports the bill 
or the legislation.  When we ask that question we realize it is 
an awfully short list.  It pretty much boils down to a list of 
large publishing companies.  That is who supports the 
legislation.  It is not supported by most Canadians.  It is not 
even in the top 10 list of what Canadians feel are important 
issues to them right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that health care is at the top of the top 10 list as is 
tax fairness for families.  Why are we not debating legislation 
that would deal in a proper and meaningful way with either of 
those issues?   We would support those issues and legislation 
that would make things better in those areas, but we cannot 
support the legislation.  It just is not supported by Canadians 
for several reasons, but I think the main reason is that they 
recognize the harm that would be done to businesses and the 
number of jobs that would be killed in this country should the 
bill proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both major economic houses in the United States government have 
come out and very clearly said “If you pass this bill, if it 
becomes law, we will take action against Canadian industry, 
Canadian businesses”, and that will have an impact on Canadian 
workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a real problem with the legislation.  Members of the 
Reform Party are not willing to allow a piece of legislation to 
pass which is wrong, which is not supported by Canadians, and 
which is a real threat to the jobs of Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of parliament in the House who support the bill and do 
not support the amendments will have a lot of answering to do to 
the people in their constituencies and across the country when 
some of them lose their jobs because of action taken by the 
Americans, action which is proper, action which the Americans are 
completely justified to take under our trade deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a big problem with the bill.  I have a problem with the 
heritage minister bringing forth the legislation.  I will 
continue to oppose the legislation, no matter what squealing 
there is across the floor, and there is plenty of it right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could talk about the steel industry, one industry the 
Americans have indicated they might target.  The heritage 
minister is from Hamilton, the steel city.  I could take the 
attitude that if action were taken against steel workers and it 
hurt that minister, why should I feel bad about it?  In fact I 
would feel bad about it because we are talking about real people 
and real jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even to get at the heritage minister, to make her wear the shame 
that she should wear for bringing forth the legislation, I am not 
willing to sacrifice the workers of this country.  It would be a 
real shame and wrong if steel workers end up suffering for the 
actions of the heritage minister and the government in the bill. 
I cannot support it for that reason.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about the people back home.  I am a farmer and 
many of the people in my constituency are farmers.  Most people 
in the House from all parties understand the very serious 
situation that farmers are in right now.   Most of the harm and 
difficulties they are facing right now are not of their own 
making. Farmers, above people in any other industry, have done 
what they should have done to be able to deal with a downturn in 
their industry, but what they did not count on were unfair trade 
practices being aimed at them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what is killing their businesses and driving their 
commodity prices down more than anything else.  It is unfair 
trade practices in Europe.  Because of these unfair trade 
practices in Europe the United States has put in unfair subsidies 
to counter them.  We also see unfair import restrictions into 
Asian countries such as Korea and Japan.  Those too are causing 
severe harm to our farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my area probably 25% of hog farmers will go broke.  They 
either have gone out of business in the past three months and 
will in the next six months.  Over that nine month period 25% of 
hog farmers will be out of business.  Very little of the reason 
is of their own making.  Much of the reason is due to unfair 
trade on the part of other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same situation for alfalfa producers.  Subsidies in 
Spain, for example, are higher than the price that our alfalfa 
producers receive for their commodity.  That cannot be right. 
That is wrong and it is unfair.  These unfair trade practices 
have to end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For grain farmers in western Canada prices have been hit 
dramatically due to unfair trade practices in other countries. 
That is the reason.  It is not poor management.  It is not the 
inability to market their commodities well.  It is not that at 
all.  It is unfair trade practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just imagine that we add to the existing problems of our farmers 
action taken by the Americans due to this ridiculous piece of 
legislation the heritage minister is bringing forth. It seems 
like everyone in the Liberal government, in that caucus, is 
willing to support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am bitterly disappointed that members of the New Democratic 
Party and the Conservative Party will support this piece of 
legislation.  They are willing by supporting the bill to see our 
farmers suffer even more than they already have through reduced 
commodity prices and through borders being shut off.  They are 
willing to see that suffering for a piece of legislation which 
will help very few people.  Most of the people it would help are 
large publishers that do not need the help, quite frankly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand the minister's idea that Canadian publishers 
cannot do well in an open and free trading environment.  I have 
more confidence in them than that.  They have done well and they 
will continue to do well.  They do not need this piece of 
legislation.  If they did need it and if it were unfair, if it 
went against the trade deal, I still could not support it.  They 
would have to find a way of working through it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes it that much easier to oppose the bill and to support 
the amendments knowing that in fact they are not needed.  They 
will not help, quite frankly.  Those who support the bill are 
saying with their vote that they are willing to see steelworkers, 
people from other industries and farmers who have already been 
hit so hard by unfair trade take another hit.  I cannot allow 
that to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every member here had better consider the answering they will 
have to do to their people back home should they support the bill 
and their people become the ones targeted by the American trade 
action.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to enter the debate on Bill C-55. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will respond to some of the comments from the other side of 
the House.  We heard a comment about dictatorship.  This bill is 
about safeguarding Canadian magazines and it is about 
safeguarding our culture.  I am amazed at how the official 
opposition, standing alone, is once again trying to cave in to 
the Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a <I>National Post</I> article the House leader for the Reform 
Party talked about rolling over.  It seems to me that any rolling 
over is being done by the Reform Party. As soon as the Americans 
threaten something, the Reform Party wants to say “We surrender. 
Canadian culture is not important and the Canadian magazine 
industry is not important”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Reform members are the Gingriches or the Livingstons of the 
north, and they look to Ross Perot as an inspiration, then I can 
understand why some of their reasoning comes forward in the way 
they expound it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the great united alternative conference, the Reform 
Party declared no confidence in itself.  No confidence.  The 
opposition party declared no confidence in itself.  And it is 
finding out that the Conservative Party does not want to join in 
its effort to unite the right, to unite the party that wants to 
roll over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The member opposite is straying a long way from the subject. 
Because you have not taken him to correction, I assume you are 
now giving permission to following speakers to speak on any 
subject they want on this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I thought the hon. member was talking 
earlier in his remarks in relation to the position of the 
opposition on this bill.  He was using the expression “rolling 
over” which he just used so I assume there is a connection here 
that is going to become manifest in a moment.  Since he used the 
same expression, I had not thought of interrupting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I can understand the 
party opposite being upset when we talk about what it means to 
protect and promote culture in Canada.  There is no country in 
the world that faces the kind of challenges we face in Canada— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  I guess not.  They are not underneath a 
Liberal dictatorship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I can only ask the 
opposition members to quiet down a bit.  Once their time comes to 
speak, we will all listen to them with great interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no country in the world that has the unique challenges 
Canada has.  This bill speaks to that. 
That is why most of the parties in the House, with the exception 
of one, are supporting it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many years Canada has maintained a policy designed to 
provide Canadians with distinctive vehicles for cultural 
expression.  These measures have balanced the need to maintain a 
Canadian presence on our own screens, in books, music and 
magazines while welcoming foreign cultural products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today and possibly always we will be faced with a fundamental 
challenge in our cultural relations with the United States. 
Culture is the voice that defines us as a nation.  It is our 
heritage.  It is who we are. The U.S. sees culture as an 
entertainment commodity with a bottom line.  It is constantly 
trying to increase its market share across the globe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the Reform Party, the Liberal Party does not believe that 
our culture is for sale.  I will repeat that.  Unlike the Reform 
Party, we do not believe in selling out our culture and we do not 
believe in rolling over. Because of this essential difference, we 
never play on the same field.  We and other smaller countries 
must insist on making our own policies that maintain our cultural 
existence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said and despite our differences, the U.S. and Canada are 
neighbours, friends and each other's best trading partner.  Given 
the vast amount of trade in goods and services which move freely 
across our borders, only a small percentage are subject to 
occasional disputes. When trade irritants do arise, the two sides 
have traditionally sought to resolve their differences through 
bilateral dialogue or if necessary, by resorting to the dispute 
settlement provisions in trade agreements.  It is not rolling 
over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada will defend its rights as a sovereign country to develop 
measures designed to support our domestic cultural expression. We 
have negotiated rights in international trade agreements and we 
will defend these rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55 ensures that Canadian magazine publishers have fair 
access to Canadian advertising services revenues.  Without these 
revenues, they would be unable to provide readers with the broad 
range of Canadian publications currently available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55 does not violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms. Bill C-55 does not violate the NAFTA or our other 
international trade obligations.  It has never been challenged 
before the WTO or any other dispute settlement body. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55 does not impose additional restrictions on Canadian 
advertisers.  They will continue to enjoy the same opportunities 
they have always had, including access to international markets 
via foreign magazines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does not place restrictions on the content of magazines 
or of individual advertisements, or limit Canadians' access to 
foreign magazines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55 does not limit competition in the Canadian magazine 
industry.  In fact, Bill C-55 ensures the economic viability of 
the Canadian magazine industry and the preservation of over 7,000 
jobs for Canadian writers, artists, photographers, editors and 
art directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>U.S. magazines cross our border every day and Canadian magazines 
compete successfully for readers, despite our close proximity and 
common language.  This is because Canadian publishers produce 
original content for the Canadian market, content which is of 
interest to Canadians.  This bill is about the advertising 
services market and the massive cost advantages foreign 
publishers would enjoy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation ensures that Canadians continue to have the 
freedom to express and enjoy a diversity of Canadian ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main rationale why this House with the exception of the 
Reform Party is in support of this legislation is that the 
majority of parties in this House believe that Canadian culture 
is worth fighting for and that Canadian culture is worth 
preserving.

hear what this country is about from Hollywood and the United

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is interesting to sit in the House today and watch 
Liberal member after Liberal member stand and read a speech 
prepared for them by the office of the heritage minister. One 
thing that comes clear in listening to their speeches is that 
they do not understand what is at the very root of Bill C-55. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is this is a very profound infringement on the freedoms 
of Canadian business.  This government is taking one more huge 
step of intrusion into the freedom of choice that Canadian 
businesses have with respect to where to place their advertising 
dollars in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After this bill is passed, Canadian businesses will not be 
permitted to place advertising for Canadian readers in the media 
area of their choice. That is what Bill C-55 is doing.  It is 
saying that a Canadian free enterpriser, an entrepreneur, a 
business, whether selling goods or a service, cannot advertise in 
the Canadian split-run side of an American owned publishing 
company.  They cannot target Canadian consumers or a potential 
market of their product in a split-run Canadian edition of an 
American publisher.  That is what this bill is saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the official opposition came to the House in 1993. Time 
after time after time we have seen this government intrude 
further and further into the lives of Canadians, their family 
lives and business lives.  What is it about this government that 
thinks it should be in control of everything in this country? 
Where are the individual freedoms of Canadians? Where are the 
individual freedoms of Canadian business? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is saying there will be freedoms of expression 
and choice in this country under this Liberal government, but 
there never will be freedom of choice under this Liberal 
government.  That is what it is all about.  It is about 
dictatorship in the strongest form.  I cannot believe it. What 
happened to democracy?  What happened to freedom of choice in 
this country?  It is a joke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said the Liberal government shall be the protector of 
Canadian culture, the protector of Canadianism.  Let me give 
three examples of how the Liberals protect Canadianism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the government that threatened Canadians with fines 
and/or imprisonment if they dared to put on the census form that 
they were Canadian.  This is the very government that would not 
allow a Canadian citizen when asked what heritage they were to 
put the word Canadian.  People were threatened with criminal 
fines and sanctions.  Is that the great protector of Canadianism? 
The Liberals are a little silent now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This same government has so little faith in the patriotism of 
Canadians that it spent $20 million of taxpayers' dollars to buy 
Canadian flags to give away free in an attempt to buy patriotism 
from the Canadian people.  The Liberals have so little faith in 
the patriotism of Canadians that they thought they better give 
away some free Canadian flags at a cost of $20 million of 
taxpayers' money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of confidence in Canadianism is that from this Liberal 
government that now stands up as the great protector of 
Canadianism in this country? 
It is a hypocritical position for them to take in the strongest 
form.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This one is really the biggest joke of all.  This Liberal 
government, these great protectors of Canadian culture and 
heritage— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  Absolutely, protectors of Canadian 
culture.  That's right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  This is the same Liberal government, the 
same protectors of Canadian culture and heritage, that thought it 
would be a good idea to sell the rights to the RCMP logo to 
Disneyland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Goofy of the north.  That's what you boys 
are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  The proud heritage of the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police, their logo, their traditions which have been with 
this country for decades, which we are all proud of as 
Canadians, this Liberal government, these great protectors of 
Canadian culture and heritage, thought it would be a good idea to 
exploit that Canadian tradition, that Canadian heritage, for a 
few American dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How hypocritical can they get?  They stand today to call 
themselves the great protectors of Canadian culture.  They are so 
quiet over there now.  I think they are embarrassed.  They have 
been caught like a rat in their own trap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is about profound intrusion into the rights and freedoms of 
Canadians.  That is this government's version of how to run this 
country:  get its fingers into everything that goes on in this 
country through regulations, restrictions, sanctions, impositions 
or whatever it can do to control every single person to do its 
will or to do things its way.  That is the mandate of this 
government.  It has been since Liberal hero Pierre Trudeau came 
on the scene.  Unfortunately he is still obviously having an 
influence on this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Liberal government are these great protectors of 
Canadian democracy.  They should be called the great intruders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this bill Liberals are like people walking blindfolded into 
a den of snakes.  The heritage minister has set herself up as the 
czar of Canadian publishing, the czar of the industry.  She 
thinks that she can unilaterally put this restriction on and the 
Americans will just roll over and play dead.  Does the minister 
not realize for one minute the implications of what she is trying 
to do?  Mr. Speaker, you do not play baseball with a little 
tennis racket when you are playing against an American team.  You 
have to go in with a position of strength. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has just put Canada in a very tenuous position.  Do 
we think the Americans are going to roll over and play dead 
because of the minister's little whim?  There is not a hope.  We 
are going to see retaliation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the Americans should start with the plastics industry 
which comes right out of the riding of the Minister for 
International Trade.  That would be a good place for the 
Americans to start, and they have suggested it.  Perhaps they 
should start with the steel industry which comes right out of the 
riding of the Minister of Canadian Heritage.  That would be a 
good place to start.  It is going to happen.  Liberals are 
walking blindly into this predicament in which they are going to 
find themselves on the short end of the stick if they keep going 
down this path. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a sad day in Canada.  It is going to be a sad day for 
Canadian manufacturers who are going to find, no doubt, sanctions 
against their products entering the U.S.  Most of all, I think it 
is really a sad day for the freedoms of this country, the 
freedoms for which we fought two world wars to protect to ensure 
that this country would be a country where if we worked hard, if 
we were diligent, if we were prudent in our decisions, we could 
succeed.  But we have a government come along and say “That was 
just a myth.  As a matter of fact, the way we do things here 
under a Liberal government is the way we say it should be done”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When I heard about this bill the first thing that crossed my 
mind was how many in this Liberal government bought shares in the 
big Canadian publishing firms.  Is that the real reason?  Does 
the minister of heritage have a bunch of shares in Maclean Hunter 
or Rogers Communications or Time Warner?  Is that the reason? 
Maybe it is a personal monetary thing.  Maybe there is going to 
be a big payoff.  One usually finds that when people do very 
irrational and dictatorial things somewhere down the paper trail 
one finds a dollar amount attached to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has to assume that there are two reasons for this:  either 
there are a bunch of shares owned by this government, by these 
caucus members, in Canadian publishers, or the Canadian 
publishers are and are going to become very big contributors to 
the Liberal Party of Canada.  It is a joke.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I was very remiss in my presentation.  The information given to 
me regarding the census forms and the fines that could be imposed 
if one wrote Canadian was given to me by the member for 
Okanagan—Shuswap.

important bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As they spoke, I realized that either they did not really 
understand what they were talking about or there was some ill 
will on the other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, when one of our colleagues opposite says that the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I regret interrupting my good friend's presentation, as I am 
looking forward to hearing it, but when he refers to the members 
across the way he mentions presumably a certain party across the 
way.  I think he should clarify that in this crucial debate. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger:</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Kamloops, 
Thompson and Highland Valleys is absolutely correct.  My 
comments were directed to the Reform Party members, not to the 
other parties in opposition.  My apologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the exception of the Reform Party, everyone understands the 
importance of this bill and is prepared to support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to the Reform members, who claim the Americans 
would be entitled to all sorts of reprisals against Canada, this 
is absolutely false.  If they bothered to check, to read NAFTA 
or the agreements between us and the World Trade Organization, 
they would realize that the U.S. has no more right than any 
other country that is a party to these agreements to seek 
reprisals with impunity. 
They must adhere to certain prescribed standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Americans decide to go outside the rules they themselves 
have agreed to, that is a whole other story.  Once again, this 
situation gives an insight into the mentality of the official 
opposition, for when the Americans bark, the Reform hides out, 
of fear for their bite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard a number of Reform members claim that there would 
be reprisals in the area of agriculture.  Unfortunately, they 
tend to forget that, yes, it is true that agriculture is an 
essential sector of our economy, one that is vital to the 
well-being of our nation and its people.  No one can deny that 
fact, but it is also true that culture is of equal importance. 
One provides food for the body and the other for the spirit. 
Unfortunately, they tend to neglect the second aspect all too 
often. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> I am sorry to have to interrupt the hon. 
parliamentary secretary.  He will have seven minutes to finish 
his speech, after Oral Question Period.

Mr. Speaker, since 1996 the government has been posturing on

that allows youth who commit violent crimes including murder and 
aggravated assault to get away with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last May the justice minister released a discussion paper, a 
strategy for renewal of youth justice, and at the same time 
promised Canadians a new youth criminal justice act by the fall 
of 1998.

anniversary of the minister's discussion paper.  Lo and behold we 
hear that a new youth criminal justice act will be tabled on 
Thursday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In typical Liberal orchestration the new act will not be a 
universal code of conduct.  Rather, it will allow opting out by 
those provinces that feel these darling young offenders are 
simply misunderstood.  Those provinces and indeed most Canadians 
that wanted to lower the minimum age of young offenders from 10 
to 12 will also be disappointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is regrettable that after a decade of debate we will not get 
a universal code.  On Thursday the window of opportunity closes 
for another decade.  The government is afraid to stigmatize young 
offenders at the expense and safety of our communities.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, in my riding of Ahuntsic, I organized for the 
fourth time a breakfast to highlight the work of non-governmental 
organizations. I once again had an opportunity to see the 
exceptional work and the unconditional dedication of several 
organizations in my riding, such as Transit 24, 
Concertation-femmes, the Montreal Italian Women's Centre, 
Maji-Soi, the Maison buissonnière, Remue-ménage, Mono-vie Ahuntsic, 
Entraide Ahuntsic Nord et Sud and the Centre d'action bénévole 
Bordeaux-Cartierville, to name but a few. These groups are 
dedicated to improving the life and plight of women in my riding 
of Ahuntsic. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today women from Ahuntsic and all over the world, despite 
linguistic, cultural and political differences, will join 
together in celebration of the progress that women have made and 
recognize the further goals we need to achieve together.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we 
have been debating family tax fairness for days now but the 
Liberal excuse for rejecting our motion tomorrow is not exactly 
clear.  Evidently they have to vote against it just because the 
opposition brought it forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me read that motion again: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That... the federal tax system should be reformed to end 
discrimination against single income families with children. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How on earth does the Prime Minister justify forcing his MPs to 
vote against that? 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it makes no sense to pit families where parents work 
either in the home or work out of the home against each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is important is that the government recognizes the 
tremendous burden and responsibility that parents have raising 
children.  It recognized its responsibility to work with them, 
which is why we referred the matter to the House of Commons 
finance committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member to work constructively with the 
finance committee to that end. 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will tell you what pits families against each other.  It is that 
a dual income family and a single income family pay such 
discrepant tax rates, and it is the government that does it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has discriminated against parents who choose to 
have one of their spouses at home when they have children.  The 
government has opted in budget after budget to let this 
discrimination continue.  It is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know for those backbenchers who have the courage 
to vote against this discrimination tomorrow night, how he will 
force his MPs to continue to abandon their principles? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I would judge that the question is at best 
borderline.  I see the hon. minister is on her feet.  I will 
permit her to answer the question if she wants to. 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we are back again to a lack of 
understanding of the issue.  The hon. member across continues to 
talk about the income tax system as if it is the only thing that 
is applicable to the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the graph of a dual income earning family, in a 
dual income earning family someone has to take care of the 
children until there is a deduction for day care.  That puts the 
dual income earning family $4,400 behind the single income 
earning family. 
<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
talk about a lack of understanding.  I think we have seen it 
demonstrated right there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister can talk about graphs.  She can talk about $4,400. 
She can talk about child tax benefit all she likes, but the 
government knows that these people are paying 60% to 100% more in 
the tax system.  There is nothing fair about that.  The lack of 
understanding is on the government side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the minister, as soon as she sits down to 
hear the question, why the government will not make this fair in 
the tax system for families that choose to stay at home with 
their kids. 
<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a case of “don't 
confuse me with the facts; I mean I don't want to hear what the 
facts tell me”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This information does not come out of some ideology or some 
harebrained philosophy.  It comes out of looking very clearly at 
the cost of a dual income family going to work and the cost of a 
single income family going to work, where they are both earning 
the same money.  The facts speak for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member to do some math 101 on this.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, at the risk of further confusing the secretary of state, 
and I hope not to do that, our motion simply calls for an end to 
discrimination against single income two parent families. That is 
it.  There is nothing confusing about that.  What is the problem? 
I ask the government what is the problem with that? 
<P><A NAME="LINK73"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the problem is simple but not 
simplistic.  The problem is simply that income tax is not the 
only system families depend on for their income.  There are 
transfers to families in which the Government of Canada does not 
discriminate against single income families.  The child benefit 
is a major one that assists low income single income families 
headed by single mothers. 
<P><A NAME="LINK74"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would suggest the government tries to find 
complexities where it does not want to find solutions.  The fact 
is that single income two parent families are being penalized by 
this tax system. When is the finance minister going to end it? 
<P><A NAME="LINK75"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as the hon. member knows, we have a progressive tax 
system and we tax on the basis of individual income.  If the hon. 
member is against that, then she should stand in the House and 
say that people who earn $25,000 a year should pay more in income 
tax than those who earn $50,000.  If that is not her position, 
then she will go to the House of Commons finance committee and 
she will work constructively with members of the government who 
want to make sure that families who are raising children have a 
partner in the Canadian government.

is International Women's Day, a day set aside to reflect on the 
status of women in Canada and to examine our behaviour and 
actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, when it comes to women's issues, the most significant thing 
this government has done has been to abolish the Canadian 
Advisory Council on the Status of Women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the minister responsible for the status of women proud of 
having abolished this agency and does she think doing so has 
advanced the cause of women?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status

on International Women's Day, we should think about women, but it 
is not the only day. While we only get such questions from the 
opposition today, this government spends the other 364 days 
looking after policies that would increase gender equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to the hon. member's question, Status of Women 
Canada this year has spent over half a million dollars funding 22 
organizations within Quebec to assist them in encouraging 
equality for women in that province.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, if

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> They never have any answers.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women was created 
to advise the government on various women's issues and to

</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister realize that, by abolishing this council, the

<P><A NAME="LINK80"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status

the status of women was disbanded, an independent arm's length 
body was set up to fund research on women's issues.  Much of this 
research is critical analyses of the government's policies.  We 
have funded five such research initiatives in Quebec over the

what the government has done to support changes in the status in

</I></B></P><P align=left>The main decision the Secretary of State for the Status of Women 
has made was to reduce funding to women's groups.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status

funding.  The same amount of money is going into funding. We have 
changed the manner in which we fund organizations to the benefit 
of the province of Quebec and the women's organizations there 
which are getting more money than they used to get.  More groups 
are getting it.  Some groups have availed themselves of three

happening.  She might understand the real situation. What she 
has just said is utterly false. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind the Secretary of State for the Status of Women 
what she has already said.  She promised women's groups that 
there would be more funding available to help them.

<P><A NAME="LINK84"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status

is very difficult for the members across to understand is that 
issues that deal with women's equality do not only sit within 
Status of Women Canada.  Gender based analysis has made it 
possible for departments across this government to suddenly make 
women their number one priority.   In achieving it, Human 
Resources Development Canada has gone about trying to enhance the 
ability of women to get training.  The child tax benefit has 
assisted many of the poor, single income women with children so 
that they can afford to look after their children.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance has demonstrated some open-mindedness in 
recent days about finding ways to end the discrimination against 
stay at home parents.  He does not have to agree with everything 
the Reform Party is saying or for that matter what others may be 
saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the Minister of Finance, within the context of 
preserving the progressivity of the Canadian tax system, would he 
commit that by next year's budget he will find a way to end this 
discrimination? 
<P><A NAME="LINK87"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member knows that whether it be the care giver 
credit, the child tax credit, the national child tax benefit, we 
have worked on this problem consistently budget after budget.  As 
the minister said, this is not something we all of a sudden 
discovered, as has the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to prejudge what the House of Commons finance 
committee is going to do, but I certainly am going to say that I 
am sure that the hon. member, unlike perhaps the Reform Party, 
will work constructively with the House of Commons finance 
committee to see if we can come up with what is the proper 
answer. 
<P><A NAME="LINK88"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the problem with the system as it now stands is that there is no 
universal benefit that values parenting no matter how it takes 
place.  We have to honour all those choices.  We have talked 
about honouring the stay at home choice by ending the 
discrimination.  We also need to talk about honouring the choice 
of those who choose to, or perhaps those who do not have the 
choice and have to work outside the home. It seems to me the way 
to do that is to make the new social union framework work.  Test 
it by having the federal government show leadership and use the 
new social union to bring in a new national child care program. 
What about that? 
<P><A NAME="LINK89"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the child tax credit in fact does go to families, 
whether or not both parents are working in the home, or whether 
or not parents are working outside of the home.  The basic point 
that is raised by the hon. member, which is the responsibility of 
government to work in partnership in terms of the raising of 
children and recognizing that burden and that responsibility, is 
a point which is well taken.

keep it that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has denied them pay equity.  It froze their wages for six

service only gets $9,600 a year from her pension.  The government

the Liberal government was the first government to introduce a

it. We have already paid out over a billion dollars to make sure 
that pay equity was implemented in the federal system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have in our law extended pay equity to federally legislated

management of the pension fund and it was ready to introduce a

the risk, to share the risk with the employer in a future pension 
fund and I have left on the table the possibility of having joint

Liverpool, Nova Scotia.  Considering ACOA's recent losses of $2 
million in two Bathurst textile companies, can the minister 
responsible for human resources development explain why his 
department would fund a company that will compete directly with 
the long established Nova Scotia clothing outfit, Frenchy's, 
which presently employs over 125 people across Nova Scotia and 
New Brunswick?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Question No. 164—<B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the Department of Human Resources Development provide 
clarification on a recent incident in one of its offices, in St. 
Clair, British Columbia, where a francophone employee was 
apparently prevented from replying in French to a francophone 
client? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> The Government of Canada strongly supports 
the rights of francophones outside Quebec to get service in their 
own language, where there is a population that needs it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Human Resources Development Canada, HRDC, began to 
consolidate its offices in 1997, it consulted with the Vancouver 
community to see where and how they would like the department to 
set up a bilingual office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A review of the most appropriate location for the provision of 
bilingual services was also needed.  A town hall meeting was held 
in French to provide an opportunity for the francophone community 
to provide input on service consolidation plans and especially 
which office shold be responsible for providing bilingual 
services.  Invitations were extended to all francophone 
associations in the greater Vancouver area and efforts were made 
to ensure participants were representatives of all HRDC's client 
groups. The Sinclair office's bilingual staff were also invited. 
Due to the length of time that has elapsed since the meeting was 
held, it is not known whether staf from the Sinclair office were in 
attendance.  However, all participants attending the town hall 
meeting expressed the preference that bilingual services should 
be provided in a full service Human Resources Centre of Canada, 
HRCC, and their choice was HRCC Vancouver.  Also, a study of the 
demographics of the francophone population clearly showed that 
the majority of francophones were living in the HRCC Vancouver 
area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on the process outlined above, bilingual service was 
trasferred to HRCC Vancouver in October 1997.  Advertisements 
were placed in the local French paper and on radio station 
CBUF-FM to communicate where bilingual service was available.  A 
letter was also sent to all francophone clients to inform them of 
this move. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are currently 20 points of service designated as bilingual 
service sites in British Columbia.  Nine of these are in 
Vancouver.  Of the nine, there is only one HRCC which is fully 
bilingual.  Along with the one bilingual HRCC in Vancouver, the 
infocentres, Labour Canada, income security and regional offices 
are designated bilingual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of the Sinclair office, even though the office is 
designated unilingual English, employees are encouraged by 
management to respond in the language of the client when the need 
arises.  This ensures that quality services are offered to all 
clients.  It is HRDC's policy to designate bilingual positions in 
unilingual offices if the work entails services that are to be 
provided in both languages.  This policy is in accordance with 
official languages regulations.  In the incident mentioned by 
Radio Canada, this policy was regrettably not followed.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>FOREIGN PUBLISHERS ADVERTISING SERVICES ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK212">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill C-55, an act respecting 
advertising services supplied by foreign periodical publishers, 
as reported (with amendment) from the committee; and of Group No. 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The astute and erudite hon. member for 
Ottawa—Vanier had seven minutes remaining. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, prior to Oral Question 
Period, I was speaking to the bill under consideration, Bill 
C-55, an act to protect the Canadian periodical industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned that, contrary to what certain members of the Reform 
Party were saying, our neighbours to the south, the Americans, 
do not have the right, with impunity as our colleagues were 
indicating, to impose sanctions or to retaliate, because they 
too are party to international trade agreements, such as NAFTA 
and the WTO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are rules and procedures, and if the Americans wanted to 
retaliate, they too would have to comply, despite what the 
Reform Party members are saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also mentioned that we on the government side are not prepared 
to hand certain sectors of our industry priority over others. 
The government does not share the opinion of some members of the 
official opposition who do not consider Canadian culture worth 
fighting for.  Both agriculture, which is vital to our economy, 
as I mentioned, and Canada's culture, which is vital to the 
well-being of our psyche, must be protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying, one feeds the body, the other, the mind. 
Unfortunately, our Reform colleagues are not quite as concerned 
as they might be about the food for the mind that Canada's 
culture represents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to take them up on another mistaken notion. 
Two weeks ago, with colleagues from the Standing Committee on 
Canadian Heritage, I visited Thunder Bay and the western cities 
of Winnipeg, Saskatoon, Edmonton, Vancouver and White Horse.  My 
colleague, who is the official opposition critic, toured the 
eastern part of the country with the other half of the standing 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the western leg of the trip, the Canadian public was very 
outspoken and supportive in its comments about the need for this 
bill, once again contrary to what Reform Party members have 
said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians generally are very aware of the importance of having 
strong Canadian cultural industries that are able to compete 
with other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to another point that our colleagues are unable 
or perhaps unwilling to understand. 
We are not talking about undue protection.  We are talking about 
drawing up ground rules that are fair to everyone. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not here suggesting that our magazine industry cannot 
compete, as members of the Reform Party might be suggesting.  It 
is not that at all.  It can and has done so over the last 30 
years.  Our industry has developed quite well because we have had 
a level playing field in place and we insist on maintaining such 
a level playing field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not level when one competitor has an incredible advantage 
of having overhead costs that 70% less than the overhead costs of 
the Canadian publishers.  That is the essence of a split-run 
edition.  They cover the costs of preparing the edition.  They 
come into a country.  They take out the pages that carry ads and 
which are replaced by other ads.  They can undercut the market 
greatly without necessarily adding anything of any significance 
or value to the Canadian cultural aspect of what these people are 
trying to do.  In most instances that is what has happened. It is 
not a fair or level playing field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under a fair and equitable competitive system our magazine 
industry will compete with any other in the world.  It is not 
fair if its competitors have a 70% overhead cost advantage.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing the Reform Party seems to forget is that it is 
indeed a unique relationship in terms of Canada and the U.S. and 
the magazine industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eighty to ninety per cent of the magazines exported by our 
American neighbours are exported in one country only, Canada, 
because of the proximity and in a number of provinces similarity 
of language.  Therefore there is a great deal of affinity in the 
market. That does not seem to satisfy them.  They want more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They control over 50% of our market.  They have 80% of our shelf 
space.  It is not enough.  They want more. When the Americans say 
“if you do this we will do that so back off”,  Reformers say 
“we do not want to protect, we will back off and the 6,000 
people who happen to work in this industry, too bad for them, so 
sorry, so sad, we are not prepared to do that”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will stand by the magazine industry in this country as we 
have in the past.  Members think this bill is exclusively from 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage.  It is not.  Do not make that 
mistake.  It is a bill supported by the government and members on 
this side of the House and we will see soon enough on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  And three other parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger:</B>  Thank you to my colleague, and three 
other parties on the other side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude with a question.  I wish anyone who has thought about 
this debate, this bill, this issue would ask themselves this 
question and answer it fair and honestly.  It is a very simply 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Which foreign publication, which American magazine, is not 
allowed into this country?  I dare any member of the House to 
find a foreign or an American publication to be more precise that 
is not allowed in this country. They will not.  It is a totally 
open market.  We are not restricting any American publication or 
magazine from coming into the country.  Canadians can buy any 
American magazine they wish to buy on almost any news stand and 
yet that seems not to be good enough for the members opposite. 
Why? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Before we resume debate I wonder if 
we could now revert, with the consent of the House, to 
applications for emergency debate so that I can deal with a 
matter raised by the hon. member for Dauphin—Swan River.  Is 
that agreed?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been hearing the Reform Party trying to strike fear into 
the hearts of Canadians that if we have the temerity or the gall 
to do anything to protect sovereignty we will be smashed by our 
American neighbours, that tanks are going to roll across the 
border and devastate our steel industry and our plastic industry 
as if we are supposed to cower at this great force, that we do 
not have the wherewithal to look after industries that we care 
about; not only industries we care about but our Canadian 
cultural sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked for an opportunity to speak to this today because I have 
always seen myself as a fiercely proud Canadian nationalist, 
almost too far that way sometimes I have been told. I am very 
proud and I really regret the fact that this country has moved 
away from some of the positions we used to take in terms of 
looking after Canadian industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been reading a book recently, <I>1967</I>, by Pierre 
Berton.  He talks about Canada as it was in 1967 and the 
government of the day. It talks about leaders of that time, 
politicians like Walter and Duncan Gordon and Paul Martin Sr., 
people willing to take real steps to something about the foreign 
takeover of our industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time it was not seen as frivolous or silly to talk about 
limiting the amount of foreign ownership of certain industries 
that were key to Canadians.  I was very pleased to see those 
moves in those days.  I was too young at that time to really 
appreciate them.  Certainly in recent years, as we see that 
school of thought slipping away, I am looking back with some 
regret that we have somehow lost that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I hear a debate like we heard today that we cannot make a 
move as minor and insignificant as trying to look after this one 
small aspect of our cultural and artistic industry, if we cannot 
make a move like Bill C-55 without worrying about being squashed 
like a grape by this steamroller to the south of us, we really 
have lost our ability to chart our own destiny as a country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55 is not a broad sweeping interference with the free 
market.  For those hon. members who really advocate the free 
market and the free hand of the market, et cetera, this is not an 
interference of that ability for industries to conduct 
themselves.  This is not state intervention in any way that will 
offend anyone.  It is a very minor detail that recognizes that 
arts and culture are as much of an industry and as much of an 
engine for economic growth as any of the other smokestack 
industries or the high tech industries we are fond of promoting 
and encouraging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Kamloops spoke very well about industries like 
the film industry and how we would be crazy not to do all we can 
to cultivate and nurture that burgeoning new industry in B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The film industry in Manitoba now is a $100 million a year 
industry.  The member for Winnipeg North—St. Paul can testify to 
this.  Two years ago it was $13 million a year.  Last year it was 
$50 million and this year it is $100 million, with a new sound 
stage being built and new crews being trained to push that limit 
even further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the kind of thing, if we really want to talk about 
growing the economic base in areas where we have real opportunity 
and real potential, the arts, culture and heritage, that we 
cannot ignore. We heard about jobs being bantered about here and 
possible job loss if we take the step of Bill C-55. What about 
jobs lost or lost opportunity if we do not act in this regard? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Community colleges in British Columbia have started 22 new 
apprenticeship programs in the film industry.  That is brand new. 
That is a whole new growth area, not only new jobs but new 
training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We always used to wonder what a gaffer does.  At the end of 
movies when the credits roll we see best boy, gaffer, key grip 
and jobs like that. Those are all apprenticeable trades, 
legitimate career positions, as are the electricians, the 
carpenters, the set designers and the lighting guys. 
It is a huge growth area.  B.C. is looking forward in that regard 
and is welcoming the jobs which go along with that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have been hearing people talk about more than Bill C-55 
is free trade.  Our party is not crazy about free trade.  We were 
cautious about going into liberalized trade agreements that may— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  You were fearmongering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  A member just said that we were 
fearmongering about free trade.  In fact, our predictions came 
true.  It is not fearmongering any more.  It is like slanderous 
and slander when it is the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In actual fact, our worst fears were realized. We watched half a 
million good jobs flow south of the border.  We heard that great 
flushing sound Ross Perot used to talk about.  Whoosh, the jobs 
went right past us.  We were not wrong about that.  We were 
absolutely right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately we intervened recently on the MAI. Everybody in this 
room except for our party, this whole House of Commons was 
willing to walk blindly into the new multilateral agreement on 
investment. Thank goodness somebody did sound the alarm on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that the dust has settled on that liberalized trade 
agreement called the MAI, we know what the real motivation was. 
The people who were pushing the MAI said there is a surplus of 
democracy in the world today that is interfering with the free 
movement of capital. The global capitalists were worried about a 
surplus of democracy, meaning that people like us, those of us in 
this House are a nuisance and interfere with corporations doing 
exactly what they want to do when they want to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly what we have heard today from the Reform Party. 
Reform members have been saying that this House does not have the 
right to make rules to look after our own well-being because the 
corporate sector in the United States will punish us. I am not 
prepared to accept that.  As a fiercely proud Canadian 
nationalist, I will never accept that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our duty to do all we can to take charge of our own 
destiny and to do what we think is right in this country, by 
majority vote.  Not everybody will always agree all the time with 
the right course to take. In this example, Bill C-55, that is 
pretty clear.  Four parties out of five, and 250 votes out of 301 
say the right thing to do is to protect our cultural sovereignty, 
to protect our arts and culture community, our heritage 
industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is more interested in the Heritage Front than 
it is in the heritage industry.  The only time I ever hear of 
heritage associated with the Reform Party is by some of its 
members who are leaders in the Heritage Front. It has nothing to 
do with arts and culture, does it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I would suggest that clearly untrue and slanderous 
allegations are unparliamentary.  I ask you to have the member 
withdraw those remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  It sounds as though it is a matter 
for debate.  I think the member has not said any slanderous thing 
that I have heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have heard a lot about 
free trade agreements and fearmongering about the Americans 
beating us up if we pass Bill C-55.  We have not heard very much 
about the merits of Bill C-55 although the parliamentary 
secretary has just done a pretty good job to try to outline those 
in a fairly balanced way.  That is the only balance I have heard 
today in listening to the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our own critic in this area, the member for Dartmouth, clearly 
pointed out that the NDP supports Bill C-55. She was quite clear 
that she would not accept the Reform Party amendments. Her 
recommendations to us were to reject the Reform Party amendments 
because they simply dismantle Bill C-55 piece by piece by piece. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are proud of our Canadian culture and our Canadian 
heritage, if we are fiercely proud Canadian nationalists as 
everybody in this room had better be, then we should be passing 
Bill C-55 and we should be voting down any amendments to the 
contrary such as those put forward by the Reform Party.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale—High Park, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am delighted to rise in the House today in support of 
Bill C-55. I would encourage all of my colleagues in the House of 
Commons to support this bill unanimously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55 sustains an important cultural objective that has been 
in place for three decades: to ensure the availability of 
information, stories and images in the magazine sector that 
reflect and inform Canadian society. Bill C-55 delivers on this 
objective by preventing unfair competition in our advertising 
services market which, if left unchecked, would put the Canadian 
publishers that provide Canadian stories to Canadian readers out 
of business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If U.S. publishers could enter our advertising market, which 
they have not had access to for over three decades, they would 
dump advertising services.  This is because they would have 
virtually no costs in that market, would achieve profit margins 
of up to 80% and would therefore heavily discount advertising 
rates in order to capture market share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian manufacturers of goods, including those in sectors that 
have been identified as potential targets of U.S. retaliation, 
have remedies available to them to prevent dumping.  Canadian 
steel producers for example regularly exercise their rights under 
trade agreements by bringing anti-dumping cases.  Magazine 
publishers do not have that option because so far there are no 
dumping rules for services. But Canada does have rights under our 
trade agreements to take measures in support of cultural 
industries and to regulate access to our advertising market in 
the magazine sector, the only available means to prevent unfair 
competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February at a luncheon of the Broadcast Executive Society, 
Michael McCabe, president and chief executive officer of the 
Canadian Association of Broadcasters, called for support of the 
foreign publishers advertising services act.  Mr. McCabe's 
comments about the current U.S. assault of this bill merits 
repeating.  Mr. McCabe stated as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current American assault on the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage's efforts to sustain a Canadian magazine industry is 
just the leading edge of a broader assault to come.  That's why 
it's so important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be able to maintain in this country a set of cultural 
policies that ensure that we can tell our own stories to our own 
people, and to others.  The American proposition that it's just 
business and there should be a level playing field is a myth—and 
a dangerous myth—given their size and market power. We, and 
other small countries, have to insist on the freedom to make the 
policies we need, to support our own cultural existence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Magazines are just the beginning.  We can't fail at this.  If we 
do, it will damage not only our businesses, but our country. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S. claims that Bill C-55 is protectionist and precludes 
its cultural products from entering Canadian markets.  That is 
not the case at all.  In fact, foreign competition dominates the 
Canadian cultural market. According to the report of the Cultural 
Industries Sectoral Advisory Group on International Trade which 
was released on February 17, 1999, foreign firms and products 
account for the following: 45% of book sales in Canada; 81% 
of English language consumer magazines on Canadian newsstands 
and over 63% of magazine circulation revenue; 79%, or over $910 
million, of the retail sales of tapes, CDs, concerts, merchandise 
and sheet music; 85%, or $165 million, of the revenues from film 
distribution in Canada; and between 94% and 97% of screen time in 
Canadian theatres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While Canada believes its citizens should have access to foreign 
cultural goods, the government also recognizes that we need space 
for our own voice.  Our culture is an integral part of who we 
are.  Sharing stories and ideas and creating a better 
understanding among people in Canada is an effective way to build 
a healthy multicultural society.  The government as steward of 
our national identity has a duty to promote cultural activities 
that help build a sense of community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cultural products are not simply commodities that can be 
packaged and sold.  Cultural goods and services are different 
from the goods and services of other industries and should be 
treated differently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, Canada is not alone in its efforts to promote culture 
and cultural industries. 
Like Canada, many countries provide direct support for their 
cultural industries.

</I></B></P><P align=left>France's Centre National de la Cinématographie uses special 
cinema taxes to support film production.  Any producer of

programs have been broadcast by French television automatically 
receives a grant from the country's film and television industry

video rentals as well as state funds to make film production 
grants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interestingly enough, the United States directly supports 
everything from literature to drama through the National 
Endowment for the Arts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are at a critical juncture in the history of magazine 
publishing in Canada as we face the choice between caving in to 
American pressure tactics or maintaining our right to continue 
the longstanding policy of ensuring that Canadians can choose to 
read their own magazines as well as other magazines from around 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Magazine publishing has never been an easy business in Canada 
even without the unfair competition of split-run editions of 
American magazines.  The scale of our market, the competition for 
readers from American magazines, and the negative impact on our 
advertising revenues of the spillover advertising that Canadians 
see in American magazines have all meant that Canadian publishers 
will survive only if they produce quality magazines that 
Canadians want to read and at the same time operate at peak 
efficiency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian magazine publishers have called on this government to 
provide an environment of fair competition, a level playing field 
so they can continue to have the incentive to invest.  Fair 
competition cannot exist when our split-run competitors have 
costs less than half of ours and no Canadian content. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55 is the only measure that has been identified that is 
effective in preventing unfair split-run competition and also is 
consistent with our trade agreements.  Bill C-55 does not violate 
the NAFTA or any other international trade obligation. It has 
never been challenged before the WTO or any other dispute 
settlement body.  Bill C-55 is entirely consistent with our trade 
obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55 regulates foreign access to the Canadian magazine 
advertising services market.  It is a services measure.  It does 
not apply to or affect imports of magazines.  As a services 
measure, it falls under the GATS.  Canada did not offer and the 
U.S. did not obtain or pay for access to our advertising services 
market in the negotiation of the GATS.  Canada therefore has no 
obligations and the U.S. has no rights vis-à-vis access to the 
market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>U.S. threats of retaliation under NAFTA show that it does not 
have a legal case to make.  If it did, it would use the WTO 
rules, where it started the dispute in the first place, to 
challenge Bill C-55. Moreover, under NAFTA the United States 
cannot forum shop.  The provision for retaliation under the 
cultural exemption applies only if the measure would violate an 
obligation in the FTA, if not for the exemption.  No such 
obligation exists. The level of retaliation the U.S. has 
threatened is equally illegitimate.  The fact that Canada's 
previous magazine measures were ruled inconsistent with the GATT 
does not mean the new measure would also be ruled inconsistent. 
Bill C-55 is completely different from the previous measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to conclude with a quote from a recent bulletin of 
the Canadian Conference of the Arts which reviewed the importance 
of Bill C-55.  “We give the last word to President Bill Clinton: 
We must enforce our trade laws when imports unlawfully flood our 
nation”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, with 
everything I have heard today, I must say that I endorse free 
trade, not liberalized trade. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT38"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT38"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1545

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have come to know in my short time here in the House of 
Commons, and in my time before that, that it is actually 
liberalized trade, not free trade.  Free and liberalized are not 
the same thing at all.  Liberalized means regulated.  Liberalized 
means subsidized.  Liberalized means tampered with and that is 
exactly what we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the folks back home I want to describe what is going on 
today.  We are debating Bill C-55.  It is the heritage minister's 
attempt to try to control freedom of speech, freedom of 
advertising with relation to freedom of speech, and to invite 
U.S. retaliation against Canadian industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 21 clauses in this bill.  My Reform colleague has 
proposed 21 amendments which would delete each one of the clauses 
with regard to the amendments and the changes and whatnot 
involved with Bill C-55. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On top of that, there is an amendment that has recently been 
added by the minister that would give the minister the power to 
decide when the bill will take effect.  We all know that is 
redundant because the cabinet already decides when a bill will be 
proclaimed in law.  What the heritage minister indeed is doing in 
this particular example is buying herself time because the 
government knows this will result in retaliation and it will be 
bad for other industries in Canada.  As a result, the government 
is putting an eject button into its own legislation because it 
wants to quickly ram it through the House and then potentially be 
able to just eject this thing and have the minister stall on it 
so it is not proclaimed.  The government already recognizes that 
it is bad legislation.  I do not know why it is defending it 
today.  I guess it is a face saving measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only do I believe in free trade as opposed to liberalized 
trade, but I also believe in free speech as opposed to Liberal 
speech and talking points, especially those prepared by the 
minister and what the backbenchers on the Liberal side are 
reading today.  I think that Canadian taxpayers and citizens 
deserve to know more, and we should have no more Bill C-55. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about some of the problems that Bill C-55 can bring 
to Canada.  U.S. retaliation is one of the things that Bill C-55 
can bring.  I would like to quote a few statistics and articles 
that have been done on this particular issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is $1 billion of trade that is done every day between 
Canada and the United States.  It is the longest undefended 
border in the world.  We have had a pretty good relationship, 
aside from the war of 1812, but then they were not really our 
troops, they were British troops at the time.  Canada was formed 
in 1867, so it was a bit before our time.  However, we have a 
pretty good relationship with the United States in terms of 
trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55 would restrict trade.  We have already signed an 
agreement stating that we would not restrict trade.  It was 
called the North American Free Trade Agreement.  To boot, there 
is also the World Trade Organization and some of the agreements 
we have made under that auspices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been precedents that have already been set within 
those agreements which Bill C-55 would violate.  Just to prove 
that point, both parties on the two most powerful U.S. 
congressional committees are backing the U.S. trade 
representative's threat of retaliation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Across the border to the south we have the two most powerful 
committees to deal with, as well as both parties and a 
representative of the White House all telling us that if Bill 
C-55 goes through there will be retaliation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what we are talking about in terms of the numbers.  It 
is designed to address about $400 million per year in the 
magazine advertising market.  In the big picture we have $400 
million over an entire year concerning magazine advertising. 
There is $1 billion worth of trade per day between our two 
countries.  Why, hon. members ask, for $400 million and some 
smaller fraction of that to be affected by Bill C-55 would we 
look to jeopardize $365 billion worth of trade? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Roughly that means that for one-one-thousandth of the amount of 
trade we do with the United States we would jeopardize our 
trading relationship over something that the World Trade 
Organization and the North American Free Trade Agreement have 
already laid out for us in precedent.  It will not stand in terms 
of a point of law.  It does not make a lot of sense, does it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has the U.S. trade representative let us know they would be 
potentially looking at in terms of retaliation?  They are talking 
about steel.  Would that not be an interesting scenario?  How 
fitting it would be for the member from Hamilton who is 
advocating the changes to Bill C-55 to have steel hit on by the 
U.S. in terms of trade retaliation.  The workers in her own 
riding, people who are steelworkers in Hamilton, would be 
affected by that trade retaliation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want that and neither does our heritage minister. 
Therefore I ask her today to either substantially change this 
bill or to get rid of it altogether. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If U.S. representatives decide to retaliate it would only be 
fitting that they do so in an industry that is directly related 
as closely as possible to the heritage minister's own riding.  I 
hope that does not happen.  That is why I hope she repeals this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other commodities which are under threat are textiles, plastics, 
lumber and wheat.  Those are all big commodities and Canada is an 
export nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would we want to risk our reputation internationally as an 
advocate of rules based trade in order to satisfy the whims of 
our heritage minister?  I do not know why we would want to do 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope those people in the Liberal caucus will stand up so this 
does not happen.  I hope that when they ram this bill through 
they will make sure that the eject button they are putting into 
clause 22 is used and this thing gets shelved so that 
steelworkers in Hamilton do not lose their jobs because of the 
whims of their own representative in the House of Commons.  That 
is what I hope happens.  I wish they would repeal it altogether. 
As a stopgap measure, because they are not willing to admit their 
own abuses of trade practices and rules based trade, I hope they 
have the decency at least to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifty per cent of the magazines purchased in Canada are foreign. 
That is another statistic I will throw into the debate.  It is 
important to temper this whole thing with an understanding of 
what is going to be affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is all about an unreasonable limit on fundamental freedoms, 
on freedom of speech and freedom of the press.  It is also a 
violation of property rights and freedom of contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to touch on some other things that this government 
has been going along with in terms of violation of freedom of 
speech, violation of property rights and violation of freedom of 
contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The press has not been in love with the Liberal government of 
late because of the whole idea of freedom of speech.  It goes 
back further than this, but let me list a few examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had APEC.  When the Prime Minister and his crew were going 
after Terry Milewski and the CBC, the press were not impressed. 
That is only fair because the Prime Minister was trying to stifle 
freedom of expression and freedom of speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have the CRTC which suppresses the Canadian identity 
from coast to coast to coast in terms of its finagling and 
shutting down competition in the cable industry.  I could go on 
to name a few others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most egregious violations this government has thought 
of yet with regard to the violation of freedom of speech has been 
the election gag laws.  If there were third parties who wanted to 
advocate a position or publish polls during an election, this 
government would impose fines or jail them.  That is another way 
this Liberal government does not like freedom of speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also uses taxpayers' money on propaganda.  It 
loves spending money in places where it should not be spent to 
advocate how good the government is.  This goes to show how out 
of touch and elitist this government is when it comes to freedom 
of speech.  It allows it only when it serves its own ends.  Shame 
on it.  It should repeal Bill C-55.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is interesting to hear some of the justification that members 
opposite seem to be trying to put forward to justify why they are 
actually voting against an industry that, by the member's own 
admission, generates $400 million in revenue.  They trivialize 
that.  They do not seem to think that is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the industry employs over 7,000 people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also heard the argument that somehow Bill C-55 is 
against freedom of speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will deal with the first issue, the accusations and comments 
about closure, that somehow this government in a heavy-handed way 
is shutting down debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous speaker stated that there are 21 clauses in this 
bill and then went on to say that his critic had put forward 21 
amendments which would basically cancel out each one of the 
clauses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does that sound like an attempt to be constructive?  Does that 
sound like they are putting forward alternative suggestions? 
There are 21 clauses and 21 amendments which are contrary to the 
entire intent of the bill.  It is clearly nothing more than an 
attempt by the Reform Party to filibuster, to try to stall 
instead of allowing for debate to take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give the House an example.  This is a quote directly from 
the government House leader in talking about Reform:  “Do they 
think this is serious debate or is it stalling?”  He went on to 
say:  “I think most Canadians would agree that 50 speeches and 
to still be on clause 1 constitutes stalling”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite clearly they are not interested in getting into why the 
Canadian parliament is at the point where it is actually passing 
a law that would restrict the open flow of advertising.  Why 
would we want to do that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They throw up the threat that the United States is going to 
retaliate, as if we should just tuck our nationalistic tails 
between our legs and go home.  In fact, they make the comment in 
a press clipping, saying that Liberals want Reform to roll over 
in its opposition to this bill.  What in essence we are hearing 
from the opposition is that they want the Canadian government, 
and by extension the Canadian nation, to roll over to the 
Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said one thing that is accurate.  We have the longest 
undefended border in the world.  It is a free border, with free 
crossings.  We have a relationship in trade, to the tune of a 
billion dollars a day.  We have a relationship in terms of 
tourism.  How many Canadians own property in the United States? 
We have an excellent relationship with them.  But are we just to 
turn around and say that we do not care that what they are doing 
is in our opinion illegal activity that is damaging an industry? 
Would we tolerate it for any other industry? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that if the fear that is being promulgated by 
the Reform Party were to come true and the United States were to 
put a tariff or some kind of a sanction on steel products, 
clearly that would be against the North American Free Trade 
Agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are mechanisms, solutions and ways of dealing with the 
situation.  They cannot simply violate that agreement.  This bill 
does not violate the NAFTA.  I do not know how many times we have 
to say it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is somewhat disturbing to me to hear the false impressions 
that are put forward in question period and in debate.  They are 
impressions that when researched are simply not backed up by the 
facts.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can give an example.  If a foreign publication is operating in 
this country for over one year it will not be impacted by the 
bill.  Canadian advertisers are not impacted by the bill.  A case 
in point would be <I>Reader's Digest</I>, which is currently about 
75% Canadian owned.  There is no negative impact on <I>Reader's 
Digest</I>.  <I>Time</I> Magazine is grandfathered by the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Grandparented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Grandparented, I stand corrected by 
the member for Peterborough.  I thank him very much.  The point 
of the matter is the minister, the committee and the staff have 
taken care to make sure that the actions taken do not reflect 
negatively on the industry.  For every action the government 
takes clearly there is reaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us assume that the split-run magazines come in.  It is very 
confusing for my constituents who have called.  There have not 
been a lot, but basically they have called to say that we cannot 
let the Americans put us out of business.  I have had none of the 
types of calls the Reform Party has referred to in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to refer to a hypothetical scenario.  If we do not act 
and there is no Bill C-55 and all of a sudden I see the critic 
standing in his place during question period demanding to know 
what the heritage minister will do to protect the $400 million in 
trade and to protect the 7,000 jobs, I can just hear the outrage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to do nothing in this area, I suspect Reformers would 
simply, as they often do, switch principles and go at it from the 
other side.  What do we hear but cries of outrage when we hear 
about the potential for or the fear of selling water to the 
United States.  We hear all kinds of people getting upset and 
saying tell them it is not so, that we have to protect Canadian 
resources, that we cannot cave in to the Americans, and let them 
solve their own problems.  On the other hand they say the 
Americans will beat us up, punch us in the nose with some trade 
sanctions and we will have to bow down to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I tried to come up with an analogy that made some sense in 
relation to protecting our cultural industries.  I think people 
will understand that we see the tremendous success in the 
entertainment and the media industries of Canadians around the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the recent music awards something like seven of the top ten 
nominations were Canadians, people like Shania Twain and Céline 
Dion.  How did that happen?  How is it that all of a sudden we 
have names like those ones, as well as Michael J. Fox and the 
late John Candy.  One of the great successful music groups in 
Europe right now happens to be a group called the Bare Naked 
Ladies.  I was talking to my brother-in-law the other day.  He 
said they were playing to packed houses.  Other Canadian talent 
is the Tragically Hip and James Cameron, the director of 
<I>Titanic</I>. The list goes on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gone are the days when the only two internationally known 
Canadian stars were Paul Anka and Robert Goulet, singing a medley 
of his hits.  Why is it that we see Canadians succeeding?  I 
think it is because they are tremendously talented people, but I 
also think it is because the nation through successive 
governments over the years has recognized the need to protect and 
ensure Canadian content in print, on the airwaves and in all 
aspects of entertainment and media. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A country of 30 million people is producing some of the top 
talent in the entire world and is exporting our cultural 
capabilities around the world.  It truly is an amazing success 
story.  This is frankly no different.  We are ensuring the 
protection of this industry with the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform is simply opposing it to be obstreperous.  I guarantee if 
we did not do this it would take the other approach entirely.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Who makes policy in Canada?  Is it parliament or the U.S. 
congress?  Shall we as a parliament govern our actions and our 
policies based on threats or perceived threats from political 
leaders south of the border? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition would have us move or not move based on 
the whims of Americans.  Canadians have elected us to do the job. 
They have asked us to protect Canada's vital interests.  Bill 
C-55 is about the survival of our magazine industry.  The issue 
is about cultural differences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Americans view culture as a commodity.  Certainly our culture 
needs support from the entrepreneurial excesses of American 
capitalists.  Canadian culture is something that needs to be 
promoted and enhanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eighty per cent of our population lives within 150 kilometres of 
the U.S. border.  We are subject to a barrage of American 
entertainment through films, magazines and television.  American 
entertainment has become what the English language has become 
around the world.  It has become universal.  It has become the 
mode by which people listen and take American values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our culture is what defines us as a nation, but it is difficult 
being so close to a population which is 25 times our size.  The 
Americans see culture simply as an entertainment commodity with a 
bottom line.  Clearly they are trying to expand that bottom line 
in terms of their share of the international market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada must and needs to create policies which maintain our 
cultural existence and in this regard the bill will assist in 
maintaining that objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have over 1,000 publishers producing over 1,400 Canadian 
titles in Canada and 561 consumer magazines with a total 
circulation of over 47 million.  We have 826 Canadian business 
publications with a total circulation of over 11 million. 
Twenty-four million Canadians over the age of 12 read one or more 
major Canadian consumer magazines annually.  The industry employs 
5,200 full time and 1,700 part time people.  Twenty thousand 
additional jobs are dependent on magazine publishers.  We are 
looking at a total annual revenue of over $1 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has maintained policy measures designed to provide 
Canadians with distinctive vehicles for cultural expression. 
Although we welcome foreign publications, we have maintained a 
policy to promote our own cultural industries.  With the adoption 
of Bill C-55, U.S. magazines will continue to be welcomed into 
this country.  They account for 80% of newsstand sales presently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55 is about regulating foreign access to the Canadian 
advertising services market.  This issue is very different from 
wheat or coal or steel.  It is about being Canadian.  It is about 
providing a sustainable and visibly Canadian periodical industry 
by ensuring the advertising revenues needed to create content is 
available.  One page of advertising equals one page of content. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some would argue that the bill would cause a trade war.  Canada 
is obliged by trade treaties to allow free trade in goods, but we 
have never agreed and will never agree to give foreigners free 
access to the Canadian advertising services market.  As Canadians 
we must and will defend our rights as an independent and 
sovereign state to develop policies which support our domestic 
cultural expression.  We will and are defending those rights.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55 maintains a Canadian policy that has been in place for 
three decades.  It aims to ensure the environment in which our 
Canadian identity can be maintained.  What is at stake is the 
future of over 450 or so smaller and more specialized Canadian 
periodicals that fill an essential niche in the country's 
culture.  So-called editions would kill the prospect for young 
publishers, for young editors who might want to set up their own 
magazine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fundamental to this policy has been the belief that Canadians 
must continue to have the opportunity to read about their own 
stories, their values and their interests.  In order for this to 
continue Canadian publishers must be able to operate in a fair 
and competitive environment.  The bill will ensure that Canadian 
magazine publishers have fair access to Canadian advertising 
services revenues.  Without those revenues they would be unable 
to provide readers with the broad range of Canadian publications 
currently available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a NAFTA issue.  The bill does not violate NAFTA or 
other international trade obligations.  It has never been 
challenged before the World Trade Organization or any other 
dispute settlement body, for that matter.  Comments about trade 
war are not well founded.  Canada and the United States have the 
most successful trading relationship with more than 95% of our 
goods and services moving freely across the border.  If the 
Americans do not like the provisions of the bill, they can always 
turn to international dispute settlement provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Early this year the Prime Minister stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important to maintain a Canadian identity.  We have a 
good case and we will win it. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly concur with that view.  We should not be surprised 
with the American sabre rattling.  Again the Americans are 
reacting, trying to have us back down.  Back down we will not do. 
Americans claim that U.S. companies will loose by being excluded 
from the Canadian market.  There have been claims that they would 
loose up to $300 million, a figure based on the improbable 
scenario of every U.S. magazine launching a Canadian split-run 
edition.  This type of sabre rattling is what we are hearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems clear that despite the success of Canadian publishers 
in meeting the demands of Canadians for stories about themselves, 
the loss of advertising revenues to unfair competition in the 
advertising services market would have a very negative impact on 
the industry.  Canadian content would be lost but not replaced by 
split-run advertising editions of U.S. magazines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians would loose the choice of reading their own stories. 
Canadians could not expect American publishers to incur the cost 
of adding Canadian stories to their split-run advertising 
editions.  Nor should they.  We need to promote our own stories 
written by and for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does not limit competition in the Canadian magazine 
industry.  In fact, Bill C-55 ensures the economic viability of 
the Canadian magazine industry and the preservation of thousands 
of jobs of Canadian writers, artists, editors, photographers and 
art directors.  Canadians need to be able to express themselves 
through their own medium.  The legislation ensures that Canadians 
continue to have that freedom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members of the House to support the legislation to 
send a message that our Canadian cultural institutions are worth 
preserving.  We will not be swayed from doing the right thing to 
ensure that the values, interests and stories that make our 
country so unique are heard now and in the future.  We must stand 
up for our own interests.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we have heard a lot in the debate about Bill C-55 
serving to protect Canada's culture.  I suggest the more correct 
term is to protect Canadian values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we think of culture we think in terms of the entertainment 
industry and we think in terms of the arts.  What we are really 
dealing with is something far more prosaic.  It is magazines that 
may deal with issues that are very much every day in Canadian 
life.  It is the very fact that they are every day in Canadian 
life that makes it so important to preserve them as Canadian 
voices rather than American voices.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give a simple illustration.  When we think of sports 
magazines and we consider the Canadian coverage of sports, be it 
sports occurring in Canada or sports occurring in the United 
States, we are liable to get a very different view from a 
Canadian on something like the use of drugs in sports than we 
might get in the United States.  I am thinking of using certain 
performance enhancing drugs in baseball which has been the 
subject of a great many articles in both Canada and the United 
States.  American society has a much more broad minded approach 
to this kind of cheating than does Canadian society. Americans 
would not consider it cheating at all but in Canadian society we 
might. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about the magazine publishing industry we are not 
necessarily talking about music magazines or arts magazines.  We 
are talking about magazines dealing with home decorating, social 
issues, anything imaginable.  Canadian values are reflected in 
this type of venue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give another example.  It is very important in Canadian 
society that we believe as Canadians that fundamental human 
rights pertain to the individual.  In our charter of rights we do 
not even mention the issue of property.  In the United States 
property rights are very much an issue.  Americans are very 
conscious of the need to protect property.  This has created a 
huge division in attitude between Americans and Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In magazine articles, even indirectly, this difference in values 
will be expressed.  When a Canadian writer deals with issues at 
home, issues of safety, the safety of Canadian cities, that 
person will look in terms of the protection of human rights, of 
individual rights, not in terms of property rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember a vivid example of a <I>National Geographic</I> 
article that dealt with a tornado that struck the community of 
Homestead, Florida.  It devastated that community.  The article 
had illustrations of the various damage of the tornado.  One 
illustration showed an individual property owner standing amid 
the wreckage of his property with his furniture and everything 
all smashed, including his home.  He had a small silver plated 
gun to the head of a looter.  The caption simply said something 
like Florida homeowner protects his property from looters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That illustration is an example of the gulf in value that exists 
between American attitudes toward property, the protection of 
property and the use of force to protect property and Canadian 
values which would say that under no circumstances would anyone 
every have the right to hold a gun to the head of a person merely 
trying to steal something or looking at the rubble after a 
tornado.  That would never happen in Canadian society. What is 
really at issue here is not just the protection of Canadian 
culture but the protection of Canadian values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note the Bloc Quebecois is very much in support of the 
principles of Bill C-55, and well it should be. It is well 
established that Americans feel very strongly that there should 
be only one official language.  They cannot understand a society 
that actually has a whole bureaucracy, all our engines set up to 
accommodate two official languages operating in a society.  That 
has made us into an exceptionally tolerant people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not what we get when we read American publications. When 
we read the language and the stories of a society, underneath are 
that society's values.  It is the same in television. 
Unfortunately we cannot do much about the airwaves but we can do 
something about the publishing industry. 
Bill C-55 tries to do this precise thing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it doing it?  As someone who comes from the publishing 
industry, I am impressed that the drafters of this law have 
recognized some realities of the publishing industry.  One is 
that companies have fixed advertising budgets.  The more 
advertising venues one has for a company that wishes to 
advertise, the more that money will be spread around and less 
will go to any individual organization. I will give the example 
that is occurring right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The <I>National Post</I> is trying to enter the newspaper 
marketplace and it is up against the Toronto <I>Star</I> and the 
<I>Globe and Mail</I>.  What we really see here is a conflict over 
trying to obtain what is essentially a limited amount of 
advertising revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A story in the Sunday <I>Star</I> this past weekend claims that 
the <I>National Post</I> is making no progress.  All we have to do 
is look at the <I>National Post</I>'s pages and we will see very 
few advertisements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same kind of thing we are talking about now.  If the 
government does not act in this area there is no doubt that 
Canadian advertisers will be attracted to split-run publications 
coming out of the United States because there is no doubt they 
have more bucks behind them, they have more resources in 
producing the glossy finished product to get those topic 
interviews that are so expensive.  There is no doubt that money 
would be streamed to some of these American split-run 
publications at the expense of Canadian publications which may be 
doing essentially the same story but that story will always have 
an undercurrent of Canadian values as opposed to American values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that level this legislation acknowledges that there is a 
problem here that must be addressed because if it is not 
addressed, there will be less of a voice for Canadian articles, 
indeed on the same subject, reflecting Canadian values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One might say that if the government feels that way why does it 
not just give all these Canadian magazines a direct grant.  Why 
does the government not give a direct grant to Canadian writers 
in these magazines?  This would encourage Canadian content. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest the problem with that is when government interferes 
with culture or a freedom of expression or function in Canadian 
society or any society, it becomes the government's values or the 
bureaucratic values that begin to operate what is actually 
happening with that publication or cultural expression, be it 
music or print or whatever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only measure of whether something is worth saying is whether 
people will pay their own money for it or go to the trouble to 
hear what is being said.  That is why it is so important to have 
this cultural responsibility in the hands of free enterprise.  We 
do that by doing exactly what this legislation does, encouraging 
Canadian advertisers to invest those dollars in Canadian 
publications so that we can have Canadian stories about Canadians 
and about Canadian values.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I feel 
constrained to try to stop this Liberal filibuster.  The Liberals 
invoked closure on this bill. We are ready to go on to the next 
group and see if we can get some debate going on the next group 
of amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are filibustering us, which is appropriate from a 
government that does not like to debate the issues but rather 
likes to just ram things through with its pulling of the strings 
of its backbenchers who vote the way they are told. There is no 
democracy.  There is no debate. There is no consultation with 
Canadians across the country to see whether they support this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the very interesting movies I saw not many years ago is 
called <I>The Mouse That Roared</I>. It is an old movie. I have

</I></B></P><P align=left>It was about a small country that had interminable financial 
difficulties.  In order to solve this problem, the prime minister 
or the president of this small country decided to declare war on 
the United States on the thinking that after it had lost the war, 
which undoubtedly it would, then the United States would, in its 
true fashion, pour millions and millions of dollars into the 
country to rebuild it which would restore its economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was just wondering if that is what Canada is now trying to do. 
Is it declaring war on the United States fully expecting to lose 
so that our economy will be restored?  I really do not think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This whole bill is based on a couple of totally wrong premises. 
One premise is that Canadian magazines cannot survive unless they 
are protected.  I reject that.  We have the same thinking from 
the heritage department when it comes to Canadian artists. It 
thinks that poor Canadian artists are so mediocre that they 
cannot make it unless the government prevents radio stations from 
playing other artists.  They must play Canadian artists.  I 
reject that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at some of the award shows these days we will see a 
fair representation from Canadian artists. They seem to be making 
it fine.  There is no law in the United States which says they 
must play a certain amount by Canadian artists.  However, those 
Canadian artists on their own and because of their merits are 
able to do this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I contend it is the same for magazines.  Canadian magazines 
appeal to Canadian readers in their particular niche of interests 
and they can make it very well, thank you, without government 
interference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another premise which I roundly reject in this bill, 
that culture will somehow be either destroyed or made less 
vibrant if the government does not protect it.  That is fuzzy 
thinking, Liberal thinking, thinking that says unless the 
government regulates, promotes, taxes and sends a whole bunch of 
investigators and supervisors into it, it will not happen. This 
is a totally wrong premise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I grew up in a culture which is not one of the ones on the 
protected list, which is another problem.  If we turn over the 
promotion of culture to government then we get a list of culture, 
A culture, B culture.  We get all these different lists and 
anybody who is not on the list unfortunately has to make it on 
their own, which they will.  Meanwhile their tax dollars are 
siphoned off in order to support other people's cultures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am quite convinced, from my own experience, that culture is 
something which we need to let the people control.  It should not 
be handed over to a government bureaucracy.  All this crying from 
the Liberal side about needing to do this in order to preserve 
our culture is just a bunch of hogwash.  It just does not fly. 
It is a false premise, fuzzy thinking and wrong thinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am quite convinced this bill is very ill advised. We are not 
fearmongering but strictly being realistic when we say that it 
puts at risk a lot of Canadian trade with the Americans because 
they have already given notice that they will do this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know members over there are saying let us not just fold every 
time somebody makes a threat.  Of course not.  We have our own 
sovereignty but let us choose the issues we will fight for.  Let 
us make sure they are worth fighting for.  Let us not pick a 
fight on something that is unnecessary, ineffective and that will 
only take us into a huge amount of trade disputes with the 
Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am ready to dispute with them anytime but does this government 
do this?  Does it do it when it comes to our farmers and trade? 
No.  The government puts up its own barriers.  It says it will 
not let Canadian farmers send their wheat to the United States. 
It puts up its own barriers and prevents farmers from doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here it is saying it will put up a barrier to protect Canadian 
industry.  That is just garbage because at every other turn it 
does just the opposite.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My contention and my statement in my short intervention 
unplanned as it is, is simply to appeal to the government 
backbenchers to think, just good old plain put the brain in gear. 
They should think for themselves.  I know I cannot address them 
directly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They should not simply vote for this because the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage has her political life on the line and there is 
a big move to try to save her face. I have no interest in having 
her lose face, but she could gain face by backing off on this 
legislation.  I would like to see her come into the House today 
and say “I am withdrawing this bill until we do more study on it 
and find out whether or not it is really needed, and whether or 
not it is effective, and whether or not it is based on right 
premises and right thinking”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unconscionable that the Liberals are ramming this bill 
through. They have put in closure and are filibustering on the 
amendments in Group No. l so we cannot discuss the amendment in 
Group No. 2 which is the minister's motion.  I cannot understand 
this.  It is absolutely frustrating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one of the things that brings this parliament into 
disrepute across the country. The people of Canada are not being 
heard.  They are not being consulted.  They are not being 
informed correctly.  They always receive all sorts of different 
messages which are meant to give them the message the government 
wants them to believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This example is way off topic but it shows what I am talking 
about. When it comes to health care funding the government wants 
us to have $2 billion, $2 billion, $2.5 billion.  When it is all 
added up it is $11.5 billion.  The fact is that the health care 
funding is going up this year by $2 billion and next year it will 
be zero because it is $2 billion more than it was last year, next 
year as well. Yet the Liberals want Canadians to think it is 
going up another $2 billion.  It is not.  That is the type of 
message the Liberals give.  It is not a fair way of communicating 
with Canadian voters, Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly what is happening with this bill. The government 
is giving out its message.  I am going to say it, Mr. Speaker, 
and you can call me on it if you want to, but it is totally false 
information.  The government is deceiving the people of Canada 
with this misinformation.  It is time that the Liberals withdrew 
the bill and said to Canadians that they are going to look at it 
again because they want to do it correctly.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview—Greenwood, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to participate in this 
debate and especially to follow the member for Elk Island. I can 
honestly say that the member represents for me probably 90% of 
the reason I could never ever be associated with the Reform 
Party. I am a passionate interventionist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about how we are ramming this bill through. 
The bill is not being rammed through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the Government of Canada and the people of Canada are 
receiving the MAD treatment from the Reform Party.  Many years 
ago, when I had the great privilege and pleasure of working for 
the then Prime Minister Trudeau, we would refer to the MAD 
treatment, maximum administrative delay.  That is what the people 
of Canada are experiencing today. Whenever an opposition party 
essentially wants to delete every clause of a bill and thereby 
delete the bill, that is the MAD treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Passionate interventionism is what I believe in.  There is not a 
riding or a sector of this country's economy that would be alive 
and well today if we had not had some form of government 
intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about tragedies.  One of the real tragedies of 
the House of Commons has been the impact that that opposition 
party has had on so many other issues where we have watered down 
the Government of Canada activism, the Government of Canada 
presence in this country. 
That is part of the reason we have separatism, but fortunately 
that party is on the way out now.  We can see that party has been 
so distracted lately because the economy is coming back.  It is 
starting to lose its separatist foundation in that province.

to quote one of our great Canadian hockey treasures, Frank

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But Mahovlich has a bleak view of the game he once mastered and 
charmed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“The head office is now in New York,” he said in his radio 
interview.  “We have lost this game. The game is not what it 
used to be.  I mean, we've always changed the rules to suit 
everybody else.  When we played the Russians, back in 1972, we 
weren't playing our rules, we were playing the Russian rules, the 
Olympic rules.  So the game is not Canadian any more.  We've lost 
it.  Whether we can get it back or not, I don't know.  We'll have 
to wait and see”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of the Reform Party have tried in so many areas to 
diminish the Canadian content, to diminish the Canadian presence, 
to diminish the Canadian activism. If there was ever an area 
where Canada's House of Commons should be standing on guard, it 
is in the area of culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I consider that Bill C-55 is really not an overly aggressive 
attempt to keep this country's magazine industry alive. I cannot 
understand for the life of me why the Reform Party is trying to 
put a spike in the spirit and the heart of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said to us that we think Canadian magazines cannot 
survive on their own. The bottom line is, I believe that.  I 
believe they cannot survive on their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Have the Reform Party members ever competed against the American 
muscle with all its money and influence?  When was the last time? 
Let us ask any Canadians who are listening to this debate.  Do 
not listen to me.  Walk down to the local grocery store, walk 
down to the local variety store or go into the local bookstore 
and look at those magazine racks. Better than 50% of the 
magazines— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger:</B>  Eighty per cent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  The Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage has just corrected me and I 
appreciate that. Almost 80% of the magazines on the racks in this 
country are American magazines.  Is the Reform Party that 
satisfied with the Americans having 80%?  Does it want us to roll 
over and give them 90% or 95%?  When will it stop? The Reform 
Party is going to want us to erase the 49th parallel next. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I dread the day when we have to have a debate about water with 
the Reform Party sitting in the House.  My goodness, that will be 
the day when we really will be put to the test because that is 
something the Americans want a heck of a lot more than more shelf 
space on a magazine rack. We should all be united and I can see 
the Reform Party running away from the water debate saying to 
just roll over and give it to the Americans.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We should respect and work with our neighbours, but at the same 
time we have a duty and a responsibility to make sure that our 
magazine industry is vibrant and viable. If it means the Minister 
of Canadian Heritage has to stand up and say enough, that this is 
what we are going to do, then we should be a fist in this House 
of Commons, especially when the Americans have access to our 
community by selling magazines like no other country in the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Americans ship them across the 49th parallel. There are 
hardly any shipping costs when they move magazines into this 
country.  Let us think about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members have to understand that many of the craftsmen and 
craftswomen who design, write and organize our magazine industry 
are the same artists who help other sectors of the cultural 
industry, the motion picture industry and the television 
industry. Unless those artists are given an opportunity to 
maximize and test their potential and have others give them 
feedback and critique the quality of their work, this is going to 
have an adverse impact on other business components of our 
cultural industry.  It is a huge, huge industry. We are talking 
job numbers here that are very serious to our gross domestic 
product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the members of the Reform Party, let us not diminish the 
Canadian cultural activity. The Reform Party members said when 
they came to this House of Commons that when they saw something 
good for the nation, they would work with us and make change.

it.  This bill should be supported because the American magazine

quite enough for our neighbours and it is time that all of us in

would be a good idea too, unless it happened to be an artist back

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The hon. member just said that this would be the last 
chance the House would have to address this issue.  I would like 
to point out to the member that we are at report stage and there 
is still third reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I do not think that is a point of 
order.  I think really it is a point of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is interesting that the 
Liberals seem to be so sensitive about the issue of time 
allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go back to 1956.  Mr. Speaker, you were but a young lad I 
am sure. 
The Liberal government of the day decided that a crucial 
parliamentary debate, a debate such as we had today, on the 
trans-Canada pipeline had tarried too long.  It implemented a 
powerful but rarely used standing order of the day and invoked 
closure, shut down debate to force a controversial bill through 
the House of Commons.  The hue and cry from the opposition 
parties, the media and ordinary Canadians was staggering.  In the 
election that followed the travesty of democracy became a scourge 
of the Liberal Party and the government of the day slipped into 
the government of the past.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How times have changed.  This week another Liberal government 
has invoked a form of closure.  This is number 49, the 49th time 
the government has invoked closure.  I think it will hit the 
golden anniversary of 50 some time this week.  That will be 50 
times that it has invoked time allocation and closure since it 
has come to power.  That is the fastest 50 uses of closure in 
Canadian history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pipeline debates are passé nowadays, but debate on this bill, a 
very important bill to Canadians as the Liberal member prior to 
me mentioned, will be shut down.  Debate will be silenced and the 
government will push it through and push it through again at the 
next stage because it has decided it is the easiest way to manage 
time in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a vitally important bill.  It involves not only a social 
principle.  It could involve hundreds of millions, perhaps 
billions of dollars, worth of trade which could be at risk 
because of the bill.  It is hugely important to Canadians and 
they want to see it properly debated in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned it is all over but the crying.  The government 
has decided that there is very little political price to pay, so 
for the 49th time it will invoke closure or restriction on 
debate.  We will be forced to vote on it tonight and it will pass 
into the annals of history as another time when democracy took 
short shrift. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The closure problem did not happen overnight.  I do not want to 
point fingers at just one political party.  The party that was in 
government before the Liberals also had this problem, although it 
took it eight years to reach 50 time allocation motions.  This 
government has done it in five. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The political masters across the way have acted so consistently 
undemocratic over the past several years that in fact I would 
argue we have become callous to democracy's decline.  The use of 
iron fisted party discipline means that MPs often vote to 
represent the party before constituents.  The lack of electoral 
reform ensures that a majority government, in this case with only 
38% of the national vote, has absolute dictatorial powers in the 
House of Commons, in the appointment process and in a hundred or 
a thousand different ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately successive majority governments over the last 
number of years also meant that power sharing was no longer 
necessary, or they felt it was not.  As a result Canadians 
increasingly tune out the democratic process between elections. 
The Liberals interpret this inattentiveness as a licence to 
ignore everything, from unanimous all party committee reports 
that are tabled in this place, to the Auditor General of Canada 
who says he will not sign off on the books of the government 
because they routinely transgress standard accounting practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet government members say “Who cares?  We have 100% of the 
power.  We do not have to share it.  We do not have to do what is 
considered routine or ordinary or normal or accepted in any other 
practice.  We will just do as we please”.  This is the 49th time 
they have taken that tact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently attended a briefing on the current democratic reforms 
occurring in the United Kingdom.  Although I do not claim that is 
the perfect democracy either, I listened to an interesting 
discussion at the high commission.  Members of the mother 
parliament, as we like to call it, are forging ahead with what 
they would consider to be radical changes.  They are talking 
about devolution of powers to local governments in Ireland, Wales 
and Scotland.  As they do that strange things happen.  Not only 
are they restoring peace and tranquillity to those regions, but 
they are also instilling a sense of pride in those regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Power sharing under this new proposal through either a coalition 
government or proportional representation will be routine.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the chairs of the committees will be allocated not 
on the percentage of who holds absolute power but on the 
percentage of the seats that are held in the House.  Imagine 
chairs being allocated in a fair manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The use of referendum to determine broad public policy and even 
constitutional matters will be commonplace.  Those on the Liberal 
side say that is a radical proposal, actually giving power to 
constituents, but in Britain they say that would be okay.  In 
fact they have already done it in Wales, Scotland and Ireland, 
and with miraculous results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Guess what.  When people have a say in the legislation and in 
the constitution they buy into it.  They say “I have been part 
of the process.  I will live with the results”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Britain is one of the last holdouts for this unelected upper 
chamber in the world.  The only other one in the free world is 
the Canadian Senate.  It is the only other one that is unelected. 
Over there they are even toying with the idea of electing 
members.  What a radical thought.  What has got into those Brits? 
Have they gone completely over the edge?  Imagine all this 
democracy at one time.  How will they stand it?  At the very 
least, the hereditary peers will be gone.  It is unstoppable. The 
move toward democratization in that upper house is now inevitable 
and just a matter of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are approaching the golden anniversary on time allocation, 
this black mark on the Liberal record.  In the last parliament 
many high profile Liberals in government, esteemed people with 
perhaps as much procedural expertise as yourself, Mr. Speaker, 
were quoted as talking about the dictatorial Tory attitude on 
closure, about the fact that it was an affront to democracy.  Now 
they seem to think it is routine business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within a few days we will see No. 50.  Within a few more days we 
will see No.  51.  I look forward to the day when they table the 
closure motion with the bill in the House of Commons just because 
it will be much simpler. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I agree with my colleague with respect to your knowledge of 
procedure and so on, but it seems to me that we are discussing 
Bill C-55 which has something to do with magazines.  Are we 
discussing procedure or the Senate?  I would be grateful if you 
would rule whether these arguments are relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, further to that point, we 
on the other side of the House have a right to address this bill 
or any other bill in the way we see fit.  The fact is in 
conjunction with this bill the government invoked time allocation 
and it is very relevant to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member who was speaking 
certainly took a flight of fancy when he described a lot of the 
changes that were happening in the U.K., which is very 
interesting, but I must say I was having a little trouble 
detecting its relevance to the bill before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, discussion about time allocation is entirely 
appropriate given we are operating under time allocation on the 
bill.  I noted before the parliamentary secretary intervened that 
the official opposition whip had come back to earth and was back 
on the bill or something relevant to the bill and so I was 
reluctant to intervene in any way.  I know that he will want to 
conclude his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the flights of fancy are 
obviously not restricted to either side of the House, and the 
Chair has his say as well.  Since we are talking about Britain—I 
was talking about it as were you—when the awards are handed out, 
whether Juno awards, Academy awards or other internationally 
recognized awards, it is always nice to see the long list of 
Canadians who have made it to the top on their ability, not on 
the fact that they have been protected.  That is how to do it. 
One becomes good at art or good at magazines or at whatever one 
happens to be doing and the world will beat a pathway to one's 
door. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope that on this 49th occasion of the use of time 
allocation, which is unfortunately restricting the debate on the 
magazine bill, we would take stock and take note of what is 
happening here.  As we consider changes for the future, I would 
hope our legacy to the world would be one that demonstrates 
dissenting voices and opinions are not only listened to but are 
listened to at length in the House of Commons and in Canada. 
We do not mind dissenting opinions.  We think it is okay in a 
democracy to develop parliamentary procedures that empower 
people, not empower governments.

come at the expense of our freedom of expression and our time in

discussing both the future of our cultural industries, which are 
important, and the future of the democratic process and the 
changes the government seems reluctant to entertain.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke—Lakeshore, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the member across the way said we may speak according to 
the way we see fit.  I want to address the bill according to the 
way I see fit this afternoon because many of my constituents who 
are watching and listening to the debate have asked us questions 
and I would like to answer a few of them on Bill C-55, the 
magazine bill or the advertising by foreign periodical publishers 
bill, and freedom of expression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I received a couple of calls today asking how Bill C-55 would 
ensure that Canadian magazine publishers have clear access to 
Canadian advertising services and the revenues accruing from 
them.  The answer to my constituents was that without those 
revenues we would not have a viable Canadian magazine industry. 
Without those revenues we would be unable to provide Canadian 
readers with the broad range of Canadian publications we 
currently have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of us as members of parliament were present at a display in 
one of the rooms on the parliamentary precincts a while ago where 
several hundred Canadian magazines were on the shelves.  Men and 
women who were cultural artists, photographers, graphic artists, 
writers, publishers, et cetera, were also there.  They were very 
proud of the work they were doing.  They see this as a viable way 
of making a living for themselves and see any move in the 
direction of where there is no support for Bill C-55 as being a 
threat to them, to their future and to Canadian cultural 
activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After reading several articles in the press this weekend, we 
know that the Reform Party will not be supporting the bill.  It 
is not unreasonable to hear what we heard today in debate.  It is 
part of the plan of action wherein there is little support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to speak specifically to my constituents who have some 
concerns and have addressed them to me.  In discussions with 
several of them there was a sense that Bill C-55 would stop U.S. 
magazines from entering Canada.  I think other members addressed 
this earlier, but I want to make sure they understand that U.S. 
magazines will continue to be welcomed in Canada and that U.S. 
magazines account for 80% of newsstand sales in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55 is about regulating access to advertising services. 
Foreign publishers seek access to revenues from selling Canadian 
advertising services without producing original editorial content 
for the Canadian market.  That revenue is then not available to 
Canadian publishers that actually produce original content for 
the Canadian market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important point is the fact that foreign publishers cannot 
come in and use our Canadian advertising services and walk away 
with our Canadian dollars, denying Canadians the opportunity to 
benefit from the Canadian market.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear a good deal about the trade war that will result between 
Canada and the United States.  My constituents are concerned 
about this when they hear from the Reform members what could 
possibly happen to us as a result, what industries could be put 
at risk, the fact that at this point in time what we will be 
really doing is letting the American anger and the American 
feelings over this issue somehow come down on us like a ton of 
bricks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say to my constituents that this is not a trade war. 
Canada and the U.S. have the world's most successful trading 
relationship with about 95% of all goods going back and forth 
across the border.  We have ways we could settle disputes and 
that dispute settlements are there to be used.  This is precisely 
why Bill C-55 has provisions that if the U.S. dislikes the 
provision it can then turn to international dispute settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One other item that is also important is something I jotted down 
from a conversation with a constituent who spoke about the fact 
that the bill does not place restrictions on the content of 
magazines or on individual advertisements or limits Canadians' 
access to foreign magazines.  This is someone who is supportive 
of Bill C-55 and who wanted to make sure that I made that point 
today. This bill does not place restrictions on the contents of 
magazines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another constituent addressed the issue of freedom of expression 
to enjoy a diversity of Canadian ideas.  I think this is what 
Bill C-55 is ensuring, that Canadians continue to have the 
freedom to express, the freedom to enjoy a diversity of ideas as 
seen in Canadian magazines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage my colleagues in the Reform Party to take a second 
look at their position at this point to recognize the importance 
of Canadian advertisers to invest in Canadian publications and to 
again take another look at the fact that this is not draconian 
and unprecedented legislation.  We have at least 100 pieces of 
legislation that contain similar legal provisions as we see in 
Bill C-55. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the last time to debate this bill.  Other 
opportunities will be presented.  This is not the last 
opportunity, as one member across the way states.  Other 
opportunities will be provided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to stand up for our cultural artists.  As we head into 
the new millennium it is important that Canadian cultural 
activities be affirmed and that we go into the millennium 
strengthened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55 supports longstanding Canadian cultural policies.  It 
is consistent with our international trade obligations and it is 
the Canadian thing to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I wish I could say it is a pleasure for me to rise this 
afternoon to address the Group No. 1 amendments to Bill C-55. 
Unfortunately I am unable to do that due to the fact that the 
government, as has been referred to already during this 
afternoon's debate, elected to impose time allocation yet again 
for the 49th time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Due to this time allocation at report stage, there is no 
assurance that this arrogant Liberal government will not impose 
time allocation as well at third reading despite what the hon. 
member preceding me had to say about this not being the last 
opportunity for hon. members on both sides of the House to 
address this legislation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Due to time allocation and the reality that the clock is now at 
5.05 p.m., my understanding is debate will be collapsed by this 
government through the use of time allocation at approximately 
6.15 p.m. and we have not even got to discuss the Group No. 2 
amendments.  I wonder if I could have the unanimous consent of 
the House to move immediately to Group No. 2 amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Madam Speaker, I think what we have just 
seen is indicative of the extremely arrogant dictatorial style of 
this government in the fact that it refused a very reasonable 
request that we move on to Group No. 2 amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ironically, Group No. 2 consists of only one motion put forward 
by the hon. minister of heritage, the very minister who is 
putting forward this bill. We will quite likely never get to 
Group No. 2. The reality is that through the use of time 
allocation by this government we on this side of the House will 
never have the opportunity to actually debate the minister's 
amendment to her own bill.  I think that would certainly indicate 
to the viewing public exactly where this government stands on the 
use of time allocation and how it pertains to democracy in our 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have said already during the debate, this is the 49th time 
this government has elected to use time allocation.  There were 
45 times that avenue was used to shut down debate and 4 times for 
closure; 36 times in the 35th parliament and 13 already in less 
than two years in this, the 36th parliament. Shame on this 
government. The reality that it has elected to continuously and 
systemically shut down debate and limit democracy is quite 
appalling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague from Fraser Valley was showing how some of the 
Liberal members, when they were on this side of the House during 
the reign of terror by the Tory government between 1984 and 1993, 
were always quick to jump to their feet whenever that government 
utilized time allocation or closure to ram legislation through 
this place. Yet these same members, many of whom are still here 
but who sit on the government side, are strangely mute when it 
comes to the use of time allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are examples of the flagrant abuse of power by this 
government other than the use of time allocation. Whipped votes 
come to mind when people think about how this government is 
abusing its power.  We remember a year or two ago when we had the 
now famous flag debate where the Reform Party put forward a 
motion that a member should be able to have a small flag on his 
or her desk to denote their patriotism. It was voted down. There 
was a whipped vote and that motion was voted down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw it with the hepatitis C issue where again the Reform 
Party was trying to get compensation for all hepatitis C victims. 
Again the government whip got all the backbenchers to fall into 
line and vote it down.  Just last month the Reform Party put 
forward a supply motion concerning the child porn situation in 
British Columbia and how we wanted to use the notwithstanding 
clause to prevent those who would view child porn from possessing 
that type of despicable material. 
Again, a whipped vote and all of the Liberals fell into line and 
voted against that very important motion.

have the Reform motion concerning the unfair tax policy and how 
it discriminates against single income families that elect to 
have one parent stay at home, work in the home and raise and 
guide their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am trying to point out is that unfortunately for Canada 
and the Canadian general public there are many examples of where 
this arrogant Liberal government is abusing the power it has been 
granted by the electorate.  It is operating in a very dictatorial 
manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that light I would like to quote from a publication called 
“Governing with Integrity”: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important asset of government is the confidence it 
enjoys of the citizens to whom it is accountable.  There is 
evidence today of considerable dissatisfaction with government 
and a steady erosion of confidence in the people and institutions 
of the public sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This erosion of confidence seems to have many causes. Some have 
to do with the behaviour of certain elected politicians, others 
with an arrogant style of political leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Liberal government will take a series of initiatives to 
restore confidence in the institutions of government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the steps cited on page 92 is that more free votes will 
be allowed in the House of Commons.  What I am quoting from is 
what has become known as the infamous Liberal red book on the 
policies they ran under in the 1993 election. Unfortunately for 
Canada they were elected to their first majority government in 
October 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the short time I have remaining one thing I would like to 
briefly refer to is of real concern to me.  One of the most 
disturbing trends we have seen lately is the drop in the 
electoral turnout at the ballot boxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. The member mentioned that he is short of time.  I have 
been watching the clock and it seems to me that for seven or 
eight minutes he has been dealing with matters such as whipped 
votes.  He is now bringing up the turnout of voters at the ballot 
boxes.  Is he debating Bill C-55 at all? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Madam Speaker, while we once again have 
a point of order from the Liberals who do not like to hear this, 
the fact is Bill C-55 has been subject to time allocation by this 
government.  We feel every right to undertake the privilege in 
the House to talk to the abuse of Bill C-55 which is indeed time 
allocation in as much as the content of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Steckle:</B>  Madam Speaker, I think it would be fair 
for the hon. member to retract his statement made a few moments 
ago that all members voted with our party on the matter of porn. 
We did not.  There were four members who did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  These observations 
are really not points of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Madam Speaker, in reply to the last point 
of order, I retract my statement about the child porn vote. I 
recognize the oversight that there were four Liberal members who 
had some courage and actually stood up and voted with the 
opposition on that motion.  My apologies to those four members. 
Unfortunately we do not see enough of them break ranks and follow 
the lead of those four so that we can get those types of motions 
passed in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the minute or so I have remaining I point out to the hon. 
deputy whip of the government that when I started my intervention 
this afternoon, I did ask for unanimous consent to move forward 
and debate his minister's amendment. 
It was he himself who refused to allow me to voice my concerns 
about this amendment.  It should not come as a surprise that 
therefore I elect to voice my concerns about the dictatorial 
manner in which this government operates.

upset me at the time.  As some may know, I have been very 
supportive of our flag.  I tried to create a flag day.  It is 
interesting that when that issue was before committee Reform did 
not support any of the initiatives.  If we went back a year ago 
the flag that would be of choice for Reform members to have on 
their desks would be the stars and stripes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55 is about ensuring that we have Canadian culture in 
Canada.  There are 30 million Canadians and there are 300 million 
Americans.  Many of our people live within 100 miles of the U.S. 
border and are bombarded by American communication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not mean it is a bad thing, but it makes it very 
difficult to build on what Canadians have built, an extremely 
dynamic, independent and sovereign country on the northern half 
of the North American continent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Trade negotiation is just that.  I was recently in the United 
States and there was no press coverage whatsoever about Canada's 
debate over maintaining its cultural industries through the use 
of Bill C-55.  We are talking about a $400 million expenditure on 
advertising, which means nothing, quite frankly, to the 
Americans.  The debate in the United States was about steel and 
steel importation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those members jump up, one after the other, saying “Look at all 
the awful things the Americans are going to do to us if we pass 
this $400 million piece of legislation.  They are going to 
embargo our steel.  They are going to embargo our softwood 
lumber.  They are going to embargo our wheat”.  Quite frankly, 
the Americans want to do that anyway.  It has nothing to do with 
Bill C-55. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was in the United States the debate was all about the 
steel industry, Bethlehem Steel.  For members who are doing the 
bidding of the Americans, I would tell them that it is a lot 
cheaper to pay lobbyists to go to Washington to lobby the 
government, Mr. Clinton and the special trade representative, Ms. 
Barshefsky, than to build an efficient steel industry in the 
United States.  The U.S. has old, inefficient operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If these members who love the Americans so much were concerned 
about their economy, they would be arguing that the Americans 
should be more competitive, allow Canadian steel more access to 
the American market and allow Canadian softwood lumber more 
access to the Canadian market because it would make them more 
efficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want them to hide behind uneconomic trade barriers. 
Uneconomic trade barriers beat up on everybody.  They use power 
to control their economy and to beat up their competitors.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This whole debate is about how they are going to beat up on us. 
It has nothing to do with cultural policy.  It would not take the 
Americans five seconds if they thought that Disneyland or the 
Disney corporation was under the threat of competition within the 
United States to ensure that those industries in the United 
States were taken care of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have 97% of our film industry.  The debate is about getting 
the other 3%.  This is a ridiculous, idiotic debate and I am 
surprised at members opposite who seem to want to support that 
kind of initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They talk about democracy.  The reality is that Ms. Barshefsky 
does not represent the American people.  She represents 
particular special interest groups, called American industry, 
which want protection.  It is not just the Canadian steel 
producers.  In fact they are the last people on their list.  They 
want to attack Korean steel, Japanese steel and steel coming from 
southeast Asia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members should look at Bethlehem Steel or the steel operations 
in Pennsylvania.  The reality is that the Americans have not paid 
the price to keep them efficient.  They have not been efficient 
producers and they are being out competed.  The Americans are 
supposed to be the great competitors.  They believe in free 
competition.  They believe in free markets, except when there are 
others coming into their market.  Then they believe in securing 
their market and keeping the other guy out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people today are supporting the American agenda to 
basically build walls around the United States.  They do not want 
us to compete in their market, but they sure want to compete in 
ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does everybody remember the softwood lumber issue?  The 
Americans successfully created quotas against the importation of 
Canadian softwood lumber.  The Americans said that we could take 
them to the WTO and we would probably win.  It is the same thing 
with this issue.  If it were to go to the WTO, we would probably 
win. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But guess what?  They could place embargoes on our exports to 
the United States.  That could go on for three years in a court 
determined process and even if the Americans had to pay penalties 
by keeping artificially high prices on softwood lumber within the 
United States it would be a money maker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened with softwood lumber?  Canada ended up with 
quotas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those people over there are supporting that kind of agenda. Let 
the bully win.  Do not do anything to the bully.  Do his bidding 
for him.  That is the Reform Party's agenda.  Those people 
claimed to wrap themselves in the flag a year ago and today they 
refuse to protect Canadian culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not like to use the word protection.  I do not believe in 
protectionism myself.  What I do believe is that Canada has an 
emerging cultural industry.  Canadians want to tell their stories 
to each other.  They want to have media, a communications network 
and magazines that tell Canadian stories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years Canadians have been happy and willing to step 
forward and pay that price because that is what we are.  That is 
part of our Canadian heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Day in and day out it is incredible what we hear from members of 
the Reform Party.  The other day we were talking about tax policy 
and they said “I guess you have to pay Uncle Sam some day”. 
That is their thought process.  It is in their brain power.  They 
do not even know what country they are living in.  They have 
accepted the American agenda to such a great extent that they are 
standing up for it.  They are not standing up for their 
constituents, they are standing up for a secular interest group, 
the American industry.  They are the tool of American industry.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I want to speak directly to Bill C-55.  A lot of what I 
have to say directly involves time allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To me there are too many issues.  With this magazine bill the 
heritage minister is setting Canada up for U.S. trade 
retaliation.  We all know that and the government knows that. 
With the risk of trade retaliation there is the risk of losing 
jobs, in particular jobs in the minister's own riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing that perplexes me is why a government would continue 
with this knowing full well that there are trade sanctions on the 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing is that when she bans Canadian advertisers from 
selling their goods and services in foreign magazines the 
minister is telling Canadian advertisers that when it comes to 
freedom of speech they are second class citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That still does not seem to affect this government when it comes 
to doing what it damn well pleases in the House of Commons, 
regardless of how it affects people in other jurisdictions.  It 
is really sad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to comment on an issue which my colleague from Prince 
George—Peace River brought up recently.  He stood in the House a 
few minutes ago looking for unanimous consent from members 
opposite to move to the Group 2 amendments.  Perhaps the folks 
out there do not understand what that is, but really what he 
wanted to do was get off the debate on the amendments that were 
proposed by the Reform Party and on to the debate of an amendment 
proposed by the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite declined.  Basically what that says is that the 
minister has an amendment to the bill which will not even be 
debated.  For the life of me, I do not understand why the 
government would take that approach.  What is it about debate in 
the House of Commons that we are not allowed to have? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the people who do not understand what time allocation is, it 
is a way of preventing further debate on an issue because the 
government wants to put through a bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As people will have heard, there have been a lot of bills which 
have had time allocation placed on them.  We must consider those 
bills and how much time we actually had to speak on them.  I want 
to talk about a couple of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-36 came before the House at report stage.  The official 
opposition had 50 minutes of debate before the government brought 
in time allocation.  What kind of debate is that?  In the House 
of Commons the government says “You have had your 50 minutes. 
Let us go ahead and do something else.  We are going to push this 
through at this stage”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell hon. members what is going to happen.  The government 
is at the end of the line on this issue.  We have now had 49 
bills on which time has been limited and we are about to get 
number 50. As House leader I am sick and tired of sitting in 
House leaders' meetings listening to the fact that closure after 
closure, time allocation after time allocation, is going to occur 
and we will just damn well have to accept it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the way it is going to be.  It may be time, and I 
think it is time, for the official opposition to say “Rather 
than your 50 minutes or your two hours of debate from us, maybe 
we will just close you down and see how you like that.  Maybe we 
will just stall all of your bills.  Maybe it is time for 
committees that want to travel to get in here and debate the bill 
because we will not allow that travel”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is time to talk turkey.  Enough is enough.  When we 
want to talk at length about important bills such as Bill C-55, 
we do not expect to come into the House and have the government 
say “We do not want you to debate this any more.  You have 
already had on this bill three hours and 35 minutes and that is 
enough”. 
That is unacceptable.  We will tell this government that it is 
not enough.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to get ready for some serious turkey talk in the 
House.  There are other bills.  Bill C-2 was on the Canada 
pension plan and we wanted to debate this at length.  It turns 
out that at the time of second reading on Bill C-2 the official 
opposition had 1 hour and 41 minutes debate on the Canada pension 
plan before this government decided we had had enough to say 
about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was looking in the library recently at the debates which took 
place in the House of Commons in the 1960s under Diefenbaker. 
They debated it at length.  There was no such thing as bringing 
in closure or time allocation.  This was an important issue for 
all of Canada, so let us debate it and determine where things are 
going.  What happens?  We talk about it for 1 hour and 41 minutes 
and the government says that is enough.  That is a disgrace. I 
wonder if they can understand on the other side how we feel about 
that.  That was second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we go to Bill C-2 on report stage and third reading. The 
government must have given a lot more time on that.  It turns out 
the official opposition had 1 hour and 20 minutes before the 
government called time allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the hon. member will stand up and talk about relevance 
in a minute on a point of order. About $1 billion in trade is 
done by Canada and the United States every day.  That is relevant 
to Bill C-55. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more relevant to Bill C-55 is this outrageous situation 
where we have the official opposition reduced to about an hour 
and a half of debate on bills that we think are important.  We 
just do not understand how this government can bring in useless 
bills, and I mean lots of useless bills, yet when we get to 
something important it calls time allocation on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only way the government is getting away with this is because 
it has a majority government and because people outside the House 
of Commons do not realize what time allocation and closure really 
are.  It is really a sad day when a government pulls this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has called time allocation and closure on bills 
so often that we will hit 50 times since the Liberals have formed 
the government in 1993.  That is two years ahead of the Tories. 
Imagine. They have a worse record than Brian Mulroney on this by 
two years.  I guess absolute power corrupts absolutely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we get a majority government like this it feels that it can 
do whatever it wants, whenever it wants.  It is a sad commentary 
on what we call a democracy.  We who came here from the west 
thought we would go down to Ottawa and speak on behalf of our 
constituents and talk about the issues that are near and dear to 
them. We did not realize that when we came here we would be short 
shifted on these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who are listening to these comments, 1 hour and 20 
minutes debate is only about three or four people who get to talk 
about these things.  On Bill C-65 which has to do with 
equalization and about $10 billion, which is coming up and we 
understand that time allocation again is coming in on that, we 
have just had 3 hours and 35 minutes debate. That is $10 billion, 
3 hours and 35 minutes debate, and that is probably about seven 
or eight people.  We all want to talk about that here, not just 
some of us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I welcome the opportunity today 
to talk about Bill C-55, the foreign publishers advertising 
services act.  It will regulate advertising services supplied by 
foreign magazine publishers to Canadian advertisers where such 
services are directed at the Canadian market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new law will ensure that Canadian magazine publishers 
continue to have access to Canadian advertising revenues which 
are necessary for the survival of our periodical publishing 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Advertising revenues from the supply of advertising services are 
the main source of revenue for magazine publishers. They finance 
the production of editorial content, the purchase of photographs 
and much more.  Without such revenues there would be no original 
Canadian content.  Therefore access to revenues from the supply 
of advertising services is critical to the continued production 
of Canadian stories and of information of interest to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since Confederation Canada has preserved, promoted and enhanced 
cultural identity through mass media.  Canada's longstanding 
cultural policies have supported the creation and communication 
of Canadian ideas, stories and information through the 
establishment of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, our 
National Film Board and a host of other organizations that give 
voice to Canadian stories and Canadian culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, Canada's cultural policies have played a key role in 
cultivating a vibrant, domestic magazine publishing industry.  In 
1996 Canadian publishers produced 1,500 magazines and sold 539 
million copies and generated revenues of more than $1 billion. Of 
the magazines in circulation in Canada, the percentage of 
Canadian magazine titles has grown from 20% in 1956 to 65% in 
1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a land as vast as ours and given our rich cultural diversity, 
Canadian magazines are a powerful vehicle for expression in the 
sharing of stories, information and perspectives.  Canadian 
magazines help define who we are and enable us to read about 
ourselves in our own voices as well as share Canada with those 
who live outside our borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a world that technology continues to shrink it is critical 
that the federal government continue to support our domestic 
magazine publishing industry so that the creation and sharing of 
Canadian stories and Canadian perspectives will thrive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With more than 250 million English speaking Americans to our 
south there is no shortage of American stories coming into 
Canada.  From U.S. magazines we would not hear about Canada Day 
or St. Jean Baptiste Day or celebrating Thanksgiving in October. 
Nor would we hear about the details of Canadian bank mergers or 
the challenges of gardening in our northern climate. What we 
would hear is the perspectives and interests of other nations and 
other people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This measure is not about excluding foreign magazines from our 
domestic market to enjoy hearing what others have to say, and we 
will continue to do that.  In fact, Canada imports more American 
magazines than the rest of the world combined.  Canadians also 
want to be able to read about themselves, their communities and 
their country.  This is clearly demonstrated in the fact that 18 
of the top 20 magazines in circulation within our borders are 
Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must make sure that Canadian publishers have access to 
advertising revenues.  Because of the relatively small size of 
our market, one-tenth the size of the U.S., a strong domestic 
advertising revenue base is required to support the creation of 
distinctly Canadian magazines.  This way we can ensure that 
Canadian magazines help project our stories to our own citizens 
as well as to others around the world.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new bill is really about choice, choice for Canadians to 
benefit from Canadian voices, perspectives and shared 
experiences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, and this is very important for anyone watching 
this debate, we are not excluding others from our domestic 
market.  Rather, Bill C-55 will result in a secure advertising 
base for Canadian magazine publishers.  This in turn will ensure 
that this vibrant cultural industry continues to provide 
distinctive expressions, distinctive vehicles for expressions 
which are distinctly Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I urge all members to seek speedy passage of this 
bill.  I also urge opposition members and all those speaking on 
this debate to give Canadians watching this debate and the 
Americans and others watching this debate the facts.  The fact is 
it is important for Canadians to have the opportunity to read and 
hear about Canadian expressions and Canadian stories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had a number of calls from residents in the constituency 
of Thornhill.  Many of them have expressed to me their concerns. 
When my children were small I searched for Canadian publications 
and magazines.  At that time there were not nearly as many as 
there are today.  They are here today because there is a demand 
for them within Canada.  The fact that we have a relatively small 
market means we need to do what we can to ensure that they will 
be here not only for today but for future generations.  It is 
therefore my pleasure to participate in this very important 
debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the Liberals would have us think they are great 
champions of expediency and getting a wonderful bill through the 
House.  This is why they have arranged matters with this bill in 
order to limit debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very instructive for people who have been watching today 
to notice what happened.  The Liberals, terribly concerned about 
a threatened Reform filibuster, cut off debate.  The Liberals 
then are filibustering.  The dread filibuster has arrived. Who is 
driving the get away car?  It is the Liberals.  Here we have the 
Liberals throwing up speakers.  I had not intended to speak to 
this part of the debate but I knew that they would use up all the 
airtime unless the opposition scrambled to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, far from there being a filibuster, we are not even 
allowed to speak to the minister's own amendment to this bill. 
In other words, the minister brings in what she tells us is a 
wonderful amendment to this bill but we do not get to talk about 
it, debate it, examine it or get any time to talk about the pros 
and cons of it.  Why? The Liberals are refusing to even allow us 
to talk about the minister's amendment to the bill.  That is the 
Liberal definition of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope Canadians watching this debate are getting as outraged 
and as fed up as I and many of us on this side of the House are 
about what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to false accusations against Reform about a 
threatened filibuster, which came after we spoke to this bill for 
less than an hour, there is a stampede to stop a filibuster. I 
guess one hour is a filibuster according to the Liberals because 
they do not like to see any opposition to their measures. We then 
have other ridiculous assertions by the Liberals who are being 
thrown up to speak on this, none of which hold the slightest bit 
of water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had one member, for example, saying that Reform had 
diminished hockey.  Is it not interesting that a government that 
is giving us a 65 cent dollar and 33% more taxes is accusing 
other people of hurting businesses that have to compete against 
the U.S.?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been some very interesting misrepresentations by the 
Liberals about Bill C-55.  One is that there is a crying need to 
protect Canadian magazines because 80% of the magazines purchased 
at the newsstand are American.  The Liberals neglect to tell us 
that less than 5% of the magazines read by Canadians are 
purchased at the newsstand and 80% of those are U.S.  We are 
talking 80% of less than 5%.  Somehow it drives the Liberals into 
a frenzy of culture protection because many of the less than 5% 
of magazines purchased are U.S. magazines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>God forbid that Canadians should be allowed the freedom to 
purchase the magazines that they would like to purchase from 
newsstands.  But of course Canadians really need to be protected 
against their own freedom of choice.  Canadians have to be 
limited in the reading material they get.  They can only read 
magazines produced in Canada because if Canadians dare to 
purchase from the newsstands a majority of magazines that are 
produced somewhere else, then the Liberals have to shut it down 
with some legislated measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what has happened with this split-run business. 
In 1997 the Liberal government lost a challenge laid with the 
World Trade Organization against its unfair and inappropriate 
measures to try to coerce Canadians into reading only certain 
types of material.  The World Trade Organization said that this 
contravened the kind of trade measures that had been agreed on in 
the international trade scene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the Liberals do next?  They brought in Bill C-55 in 
order to do an end run around the World Trade Organization.  Of 
course the World Trade Organization understandably is a little 
unimpressed by this move by the Liberals but the Liberals have 
done it anyway.  We heard today that the Liberals have brought in 
a measure that says that we cannot stop magazines that have been 
operating in Canada on split runs so this only applies to new 
magazines that come onstream. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If all of a sudden we have to protect Canadians against new 
incursions into their magazine market by the U.S., but we have to 
allow the magazines that were operating in 1997 when we lost this 
appeal to the World Trade Organization, then what are we really 
protecting Canadian culture from?  None of the elements that were 
present in 1997 will be affected by this bill, only new ones. 
Suddenly there is a switch.  The things we were going to have to 
be protected against in 1997 are now allowable, they are okay 
now.  Our Canadian culture is not threatened by them any more, 
even though we tried to restrict them.  Now we have to restrict 
something that may be new or different.  We are not sure what it 
is yet but by God, we are not going to allow it.  No siree, we 
are going to stand up for Canadian culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the members opposite even had the nerve to suggest that 
artists like Céline Dion and Shania Twain owed their success to 
the protective hand of government.  What errant nonsense.  If I 
were one of the artists mentioned in the member's speech, I would 
be absolutely furious at the suggestion that in some way, shape 
or form the comforting and kind hand of government had made me a 
success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to suggest a rather new and startling proposal to 
this government, which is that Canadian artists, Canadian culture 
and Canadian magazines can compete on their own.  They may just 
be good enough, strong enough, timely enough, well written 
enough, well researched enough and appeal to the information 
needs of Canadians enough that they do not need this Liberal 
government and its silly bills to protect them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time that we were realistic about some of these things. To 
hear the debate from the other side and to hear the intransigence 
on the other side about debating their own amendments is a poor 
reflection on the democracy of this place. As our House leader 
just mentioned, the Liberals' abuse of the system, the Liberals' 
assertions that do not hold water simply cannot be tolerated any 
longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today in question period we heard the minister make it clear to 
everyone that she does not know the provisions in her bill and 
how the bill will affect Chinese publications and their split 
runs. There is clearly something wrong when the minister 
misinforms the House about the effect of her own bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely there is a great need to take some time to debate this 
properly and thoroughly but no, we have to close down debate. 
My debate is going to be closed down pretty soon, and I am sure 
everyone feels as badly about that as I do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have to arrange things so we cannot discuss the 
minister's amendments.  It is time we put a stop to this.  I 
appeal to members of the House to give this matter some sober 
thought.  Make sure that bills are properly debated and presented 
and that every aspect is examined by the House as it is our duty 
and our responsibility to do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West—Nepean, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have to point out to the House on the limiting of the 
debate that nearly two dozen Reform members of parliament have 
already spoken on this bill.  Having heard many of them just at 
this one stage of the bill, I know that the same things have been 
said nearly two dozen times over.  Nothing new is being added to 
the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out to Canadians who are listening that there was 
also second reading at which many Reform members spoke. There 
will also be third reading at which many more Reform members will 
speak.  It is hardly the fault of the government if in all those 
opportunities, nearly 50 in total, the Reform Party has not been 
able to get across its message to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing I need to correct in the member's speech is the 
fact that we are trying to limit the choice of Canadians. There 
is no foreign magazine that will not be allowed in Canada. If 
having 80% of the magazines on our newsstands that are American 
magazines is not enough choice for Canadians, I would be 
extremely surprised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about what it means to me to be Canadian.  My 
father chose to come to this country nearly 70 years ago.  He 
chose Canada.  He was very clear about why he did not choose to 
become an American.  He believed in the different values this 
country has, values that we as Canadians share from coast to 
coast to coast.  Before I could learn to speak, I knew how lucky 
I was to be a Canadian.  That is why I am in this parliament, to 
follow in the great traditions of the people who sat in this 
chamber before us and of those who will come after us, to 
preserve what this country stands for, not only for Canadians but 
for the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a believer in competition too.  But there is no fair 
competition when an American magazine can produce absolutely no 
new literary product in Canada, yet can come here and steal 
revenue from Canadian magazines, making it impossible for them to 
survive in the marketplace and to continue communicating with and 
to Canadians what this country is about.

<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The American magazines can mass produce for the American market, 
send the same magazine into Canada and therefore discount or 
subsidize their advertising rates in Canada.  It is called 
predatory pricing.  This government is here not to allow Canadian 
magazines to be put out of business by that kind of unfair 
competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is very clear to me is that we also cannot be bullied. When 
it comes to doing what is best for this country, we cannot be 
bullied by threats against other products in this country.  We 
have to stand up against that.  We have to stand up for the right 
of the Government of Canada to govern in the interests of this 
country and its people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course what we have with Reform is a party that really wishes 
this country were American.  It is quite simple.  The Reform 
Party wants things like recall and referendums.  It wants elected 
representatives of this country to be the captives of well 
heeled, well financed, very powerful lobby groups.  That is who 
benefits from the kind of policies the Reform Party advocates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that the Reform Party listen to Canadians.  Listen to 
the debate that took place, first with the Canada-U.S. Free Trade 
Agreement, then with NAFTA, then with MAI, and then with our 
involvement in the World Trade Organization.  What Canadians said 
among other things was that they want to be able to protect 
Canadian culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the world globalizes, we have one superpower in this world, a 
superpower that is reaching into every culture, every economy of 
the globe.  Countries have to be able to stand up and protect 
their individual identity.  We are prepared to stand up to 80% 
competition from foreign magazines and publications with fair 
competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party says to let the marketplace decide.  Look at 
the history of the country.  The marketplace would never have 
built a railway across vast empty spaces to create a united 
country from Atlantic to Pacific. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The marketplace would never have created a communications 
network so that people in the far northern reaches of this 
country could be part of what Canadians were saying to each 
other, what was important to us and what we were talking about 
among ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The marketplace would never have created a national airlines so 
that we could travel and do business and visit relatives anywhere 
in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The marketplace would never have said that it wanted a certain 
amount of Canadian content on our radio and television stations 
because it would have been afraid that featuring Canadian artists 
and performers would limit its profits. When those Canadian 
content regulations came in I have to say I was one who did not 
particularly favour them.  I spoke much as the member might have 
at the time and I said that Canadian artists are good enough, 
they do not need a Canadian kindergarten to protect them from 
competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I knew within six months that I was wrong because I was hearing 
Canadian singers on my radio.  I had never heard them before. 
Without those content regulations, we would not have had <I>Anne 
of Green Gables</I>, we would not have had Anne Murray, we would 
not have had Gordon Lightfoot, and we would not have had Shania 
Twain, Alanis Morissette and Céline Dion at the Grammys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may take members of the Reform Party a similar 30 years to 
admit that they were wrong, but we on this side of the House are 
here to make sure that there will be Canadian magazines for our 
children and grandchildren.  There will be Canadian performers. 
There will be Canadian transportation and communications systems. 
We will not give up the great Canadian dream just because the 
Reform Party would rather we were Americans. 
That is the dream my father came to this country for.  That is 
the dream I will protect as long as I live.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we are 
here this afternoon debating amendments put forth by the Reform 
Party.  What we have here and what Canadians had to listen to is 
somewhat embarrassing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have Reformers kowtowing to the U.S., having us run scared 
from a free trade agreement that they fully supported and 
continue to support.  We have the Liberals dancing around the 
trade agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians, and certainly New Democrats, foresaw our culture 
being threatened and the bill is proof that our culture is not 
protected.  The bill is not perfect but it is an attempt by the 
Liberals to at least right some of the wrongs brought about by 
free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout this debate I have also heard Reform cry “let the 
market decide”.  The situation Canadians have seen themselves in 
is certainly the marketplace throughout Canada.  With the Asian 
crisis, everybody was saying “Oh, my gosh, we let the market 
decide”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since today is International Women's Day and we know we have to 
let the market decide and be part of globalization, I want to 
take this opportunity to let the market decide and to let 
Canadians decide if they want to be part of that.  I watched a 
news documentary in which a fellow by the name of Robert Ohuras 
who was representing an American company in Juaréz, Mexico, was 
commenting on a request that was made to change the hours women 
and young girls had to work in plants or in factories owned by 
Canadians and American companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bodies of 200 women have been found outside in the desert 
Juaréz.  There was a request made to change their hours of work 
so that they would not have to walk home at 1 a.m.  Mr. Ohuras' 
response was “Don't forget why these companies are in Mexico. 
They must be globally competitive.  They need to have flexible 
hours”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we need to let the market decide?  Any time Reformers want to 
let the market decide, I want them to think of these women.  This 
is all part of it.  When the market is the only thing left to be 
the deciding factor, that is the outcome.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, thank you for 
this opportunity to address my colleagues, as well as all 
Canadians, with respect to Bill C-55, the Foreign Publishers 
Advertising Services Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will make it an offence for foreign periodical 
publishers to sell advertising services on the Canadian market. 
This is an important legislative measure for the Canadian 
periodical publishing industry, because it will protect the 
health of this important cultural industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Revenues from advertising services are vital to any periodical 
publisher.  Without them, periodicals would simply not exist. 
Revenues from advertising services pay for such things as 
editorial content, the cost of photos, and the development of 
new talent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55 will ensure that Canadian publishers have access to the 
limited advertising revenue in our country.  They will thus 
continue to bring Canadians a wealth of diversified articles, 
information and viewpoints about their own country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years, the Canadian periodical publishing industry has 
played a very important role in developing our cultural 
identity.  With the support of the federal government, the 
industry has grown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Forty years ago, there were 660 Canadian periodicals, with an 
annual circulation of 28 million copies, representing 20% of all 
periodicals sold in Canada. 
Today, there are over 1,500 periodicals, with a circulation of 
539 million, representing 65% of all periodicals sold in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996-97, the Canadian publishing industry brought in 
over $1 billion, and provided jobs for close to 6,000 Canadians. 
This industry illustrates the success of Canada's cultural 
policy, which is why it is important to support this bill. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1805"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out that over 60% of all revenues reported, or 
$647 million, came from advertising, and this can go as high as 
80% and up for general and special-interest periodicals.  Paid 
subscriptions and newsstand sales are not enough to ensure the 
survival of periodicals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members have surely all had periodicals distributed free to 
their home or office.  These are made possible by the sale of 
advertising services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Advertising revenues are vital, as I will explain.  Each page of 
advertising pays for one page of editorial content.  American 
publishers have a net competitive advantage over their Canadian 
counterparts when it comes to supplying advertising services to 
Canada.  This is because they can recycle content for the 
Canadian market.  Furthermore, the size of the American market 
is conducive to economies of scale in the periodical industry. 
Bill C-55 seeks to address this unfair situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament must ensure the economic survival of the Canadian 
periodical publishing industry and the continued prosperity of 
Canadian publishers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Minister of Canadian Heritage said, periodicals differ 
from other products, in that they are vehicles for the 
expression of our unique views and experiences.  We want those 
views and experiences to be heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will not make it difficult to import foreign 
periodicals.  In this regard, our country is one of the most 
open in the world.  The United States exports more periodicals 
into Canada than do all other countries combined.  Foreign 
publishers will be able to go on selling their periodicals 
without restriction in Canada, and Canadians will have the same 
access to foreign periodicals they have always had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new legislation will simply ensure that Canadian periodical 
publishers have access to the advertising revenues they need to 
create periodicals that give voice to our own cultural identity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is very aware of the advantages and opportunities of 
increased globalization, and intends to promote international 
trade and establish corresponding rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada also intends to support our cultural diversity, in which 
periodicals play an important role.  We believe that these two 
goals can coexist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to pass this bill quickly 
because, as we have mentioned throughout the debate, it is 
important for all Canadians and for Canadian jobs.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, earlier in the debate the government deputy whip 
suggested that further debate on the bill was pointless.  She 
noted that about a dozen Reformers had spoken and the debate was 
repetitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a look for a minute at time allocation 
statistics.  For example, on Bill C-36 at report stage and third 
reading Reform only had 50 minutes of debate on that bill before 
time allocation was moved.  There was a total of two hours and 15 
minutes of debate before time allocation was moved.  The total 
time of debate before and after time allocation on Bill C-36 was 
only three hours of debate by the official opposition, for a 
total of nine hours and 12 minutes of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Bill C-36 at second reading Reform only spoke for one hour 
and six minutes before time allocation was moved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Bill C-43 Reform spoke for an hour and 56 minutes before time 
allocation was moved, and the total debate time on that bill was 
3 hours and 19 minutes out of a total of 11 hours and 25 minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These bills are important bill.  Bill C-36 was the budget 
implementation bill. 
Bill C-43 was the custom and revenue agency bill.  Not small 
potatoes but important bills which the Canadian public expected 
to be debated in the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At second reading on Bill C-2, the Canada pension plan, the 
official opposition only spoke for an hour and 41 minutes.  When 
time allocation was called Reform had only spoken for an hour and 
51 minutes out of a total of 11 hours and 15 minutes of debate 
time.  That is not much time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Bill C-2 at report stage and third reading the official 
opposition again only spoke for an hour and 20 minutes before 
time allocation was moved.  The total debate time was two hours 
and 45 minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a lot of people concerned about the Canada pension 
plan.  We saw earlier where the Minister of Finance removed the 
individual who was responsible for doing the numbers on the 
Canada pension plan.  He did not want the real straight goods on 
it and he did not want debate to go on in the House on that very 
important bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-4 respecting the wheat board is important to Canadians on 
the prairies.  Reform had a total of eight hours debate on that 
bill before time allocation was moved.  There was much to be said 
about that bill.  There were many problems with it.  It was of 
great interest to Canadians on the prairies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Bill C-3, the DNA bill, Reform had two hours and 15 minutes 
of debate time before time allocation was moved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These kinds of numbers are simply unacceptable in a democratic 
society.  This place is supposed to be about debate.  It is 
supposed to be about discussion of ideas.  We are supposed to 
debate the principles behind these bills and what they mean to 
Canadian people.  We are not supposed to get into derogatory 
personal comments and we do not.  We debate the issues.  That is 
what it is supposed to be about.  That is what we are talking 
about in these bills, the issues at hand.  Yet if the government 
continually moves time allocation, what is the point of being 
here? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day when time allocation was moved on a justice bill 
my colleague from Wild Rose said “We might as well turn this 
over to the judges.  There is no point in even being in this 
place to try to express the interests and the concerns of the 
Canadian public”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the equalization bill, Bill C-65, there were three hours and 
35 minutes of debate at second reading before time allocation was 
moved.  It is an important bill, a bill that is especially 
important to the province of British Columbia which suffers under 
a socialist government.  Its economy is in a nose dive and I do 
not think we have seen bottom.  Yet we are required under the 
equalization bill to continue paying the piper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us today is an important one.  It is a bill that 
has a lot to do with the health of Canadian industry.  It is a 
bill which fails to recognize that about $1 billion a day of 
trade is done between Canada and the United States.  That does 
not mean to say that we have to capitulate to every American 
complaint and everything that Americans do not find satisfactory. 
Far from it.  What it does say is that we have to be reasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is this bill not reasonable, but it fails to recognize 
that Canadians can fend for themselves, that there is a place in 
the market for Canadian performers, and that there is a place in 
the market in Canada for Canadian magazines.  They will be 
supported by Canadians.  Canadians want to hear what other 
Canadians have to say about events in the world. 
They want to hear about what Canadians have to say about events 
taking place in this country.  They are not prepared to simply go 
to U.S. sources and publications for news and items of interest 
to Canadians.

too long to wait.  Every day in the country that someone is in 
possession of child pornography is one day too long.  The 
government could have stepped in using the charter to make sure 
that did not happen.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To repeat what I said in the House, the law is still the law of 
the land.  It is only one court in the land that has ruled 
someone can possess child pornography for personal use but we are 
going to be appealing. We are awaiting the decision of the court 
of appeal where we have intervened. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One court of the land has ruled that one can do it.  Since the 
last time I had a chance to ask this question in the House, we 
had a case in Vernon where a person actually pleaded guilty to 
possession of child pornography.  That case was adjourned by the 
judge because of the situation of this ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House still say that every day is one day 
too long.  If we do not get the right decision on April 26 to 29 
on this appeal we could then be waiting a lot longer for a 
supreme court ruling. That is not good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote from the member for Scarborough Southwest in a speech he 
delivered in the House on May 11, 1993 when debating the issue of 
pornography and pedophiles: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is crucially important because the only people who are 
interested in the possession of child pornography are pedophiles. 
I would also say it is true that there are very few passive 
pedophiles, if I can put it that way, those who are prepared to 
go no further than to look at the pictures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know from various studies that pedophiles prey on 
children.  There are no one-victim pedophiles.  In fact most of 
the studies that have been done show that pedophiles, both 
heterosexual and homosexual, prey on more than 200 children each 
in their lifetimes. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case we have a government that is prepared to wait.  I 
do not think most Canadians want them to wait. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quoting again from the member for Scarborough Southwest: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of a country do we have if we do not protect our 
children from pedophiles?  What has our government done about it? 
It has done absolutely nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every child depicted is a victim for life.  They are scarred 
forever and those are the people we have to protect in this 
country. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not agree with the member more.  Remember this was a 
bill in 1993 when Liberal government members were in opposition 
and making these kinds of statements.  Now that they are in 
government they have changed their minds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do say to the government that in whatever bill it has suddenly 
discovered is on the legislative agenda it should provide for the 
broadest possible spectrum of what could be defined as child 
pornography because I would rather err on the side of protecting 
child victims than on the side of protecting child pedophiles. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why this government should have taken the action it 
could have taken quite a few weeks ago to make sure that 
pedophiles in British Columbia cannot possess child pornography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It always interesting in this House when one finds these 
speeches written by members such as one by the member for 
Scarborough Southwest who was in the opposition then and now sits 
in the government.  It is now his government that is allowing 
pedophiles in Canada to possess child pornography.  It is 
prepared to wait until a judge decides, instead of parliament 
doing the responsible thing and taking the proper action.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
clearly we are all concerned with the availability of child 
pornography in this country.  As many have said, it represents 
evidence of the sexual abuse and exploitation of children and 
perpetuates the message that they are appropriate sexual 
partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the federal government is intervening in the Sharpe 
case before the British Columbia Court of Appeal to vigorously 
defend the constitutionality of our laws which prohibit the 
possession of child pornography in any form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have all had the opportunity in the House to raise our 
concerns.  Unfortunately the member for West Vancouver—Sunshine 
Coast and other members of his party have been exploiting this 
issue and misinforming the public as well as fearmongering.  This 
is not a question of pedophiles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will recall at that time the Minister of Justice 
stressed the importance of respecting the rule of law, 
particularly where we are privileged to live in a free and 
democratic country where our Constitution and charter of rights 
are respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the minister's views, as do the majority of the 
members of the House.  Attorneys general across the country are 
still enforcing the law.  They are indicating their support for 
pursuing this matter through the courts.  All of us recognize 
that other more drastic approaches would not be in the best 
interests of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the Sharpe case has had some impact on British 
Columbia where it is binding on provincial court judges. However, 
let us be clear. Contrary to what others in the House have 
suggested, including the hon. future leader of the so-called 
united alternative, cases are not being thrown out of the courts. 
A number of cases scheduled to proceed before these judges are 
being postponed until after the Sharpe case is heard by the B.C. 
court of appeal.  Let us not forget that the attorney general of 
British Columbia has indicated that cases continue to be 
investigated in that province and charges are being laid.

constitutional and will be strongly defending this legislation 
before the British Columbia Court of Appeal shortly.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>AIRBUS 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK260"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I can see the air will be thick with party line 
today.  On November 3, 1998, I brought to the attention of the 
House a citation from page 303 of the book <I>Presumed Guilty</I> 
by William Kaplan.  In it the Prime Minister allegedly discussed 
Airbus and mused about a royal commission with an Ottawa 
businessman in the summer of 1995.  This was several months 
before November 20, 1995 when the Prime Minister claimed that he 
had learned of the investigation in a <I>Financial Post</I> 
article dated November 18, 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the Prime Minister to confirm or deny that particular 
conversation took place and would the Prime Minister stand by his 
November 1995 statement that he did not discuss Airbus prior to 
November.  As expected, the Prime Minister did not answer the 
question and simply stated that the person who gave him the 
information did not give his name and this amounted to an 
allegation based on nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Trite, dismissive, nonsense answers are becoming the norm and 
Canadians are concerned that the government could be so reckless 
in the pursuit of a conviction of an innocent man.  Despite the 
Liberal government's malicious attack and continued efforts to 
win a conviction of some sort against the former prime minister 
evidence has never been found to substantiate this cause.  This 
is a misguided investigation and the facts are disturbingly 
clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Brian Mulroney is innocent of all wrongdoings and yet the 
Liberal government will not cease and desist the RCMP 
investigation.  The Liberal government has a vendetta against the 
former prime minister which stems from the Liberals' days in 
opposition.  There are growing concerns that the current Prime 
Minister's legacy might pale by comparison.  The Liberals' plot 
for revenge is continuing to cost the taxpayers significant 
dollars, $4 million and counting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious the Liberal Party has placed its own agenda for 
vengeance ahead of the fundamental freedoms of this man.  It 
appears that while the Liberals are in government these rights do 
not have importance for Mr. Mulroney.  Mr. Mulroney knows the 
Liberal agenda all too well, for he has been presumed guilty from 
the very beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the Canadian public has found that its demands for 
responsible government in this case have fallen on deaf ears. 
The idea of wasting $4 million on the Airbus investigation is 
clearly not what the public would want and it is not responsible, 
especially when the repeated attempts to find any wrongdoing have 
continually come up completely empty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Airbus investigation has amounted to an expensive 
embarrassment for this government.  Yet, like a stubborn mule, 
the government would rather continue to waste public money than 
admitting that its insatiable obsession with defaming the 
character of a former prime minister has led it to getting 
nothing more than egg on its face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There may come a day in a civil action when we will hear from 
the important players in this matter, players like Kimberly 
Prost, her boss Mr. Corbett, Fraser Fiegenwald, the fictitious 
writer Stevie Cameron and possibly even a former justice minister 
and solicitor general.  The sad results of this vendetta may 
truly be made public at that time; all of this done in the face 
of deep cuts to RCMP budgets that have resulted in overloading a 
computer system, the CPIC information system, cuts that have 
affected significantly the ability of police officers to do their 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all that said, the following question begs to be answered 
yet again.  When will the government simply cut its losses, put 
an end to this ill founded investigation and focus on 
replenishing scarce police resources for the betterment of 
protecting Canadian citizens? 
<P><A NAME="LINK261"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Mr. Kaplan's book to which the hon. member referred adds nothing 
new to the facts of the Airbus case except for raising unfounded 
allegations and inferences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to any claims made in the book, the Prime Minister 
learned of the letter to the Swiss authorities and the Airbus 
investigation only after the letter became public on November 18, 
1995.  I also remind the hon. member, as the Minister of Justice, 
myself and other ministers who have been attacked in this House 
by the hon. member have done numerous times, of a settlement 
between former Prime Minister Mulroney and the Government of 
Canada which was signed on January 5, 1997 and which has been 
tabled in the House: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parties accept that the RCMP, on its own, initiated the 
Airbus investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parties have always acknowledged that the RCMP must continue 
investigating any allegations of illegality or wrongdoing brought 
to its attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parties accept that the RCMP and the Department of Justice 
in sending the request for assistance to Switzerland acted within 
their legitimate responsibilities in this manner.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>DEVCO 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK263"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, how has the Liberal government misled Cape Bretoners on 
Devco?  Let me count the ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Natural Resources said in this House on many 
occasions “There is no plan to shut down Devco”.  The facts are 
different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government commissioned a study by Nesbitt Burns in 
1995 to plan the sale and closure of the Cape Breton Development 
Corporation.  This plan called for a sale in 1996 or, failing 
that, in 1999.  The plan has been followed to the letter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the fall of 1998 the management of Devco said it did not have 
enough money to make the payroll and it had to be bailed out by a 
$41 million cheque from Ottawa.  Devco's management then spent 
$11 million to buy new jacks, new jacks that would only be needed 
if new walls were being developed, new mines opened.  There was 
$11 million worth of jacks, a gift to whomever buys Devco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, the corporation sold seven diesel locomotives 
without tender, locomotives needed to haul coal, locomotives 
needed to provide emergency power to the mine in the event of a 
power outage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While miners have been laid off over the last two years, more 
management personnel have been hired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These examples are just two of the many that prove a pattern of 
managed mismanagement at this crown corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the election of the Liberals in 1993 Devco has suffered 
from a slow hemorrhage, a hemorrhage of money, of workers and of 
political will.  Ultimately that is the central issue.  This 
government has been unwilling to talk openly about its very 
obvious agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nesbitt Burns communication synopsis outlined problem areas 
for the government that it needed to address in order to 
facilitate the divestiture of Devco.  A popular call-in show, 
<I>Talkback</I>, was cited as an obstacle to easing the sale.  In 
1998 the show was cancelled following pressure applied by Liberal 
advertisers, leaving Cape Bretoners without a forum to exchange 
their views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every angle was covered.  The report raised the issue of 
ownership of the coal leases, perceived as being a source of 
possible conflict with the provincial government.  Just weeks ago 
the Liberals in Ottawa announced that the issue had been examined 
from a legal perspective and they were confident of their 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only thing that changed between then and now was the wave of 
change that swept Nova Scotia.  That change saw the rejection of 
the former minister of health because of his abandonment of the 
coal industry and the election of a coal miner's daughter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been on the record on this issue many times.  I have 
predicted events concerning this process, and despite accusations 
of being hysterical from the Liberals, time has unfortunately 
proven my predictions correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I promised to stand up for the miners when I was elected.  I am 
here once again to demand accountability from this government.  I 
call on the government to openly discuss the future of Devco with 
Cape Bretoners and, as a first step, to immediately launch a 
forensic audit of the crown corporation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK264"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
when the Minister of Natural Resources made the government's 
announcement of the future direction for Devco, he indicated that 
Devco's management wished to review the human resource packages 
with union representatives.  Some of those discussions have 
already been held. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $111 million in funding which has been approved by the 
government for workforce adjustment measures include $60 million 
for an early retirement incentive program, $46 million for 
severance packages and $5 million for training for employees who 
will receive severance packages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The criteria to determine eligibility for the early retirement 
incentive program have not been pulled out of a hat.  They are 
the criteria that were negotiated between Devco and its unions 
through a joint planning committee in 1996.  They are the 
criteria that Devco's collective agreements indicate shall apply 
to the early retirement incentive program for any further 
workforce reductions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make it clear that the early retirement incentive 
program has no relationship to the pension benefits that Devco's 
employees have earned through participation in one of the 
corporation's pension plans.  Workers will continue to be 
eligible for any earned pension benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to make it clear that the provisions of Devco's 
collective agreements with its unions will be honoured. 
These provisions indicate that in the event of a site closure 
employees shall be laid off in reverse order of seniority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that many of the longer serving employees who will 
not be eligible under the early retirement incentive program will 
continue to be employed. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
have been adopted. Accordingly, this House stands adjourned 
until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
