	The House resumed from June 1, 1995, consideration of the 
motion that, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
take the measures necessary for the legal recognition of same sex 
spouses.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would like to point out to 
the House that there are 42 minutes remaining in the debate on 
Motion M-264.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There are 42 minutes remaining in debate on Private Members' 
Business Motion No. 264. When M-264 was last before the House 
the hon. member for Jonquière had three minutes remaining for 
debate.
<P>
	Resuming debate.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jean Payne (St. John's West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member has moved that the government should take the measures 
necessary for legal recognition of same sex spouses.
<P>
	By ``legal recognition of same sex spouses'' I am unclear 
whether he means same sex partners should be able to register, as I 
understand they can do on Denmark, or that benefits currently 
given to married and common law spouses should be extended to 
same sex partners.
<P>
	Neither option is viable to my mind given the current state of the 
law. Perhaps it would have been a better motion had it been made in 
a provincial legislature rather than here in the House of Commons.
<P>
	The federal government has very limited jurisdiction in the area 
of legal recognition of personal relationships. The constitution 
divides jurisdiction in the area of family law between the 
provincial legislatures and the federal Parliament. The jurisdiction 
for marriage is divided, with  the provinces being responsible for 
the solemnization of marriage.
<P>
	Until fairly recently historical common law spouses were not 
recognized by our law. The term is a misnomer in any event as 
common law spouses do not actually exist in common law or judge 
made law. They actually are created by statute law; not one statute 
at that but by a large number of statutes at both federal and 
provincial levels. In other words, unless a particular statute 
specifically provides that a reference to spouse will include 
common law relationships they are not included for the purpose of 
the benefit in issue.
<P>
	The major statute laws that recognize common law spouses are 
the provincial family law statutes. These statutes create the major 
legal obligations imposed on common law spouses should the 
relationship break down. They deal with the division of property, 
support obligations between former spouses and any children, and 
yet even here the provincial law is not consistent across the 
country. Common law spouses are subject to different legal 
obligations under different provincial family law statutes across the 
provinces. They are not even recognized in two provinces 
including Quebec, the province of residence of the hon. member 
proposing this measure.
<P>
<B>(1105 )</B>
<P>
	Common law marriage is a quite different concept from that of 
common law spouses. Common law marriage existed only in the 
early settlement days of Canada when a minister or a priest was 
often difficult to find. Although there is some speculation that the 
concept may still exist in common law in Canada, it would apply 
only in opposite an sex context. Therefore if the provincial family 
law is the main source of legal obligations between spouses, then it 
would seem more appropriate that any legal recognition of same 
sex partners would come first under provincial family law. As I 
understand it, this was primarily the way in which common law 
relationships first gained legal recognition.
<P>
	As a result of several high profile cases before the Supreme 
Court of Canada, the courts recognized through the doctrines of 
unjust enrichment and constructive trust the contribution of a 
woman who had lived for a long period of time with a man as 
married, even though they had not married.
<P>
	Legislative changes followed thereafter, starting primarily with 
family law and then slowly with provincial  family law and then 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14502"> 14502 </A></B>
<P>
slowly moving into the benefits field. This legal recognition is 
recent in Canadian law. The changes to the Income Tax Act to 
reorganize common law spouses have just come about in the last 
year or two, after the majority of provincial family law statutes 
recognized the status. It is only recently that the majority of the 
Supreme Court of Canada stated in the Miron decision that in the 
circumstances of this case it was discriminatory to treat unmarried 
couples differently from married couples.
<P>
	The only references in federal law to personal relationships 
either follow blood or marriage relationships, which are relatively 
easy to prove, or copy provincial family law definitions of common 
law relationships. At the federal level spouses are mostly included 
in legislation for the purposes of employment benefits, government 
pension plans, income tax and so on.
<P>
	The concern is that if we were to extend these benefits to same 
sex partners at the federal level first, before the provincial family 
law extends any legal obligations, this could create a situation of 
unfairness. Spouses, both married and common law, are currently 
subject to a package of legal rights and responsibilities created by a 
combination of federal and provincial laws.
<P>
	It is because spouses are subject to legal obligations, such as 
support obligations on the breakdown of the relationship, that they 
are also eligible for benefits, such as survivor benefits under 
pension plans. It is for the provinces to extend the obligations 
before we should extend benefits under federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	How would we accomplish what the hon. member is asking for? 
How would we take the measures necessary for the legal 
recognition of same spouses, even were we to agree that this should 
be done? It is clear from the history of the recognition of common 
law relationships that this was not accomplished by passing a 
statute called the common law spouses act, nor was this legal 
recognition even accomplished by the government at any level.
<P>
	The fact of social change was first acknowledged by the courts in 
looking at unfairness and unjust enrichment between two partners 
who had not married. The courts felt strongly that individuals who 
were living together as if married and so were getting all of the 
advantages of being married, such as working together to afford a 
better lifestyle than either would have been able to achieve living 
alone, should not be able to avoid taking on the obligations of 
married persons simply by choosing not to marry. Particularly in a 
situation such as that represented in the first few high profile cases, 
the common law wife needed the protection of the law.
<P>
	However, this is a controversial enough subject with regard to 
opposite sex common law couples. Many common law couples 
continue to disagree and feel frustrated that the law deems their 
relationship to be akin  to marriage after a certain time has passed. 
Many still feel that their choice not to marry should be respected by 
the law.
<P>
	How much more of a problem will this be with same sex couples 
who may not be public about their relationships? Conversely, is it 
fair to recognize those same sex couples who do wish to be open 
about their relationships?
<P>
	For a numbers of reasons, the motion is premature and not 
feasible for the federal government to adopt without the full 
co-operation of the provincial legislatures.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased with this opportunity to rise in the House today, especially 
since I unconditionally support Motion M-264, which seeks the 
legal recognition of same sex spouses. Voting for this motion will 
give nearly 10 per cent of the population the recognition to which it 
is entitled.
<P>
	Since the Quebec government launched its prereferendum 
campaign, the federal government has spent millions of dollars of 
taxpayers' money to convince us that Canada is one of the best 
countries in the world to live in, a country that is tolerant and 
especially, a country that accepts diversity.
<P>
	I therefore ask this government to act accordingly and support 
the motion standing in the name of my colleague, the hon. member 
for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. In fact, the hon. member for Central 
Nova told us in her speech on the same topic that Canadians are 
tolerant and respect and appreciate diversity.
<P>
	Will the government be as tolerant and show as much respect for 
diversity as the hon. member? In May 1994, the Minister of Justice 
also promised to redefine, in fairly broad terms, the ties between 
people who live together, are interdependent and should therefore 
have the same social benefits as traditional families, which does 
not mean-and I can understand that-changing the concept of the 
family. Let us be clear about this. The motion does not seek to 
redefine the family but to enhance the rights of certain people and 
ensure that discrimination against homosexuals is unacceptable in 
Canada.
<P>
	Last June, the Reform Party member for Elk Island reminded us, 
and I quote: ``As legislators, we have a responsibility, an 
obligation, a high calling to do what is right for our country and its 
citizens''. He directed this message to all Canadians, without 
exception. It included all Canadians. Consequently, our role as 
legislators, in my opinion, is to set an example by being 
openminded, by our sense of justice and our sense of fairness.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14503"> 14503 </A></B>
<P>
	That is why, according to this motion, we have a duty to amend, 
yes, amend all provisions of Canadian legislation concerning 
spouses. It is a matter of justice, fairness and equality for all 
citizens.
<P>
	Let us recall that, last May, the Supreme Court of Canada 
unanimously agreed that sexual orientation should be added to 
section 15 of the charter, thus prohibiting discrimination against 
homosexual men and women.
<P>
	While the cities of Toronto, Vancouver and Ottawa-to name but 
a few-as well as many private and public companies also 
recognize same sex spouses, we in the Parliament of Canada, a 
supposedly tolerant country that allows anyone to make racist 
comments or distribute hate propaganda, deny such a basic right to 
10 per cent of our population.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	I see this as an injustice. A closer look at the definition of the 
term ``discrimination'' shows that it means imposing on an 
individual or group of individuals certain burdens, obligations 
or-as in this case-disadvantages that are not imposed on other 
groups. Discrimination also means denying or restricting access to 
the opportunities, benefits or advantages offered to other members 
of society. That is discrimination.
<P>
	In fact, the Quebec human rights commission has recommended 
that the government review all its laws and regulations and pass a 
law that would make all legislation dealing with spousal issues 
comply with the charter, so that same sex spouses can enjoy the 
same rights as heterosexual common law couples.
<P>
	Will allowing same sex spouses to take bereavement leave when 
their lifelong partners die change anything for heterosexual 
Canadians? Will allowing same sex spouses to receive benefits 
from public pension plans after their partners die or to contribute to 
spousal RRSPs change anything for the remaining 90 per cent of 
the Canadian population? I do not even want to hear the argument 
that such a measure would result in higher costs.
<P>
	According to the studies done by many private and even public 
companies, it would cost less than 1 per cent to correct this 
situation. Since this Parliament is supposedly not homophobic-as 
many members keep bragging about in this House-I see no reason 
why we should not recognize same sex spouses. This would be 
quite normal and not a privilege granted to one group of people. On 
the contrary, it would simply be fair to a segment of our population.
<P>
	I remind you that this is 1995. Today's reality is completely 
different from what it was 50, 30 or even 10 years ago. Federalists 
boast that this institution, the Parliament of Canada, is not out of 
step, obsolete or ossified. They should just prove it and stop talking 
about the status quo. The status quo is nothing but a vacuum.  
Again, voting in favour of this motion does not recognize any 
special rights except for the right to equality. Quebecers are fed up 
with the double standard inherent in this government's policies. We 
already know that a sovereign Quebec will fight such measures. 
The question is: Will the Canadian government be as courageous as 
the Quebec government?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
welcome back to the House. It is good to be here.
<P>
	It is a privilege to speak to this motion today because the issue of 
same sex marriage has been raised to such a high level of 
awareness in Canada.
<P>
	As I see it the motion can be approached in two different ways. 
We can talk about the morality of the homosexual lifestyle which is 
a bona fide thing to do. After all, the gay and lesbian community 
bases its arguments for inclusion on moral grounds arguing that 
what it does is morally acceptable and therefore worthy of 
government recognition. However, it is not necessary to cast same 
sex benefits in a moral framework. We can leave aside the moral 
question for another day and approach this from a pragmatic 
viewpoint. To set the stage for a pragmatic discussion, allow me to 
talk about definitions for a moment because this motion is really 
about societal definitions.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	Our society is becoming less and less categorical in its societal 
definitions and more graduated in every way. Let me give an 
example. There used to be a huge distinction between social classes 
in society. If one was born a peasant one could never be a nobleman 
and vice versa. However, for a variety of historical reasons the 
distinctions between classes disappeared and status and influence 
are now seen to be on a gradual continuum, except perhaps for a 
few people born lucky like the Royals or maybe the Kennedys.
<P>
	Morality is another example. Things used to be seen in black and 
white in a moral sense because the laws people lived by were held 
to be revealed by God. Although these laws seemed arbitrary, the 
sharply defined moral categories lent a certain stability to life in 
society.
<P>
	Over the last two centuries people became less convinced about 
God and divine law so the old value categories became blurred and 
fuzzy. The new values are relative to each situation. People say that 
there are no absolutes and that each situation must be judged on its 
own merits.
<P>
	The assault on all social definitions in our society also applies to 
the family. Last year was the UN year of the family and the theme 
was ``The Family-The Smallest Democracy at the Heart of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14504"> 14504 </A></B>
<P>
Society''. This statement  marks an enormous redefinition in our 
culture, that a family is a democracy.
<P>
	Authority used to be categorical with parents giving the orders 
and the children listening. If the UN had its way, family matters 
might be decided democratically. I do not know how but that is 
what the UN suggests.
<P>
	However since any undemocratic organization is no longer 
considered to be legitimate in the eyes of the state, this would give 
the state the rationale to intervene in what it would call an 
authoritarian family or traditional family. The idea of a democratic 
family therefore reduces the authority of parents and 
fundamentally alters the security of the family in relation to the 
state.
<P>
	Just as the authority within the family is being dispersed, the 
definition of family seems to be broadening. Listen to what Hillary 
Clinton said last year, ironically on Mother's Day. Talking about 
the family she said: ``If it ever did, the traditional family no longer 
does consist of two parents, two children, a dog, a house with a 
white picket fence and a stationwagon in the driveway''.
<P>
	The First Lady went on to recommend what she called the 
extended family to fill the void as traditional families dwindle and 
to look out for friends, neighbours and fellow citizens as they 
would members of their own families. She concluded by saying: 
``When the traditional bonds of family are too often frayed we all 
need to appreciate that in a very real sense we have all become an 
extended family''.
<P>
	What the First Lady really said is that the traditional family, the 
defining boundary between the mom, the dad and the kids is now 
disappearing and a continuum of other relationships should be 
added to it. Here a conflict emerges. At the same time as societal 
definitions broaden, for financial reasons the ability of all 
governments to grant benefits is being severely restricted. In order 
to apportion benefits in some rational manner the logical answer 
for government is to narrow its definitions of who may receive 
them. Therefore governments should be looking to restrict their 
definitions, not broaden them.
<P>
	I am not pronouncing a judgment on whether or not homosexuals 
should live together. However, I am saying that for the purposes of 
government benefits society cannot afford to broaden its 
definitions to apportion benefits to many more new groups, 
including homosexual unions.
<P>
	The member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve may argue that he 
does not want benefits; he simply wants rights, specifically the 
right to be recognized as a married couple. He might say that a 
marriage ceremony does not cost anything but in Canada rights are 
the door to entitlements.
<P>
	The concept of entitlement is a very powerful thing in Canadian 
law. If a person is defined as someone who is  eligible to receive 
unemployment insurance for example that benefit becomes a right, 
an entitlement and no one can deny it to that person. Marriage 
brings with it entitlements as well. Once the right has been given 
there would be no way to hold back the benefits.
<P>
	There is another reason to decide against this motion. The 
redefinition of the family would open up a Pandora's box of 
definition problems for other groups. There is no logical stopping 
point between a homosexual couple and any number of other 
unions. If a homosexual couple wants to be a family why not 
roommates or people living together in group homes? Why not 
close friends living under different roofs? By surrendering the 
traditional definition of the family, government would surrender its 
ability to choose who receives benefits and who does not.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	I want to remind members that in practice the concept of the 
nuclear family is really quite static. As late as 1949 anthropologist 
George Murdock completed a study of 250 societies worldwide and 
said: ``The nuclear family is a universal human social grouping 
either as the sole prevailing form of the family or as the basic unit 
from which more complex familial forms are compounded. It 
exists as a distinct and strongly functional group in every known 
society''.
<P>
	A Stats Canada study released last year found that in 1941, well 
prior to that study, 88 per cent of Canadians were living in nuclear 
families. In 1991, 87 per cent of Canadians were still living in this 
husband and wife model. In other words the number of people 
living in nuclear families or in husband and wife with children 
families has remained constant for 50 years.
<P>
	Therefore attitudes toward the nuclear family and real life 
practice are not changing as much as we are led to believe by 
activists who manipulate or would like to manipulate members of 
Parliament and the media. Members should not be stampeded 
toward redefinition by media criticism and noisy pressure group 
tactics.
<P>
	It seems to me that interest groups exercising profound political 
pressure over several decades have managed to slice up the 
government benefits pie in ways that are advantageous to them and 
disadvantageous to nuclear families when the nuclear family is one 
of the foundations of our society and needs to be strengthened, not 
weakened.
<P>
	For this reason I introduced a private member's bill called the 
auditor general for the family act. This bill would establish a small 
body with a limit of 20 employees to advise Parliament about the 
ways it could support and strengthen the nuclear family in Canada. 
It is interesting that later this week we will be debating in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14505"> 14505 </A></B>
<P>
House the need for the country to have an environmental auditor 
yet we do not have the same sort of thing advocating on behalf of 
the nuclear family.
<P>
	I am proud of the bill I have put together because although 
society might accept a wide variety of living arrangements it 
should not be obligated to support every societal arrangement. It 
must allocate its precious resources to those tried and true social 
structures which have been common within Canadian society for 
centuries and are common across literally hundreds of cultures 
around the world.
<P>
	The February issue of <I>U.S. News and World Report</I> details 
studies from the states showing that moms and dads together are 
the ideal parental form. Nothing else is as effective in cutting 
poverty and fighting crime, teenage pregnancies, suicide and 
mental illness. Even so, nuclear families continue to be 
discriminated against even in taxation within our own country. The 
time has come to expose this government sanctioned 
discrimination against nuclear families. That is why I hope when 
my bill does come up for a vote we will be able to deal with that 
properly.
<P>
	In closing, I want the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve 
with whom I sat on the standing committee for human rights in the 
last session to know that I appreciate him and his work on the 
committee even though we might disagree on this issue. Although I 
state freely that I have moral reservations about the homosexual 
lifestyle, I have approached the issue purely on the pragmatic 
reasons I have outlined. Same sex benefits are not in the public 
interest.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in this debate on the motion 
put forward by my hon. colleague from Hochelaga-Maisonneuve:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should take the measures 
necessary for the legal recognition of same-sex spouses.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mr. Speaker, I would like first of all to commend the hon. 
member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve for having the courage to 
table in this House a motion that makes us see, in terms of human 
rights, what is really at stake here and, more importantly, where the 
members of this House, particularly our colleagues from the 
Reform Party as well as certain members of the Liberal majority, 
really stand on this issue.
<P>
	Several of my colleagues, including the hon. member for 
Chicoutimi who spoke a moment ago, the hon. member for 
Jonquière who spoke during the first hour of debate and, of course, 
the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, addressed the 
merits of the question of recognizing the rights of same sex 
spouses, the need to take action and the economic impact of such a 
decision. I therefore have no intention of repeating what was said 
as these points were quite aptly made.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	I would like to address what appears to be the main issue: is this 
a debate on homosexuality or a debate on human rights?
<P>
	It is true that we are used to hearing our colleagues from the 
Reform Party talk that way. One would think that Reform members 
have become all round right wing fundamentalists. We are used to 
this kind of language, but there is still a limit to what I can tolerate.
<P>
	When it comes to despicable, shameful and downright 
unacceptable remarks, our Liberal colleague from Central Nova 
takes the cake. She was heard making such remarks more than once 
in this House; first, during the debate on Bill C-41 and again when 
she spoke on the motion put forward by my hon. colleague from 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. What she said was a disgrace-I 
repeat, a disgrace-for this House, the Liberal majority and 
democracy itself.
<P>
	What is it that the member for Central Nova said and was 
applauded for by Reform members? In her remarks on Bill C-41, 
she said, and I quote: ``Homosexuality is not natural; it is immoral 
and it is undermining the inherent rights and values of our 
Canadian families and it must not and should not be condoned''.
<P>
	And she added: ``-a faction in our society which is 
undermining and destroying our Canadian values and Christian 
morality-We have the majority-I suppose she is referring to the 
heterosexual community here. We have a democracy. I am 
representing in my viewpoint the majority of Canadians''.
<P>
	If this is the kind of society and the kind of freedom that Canada 
has to offer, and if the member for Central Nova is, as she claimed, 
speaking on behalf of most Canadians, then it is urgent for us 
Quebecers to get out of this country.
<P>
	We take exception to such comments. The debate in this House is 
on the motion tabled by my colleague, the member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, and it has to do with human rights, not 
homosexuality. If there are members in this House who have 
doubts as to their own sexual orientation, they should go for some 
therapy. This is not the place for group therapy. As a democratic 
institution, Parliament must ensure that democratic values are 
respected and promoted. I dare say that one of the most important 
democratic values is the respect of individuals in each and every 
one of our families.
<P>
	We all know men and women who live their homosexuality. Do 
Reform Party members claim that these people should be 
eliminated, that their most basic rights should not be recognized? 
We are not saying that the House should pass a motion to promote 
homosexuality, no more than it should promote heterosexuality. 
What we are saying is that if two people, whether a man and a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14506"> 14506 </A></B>
<P>
woman, two men or two women, decide to live together, why 
should they not be treated  with respect and fairness in our laws? 
This is what the debate is all about. This is the issue that we will 
vote on in a few minutes.
<P>
	I did not hear many Liberal Party members speak in favour of 
this motion. Am I to understand that they support the views 
expressed by the member for Central Nova?
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	I am putting the question to them. There are a few minutes left 
and I would appreciate an answer. This is a fundamental debate on 
human rights. These days, and this is particularly true of Liberal 
Party members, many are trying to champion individual freedoms 
in Quebec. I would like to hear some Liberal members address the 
issue today.
<P>
	It should also be pointed out that values evolve with time. Let me 
quote the member for Central Nova. She made these comments in 
this House, during the debate on this motion. I could not believe 
what I was hearing. On June 1, 1995, the member said, in reference 
to the motion tabled by the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve: 
``All these demands are encroaching on and undermining the 
inherent and inviolable rights of families. Families have existed 
before the church. Families have existed before the state. 
Parliament has absolutely no legal or constitutional authority to 
redefine family, or to enter into the realm of the sanctity of 
marriage''. Given the reasoning of the member for Central Nova, 
there would never have been a Parliament, since Parliament is there 
to pass legislation and grant rights to the population.
<P>
	Again, since Parliament necessarily came after families and after 
the church, it would never have existed, based on the member's 
reasoning. As we all know, and as the member for Chicoutimi 
pointed out just a few moments ago, values change over time. 
Thirty or forty years ago, there was no recognition of common law 
spouses. Divorced people were pointed at, perceived within their 
communities as abnormal, as needing to be watched and reported 
on. Unwed mothers had to hide away, give birth to their babies in 
institutions and then give them up. All that barely 30 or 40 years 
ago. That is how it was in Quebec and I imagine it was the same 
everywhere in Canada.
<P>
	The disabled were seen as invalids who generally had to be 
institutionalized. Seventy-five years ago, Canadian women did not 
have the right to vote. Fifty years ago that was the situation in 
Quebec. There was slavery in the United States 150 years ago. Four 
hundred years ago Galileo was imprisoned for saying that the earth 
was round. Human kind has evolved since it first appeared on this 
planet. I trust that this process will continue and that the example of 
the member for Central Nova will be nothing more than one 
unfortunate anecdote in the history of humanity.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I remind the House the 
question will be put at 11.45 a.m. We entered this debate at 11.03 
a.m. with 42 minutes of maximum debate time. I want to forewarn 
the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in speaking to Motion No. 264 I will focus my discussion on three 
of the concerns I have relating to this motion: the opposition 
Canadians appear to hold in recognizing same sex relationships; 
the extremely limited number of people such drastic changes would 
benefit; the excessive cost both in time and money resulting from 
the passage and implementation of Motion No. 264.
<P>
	Much of the debate over this motion has centred around the 
various financial and legal benefits currently available only to 
opposite sex couples. The reasoning behind these benefits lies in 
the desire of all levels of government to protect and preserve the 
two parent nuclear family.
<P>
	From biblical times to the present day, the traditional family has 
been viewed as an ideal family structure. As well, it is the building 
block of the extended family, the cornerstone of contemporary 
Canadian life.
<P>
	The dozens of programs directed toward traditional couples and 
families have been brought in over many years after careful study 
and discussion.
<P>
<B>(1140 )</B>
<P>
	Support of the traditional family remains widespread today. 
According to a recent Angus Reid poll, 68 per cent of all Canadians 
believe the traditional two parent family is the very best family 
model in which to raise children. If we talk to educators and 
counsellors across the country they will tell us that on average the 
most well adjusted, well behaved children are those who come 
from the traditional ideal family model consisting of a father, a 
mother and children.
<P>
	The sorts of radical changes advocated by the motion do nothing 
whatsoever to enhance the nuclear family. Rather, they remove the 
distinctiveness and uniqueness, reducing the traditional family 
structure from the ideal choice to simply one choice among a range 
of options. I refuse to stand by and let this happen.
<P>
	It appears this opinion is shared by the vast majority of 
Canadians. Again according to a recent Angus Reid poll, a poll 
conducted for the international year of the family, a solid 60 per 
cent of Canadians rejected the idea of benefits for same sex couples 
and 85 per cent objected to paying higher taxes to fund benefits for 
same sex couples.
<P>
	As well, a recent constituency poll showed me that 77 per cent of 
the people in my riding oppose the official sanctioning of same sex 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14507"> 14507 </A></B>
<P>
couples in the manner the hon. member is advocating. The people 
of Cariboo-Chilcotin and the people of Canada have spoken out 
on the motion. They are not saying no to the principle of  personal 
choice and they are not saying no to members' sexual orientation. 
They are saying no to full legal recognition of same sex couples.
<P>
	Motion No. 264 is asking for our opinion as MPs on the issue. 
Members of Parliament are charged with the duty of representing 
their constituents and reflecting the will of Canadians in 
legislation. Canadians have clearly stated their opinion in the 
matter and I certainly intend to respect it.
<P>
	We must also be realistic about the number of people the motion 
and the changes it could bring into being will affect. Often the 
figure of 10 per cent is cited as if to create the impression of a large 
invisible minority clamouring for rights. However, numerous 
studies have placed the percentage of homosexuals within Canada 
at between 1 per cent and 3 per cent. According to Professor 
Edmund Bloedow of Carleton University, fewer than 5 per cent of 
these individuals are in some form of permanent or committed 
relationship. Sociologists Alan Bell and Martin Weinberg, in their 
book Homosexualities, assert that a mere 1 per cent of people 
within the homosexual community are committed to a single 
lifetime partner.
<P>
	I therefore question the necessity and urgency of debating the 
principle of same sex couple recognition. The hon. member has 
shared with the House the normality of same sex couples and how 
they are virtually identical to opposite sex couples. However, 
academics have gone on record to argue that committed same sex 
couples are more the exception than the norm by far within the 
homosexual community.
<P>
	Before the House even considers making the kinds of changes 
advocated by the hon. member, we as members of Parliament have 
to see proof that committed relationships are the ideal majority 
preference, not the abnormality in the homosexual context.
<P>
	To grant the sort of recognition the hon. member is seeking he 
would have the House use hundreds of hours of precious time, 
changing every piece of legislation mentioning the word couple 
and spending millions upon millions of dollars in legal fees, 
additional payouts, and supplemental benefits. The end result of 
the motion, when all is said and done, would be either higher taxes, 
increased debt, or reduced funding for programs supporting the 
traditional family. These are results Canadians do not support.
<P>
	Canada has little to gain and much to lose with the passage of the 
motion. When the matter comes to a vote I intend to heed the 
wishes of my fellow citizens and my constituents and vote against 
Motion No. 264 as it now stands.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe there is a tradition in this 
House allowing the sponsor to close the debate. If I may I would 
therefore request the consent of the House to make use of that 
entitlement, two minutes more.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Since the period of debate is

unanimous consent of the House to conclude the debate, for a 
maximum duration of two minutes. Is there unanimous consent?

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> In my opinion the nays have 
it.
<P>
	<I>And more than five members having risen:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Call in the members.

I will then ask the other members supporting the motion on the

of those supporting the motion on the opposite side of the House 
will be recorded. The votes of those opposing the motion will be

a ruling of the Speaker last June with regard to the wearing of 
exhibits in the House. I would like to challenge that the member for 
Halifax is wearing an exhibit which I do not think is proper in this 
assembly.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I thank the member for 
Lethbridge for his intervention. Perhaps I might seek the counsel of 
the table officers for a moment, please.
<P>
	The member for Lethbridge raises an issue following a ruling 
made by the Speaker on an issue as we drew near to the summer 
recess period. I would hope, as an occupant of this same chair, to 
maintain the consistency of the ruling of the Speaker at that time.
<P>
	I must state unequivocally that I did not personally view the 
exhibit, be it a lapel button or otherwise. However, if in fact it drew 
the attention of a member or others we would hope and call upon 
members on both sides of the House to be mindful of the ruling of 
the Speaker in June regarding exhibits, lapel pins, et cetera. The 
Chair will endeavour to maintain a consistent interpretation of that 
ruling throughout this session.
<P>
<B>(1215 )</B>
<P>
	I thank the member for Lethbridge for his intervention. I regret I 
cannot act differently. As I said, I did not personally view this 
exhibit. I trust that this intervention will remind us all of the ruling 
in June, that we will be respectful of that ruling and adhere to the 
intervention of the Speaker.

	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-83, an act to amend the 
Auditor General Act be now be read the second time and referred to 
a committee.
<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, today with the proposed amendments to 
the Auditor General Act, I believe the government is making 
profound changes in the way it does business in order to make sure 
that it's environmental agenda is integrated with Canada's 
economic agenda.
<P>
	Today we are also fulfilling a major election commitment of the 
Prime Minister and the Liberal Party. In the red book we said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Sustainable development, integrating economic with environmental goals 
fits in the Liberal tradition of social investment and sound economic policy. 
Preventive environmental care is the foundation of the Liberal approach to 
sustainable development.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We also said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is past time for the federal government across all departments to act on this 
understanding by adopting economic and environmental agendas that 
converge.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Since assuming office we have tried to be guided by this belief. 
Our approach has been to integrate economic, social, 
environmental and foreign policies.
<P>
	I believe we are serious about promoting sustainable 
development. We are serious about the greening of government. 
We are serious about getting the federal government's act together 
on environmental issues. We want to be held accountable for our 
environmental actions and our environmental planning.
<P>
	We are serious about these things because Canadians want a 
healthy country in which we and our children can work to achieve 
our aspirations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	One vital aspect of our approach is to ensure that the 
environment and sustainable development form an integral part of 
the decision-making process in all federal government 
departments.
<P>
	We are therefore talking about decisions on new policy, new 
programs and new regulations or legislation and on existing texts. 
We are also talking about decisions concerning departmental 
management of buildings, facilities and operations.
<P>
	Proposals for amendments to the Auditor General Act now 
before the House will result in much of the integration we are 
aiming for. They form a key part of the government's response last 
fall to the initial report by the Standing Committee on Environment 
and Sustainable Development, entitled the ``commissioner of 
environment and sustainable development''.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	Under the enlightened leadership of the hon. member for 
Davenport and with the support of all the members, the report gave 
careful consideration to the government's commitment in the red 
book to establishing an environmental function equivalent to that 
of the auditor general. The committee felt that, while it is vital to 
audit existing government documents, it is even more important to 
ensure that environmental considerations are a fundamental 
consideration in all departmental planning.
<P>
	The committee called for greater environmental auditing of 
government policies, programs and legislation. It felt that the 
government must report to Parliament and to the public on the 
progress it makes in achieving its objectives.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The committee advocated the idea that the government go 
beyond simply an environmental auditor and instead establish a 
commissioner of environment and sustainable development. In 
these proposed amendments to the Auditor General Act the 
government will establish a commissioner and I hope meet the 
objectives of the committee's report.
<P>
	The amendments do contain one departure from the committee's 
report and that is to create the commissioner of environment and 
sustainable development not as a separate position but within the 
existing framework of the office of the auditor general as 
recommended in the minority report. This is not in any way to be 
seen as a retreat from our red book pledge. Indeed I believe it will 
prove to be an effective way of achieving our promise.
<P>
	The office of the auditor general has clout. When the auditor 
general speaks, departments of government  listen. It is indepen-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14510"> 14510 </A></B>
<P>
dent from government, it is well respected and it has the expertise, 
as we saw recently in its initial assessments of environmental 
auditing of the government.
<P>
	For all these reasons I believe it can greatly enhance the 
government's auditing of its environmental performance. There is 
another advantage to this innovation. Within the work of the 
auditor general, issues of environment and sustainable 
development must be directly integrated into economic 
considerations. This kind of integration is what sustainable 
development must be about. It is not a separate vertical approach 
but rather a horizontal approach which must de facto involve every 
department of government.
<P>
	What then is the substance of these amendments to the Auditor 
General Act that I am proposing today?
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	First, as I mentioned, these amendments establish the role of the 
commissioner of the environment and of the office of sustainable 
development within the office of the auditor general, as the official 
opposition has proposed. The commissioner would report directly 
to the auditor general and would work with him to evaluate the 
government's implementation of sustainable development policies 
and practices. The commissioner and the auditor general would 
also work together in reporting to the House of Commons on the 
government's practices in matters of ecology and sustainable 
development.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	No matter who the auditor general is, the amendments bind the 
office of the auditor general and the commissioner for sustainable 
development to encourage consideration of environment and 
sustainable development in all official duties. They do that by 
explicitly incorporating sustainable development and environment 
into the Auditor General Act. They do it by requiring the auditor 
general to take environmental effect into account when preparing 
all reports to the House of Commons.
<P>
	For the first time an independent commissioner has a mandate 
and responsibility to follow up and report on what the government 
is doing or failing to do in meeting its environmental 
commitments. I must say entre parenthèses that one of the first 
departments the office of the commissioner will be looking at is my 
department, the Department of the Environment. We welcome the 
opportunity of independent public review because we believe it 
will accelerate the integration of the two key objectives of 
sustainable development and their integration into the economy.
<P>
	We know that the blaze of publicity that attends each auditor 
general's report of financial failings has caused governments in the 
past to move and to take a different path. We can expect an impact 
at least as great for  reports of environmental shortcomings and that 
publicity or the urge to avoid it should be a powerful spur to 
government action, a spur in more ways than one.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	At times this may make things uncomfortable for us in 
government. It may make things uncomfortable for us as ministers 
and as members of the government but we are prepared and 
welcome that discomfort if the end is better government for 
Canadians. Better integration of sustainable development is a key 
factor in making decisions.
<P>
	Imagine if we had taken into account sustainable development 
many years ago when we were making decisions about how to 
allocate quota of the cod stock. Look at the price we pay today for 
the thousands of fishermen who do not have fish to catch simply 
because we did not develop sustainable fisheries, not only 
domestically but internationally.
<P>
	I had the privilege recently of participating in an environmental 
trade mission to the Far East. In discussions several governments 
were very interested in the concept of the commissioner for 
sustainable development. They understand, as we understand, the 
times when a department of the environment is the only department 
responsible for sustainable development are gone. We need 
integration through the highest levels of government. I believe the 
influence of the office of the auditor general and the new 
commissioner for sustainable development and the environment 
will be able to deliver that cross-cutting analysis of all government 
policy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The scope of the amendments goes beyond a mere 
institutionalizing of procedures for monitoring and reporting on 
government activities.
<P>
	More directly, these amendments require all federal departments 
to take environmental action. They go further than the red book's 
commitment in that they vigorously promote sustainable 
development through government activities.
<P>
	Under the Act as amended, each department has two years to 
prepare a strategy for sustainable development, to be presented in 
the House of Commons by the minister responsible. The strategy 
must be results oriented. It should include the department's 
objectives and a plan of action to attain those objectives.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In effect this legislation will make every minister a minister for 
sustainable development. For example, the industry minister will 
be responsible for the portfolio and also for ensuring the 
Department of Industry operates in an environmentally sound way. 
The same is true for the foreign affairs minister, the transport 
minister and all of our colleagues.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14511"> 14511 </A></B>
<P>
	This is a step forward in making sustainable development more 
than a concept. The departmental strategies will assist the auditor 
general and the commissioner in not only monitoring government 
for preparation of their reports to Parliament but they will also 
serve as benchmarks by which the commissioner and the auditor 
general can assess each government department's performance in 
making that shift to sustainable development.
<P>
	By the way, the auditor general and the stakeholders have 
already indicated the need for such benchmarks. We need to show 
where progress is being made and if not, why not. This is not a one 
shot affair to be undertaken with fanfare and then quickly 
forgotten. Every three years each department must update its 
sustainable development strategy and its minister must table the 
update in Parliament.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Thanks to these amendments, Canadians will be able to play 
their part by ensuring that the government is responsive to 
expectations with respect to the environment. The Auditor General 
will have the authority to receive petitions from the public about 
environmental matters and forward them to the appropriate 
minister.
<P>
	The number and purpose of petitions received by ministers and 
the status of these files will be monitored, and the commissioner 
will report on the results obtained to the House of Commons.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The amendments also require the commissioner to report every 
year to the House of Commons on behalf of the auditor general. 
These reports can focus on anything related to sustainable 
development, whatever the commissioner feels important enough 
to bring to the attention of the House. In particular, the 
commissioner's annual report will show how far governments and 
departments have gone in meeting the objectives and expectations 
they have established in their strategies.
<P>
	However, the annual report will not be the only report to the 
House of Commons on our environmental performance.
<P>
<B>(1230 )</B>
<P>
	These amendments will ensure that environmental observations 
continue to be included in the auditor general's report as well. That 
is important because the auditor general's reports are more general 
in scope and they will include considerations of effectiveness and 
the environment. One of the commissioner's duties will be to assist 
the auditor general in preparing aspects of those reports referring to 
the environment and sustainable development.
<P>
	We are wasting no time in moving on our obligations under the 
Auditor General Act because we are  committed to thinking green 
and ensuring that green government is a central component of the 
decisions we make as a society. Our action plan accelerating the 
shift to green practices in government can be reflected in the work 
of Environment Canada. That plan has five points: green 
procurement policies that emphasize reduction, reuse, and 
purchase of environmentally sound products; managing the 
department's car fleets to reduce emissions by 30 per cent within 
the next five years; making zero waste a target in our offices; 
improving energy efficiency and conserving water specifically by 
auditing the use of water in all Environment Canada buildings.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We have already had some major successes. At Environment 
Canada headquarters in Quebec City, in Sainte-Foy for instance, 
water consumption dropped by 9.6 million litres annually 
following implementation of effective ways to save water. This is a 
good indication of the economic potential of sustainable 
development.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In Hamilton-Wentworth at the Canada Centre for Inland 
Waters, which is in the city of Burlington, energy efficiency 
improvements are lowering carbon dioxide emissions by 5,900 
tonnes. That is the equivalent per year to the emissions from 1,500 
cars. That means we are saving enough energy to heat 525 homes a 
year.
<P>
	Another example is the new guidebook entitled ``A Guide to 
Green Government'', which is signed by the Prime Minister and all 
cabinet ministers, to help federal departments make sustainable 
development their business. It will serve as ground breaking 
information for the commissioner when she or he reports on the 
success departments are having in integrating sustainable 
development practices. They already have ``A Guide to Green 
Government'' signed by the Prime Minister of Canada because he 
believes that sustainable development is a responsibility we all 
share. It is a responsibility shared by Canadians.
<P>
	When governments prepare our strategies we must act in an open 
and transparent way. We must include groups with expertise, like 
the national round table on the environment and the economy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Another example illustrates the fact that we take our 
responsibilities seriously. The Minister of Finance and I received a 
report from a multiparty task force that was asked to identify 
obstacles to sound environmental practices as well as effective 
ways to use economic instruments.
<P>
	In the last budget, the government followed the short-term 
recommendations of the task force, and we hope it will do more in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14512"> 14512 </A></B>
<P>
the long term. The response will establish how the government 
intends to go about using  these economic instruments and to 
develop government policies that are environmentally sound.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A final example of our commitment is the proclamation of the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act last January. I believe the 
legislation will ensure that environment is formally integrated into 
the project planning process of government. Through the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Agency we are already working hard to 
make sure that environmental assessments of new government 
policies and programs are done well.
<P>
	These are important measures to establish a framework.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	For years, governments have been talking about sustainable 
development. We have stated our commitment to this principle, but 
it has not been easy to ensure compliance.
<P>
	That is why environmental groups have been asking for a 
governmental monitoring function and for independent reporting 
that would focus on the government's environmental activities. 
They saw this as a way to force governments to keep their word. 
And just as persistently, our predecessors in government have 
steadfastly refused to take this route.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We are convinced that these initiatives will have far reaching 
effects within government and within society. I hope and believe 
they will move government and the country forward on the path 
from talking about sustainability to actually delivering in terms of 
government policies and programs. That is something Canadians 
can be grateful for today.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	I want to particularly thank the parliamentary committee under 
the chairmanship of the hon. member for Davenport and also the 
members of the opposition who brought constructive suggestions 
to the table. I think all Canadians understand that whatever one's 
political stripe, when it comes to the environment we should be 
working on behalf of the whole country. Certainly we saw that 
co-operation in the work of the Standing Committee on 
Environment and Sustainable Development. If we can carry on like 
that in government, we will be doing okay.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, here we 
are back in the House after an exceptional summer during which 
many things happened.
<P>
	First of all, in Quebec, under the Parti Quebecois 
government-in partnership with our party, the Bloc Quebecois, 
and the ADQ, the Action démocratique du  Québec, with the 
support of many partners from all sectors of society, and in 
accordance with the strong wishes of a majority of Quebecers-all 
of us in Quebec are moving toward the referendum, which, I am 
increasingly convinced, will give us a country, Quebec, in a few 
weeks. This is what happened in Quebec over the summer. Winds 
of change have been blowing and are getting stronger every day.
<P>
	The Prime Minister of Canada, who says he is distinct-and I 
fully concur with him-mentioned that the coming referendum 
debate would be fun. With the winds of change getting stronger, the 
fun expected by our distinct federalist Prime Minister will become 
serious and I am sure that he will not find it so funny on October 
30.
<P>
	Other events have commanded my attention this past summer. 
As a result of a labour dispute, workers at Ogilvie Mills in 
Montreal have been on strike for more than a year. This is the only 
labour dispute in Quebec that is specifically due to the use of scabs, 
which is allowed by the Canada Labour Code. Yet, the Minister of 
Labour, our national aunt, a first class switch-hitter and former 
critic of the federal government, promised several times that she 
would resolve this intolerable situation. The leader of the No side 
in Quebec continues to say no to these Quebec workers.
<P>
	Another major issue that is of particular concern to me is the 
raising of the Irving Whale. I would first like to draw a parallel 
between this issue and the bill before us today, in the hope that 
creating the position of Commissioner of the Environment and 
Sustainable Development will help us avoid a similar mess. Let us 
hope that the federal commissioner can get involved in such federal 
matters in order to alert decision makers and, if necessary, stop or 
reverse decisions like the one to raise the Irving Whale.
<P>
	This salvage operation, which was scheduled for the month of 
August, could be described as a total fiasco. In fact, not only the 
operation itself but the whole matter is a dismal failure. 
Everything, from the decision making to the environmental 
assessment, the awarding of the contract and the job itself, was 
done in an incompetent and irresponsible fashion. The first one to 
blame for this fiasco is the Minister of the Environment who, for 
reasons I would describe as very partisan, took serious decisions 
without proper thought. The minister's partisanship on this issue is 
obvious. Just think back to the announcement she made in this 
House, saying something like: ``Twenty five years have passed 
since the barge sank, and nothing has been done. But I, just 90 days 
after coming into office, made the right decision''.
<P>
	We now have proof that the minister's decision was in fact a 
botched job. The barge is still lying on the bottom of the Gulf, more 
than $12 million was spent-taxpayers' money of course, the 
procedure selected is increasingly questioned, and a Federal Court 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14513"> 14513 </A></B>
<P>
judge even requested  that she redo her homework as far as 
environmental assessments regarding PCBs are concerned.
<P>
	Her botched and dicey decision could have caused irreparable 
damage to the environment. This partisan political game she has 
played is inexcusable.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	This threat that hung over the Gulf of St. Lawrence throughout 
the month of August was a matter of continual concern for those 
directly involved.
<P>
	Speaking of those directly involved, the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine has been conspicuously 
reserved over the summer with his dear constituents who, all 
summer long, were completely shattered by this decision to lift the 
ship in that manner.
<P>
	The media actually covered the operations, that they questioned 
on many occasions. The work was conducted haphazardly and 
without any degree of certainty. In a nutshell, it smacked of 
amateurism, and that had many people worried.
<P>
	I certainly hope that the commissioner of the environment and 
sustainable development, whose position Bill C-83 seeks to 
establish, will have a say in this kind of decisions, which directly 
threaten the environment. The commissioner will be in a position 
to monitor the whole decision making process.
<P>
	In the case of the <I>Irving Whale</I>, the process followed was 
seriously flawed, thus preventing an appropriate decision, that is 
the best possible one. Indeed, the process followed regarding the 
<I>Irving Whale</I> was flawed in several ways.
<P>
	At the end of 1992, two studies commissioned by the Coast 
Guard and by the Department of the Environment recommended 
pumping the cargo out of the sunken wreck. Marex and CEF both 
concluded that was the safest technique.
<P>
	However, the government ignored the recommendations made in 
studies which it commissioned. Instead, the Minister of the 
Environment relied on a third study commissioned by an 
independent organization, the Ship-source Oil Pollution Fund, 
which recommended lifting the barge without emptying it and 
moving it to a safe place before pumping the oil out.
<P>
	It should be noted that this study conducted by London's Murray 
Fenton firm used the two above-mentioned studies as its main 
references. How could this third firm go against the findings of the 
other two if it used their studies as its basic reference? At that 
stage, the process was very twisted to say the least. All this does 
not seem very logical.
<P>
	What we can figure out however, is the logic relating to the costs 
of the operation. In spite of the reassuring words of the minister, it 
is clear that the costs of the operation unduly influenced the 
decision making process. Indeed, the government chose the least 
expensive  solution. Bloc Quebecois members and environmental 
groups have always said that the government should first pump the 
oil out of the barge.
<P>
	Public hearings and consultations were held following the 
minister's decision, but the whole process was obviously a sham. 
Surely, the commissioner of the environment will be able to take a 
close look at such decisions.
<P>
	Then we found out that PCBs were present in the wreck. The 
government says ``What a surprise-we did not know.'' Yet page 3 
of chapter I of the Marex report submitted to the government in 
December 1992 states that the capacity of the heaters ``was 
transmitted to the cargo via a heating fluid (Monsanto MGS 295S) 
and heating coils in each tank''. Thus the presence of PCBs was 
already mentioned in the 1992 documents.
<P>
	So, in June 1995, another environmental assessment and 
consultations were carried out, this time not only fabricated but 
hastily fabricated at that. The outcome: a federal court judge issues 
a stop order and makes the Minister of the Environment do her 
homework all over again, this time conforming to her own 
department's statutes and regulations. That is something else, Mr. 
Speaker. What a blow to the pride of our Minister of the 
Environment, who had boasted only a few months earlier that she 
had settled the whole thing.
<P>
	So the work was stopped by an injunction, work that had been 
delayed continuously and had already used up its budget. They say 
that it would cost between $150 000 and $180 000 a day to go on 
with the project.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	And while all this flagrant bungling was going on, those in 
charge of the Coast Guard and Environment Canada were telling us 
``No problem. This is a well-oiled operation.'' Never were words 
so well chosen, for the whole danger of this controversial operation 
lay in its ``well-oiled'' nature.
<P>
	We are continuing to follow this issue very closely and are 
anxious to see what the minister's next steps will be. I have drawn a 
parallel between this issue and Bill C-83, an act to amend the 
Auditor General Act, since the purpose of that bill is to create a 
commissioner of the environment responsible for overseeing 
situations like that of the <I>Irving Whale</I>.
<P>
	It gives me pleasure to intervene, because this bill arises from 
the dissenting opinion expressed by the Bloc Quebecois in the May 
1995 report of the Standing Committee on Environment and 
Sustainable Development on the commissioner of the environment 
and sustainable development.
<P>
	As a result of the committee's work on this subject, the Bloc 
members proposed three essential criteria in the creation of the 
position of environmental auditor. They are as follows. First, it is 
the government's responsibility  to establish the policies and the 
auditor's to examine them. Second, we must avoid creating more 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14514"> 14514 </A></B>
<P>
organizations with similar mandates. Third, economic and 
environmental elements must be intrinsically linked.
<P>
	These criteria gave rise to our party's proposal that the mandate 
of the auditor general of the environment be given to the office of 
the auditor general along with the resources it requires to 
effectively carry out its role.
<P>
	That is what we proposed at the time. Our proposal was 
influenced in large measure by the testimony given by the auditor 
general, Denis Desautels. In testifying before the committee, Mr. 
Desautels indicated that his office performed the audit duties that 
would constitute the prime responsibilities of an auditor general of 
the environment. In other words, the auditor general indicated that 
he was already involved in environment issues and that he spent 
$4.5 million on them annually.
<P>
	He also felt that his office could take on full responsibility for 
examining environmental and sustainable development matters 
with an additional appropriation of $4.5 million-making a total of 
$9 million. The route proposed by the auditor general struck us as 
the most sensible, simple and effective one to take. The Bloc 
Quebecois therefore proposed this route, and with Bill C-83 the 
government confirmed that we were right.
<P>
	Most committee members were in favour of increasing 
structures. The Liberal and Reform members advocated, at one and 
the same time, a new body to be known as the office of the 
commissioner for the environment and sustainable development 
and the retention of the auditor general's duties in this area. 
Liberals and Reformers recommended an office of the environment 
and of sustainable development, with a budget of $5 million and 
staff of 30 professional and 15 support employees.
<P>
	Also as mentioned in recommendation No. 17 of the report, they 
wanted to congratulate the auditor general on his initiatives on the 
environment and urge him to keep up the good work. The 
committee also recommended amending the Auditor General Act 
so he would have the appropriate instruments to do his job.
<P>
	Liberals and Reform Party members on the committee were in 
favour of a new, specific structure, while maintaining and 
enhancing another structure with the same responsibilities. This 
would have been inconsistent, inefficient and very costly. 
Fortunately, the Bloc made its own proposals, and the Liberal 
minister listened to us, instead of acting on the recommendations 
of her own members which would have created duplication and 
overlap within the federal government.
<P>
	I am glad that the Bloc and the auditor general opted for a 
common sense approach in this matter.
<P>
	I think the Liberals and Reform Party members on the Standing 
Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development do not 
have a clue what common sense  means and what the 
environmental facts are, and I am referring to problems out there 
that must be dealt with quickly and effectively.
<P>
	Another instance of this lack of realism on the part of Liberal 
and Reform members on the committee could be seen in the report 
on the quinquennial review of the CEPA, the Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	Liberals and Reform Party members were convinced that it was 
absolutely necessary to further centralize authority in Ottawa in 
order to protect the environment. In this report, members opposite 
and next to us raised several considerations to justify increased 
centralization of authority in environmental matters. They referred 
to the growing globalization of environmental problems, the issue 
of national interest, the increasing importance of international 
trade and an ecosystem based approach as so many reasons for 
suggesting that the federal government expand its role and take full 
responsibility for environmental protection.
<P>
	With these proposals the committee, in its report on the 
CEPA-by the way, the Bloc did not agree with the 
report-ignored the fact that the provinces already had most of the 
responsibility in this area. The committee, minus the Bloc, takes its 
cues from the government. They speak the same language, the 
language of centralization. The federal government wants more 
power, steadily encroaching on areas that, either directly or 
indirectly, come under provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	This encroachment by the federal government obviously leads to 
legislative and regulatory duplication which has the effect of 
setting back and undermining environmental protection. This 
duplication also causes some reluctance and apprehension among 
developers who no longer know where they stand. It is not very 
good for the economy. And this while members opposite keep 
talking about the economy and creating jobs.
<P>
	With its increasing propensity for minding the business of the 
provinces the government is hardly stimulating the economy. In 
fact, it makes things increasingly difficult for its beloved economy. 
This is very disturbing. And it is very disturbing for an economy 
that is supposed to produce all those jobs promised by the Liberals 
and for the environment, which is in dire need of being protected 
and renewed.
<P>
	Is there a way out of this extreme centralist approach? No, not 
unless we take matters into our own hands as we are about to do in 
Quebec on October 30. Federalism as such is centralizing, and I 
would say very much so. This excessive centralization and the 
manifold duplications it generates means established businesses 
have to work harder in order to be heard by both levels of 
government, face double the paper work and are obliged to meet 
the requirements of two levels of government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14515"> 14515 </A></B>
<P>
	One convincing example of the federal government's 
duplication involves the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 
which came in effect last January. Environmental assessment had 
been, until then, essentially a matter of provincial jurisdiction, had 
it not? The federal government's unilateral action turned the rules 
of the game completely around. We in Quebec have been doing 
environmental assessments for more than 15 years. We have 
developed an expertise and have established a reputation. With its 
legislation, the federal government wrecked everything. Worse 
yet, the federal government did not incorporate any of the 
amendments proposed by Quebec or any of the other provinces.
<P>
	The repercussions of this affront to Quebec and the other 
provinces on the CCME, the Canadian Council of Ministers of the 
Environment, were significant. While the federal minister was 
inviting her provincial counterparts to discuss harmonization, the 
events of January 1995 cooled things off considerably.
<P>
	According to some sources, the climate between the minister and 
her counterparts remains unsettled. The federal minister would 
appear to be acting in a somewhat cavalier fashion by showing 
little concern for the provinces or for the environment. But what do 
you expect, Mr. Speaker, the minister is much more a political 
creature than an environmentalist. She is also much more of a 
federalist at all cost, a vehement centralist, than a decentralist.
<P>
	Her partisan instincts lead her to unacceptable behaviour that 
raises a lot of concerns about the environment. She will certainly 
not effectively manage the environment by treading on the backs of 
the provinces-quite the contrary. The provinces, and Quebec in 
particular, have a considerable lead in this area. The minister 
should respect this and stop meddling in areas of jurisdiction 
already occupied, and well occupied at that, by the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	If the new Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable 
Development looks carefully at the federal government's intrusion 
into areas of provincial jurisdiction, I am sure that he will focus on 
how overlap and duplication is detrimental to sound management 
of the environment.
<P>
	To get back to this bill, the minister proposes to amend the role 
of the auditor general by giving him the specific mandate to look 
into matters related to the environment and sustainable 
development. As I said earlier and as he himself pointed out during 
hearings, the auditor general has already opened the door by setting 
aside $4.5 million a year for this purpose.
<P>
	The bill provides for the appointment by the auditor general of a 
senior officer to be called the Commissioner of the Environment 
and Sustainable Development, who will perform this specific task.
<P>
	One of the commissioner's duties will be to submit an annual 
report to the House of Commons on behalf of the auditor general. 
This report will deal mainly with two things: first, the extent to 
which departments have met the objectives and implemented their 
plans concerning the environment and sustainable development; 
and second, a record of the petitions received and their status.
<P>
	What is new in this bill is that it requires the new commissioner 
to do two things: one, to ensure that category I departments table a 
sustainable development strategy within two years after this bill 
comes into force; two, to open a door by allowing citizens wishing 
to be heard to file petitions calling for action on the environment 
and sustainable development.
<P>
	These two initiatives seem worthwhile in principle. In reality, 
however, one may wonder how much actual impact they will have.
<P>
	Let us have a closer look at this new opportunity for people to 
file petitions with the commissioner.
<P>
	This is a very simple procedure. The petition must be filed 
within the specified deadline; certified copies must be sent to those 
directly concerned; finally, the department responsible must 
provide a response. The procedure will be implemented without 
problems.
<P>
	What I question though is the effectiveness of such petitions. Is 
this bill merely and stupidly putting in place a mechanism by which 
petitions can be tabled or will it really enable the people to have an 
say and to effect change?
<P>
	In light of what is achieved through the petitions we table in this 
House, allow me to doubt their ability to effect any changes. The 
government's will to respond by taking swift action is seriously 
lacking. Petitions are given only trivial answers, based on facts, 
statistics or results and in no way sway the government or compel it 
to do anything. Petitions are not taken seriously by the government.
<P>
	What will become of petitions to the commissioner of the 
environment? They will have the same fate as the rest of the 
petitions tabled in this place, since they will be answered by the 
same departments. There is no doubt that the government should be 
forced to pay greater attention to this means of applying pressure 
that the taxpayers have. Greater merit should be recognized to 
petitions.
<P>
	I can remember the petition I tabled in this House regarding the 
<I>Irving Whale</I>. On September 23, 1994, petitioners from the 
Magdalen Islands asked that leaks be stopped and that further 
public, and particularly more transparent, hearings be held on this 
issue. To no avail. The barge continued to leak and is still leaking 
as we speak, but no further hearings were held.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14516"> 14516 </A></B>
<P>
	The Minister of Transport's answer was flat and did not take 
into account the concerns expressed by the people. Petitions are 
useless since governments pay little attention to such demands.
<P>
	This is highly regrettable and it aggrieves the people. On the 
other hand, while not signing any petitions, lobbies are paid much 
more attention to by ministers. The Liberals opposite are 
particularly lax in that area. Recent decisions clearly show that 
lobbyist and minister go hand in hand, while petitions amount to 
nothing.
<P>
	This concludes my remarks on the petition aspect of the bill. Let 
us now turn to the other key element, namely the development and 
tabling of sustainable development strategies by the departments.
<P>
	I immediately wonder about the two year time limit for tabling 
these strategies. What will the commissioner do during those two 
years, since his job is to make inquiries and monitor the 
implementation of departmental action plans and report annually 
on the extent to which objectives were met? What is the 
commissioner going to do for two years? This measure means that, 
to all intents of purposes, he or she will have nothing to audit for 
three years, assuming that the initial report will be on the first year 
the strategies are implemented.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	Let us now examine these sustainable development strategies. 
First of all, it needs to be pointed out that they replace the green 
plan, that famous green plan which held such promise, but has 
passed on after years of neglect by the government.
<P>
	We in the Bloc see this new federal government approach as 
another serious threat of encroachment and intrusion into 
provincial areas of jurisdiction. This concept of sustainable 
development which the federal departments are to develop 
concretely into plans raises some legitimate concerns. Does not 
sustainable development concern resources, an area of provincial 
jurisdiction?
<P>
	Recent federal government actions, including the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act, as well as the Liberals' 
ultracentralist intent in the report on the CEPA, are clear evidence 
to us of this tendency to interfere.
<P>
	The federal government, under the guise of ecologizing the 
operations of each department, is actually implementing an overall 
result-oriented sustainable development strategy. On first view, 
one might believe this to be an initiative with exclusively federal 
effects, but when the description and orientations of this initiative 
are examined, it can be seen that it will be able to influence all of 
the provincial governments directly.
<P>
	This initiative goes much further. By introducing sustainable 
development, each department has an  opportunity to take 
responsibility for certain areas under federal jurisdiction. To 
achieve the desired results, the federal government has identified 
certain objectives for sustainable development which it intends to 
promote. For instance, it wants to ensure that the development of 
renewable and non-renewable resources, many of which, I may 
remind you, are exclusively under provincial jurisdiction, is 
sustainable.
<P>
	Even if the provinces play a major role in achieving these 
objectives, the federal government has clearly indicated that it will 
emphasize communications and consultations with individuals and 
the private sector. It has only hinted at the possibility of joint 
management agreements with the provinces and aboriginal 
communities.
<P>
	This approach, including implementation of the concept of 
sustainable development and an emphasis on relations with 
individuals and the private sector, may be seen as a threat to the 
provinces. A very subtle threat, which nevertheless reveals the 
cavalier approach of a federal government that uses this diversion 
to satisfy its hunger for centralism. In fact, the federal government 
increasingly resorts to this kind of strategy to get around the 
provinces and encroach on a number of areas.
<P>
	As far as the environment is concerned, this approach is both 
unfortunate and dangerous. The federal government's record is not 
outstanding in this respect, and centralism does not tend to produce 
quick results where they are needed. We must not forget that the 
environment is out there, not in the offices of Ottawa's bureaucrats.
<P>
	We think that before making any claims that they can do a better 
job, federal departments should start by complying with provincial 
legislation. The environment is one area where the provinces 
played a very active role well before the federal government did so. 
In fact, the Constitution confers on them a role that is more 
important than that of the federal government which, over the 
years, has used and abused its spending power in provincial 
jurisdictions. Ever since the federal government broke this delicate 
balance in the middle of the eighties, the result has been 
overlapping jurisdictions, conflicting objectives and costly 
duplication.
<P>
	Fortunately, in Quebec, on October 30, Quebecers will decide to 
make their own country. Our environment will no longer be at the 
mercy of the federal government and will be able to breath easier.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
before I get into talking about the bill I would like to make a few 
comments about the previous speaker, my colleague from the Bloc.
<P>
	I find it most interesting that the Bloc would want the federal 
government to bow out of environment on the federal arena. 
However it is quite prepared to accept  Canadian tax dollars to raise 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14517"> 14517 </A></B>
<P>
the <I>Irving Whale</I>. This is part of the double message, the double 
standard. I expect it is some of the nonsense that we will have to 
put up with over the next six weeks from Her Majesty's Loyal 
Opposition.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	A similar issue is the pensions. Bloc members want out of the 
country but they sure do not want out of the pension plan. They are 
quite prepared to accept it.
<P>
	To get back to the bill we are talking about today, I am pleased to 
have the opportunity to speak on the bill to amend the Auditor 
General Act. I want to make clear from the outset that the Reform 
Party supports efforts that balance economic and environmental 
considerations to maintain a clean and healthy environment for 
future generations.
<P>
	We are into the third session of the 35th Parliament. Yet to date 
the government has been visibly lacking in its environmental 
initiatives. A recent study by the National Centre for Economic 
Alternatives ranks Canada as the second worst in deterioration of 
land, air and water. We have seen little action from the minister to 
address this situation. We have heard plenty of rhetoric but have 
seen very little action to address key environmental concerns.
<P>
	Bill C-83 is one of the very few initiatives the Minister of the 
Environment has announced and it is far from revolutionary. Bill 
C-83 amends the Auditor General Act to create the position of 
commissioner of the environment.
<P>
	The commissioner of the environment was one of the initial 
undertakings of the standing committee. This bill comes to the 
House after a lengthy process of consultation with witnesses before 
being sent to the minister. During committee I listened with 
members on both sides of the House to witnesses who came 
forward with recommendations on what role and which 
responsibilities the new position of an environmental auditor 
general should take.
<P>
	At the end of the hearings the recommendations were 
consolidated and I worked with members of the committee to sort 
out and weigh the various recommendations. We put together a 
standing committee report of recommendations which was then 
forwarded to the Minister of the Environment last year.
<P>
	It was a long process of deliberation. I commend the many 
members and witnesses who contributed to the process. I am also 
pleased to say that for the most part the members of the standing 
committee on the environment were able to put aside partisan 
politics to work for a common goal: to establish the role of a 
commissioner of the environment.
<P>
	It is unfortunate, however, when so much time, effort and 
expense goes into these studies and committee reports that the end 
result is barely acknowledged by the minister in the resultant 
legislation.
<P>
	Representatives are flown in from all over the country at 
taxpayers' expense to present their concerns to the committee. One 
of the roles of standing committees is to listen to and consult with 
people on government initiatives and bills before the House, a role 
which has been widely abused by this and previous governments. It 
is unfortunate that the process of consultation under this 
government is somewhat meaningless.
<P>
	Despite any decisions made by the parliamentary committee or 
any feedback from Canadians while the government is on the road 
supposedly consulting with people, the bottom line remains that 
decisions are still made behind closed doors at the whim of the 
cabinet. It is particularly disappointing to note that very little of 
Bill C-83 reflects what was contained in the recommendations of 
the parliamentary committee presented to the environment minister 
last year.
<P>
	Why have a lengthy consultation process when the minister is 
going to ignore the results?
<P>
	If the bill is representative of the minister's initiatives on the 
environment it speaks volumes. Members on both sides of the 
House proposed a number of excellent recommendations regarding 
the commissioner of the environment, most of which the minister 
chose to ignore in the bill.
<P>
	When the Canadian public has had the opportunity to examine 
the bill they will conclude that it accomplishes particularly little to 
protect the environment. It is little wonder Canadians have 
criticized the minister for coming up short on her 
accomplishments. Clearly this legislation is not the answer to 
environmental concerns.
<P>
<B>(1310 )</B>
<P>
	Canadians are waiting for the government to take charge and 
pass reasoned, meaningful legislation, not bills like this one which 
is completely lacking in substance and will do very little to change 
the status quo on environment.
<P>
	It should be noted that the commissioner of the environment was 
not only a committee recommendation but also a Liberal red book 
election promise which the minister again fails to deliver.
<P>
	The environment committee made several recommendations for 
the office of the commissioner of the environment, 17 in total. The 
Reform Party supported the initiative. Yet few of the committee 
recommendations have been followed through in the bill which 
barely resembles the intent of the parliamentary submission 
presented to the environment minister.
<P>
	For example, the standing committee recommended that the 
office of the commissioner of the environment  and sustainable 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14518"> 14518 </A></B>
<P>
development be established by new and separate legislation. 
However the bill is an amendment to the Auditor General Act. The 
bill is neither a new nor a separate piece of legislation.
<P>
	The government promised in its red book that it would appoint 
an environmental auditor. The bill does not do that. It creates in 
legislation the position of a clerk who reports to the auditor 
general, a clerk with a limited role and with very few powers, not 
anything remotely close to an independent environmental auditor.
<P>
	The standing committee on the environment recommended that 
the government establish a new office designated the commissioner 
of the environment and sustainable development. The legislation 
does not establish a new office.
<P>
	The commissioner of the environment is clearly not an 
independent environmental auditor general but a clerk reporting to 
the auditor general who will assist with environmental issues. It is 
not independent. It is not powerful. It is a clerk.
<P>
	I am sure the auditor general already has several assistants to 
help him with environmental issues. I question the need to entrench 
the position in legislation, especially given the limited mandate 
spelled out in the legislation. The government has severely reduced 
the scope and extent of the position by establishing the 
commissioner of the environment within the offices of the auditor 
general in a position.
<P>
	I can question how much if any the new position will actually 
change the status quo. The auditor general already responds to 
environmental issues. Now he has his new clerk entrenched in 
legislation to help him with the issues. This does not change 
anything.
<P>
	The red book promised the environmental auditor general would 
report directly to Parliament. This was also recommended by the 
standing committee. Again the government has reneged on its 
promise. The bill comes up short of fulfilling this promise. Bill 
C-83 proposes the new assistant to the auditor general will report to 
the auditor general, not to Parliament as promised. When the 
commissioner reports to Parliament it is through the auditor 
general, not as an independent body.
<P>
	The committee also recommended that the commissioner submit 
an annual report to Parliament. The bill proposes that the 
commissioner's annual report to Parliament will be on behalf of the 
auditor general who does the same thing. Appointing an assistant to 
speak for the auditor general hardly changes the status quo.
<P>
	Another recommendation from the standing committee on the 
environment which the minister has ignored is that all reports 
produced by the commissioner be referred automatically to the 
Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable 
Development or to one or more parliamentary committees if the 
subject matter of  the report makes it appropriate or necessary. 
Again there is nothing in the bill to support the committee 
recommendations.
<P>
	Within the duties of the commissioner of the environment the 
only reports the commissioner will be making to Parliament on 
behalf of the auditor general will be related to the status of 
environmental petitions brought to the attention of government and 
the status of departmental sustainable strategies. The bill does not 
empower the commissioner of the environment to report on much 
more than these two items.
<P>
	In addition, the role of reporting on departmental sustainable 
development strategies is not a new initiative of the government. It 
was tried before when the last government attempted to establish 
an office that would report on the status of departmental 
sustainable development strategies. This office was called the 
office of environmental stewardship. Its mandate was to carry out 
environmental audits of federal departments and agencies in 
co-operation with the office of the comptroller general. The details 
and funding arrangements were all laid out in the green plan. This 
April we learned that the plug had been pulled on the green plan. It 
appears that this same office created by the last government has 
been dismissed by this government and reintroduced as a new 
initiative. The games they play in the tired politics of the old line 
parties.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	The committee also recommended that the commissioner be 
granted in legislation adequate access to information powers 
commensurate with his or her mandate. Given that the mandate for 
the commissioner is so weak clearly explains why the bill contains 
no such recommendations.
<P>
	The minister also completely ignored the committee 
recommendation for the commissioner to have the discretionary 
powers to appoint individuals to one or more advisory committees 
to assist the office in the performance of its duties. This committee 
recommendation has been completely ignored.
<P>
	The committee also recommended that legislation to appoint the 
commissioner should be with the approval of Parliament. Instead 
the bill allows the auditor general to appoint the commissioner in 
accordance with the Public Service Employment Act. Actually, this 
is one recommendation of the minister which merits serious 
consideration because in this instance it may eliminate the 
potential for a patronage appointment, an area where this 
government has been so free. By allowing the auditor general to 
appoint a commissioner of the environment the position will be 
more at arm's length from the government.
<P>
	There is nothing in the bill that outlines the term or length of 
office for the commissioner. The standing committee 
recommended that the position be held for a term of five years 
which may 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14519"> 14519 </A></B>
<P>
be reviewed only once, in other words a 10 year maximum. The 
position would have a specified length of term. By allowing the 
position to be renewed only once would prevent a monopoly of the 
position and would allow fresh new ideas to be injected into the 
position on a regular basis.
<P>
	There is nothing in the bill which addresses the recommendation 
that the commissioner be paid a salary equivalent to that of a judge 
of the supreme court. However, the salary of course is based on the 
role and mandate of an independent, effective position. Given the 
measly powers and responsibilities of the position, such a salary 
clearly is not warranted.
<P>
	There is nothing in the bill that subjects the commissioner's 
office to a parliamentary review. The committee recommended that 
the office be subject to a review every five years by Parliament. 
This would allow members of Parliament to evaluate the 
effectiveness and usefulness of the position. It is clearly evident 
that the minister has failed to carry through on this 
recommendation in her bill. Such a clause could be contained in the 
bill to ensure accountability. If the role is not effective or necessary 
after five years a new government may wish to review and 
reconsider the position. I suggest the government consider this.
<P>
	The red book also promised that the environmental auditor 
general would have ``powers of investigation similar to the powers 
of the auditor general''. Yet in this bill the responsibility for 
reporting on environmental issues remains with the auditor 
general, not with a new body. The only powers of investigation that 
the new commissioner on the environment will have in the 
proposed legislation will be those designated by his boss.
<P>
	The government is backtracking on another red book promise. 
Obviously, as assistant to the auditor general the commissioner of 
the environment does not have the same powers as his boss to 
whom he reports. Whether issues are reported through the auditor 
general or the auditor general's assistant, the commissioner of the 
environment, it is still up to the auditor general to decide whether 
action will be taken.
<P>
	The government is not bound to any of the recommendations of 
the auditor general nor is it required to make a formal response to 
the auditor general's report. As a result-and we are well aware of 
this-many recommendations in the auditor general's reports have 
been ignored for years by governments which would rather not 
recognize the problems or act on the solutions.
<P>
	The Liberal red book criticized the Conservatives for their lack 
of action in the area of environmental assessment, yet this 
government refuses to conduct a full environmental assessment of 
critical environmental hot spots such as the Sydney tar ponds in 
Nova Scotia. It appears the gap between rhetoric and action is as 
evident with the Liberals as it was with the Conservatives.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	The Minister of the Environment has complained that she cannot 
perform her job without public pressure. Why then does the 
minister not create a real position for the commissioner of the 
environment with powers to put some pressure on her department 
which she is having so much difficulty handling?
<P>
	The standing committee proposed to create a separate, 
independent office of the commissioner of the environment that 
would have real powers and would be responsible to report directly 
to the House. The legislation fails to meet the fundamental goals of 
the standing committee and of the Liberal red book of election 
promises.
<P>
	It is high time the government came clean on its election 
promises. The changes proposed in Bill C-83 to amend the Auditor 
General Act are simply cosmetic. It is all just a big show from the 
Liberals in an attempt to fool the public into thinking they are 
actually doing something when clearly they are not. The bill is 
nothing but fluff. It accomplishes little.
<P>
	The government made a number of promises to Canadians. It is 
becoming very apparent that it cannot or has no intention of 
keeping promises such as establishing this position. It is time the 
government came clean on its agenda. If government is going to 
encourage others to clean up their act, it is time it started putting its 
own house in order.
<P>
	From the failure of the government to establish a real 
environmental auditor general, or a real ethics commissioner for 
that matter, to the failure of individual members across the way to 
resist the draw of the pension trough, the picture is clear: the 
government has no intention of keeping many of its promises to the 
people of Canada.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We will now move to the 
next stage of debate where members will be entitled to a maximum 
of 20 minutes in their interventions subject to a 10-minute question 
or comment period.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, to begin with, I would comment very briefly on a remark 
by the hon. member for Laurentides, who, when speaking on behalf 
of the official opposition, accused the minister of partisan politics. 
I could not help noting the irony of her remark in a debate on an 
environment bill when she talked about the Quebec referendum and 
the Ogilvie mills, of her lengthy remarks concerning the <I>Irving 
Whale</I> and of course of the usual litany on centralizing federalism 
with all its sins and evils.
<P>
	Even more ironically, while accusing the minister of partisan 
politics, she herself admitted that the minister chose the option put 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14520"> 14520 </A></B>
<P>
forward by the Bloc Quebecois as  the official minority, rather than 
the option put forward by the Liberal majority.
<P>
	I believe that Canadians, including Quebecers, want to set aside 
this sort of unproductive debate. Everyone agrees that 
environmental concerns transcend political referendum disputes 
and so-called centralizing federalism. For this reason, I am going to 
avoid talking about this sort of thing and keep to the subject of Bill 
C-83.
<P>
	In 1987, I had the honour of being a member of the Canadian 
delegation to the United Nations when Prime Minister Brundtland 
submitted her famous report on the environment and the economy, 
known today as the Brundtland report. She was followed at the 
podium by the president of the Maldive Islands, Mr. Abdul 
Gayoom, who remains the president today.
<P>
	The Maldives are an archipelago of some 100 islands south of 
India in the Indian Ocean. Describing his country in the words of 
the great Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl as jewels on a 
cushion of blue-the Indian Ocean-he said that his country and its 
magnificent islands were not hit by storms and adverse weather 
conditions until the 1980s. They were inundated by enormous 
waves in 1984 and 1985 and then again in 1986 and 1987-for the 
first time in their history. These waves became increasingly 
violent, bringing about distress, destruction and casualties. 
Everybody there was asking the representatives of industrialized 
countries: ``Do we, innocent people of the Maldives, have to pay 
the price for the destruction you caused, for the harm you did to the 
environment, for the greenhouse effect, for all the environmental 
problems for which we are totally blameless and for the 
consequences of your actions?''
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	I submit this is a fundamental problem and that, as a rich country 
with unparalleled natural resources, we must set an example for the 
world, especially for the developing countries which have to 
endure the consequences of the actions taken by industrialized 
countries. We must show the world that sustainable development is 
more than just words.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have to start practising what we preach on the international 
scene. Sustainable development must never be just a catchword. It 
must never be that kind of convenient buzz word that makes us 
escape from the realities of having to integrate economy and 
environment in a realistic and true fashion.
<P>
	If the federal government does not practise sustainable 
development in all its day to day doings in its act of governing the 
country then how can it expect its citizens to do the same? How can 
it expect municipalities and provincial governments to practise 
sustainable development if it does not show the example itself?
<P>
	This is why in 1993 in the red book the Liberal Party of Canada 
devoted a total chapter on sustainable development. One of the key 
parts of that chapter was to install a commissioner of the 
environment. In the red book the idea was such that it be linked to 
the office of the auditor general of the environment.
<P>
	I am very pleased this is becoming a reality with Bill C-83. We 
will become the second country in the world to install a 
commissioner of environment and sustainable development after 
the leading example of New Zealand several years ago.
<P>
	This new office will have significant powers. Beyond the 
significant powers of the office, the very existence of the office of a 
commissioner of environment and sustainable development sends a 
powerful signal not only within the government itself but beyond 
the government into the reaches of Canadian society. They now 
know there will be somebody there, a monitor, an ombudsman, 
who will devote his or her duties to the environment and 
sustainable development in making sure the government itself 
practises what it preaches.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable 
Development held hearings for several months on that topic. Our 
colleague from Davenport really deserves to be congratulated for 
his sensible and really inspiring leadership. In fact, our committee 
had recommended that an independent commissioner of the 
environment and sustainable development be designated, a position 
similar to that of the Commissioner of Official Languages, but the 
government went with the suggestion made by the official 
opposition, to set up a commissioner of the environment and 
sustainable development within the office of the auditor general.
<P>
	Despite the fact that the government did not choose the option 
recommended by the committee, I think-even though I was a 
member of the committee-that it is a major step forward. Today, 
with Bill C-83, we are creating this position of commissioner, 
which becomes irreversible. With the appointment of the 
commissioner, two years from now each government department 
will be required by law to table in the House a sustainable 
development strategy.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	These strategies will have to be updated every three years and 
the revised strategies will also have to be tabled before Parliament. 
So, Parliament will be accountable to the Canadian people for all 
these sustainable development strategies in the future.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is a tremendous departure for the Canadian public that in the 
future every ministry of government will have not only to produce 
a strategy of sustainable development but also be responsible to the 
commissioner  for its being monitored, its being followed up very 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14521"> 14521 </A></B>
<P>
closely to ensure that it really responds to the reality of truly 
integrating economy and environment in our governance.
<P>
	Further, the public can now intervene with the commissioner. 
The public can send petitions to the commissioner if it does not 
agree with government policy or government programs relating to 
environment and sustainable development. The commissioner will 
transmit the petitions to the ministers and the ministers will be 
bound by this bill, Bill C-83, to respond to the commissioner within 
a reasonable delay so that the public at large will feel very truly that 
in the commissioner for environment and sustainable development 
it has an ally, an ombudsman, somebody it can turn to at all times 
and in complete open freedom.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The commissioner will have to table before the House an annual 
report to Parliament. This annual report will give the status of each 
department regarding its sustainable development strategy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Furthermore, the report of the commissioner will have to give 
details of all the petitions he has received from the Canadian 
public, what action has been taken, and what response the ministers 
have given in regard to these petitions.
<P>
	The key issue here is if this commissioner of environment and 
sustainable development will be truly independent and have the 
necessary powers, autonomy, independence to ensure that he or she 
is listened to and that the public feels that through this office it has 
a voice and a say.
<P>
	The best answer to this is that we will now have to amend the law 
of the auditor general. I think all Canadians are fully satisfied to 
date about the independence, the autonomy, the openness of the 
auditor general to freely criticize government when he or she feels 
that criticism is deserved and that criticism is carried far and wide 
into the land and the government pays heed. I am convinced that it 
will be the case with the commissioner for environment and 
sustainable development and that the commissioner will have the 
full independence and autonomy that he or she deserves on behalf 
of the Canadian public.
<P>
	We have just undergone work on behalf of the committee on the 
environment and sustainable development under the leadership of 
the member for Davenport on a massive review of the mainstay of 
Canadian environmental legislation at the federal level, the 
Canadian Environmental Protection Act. This review has touched 
on the various aspects of what must guide the environmental cause 
in the future: the fact that we cannot govern ourselves now in little 
compartments, that ecosystems mean that everything is connected 
with  everything else and we human beings are connected with the 
ecosystems, that without this interconnection, this interdependence 
of all the elements that form the ecosystems and bioregions, 
economic development or profit is impossible. You cannot plant 
trees in a desert. You cannot use water if the stream has dried up.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	We who are blessed with natural resources beyond compare have 
a duty to guide ourselves in the future so that instead of short term 
we look to what our aboriginal brothers and sisters say: seven 
generations ahead. We really truly believe, as they do, that a 
healthy mother earth provides a healthy quality of life but a sick 
mother earth makes us sick as well.
<P>
	I believe that the CEPA review, having put out all these new 
ideas into the realm of the Canadian public today, will see in the 
office of the commissioner of environment and sustainable 
development a tremendous opportunity for these ideas gaining 
ground in actual governance inside the federal system.
<P>
	I believe the time has come for us to realize that we cannot be the 
society of waste we have been. We cannot continue to be the 
society of overuse of energy. We must live differently. We must 
find new ways of production. We cannot toxify and harm our 
natural resources forever without suffering the consequences. This 
is why this bill is so important to all of us today.
<P>
	I was listening to the official opposition with all its litany of 
partisan politics about the referendum. I have always believed and 
my experience has shown me, as a politician in Quebec and also at 
the federal level, that the environment is the greatest binding thread 
among people because it knows no colour, it knows no race, no 
creed, no physical boundary. The environment is all of us. It is life 
itself. It is whatever sustains life and living. It is a tremendous 
binding force for good.
<P>
	I think at this time especially we should reflect on the 
tremendous binding force the environment can be among 
Canadians. If we really truly believe in the environmental cause, in 
quality of life, in the seven generations, then we will back Bill C-83 
with great conviction. I am convinced that it will change the way 
we govern ourselves. It will lead to change in the way we act and 
live as citizens so that we will look to our natural resources to be 
there not only when we ourselves grow old but for the generations 
to come.
<P>
	It is with great conviction that I will vote for Bill C-83.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to be able to be here today to take part in the 
debate and listen to the hon. parliamentary secretary respond to the 
bill before us.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary make a couple of important 
notations in his remarks to the House. He talked about sustainable 
development being more than  just words. Obviously all of us agree 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14522"> 14522 </A></B>
<P>
with that. The whole activity of working toward sustainability must 
be more than just words. It must be seen to be happening, not just 
heard to be happening. Governments often are not trusted because 
they say things that cannot be seen.
<P>
	The committee did a tremendous amount of work on this, as the 
parliamentary secretary has already indicated. In his remarks he 
referred to Canada now being only the second country in the world 
to install a commissioner of the environment. He pointed out that 
New Zealand was the first country to have a commissioner.
<P>
<B>(1340 )</B>
<P>
	The point I wish to address my question to is the concept of 
sustainable development being more than words. The New Zealand 
model for a commissioner is much different from the model being 
put forward in Bill C-83. Helen Hughes, the commissioner of the 
evironment for New Zealand, appeared before the parliamentary 
committee and said at the time that she would find it very difficult 
to operate without being able to look at government policy. The 
commissioner of the environment in New Zealand has the ability to 
look at government policy, has the ability to look ahead.
<P>
	Bill C-83 simply gives the commissioner of the environment 
within the auditor general's department the ability to look at what 
government has done and tell us whether we have made a mistake, 
not to tell us where we have to go and how to get there, not to look 
at the future, the seven generations the member spoke about.
<P>
	I wonder if the minister could tell us how he can talk about New 
Zealand as a model to look up to and then indicate his support for 
Bill C-83, which does not come close to the New Zealand model.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the question 
and also for the very significant contribution he made to our 
committee when we studied this question. All of us on the 
committee were truly grateful for his presence and his contribution.
<P>
	I concede that we did not go as far as our report suggested. 
Sometimes politics is the art of the feasible. However, I think it is a 
significant start toward the New Zealand model.
<P>
	The commissioner will have the task of ensuring that every 
ministry of the government will have to table before the House 
within two years strategies for sustainable development. Strategies 
for sustainable development as such obviously will touch on policy 
and programs because sustainable development is effectively how 
we integrate the economy to the environment within a framework.
<P>
	As the Minister of the Environment stated, environment will not 
be carried just by the Minister of the Environment in the traditional 
sense; every ministry will become a sustainable development 
ministry.  Furthermore, by law it will have to produce to Parliament 
within two years a strategy of sustainable development.
<P>
	This is looking forward and not backward. Obviously the 
strategies will look to the future. If at the time the strategies are 
tabled in Parliament Canadians or parliamentarians are not 
satisfied, the commissioner will be subject to petitions on every 
aspect of these strategies. He will have the power to report once a 
year to Parliament on the status of these stratgies, which will have 
to be updated every three years through Parliament.
<P>
	Therefore, I do believe it is a significiant step forward. It may 
not go as far as the New Zealand model, considering that New 
Zealand is a country of 3 million people and we are a country 10 
times larger and far more complex. At the same time, I am 
convinced that it is a significant step forward.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I also 
have a question for the parliamentary secretary.
<P>
	As he heard earlier, the hon. member for Laurentides spoke at 
length about an assumption of hers. She stated that the federal 
government is using the environment as a means of concentrating 
power in a big way in its own hands. I would like the parliamentary 
secretary in order to tell us what he thinks about the point made by 
the hon. member for Laurentides.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be brief. As an 
environmentalist of many years, as someone who has spent most of 
his political life standing up for the environment, I must say that 
wherever I go in Canada, whether it be in British Columbia, in 
Newfoundland or especially in Quebec where I laboured for most 
of my political career, including three years as Minister of the 
Environment, whenever I talk to environmentalists or 
environmental groups, I realize that they do not make any 
distinction between the federal government and the provincial 
government, when the environment is at stake.
<P>
	All they want is for things to work out. All they want is a 
collective approach where everyone can work together.
<P>
	I know there has been duplication and overlap at times. It is 
unavoidable in a government system like ours. But at the same 
time, given all the positive work that has been done for the 
environment these last few years, and the very fact that the Council 
of Ministers of Environment has become a worthwhile body which 
meets regularly, I think it would be a total exaggeration to say that 
the federal government is using the environment to infringe upon 
provincial areas of jurisdiction. In fact, I think we should put this 
issue aside and find ways to turn the environment into a major 
cause that could rally all of us, because for the sake of the 
environment, we must all work together. Otherwise, we are 
doomed to failure.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, to follow up on my previous comments and questions, 
again I thank the parliamentary secretary for his kind words about 
my work on the committee. I did enjoy the work on the committee.
<P>
	I have congratulated the committee on its work since the report 
was brought forward. The committee certainly did a tremendous 
amount of work. I congratulate the chairperson and the 
parliamentary secretary for their activity with regard to the 
committee as well. I wish the government had listened to the 
committee's recommendations because obviously we would be in a 
better position today with regard to this bill.
<P>
	My question has to do with the departmental strategies the 
parliamentary secretary talked about. The bill asks the auditor 
general for the environment to look at departmental strategies. The 
bill gives the departmental officials two years to write those 
strategies and then exempts them from redoing it again for another 
three years. Does the parliamentary secretary know the purpose of 
the auditor general for the first two years while the departmental 
people are writing these strategies we are all supposed to be so 
excited about?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member raises an important 
point which has also been raised by the official opposition. 
Obviously during the first two years the commissioner will have to 
set up the office and will have to organize the whole work of the 
auditor general's department relating to the environment.
<P>
	Today the auditor general carries out a significant amount of 
work on the question of environment and sustainable development. 
The commissioner will take over this work and will assist the 
auditor general in carrying out this work further.
<P>
	Also, the bill provides a very important function which cannot be 
lessened or minimized which is the power of Canadians to be able 
to submit petitions to the commissioner about government 
performance in sustainable development. These petitions from 
Canadians will certainly go forward and the commissioner will 
have to deal with them.
<P>
	The two years are a very wise investment in time. At least the 
office will be well prepared to deal with infractions that will ensue 
and will also help the auditor general with his important work on 
environment and sustainable development.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
purpose of the legislation we are discussing this morning, that is 
Bill C-83, is to amend the Auditor General Act so as, first, to 
ensure that environmental considerations in the context of 
sustainable development  are taken into account in the auditor 
general's reports to the House of Commons. Second, it provides for 
the appointment of a Commissioner of the Environment and 
Sustainable Development. Third, it imposes requirements for 
responding to petitions received by the auditor general about 
federal environmental matters in the context of sustainable 
development.
<P>
	So that it be clear for all constituents, a petition does not 
necessarily have to be signed by hundreds of people. A complaint 
made by only one person will be processed normally as if it were 
endorsed by one or two thousand people.
<P>
	Four, it requires monitoring and reporting to the House of 
Commons on petitions and the extent to which departments have 
met the objectives, and implemented the plans set out in their 
sustainable development strategies. Fifth and finally, to require 
each department to establish and table in the House a strategy for 
sustainable development.
<P>
	By tabling the bill in this House, the Liberal government across 
the way will be able to claim that it is respecting one of its 
campaign commitments as set out in the red book. In this 
connection, the red book stated-if I may, I shall repeat the exact 
quote that the Minister of the Environment gave a few minutes 
ago-that a Liberal government will ``appoint an Environmental 
Auditor General, reporting directly to Parliament, with powers of 
investigations similar to the powers of the Auditor General. This 
office would report annually to the public on how successfully 
federal programs and spending are supporting the shift to 
sustainable development. The report would also evaluate the 
implementation and enforcement of federal environmental laws. 
Individuals could petition the Environmental Auditor General to 
conduct special investigations when they see environmental 
policies or laws being ignored or violated''. End of quote from the 
famous red book which, incidentally, has become very rare and 
therefore worth its weight in gold.
<P>
	The red book is now being kept hidden away under the counter, 
and it is very difficult for anyone outside the Liberal Party to get a 
copy.
<P>
	It was, however, at the suggestion of members of the opposition 
that the government decided to modify the Auditor General Act to 
integrate the position of Environmental Auditor General. Let us 
indicate right at the outset that the Deputy Prime Minister would 
have liked this position of Environmental Auditor General to report 
to her department, no doubt out of a desire to build up her influence 
within her government or her party, or maybe both. But that is 
another story we can get to later in more detail.
<P>
	Here I would like to make a parenthetical remark. A few 
minutes, a few seconds ago, the parliamentary secretary to the 
Minister of the Environment stated in his response to one of my 
colleagues that the  environmentalists and ecologists wanted things 
to work out.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	He says he is convinced that there is some overlap and 
duplication in terms of public servants, services and money, but 
what people, and particularly ecologists, really want is for the 
operation 
<P>

<B><A NAME="14524"> 14524 </A></B>
<P>
to work. I am almost tempted to tell the parliamentary secretary to 
the Minister of the Environment that we too hope it will work. I 
remind him that it was 25 years just a few days ago that the <I>Irving 
Whale</I>, a barge full of oil, sank off the Magdalen Islands and PEI. 
At the end of June, we learned that there was not only bunker crude 
oil but also PCB-contaminated oil in the wreck.
<P>
	That oil is leaking, slowly but surely, in the Atlantic ocean. If the 
hon. member is so intent on making it work, then he should take 
action. He awarded a contract in the spring and the operation was 
supposed to go smoothly. Yet, the barge is still at the bottom of the 
ocean and hundreds of litres of bunker crude oil are leaking from it. 
Again, if the hon. member really wants the operation to work, he 
should take measures not only to pump the bunker crude oil out, 
but also to get the Irving Whale out of there.
<P>
	With leave, I will carry on after question period, but for now I 
will conclude by reminding the hon. member of the St. Lawrence 
action plan, phases I and II. The government took $6.5 million 
allocated to phase II and invested that money in Miramichi, several 
hundreds of kilometres away from the St. Lawrence River. This is 
the vision of the federal environment department.
<P>
	Indeed, a good part of the money allocated to clean the St. 
Lawrence River, that is $6.5 million out of $20 million, was spent 
in Miramichi, New Brunswick.
<P>
	Such examples must be brought to light daily in the House of 
Commons. I will get back to the green plan after question period.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 30(5), 
the House will now proceed to statements by members pursuant to 
Standing Order 31.

	<B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
August 17, St. Catharines stood before the world's international 
rowing body representing Canada's bid for the 1999 World Rowing 
Championships.
<P>
	Canada won the right to host the biggest world rowing event in 
1999. The federal government played a leading role in the success 
of the bid. The community, local  fundraisers and other levels of 
government will also assist in ensuring this project is a success.
<P>
	The 1999 World Rowing Championships will bring millions of 
dollars and hundreds of jobs to Canada. The event will bring the 
athletes, coaches and media of some 40 countries. It will be the 
final event in a summer long rowing festival in Canada including 
the Pan American Games in Winnipeg, the Canada Cup in 
Montreal, the Commonwealth Regatta in London, the Regatta of 
the Americas in Welland and the Royal Canadian Henley and the 
World's in St. Catharines.
<P>
	I thank all my colleagues for the wonderful support they have

dynamism and proud determination of women everywhere to 
improve their living conditions. The Secretary of State for the 
Status of Women who headed the Canadian delegation made a 
commitment on behalf of her government to promote the equality 
of women via the plan for gender equality.
<P>
	On the strength of those promises, I invite the Canadian 
government to translate words into actions and to immediately 
adopt measures to create employment, daycare services, social 
justice and measures to ensure employment equity as well, bearing 
in mind those areas that are under provincial jurisdiction.

of important challenges: health care reform, tax reform, pension

	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister 
of Transport with his new marine strategy is considering a 
recommendation concerning the policing of Canada's ports.
<P>
	A recommendation that local ports simply use municipal police 
forces or private security firms is just not adequate. The Canadian 
Association of Police Chiefs has expressed its concerns and has 
stated that Ports Canada police officers are specialists in their field, 
they are trained and knowledgeable in national and international 
crimes such as drug trafficking, illegal immigration and terrorist 
activities.
<P>
	Chief Sherwood of the Saint John Police Department has said 
that he does not want the extra responsibility nor does he have the 
manpower or the expertise.
<P>
	I ask, for the safety and security of our country, that the 
recommendation concerning port policing not be endorsed by the 
government and that the port policing continue to be funded and 
operated under federal jurisdiction.

business loan for small business.
<P>
	This program is aimed at helping both existing and new small 
businesses with amounts up to $25,000. It will help ensure that the 
entrepreneurial spirit in Canada is encouraged and that ideas that 
will lead to new businesses and new employment will not be 
starved for lack of capital.

<P>
	An important component of this program is training. All 
participants will be required to demonstrate their ability to handle 
the financial aspects of operating a small business.
<P>
	This is an example of the bank's new role as a complementary 
lender. It is an example of the government's commitment to small 
business and it is an example of how government can create an 
environment in which the private sector can create jobs. I applaud 
this initiative.

weekend a CROP poll reminded us once again that 50 per cent of 
Canadians are open to a partnership with Quebec after a yes vote.
<P>
	Beyond the unyielding stance of politicians who do not want to 
have anything to do with any kind of association with a sovereign 
Quebec, the people show plain common sense, realism and 
pragmatism. As a matter of fact, half of the respondents agree that 
the rest of Canada should maintain an economic and political 
association with a sovereign Quebec.
<P>
	This should be no surprise for government members. Even 
before the federalist scare campaign, the majority of Canadians 
outside Quebec said they were in favour of maintaining an 
economic association. As we can see, they have not changed their 
mind. The Canadian people knows where its true economic 
interests lie.

	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Fourth World Conference for Women has ended in China amid 
conflicting claims of great success and monumental failure.
<P>
	As Canadians we have much of which to be proud. We have a 
reputation world wide as a country which supports diversity and 
equality. Canada's contribution to the United Nations' discussions 
and Canada's non-governmental organizations played a large role 
in promoting human rights and social and economic justice for 
women on all continents.
<P>
	However there are those who choose to present the results of the 
conference as anti-family and to make outrageous claims about the 
intent of the platform of action. I challenge those who choose to 
manipulate the facts to Canadians to answer why it is anti-family to 
condemn female genital mutilation of the girl child and neglect of 
girl children; why it is anti-family to condemn rape as a war crime; 
why it is anti-family to take measures to combat the feminization 
of poverty; and why a platform of action which recognizes the 
family as a basic unit of society that should be strengthened is 
anti-family.

and to have an action plan for implementation.

opinion of Quebecers while a no vote would only give separatists 
the excuse to impose referendum after referendum to Quebecers, 
until sovereignty finally wins.
<P>
	The words of the Bloc leader reveal a paternalistic attitude and

secondary comprehensive school joined forces with the local

to drugs. The separatists put so much pressure on the LCSC that 
it decided to withdraw that publicity from the air until the end 
of the referendum campaign.

refused to condemn France for resuming nuclear testing.
<P>
	Until recently, the PQ had always advocated peace and 
demilitarization. The PQ's political program published since 1970 
states that Quebec will have to gain recognition within the

disarmament over war as a way to settle international disputes and 
by opposing the testing and use of nuclear and bacteriological

pleaded with the judge to incarcerate this man because of his

the accused was released by the judge with a $500 fine.

	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> Please allow me to ssuggest that the Leader of 
the Opposition check in the Robert dictionary, which says that No 
is a negative adverb expressing a negative answer or refusal. It 
certainly does not mean ``maybe'', ``some other time'' or ``next 
time''.
<P>
	Will we ever be done with the ``indépendantistes''? They 
generate this economic instability and they are really costing us.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="QUEBECREFERENDUM">QUEBEC REFERENDUM</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last year, Quebecers elected a sovereignist government 
with a mandate to hold a referendum as soon as possible on 
Quebec's accession to sovereignty.
<P>
	Acting on its electoral promise, the government presided by 
Jacques Parizeau triggered the referendum mechanism in the 
National Assembly.
<P>
	Recently, the Minister of Labour and federal minister 
responsible for the Quebec referendum was called to order by the 
Prime Minister for having said, and I quote: ``We have always said 
that Quebecers had the right to express themselves on the future of 
Quebec, either within or outside Canada. We live in a democratic 
country, so we will respect the vote-''.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Prime Minister: What was so 
wrong about the minister's statement, which reflected the most 
elementary principles of democracy, that would justify the 
humiliating retraction he inflicted on her?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Quebecers will be able to express their opinion on 
October 30 in a referendum.
<P>
	As far as I am concerned, the country has other problems to deal 
with as well, and I will not spend my time answering hypothetical 
questions from the Leader of the Opposition who says that if it is 
yes, it is yes, and if it is no, it is not the right answer.
<P>
	So I do not need any lessons from him.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> I will be able to answer the 
Leader of the Opposition if he tells me if it is supposed to be a 
play-off, two out of three, three out of five or four out of seven.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think someone put on the wrong record, because the 
question was about whether the Prime Minister could tell us why he 
called his minister to order.
<P>
	I would like to ask him whether we are to understand that taking 
the same line he took with his minister, he also intends to call to 
order the chairman of the No Committee, Daniel Johnson, who last 
Tuesday in Quebec City recognized the right of Quebecers to 
decide on their future and promised to respect their decision.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have always said they had the right to have a referendum 
in Quebec. Quebecers can be consulted and can explain their point 
of view.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	However, we on this side of the House are convinced that 
Quebecers, if they are asked an honest question about the 
separation of Quebec from Canada, not a trick question, no clever 
twists and turns but an honest question: Do you want to separate 
from Canada? If the leader of the Leader of the Opposition, Mr. 
Parizeau, was truly intellectually honest, he would have asked 
Quebecers: Do you want to separate? And Quebecers would have 
answered: No, never.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, with respect, I deplore the fact that at the very beginning 
of this fundamental debate, we are hearing applause for a prime 
minister who has just impugned the intellectual honesty of Mr. 
Jacques Parizeau, who certainly does not need lessons from this 
prime minister.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> If I understood the Prime Minister's answer 
correctly, he sees the outcome of this referendum merely as a point 
of view to be expressed by the people of Quebec. I think we should 
consider this from the legal point of view, and I may remind the 
Prime Minister that the National Assembly and the Quebec Gov-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14529"> 14529 </A></B>
<P>
ernment  based their referendum strategy on the right of peoples to 
determine their own future in a peaceful and democratic manner. I 
want to ask the Prime Minister whether he recognizes the right of 
Quebecers to do so.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the Leader of the Opposition wants to ask me about the 
legal aspect, he already has an answer from the Quebec courts, and 
I am not going to get involved in that, but I can answer his question. 
When the Leader of the Opposition says that the right to 
self-determination does not apply to aboriginal people in Quebec, 
he is contradicting himself. So if he wants to have that kind of 
debate, we can have one.
<P>
	As far as I am concerned, I simply want to say that I am 
surprised at the attitude taken by the opposition, which is hiding 
things from the people. They did not want to ask an honest 
question. The Leader of the Opposition told the Americans: ``I am 
a separatist'' and when he is in Quebec, he is afraid to say he is a 
separatist. As for what is happening in Quebec right now, when his 
own economist, Mr. Mathews, prepared honest studies, the leader 
of the government, the leader of the Leader of the Opposition, Mr. 
Parizeau, said he was incompetent. Does the Leader of the 
Opposition agree with Mr. Parizeau that his own economist is not 
competent?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it will be 
noted that the Prime Minister is carefully trying to avoid answering 
questions on the recognition of the right of Quebecers to make 
decisions on their own future. He is also creating confusion by 
censuring his minister responsible for the referendum in Quebec 
because she made the terrible mistake of saying frankly that the 
government should respect the wishes democratically expressed by 
Quebecers.
<P>
	My question to the Prime Minister is very clear and simple, and I 
want an answer. Given the important consequences for all the 
people in Quebec and in the rest of Canada, can the Prime Minister 
tell us clearly whether or not he will respect the choice expressed 
by Quebecers in the upcoming referendum?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like the opposition to tell the government that 
they will respect a No vote. We won the referendum in 1980 but 
they did not respect the wishes of Quebecers.
<P>
	They are doing the same thing again today. The Leader of the 
Opposition says that he does not want the No side to win and that 
he would not regard a No vote as final. When will he stop playing 
with the future of the people, who want their governments to deal 
with the real problems, look after their interests, create jobs and 
provide sound public administration. That is what the people want 
and what the opposition refuses to do.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, they have 
very short memories. Quebec sovereignists have always respected 
the results of the 1980 referendum, as shown by the fact that, 15 
years later, we are still in Canada discussing the Constitution 
because two things have occurred since the referendum. The 
situation has changed, Mr. Speaker. He unilaterally repatriated the 
Constitution-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yes. Yes.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> -and he killed the Meech Lake accord. He is the 
one who is creating problems.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yes. Yes.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, to the man who said in 1980 that No 
meant Yes and that Yes meant No, I ask the following question, and 
we would like an answer.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister of Canada realize that by refusing to 
admit that he will respect the results of the democratic referendum 
to be held in Quebec, he is contradicting the chairman of the No 
committee and his boss in this case, Daniel Johnson from Quebec, 
as well as his minister responsible for constitutional matters and 
the referendum in Quebec? Does he realize that his irresponsibility 
is creating uncertainty and that he is duty-bound to give real 
answers?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, how can Quebec separatists talk to me about the Meech 
Lake accord when they were against it? They were against the 
Meech Lake accord, and so too was Parizeau.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> And you stabbed-in the back. 
Yes.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Although the Leader of the 
Opposition was not present at the end of the Meech Lake debate, he 
claims that it was a humiliation for Quebecers. They claim in their 
propaganda that the rejection of the Charlottetown accord in a 
referendum was a humiliation for Quebecers. Yet, they all voted 
against it. They helped humiliate Quebecers by voting against the 
accord.
<P>
	I reiterate to the opposition that only 3 per cent of Quebecers see 
the Constitution and the referendum as priorities. The remaining 
Quebecers want their parliamentarians to deal with the real 
problems such as job creation, social justice and Canada's place in 
the world. They want us to deal with the real problems and, on 
October 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14530"> 14530 </A></B>
<P>
30, Quebecers will say clearly to the  separatists that they want to 
remain in the best country in the world, Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Canadians want this Quebec referendum to be decisive 
and conclusive. They do not want any confusion or ambiguity 
concerning the meaning of the vote, before or after.
<P>
	Yet the Leader of the Opposition clouds the issue when he says 
that he is prepared to accept a yes vote as binding and conclusive 
but not a no vote, and the Prime Minister does not help things when 
he implies that he is prepared to accept a no vote as binding and 
conclusive but waffles on the meaning of a yes vote.
<P>
	For the benefit of all Canadians including Quebecers who want 
clarity and certainty in interpreting the Quebec referendum, will 
the Prime Minister make clear that a yes vote means Quebec is on 
its way out, that a no vote means Quebec is in the federation for the 
long haul, and that 50 per cent plus one is the dividing line between 
those two positions?
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if we had a clear question. They are asking the people of 
Canada: Do you want sovereignty? At the same time they say they 
want to stay in Canada.
<P>
	Last week <I>The Economist</I> had the title ``They want a divorce 
today and they want to be lovers tomorrow''. It is not a very clear 
question. I have been asking them for a long time in this House of 
Commons to give us a real question, an honest, clear question on 
separation. They have clouded the issue talking about divorce and 
remarriage at the same time. They want me on behalf of all 
Canadians to say that with a clouded question like that with one 
vote I will help them to destroy Canada. You might, I will not, Mr. 
Manning.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would ask all hon. members to please direct 
their remarks to the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a simple supplementary in response to the Prime 
Minister's reply. If the question asked in the Quebec referendum is 
not clear and is ambiguous, is he prepared to ensure a clear 
question is put to Quebecers?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there will be a clear answer by Quebecers on the 30th of 
October. They will say they will stay in Canada so the question is 
purely hypothetical.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, the questions today have bordered on 
the hypothetical. I would ask all hon. members in phrasing the 
questions to please pay strict attention to the fact that they be 
questions which deal  with policy matters of the government as 
opposed to hypothetical questions. I would ask you to do that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I find the Prime Minister's answer adding to the 
ambiguity which as I said at the beginning Canadians do not want. 
He just said that the question was unclear and therefore the answer 
would be ambiguous. Then he said that the response to that 
question would be a clear answer.
<P>
	The majority of the members of this House believe that a yes 
vote in the referendum means the separation of Quebec and an end 
to its participation in the Canadian union. The separatist members 
can talk about a new marriage or partnership but it will be a 
partnership without a partner, a marriage without a spouse and 
Quebec will find itself at home alone.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister therefore state unequivocally that a 50 
per cent plus one yes in the referendum will mean, sadly, an end to 
Quebec's position in Canada and not a new and better union?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, very often when the PQ and the Bloc Quebecois say that 
they will all have an economic and political union, that they will 
have a passport, citizenship, that they will have the same currency 
and so on, they are not being very frank with the people of Quebec. 
That would be decided by the rest of Canada if it were to be the 
case.
<P>
<B>(1435 )</B>
<P>
	But why waste our time? We have so many other problems 
facing this nation. Six weeks from today the people of Quebec, the 
people who were here, who opened up this country, when the 
francophones of this land left the Saint-Maurice valley to open the 
prairies, do we think these people will want to let go of the best 
country in the world? They will not.
<P>
	That is why, Mr. Speaker, you should have the rules of the House 
respected. Hypothetical questions are not permitted in this 
situation.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. In his 
autobiography, <I>In the Lion's Den</I>, published in 1985, our current 
Prime Minister, undertook to abide by the decision made by 
Quebecers, saying that his party was betting on democracy. That 
they would convince that they should remain in Canada and would 
win. If they lost, they would respect Quebecers' wish and accept 
separation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14531"> 14531 </A></B>
<P>
	How does the Prime Minister explain his about-face in refusing 
to accept the outcome of the Quebec referendum?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I actually made this statement in the riding of the Leader 
of the Opposition, in Alma. At the time, when they asked me, I said 
there would be a referendum and we would win. And we had a 
referendum. All this took place before the first referendum. Since 
then, the Leader of the Opposition and the separatists have been 
saying that they will never take no for an answer. So they have 
never said they would accept a no vote as valid.
<P>
	The Leader of the Opposition has again said recently himself 
that there will be referendum after referendum-except Quebecers 
have heard enough talk about the constitution and do not want to 
hear any more about it. They want to hear about the real problems 
concerning Quebecers: job creation, income security, peace for 
seniors. This is exactly what this government wants to do-look 
after the country's real problems-while they are busy playing with 
hypothetical questions. However, they will be making no more 
speeches after October 30.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question was not about hypothetical remarks, but 
about remarks the Prime Minister took the time to write. I imagine 
it was he who wrote his book. It was before 1985, well before the 
Bélanger-Campeau Commission, well before Meech and all that. I 
am asking the Prime Minister how he can justify changing his mind 
on such a basic question, when he stated before the 
Bélanger-Campeau Commission, in 1990-1991 I would remind 
you, and I quote: ``I am a democrat, and I said so in 1980. Had we 
not recognized that Quebec could decide to separate, we would 
have acted differently''.
<P>
	Why is he not saying the same thing today? Are the years 
eroding logic?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I made that statement before the other referendum. We 
had a referendum, but Canada won. So the problem was settled.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> I wrote that before, in 1986, and 
I said at the time that we were going to respect the referendum that 
was held and we won. Now the opposition keeps saying that there 
will be no end, that there will be a referendum so long as it fails to 
win. I have to say that it is very important to respect democracy and 
that, at the moment, the question put by the Parti Quebecois, by the 
leader of the Leader of the Opposition, is ambiguous; it will create 
an ambiguous situation, and Quebecers do not want an ambiguous 
situation. They decided to remain in Canada, and Canada will be 
the winner on October 30.
<P>
<B>(1440 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
to say that I am extremely disturbed and I think Canadians will be 
disturbed at the answers the Prime Minister gave to the leader of 
the Reform Party.
<P>
	We have the separatists in Quebec telling Quebecers that they 
can vote yes and have this imaginary union. Now we have the 
Prime Minister saying that a no vote counts and a yes vote may not 
count. I ask the Prime Minister to reconsider that position 
carefully. Is he not really telling Quebecers that it is easy and 
without risk to vote yes when that is not the case?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I do not know what the real question is the member is 
asking me. I am always telling Quebecers that they have a chance 
to vote again on this.
<P>
	For months and months I have asked the Government of Quebec 
to ask a clear question. It is asking an ambiguous question. Reading 
any comment on that from abroad they all say it is terribly 
confusing. They say we will get divorced and then remarry.
<P>
	The member is asking me to say yes to the question without any 
analysis. Even then they say to Quebecers that separation will not 
come the day after. Therefore, do not tell me to tell them that it will 
be over on October 31. This country will be together on October 31 
of this year and on October 31 of next year. As long as I am alive it 
will be part of Canada. Therefore, I do not want to spend my time 
talking about separation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
country is not going to stay together just on the basis of one man's 
interpretation of a referendum question. It will stay together 
because the Prime Minister and others are successful in convincing 
Quebecers to vote no.
<P>
	I again ask the Prime Minister why he does not simply do what 
the Leader of the Opposition is unwilling to do and tell Quebecers 
that their vote counts, yes or no, and that democracy is on the side 
of the federalists?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, no one that I know of has talked more about Canada and 
Quebec. I know they will vote for Canada even with this 
ambiguous question. Therefore, I do not want to spend my time 
replying to these hypothetical questions. We will campaign in 
Quebec and Quebecers will know that it is in their best interests to 
remain in Canada.
<P>
	I do not understand why the Reform Party is trying to score 
political points when it is time for all Canadians to be on the same 
side in convincing Quebecers to stay in Canada.
<P>

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, strangely enough, the Prime Minister did say-although it 
is not so clear today and I am not too sure any more-that he 
acknowledged the legitimacy of the referendum process under way 
in Quebec. Unlike the Minister of Labour and the chairman of the 
No committee, Daniel Johnson, however, he still refuses to 
recognize the eventual results of this referendum process through 
which Quebecers will decide their political future.
<P>
	How can one logically reconcile acknowledging the legitimacy 
of a democratic public consultation process, take part in it and at 
the same time refuse to recognize its eventual results?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I said several times already, we have asked for a clear 
question and none was forthcoming. They do not even have the 
courage to tell Quebecers that they are separatists. They looked for 
and coined a word to describe themselves, which is not even in the 
French language. They call themselves ``souverainistes''. It is 
nowhere to be found in the dictionary.
<P>
	They do not have the courage to let Quebecers know that they 
want to separate. They are trying to disguise their option and they 
want me to play their game, when I only want them to ask the 
people, I challenge them to ask them this question because the 
debate is not over in Quebec: Do you want to separate from the rest 
of Canada? Period. Then I would be the first one to admit that they 
were honest enough to put an absolutely unequivocal question to 
Quebecers.
<P>
<B>(1445)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, are we to understand from all the answers given by the 
Prime Minister that, as far as he is concerned, the Quebec 
referendum will only be valid if the results are what he is hoping 
for? Is that his idea of democracy?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is the Leader of the Opposition who says that a No vote 
does not mean No, but that a Yes vote means Yes. They are the ones 
who say that. They refuse to respect the people's wishes. They say 
they will go on and on.
<P>
	Quebecers have heard as much as they can take about 
referendums and constitutional issues. They want politicians to 
deal with job creation, provide sound public administration and 
give them an honest and competent government. That is exactly 
what they lack in Quebec and that is why they will be voting for 
Canada on October 30.

	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Canadian agenda includes a lot more than the Quebec 
referendum.
<P>
	Documented lawlessness was occurring at Camp Ipperwash 
since the native occupation on July 29. The local community is 
feeling betrayed by the total absence of military policing. This 
absence culminated tragically and unnecessarily in the death of 
Dudley George at the adjacent Ipperwash Provincial Park.
<P>
	Why did the Department of National Defence allow the 
2,000-acre military camp to go totally unpoliced after a 16-year old 
crashed the bus into the camp buildings area?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, members of the 
band occupied part of Ipperwash in the fall of 1993.
<P>
	In the budget of 1994 the government took the decision that 
Camp Ipperwash would close. It was surplus to our needs. We then 
entered into dialogue with the chief of the Kettle Point Band, Mr. 
Bressette, to talk about transferring ownership as part of the 
original agreement. Those discussions were rather long and 
involved questions of compensation about environmental clean up, 
all of which the government was committed to do.
<P>
	When the rest of the renegade group, which does not accept the 
main band and the chief, occupied the camp some time ago-I 
guess it was in the month of July-the commander on the spot took 
the correct action. Rather than have confrontation where there 
would be loss of life, and given the fact that the camp was not being 
used by the military, the military agreed to withdraw temporarily, 
pending negotiations.
<P>
	Those negotiations have borne fruit with the discussions that 
were held last week by the minister of Indian affairs. Everyone 
should congratulate him on the job he did in bringing a resolution 
to this subject.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister was begged by the town, by the province, by 
the Reform Party, and the chief and council of the band to militarily 
police the camp and instead left a policing vacuum over lands 
under his jurisdiction.
<P>
	The minister swore an oath as a cabinet minister and privy 
councillor to uphold the laws of Canada. When is the minister 
going to do that?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, rather than 
listen to the inflammatory remarks of the hon. member, what we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14533"> 14533 </A></B>
<P>
have seen in the recent  events is that only with dialogue and 
negotiation with Canada's First Nations can we resolve these 
disputes.
<P>
	There was division within the aboriginal community on the 
question of entitlement to that piece of land the federal government 
wants to give back.
<P>
	After the negotiations conducted by my colleague, the Minister 
of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, this now appears to 
be on the way to a satisfactory resolution.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, </B><B>BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last week, the Minister of Labour responsible for the 
Quebec referendum made the following comment: We always said 
that Quebecers have the right to express their views on Quebec's 
future, whether that future is in or out of Canada. We live in a 
democratic country; consequently, we will respect their wish.
<P>

responsible for the Quebec referendum still stand by her statement 
to the effect that she will recognize the result of the referendum 
vote?
<P>
<B>(1450)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have said, and I am proud to say it again in the House of 
Commons, that Canada is a democratic country and this is why I 
hold it so dear, as a Quebecer as well. Let us never forget that.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, we have always said that Quebecers have the right 
to express themselves in a clear and democratic way regarding their 
future. Where is the clear question? Where is the clear question 
from our colleagues? Why are they hiding what is really at stake 
with this referendum? What are they hiding?
<P>
	They are hiding studies. What else are they hiding? Why do they 
not want to tell the truth to Quebecers? The answer will be clear on 
October 30.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister's reprimand was heard clearly. The 
fact is that when the minister said she would respect the wish of 
Quebecers, she knew what the question was.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> So, will the minister recognize that, rather than 
treading on her own principles, she should have had the courage to 
resign to stand for her beliefs, express her attachment to Canada 
and preserve her own credibility?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will repeat what I was just told. I do not  need any advice 
on democracy. I was just told, as Yves Duhaime once said: Is she a 
true Quebecer, since she was elected by the people of 
Saint-Henri-Westmount? Since English speaking people voted 
for me? Mr. Speaker, this is what was just said.
<P>
	You can see the kind of moral standards and ethics we are 
dealing with. Do we have the courage to tell the truth to Quebecers? 
They can decide for themselves. If you ask them ``Do you want to 
separate from Canada?'', the answer will be no.

respect the Quebec referendum results, the Minister of Labour, who 
is responsible for the referendum in Quebec, was put in her place 
by the Prime Minister a few minutes later.

the Minister of Labour at least undertake to plead privately with the 
Prime Minister to convince him to recognize the results of the 
Quebec referendum?

Speaker, as I said before, Quebecers have the right to express 
clearly and democratically what they want their future to be, and 
we will respect this right. That is why we are sure that, faced with a 
clear question, Quebecers will say No to Quebec's separation from 
the rest of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the 
minister admit that, by doing an about-face and saying she no

of the Bosnia peacekeeping mission. Given the massive ongoing  
fighting that is occurring in Bosnia and the fact that this afternoon 
Boutros Boutros-Ghali announced that the peacekeepers should 
leave Bosnia, will the Minister of Foreign Affairs do the right thing 
and immediately announce that our troops will be withdrawn from 
Bosnia?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Canadian soldiers are doing the right thing every day in 
that part of the world. They are there serving in a very difficult 
environment in order to protect civilians and help people to be fed 
and protected. Canada and Canadians should be very proud of what 
our soldiers are doing there.
<P>
	We are committed to the end of the mandate. It is quite clear that 
Canada will respect the mandate it has received from 
parliamentarians and that the Canadians will stay to the end of the 
mandate. We will have a chance to discuss with our colleagues and 
other countries who are contributing troops in that part of the world 
what is the best thing to do in order to enhance the peace process 
that is taking place.

<P>
	As the minister said, they are there for peacekeeping only. That 
is the only function they should be there for but there is no peace to 
keep. Again I ask the minister, why are you breaking faith with our 
troops, abandoning them-

	<B>The Speaker:</B> Earlier in question period I mentioned that you 
should please address your questions through the Chair. I would

those who have come back from Croatia have all indicated their 
pride in participating in such a UN peacekeeping operation, 
although it is a very difficult one.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="RIGHTHON.JOHNDIEFENBAKER">RIGHT HON. JOHN DIEFENBAKER</A></H3>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House to mark the anniversary 
of the birth of John Diefenbaker 100 years ago today.
<P>
	John Diefenbaker was a predecessor in the office of Prime 
Minister. I know I speak for everyone in the House when I salute 
him on this historic day. I am also one of the lucky few in this 
House today who had the opportunity to know John Diefenbaker, to 
see him in action and to serve with him in Parliament.
<P>
	John Diefenbaker was one of those rare public figures who was 
larger than life and who remains larger than life. He helped define 
an entire era in our history. Like all Prime Ministers he left a mark 
on his country through his accomplishments in office, but like only 
a very few Prime Ministers he left a mark on our national psyche 
just by being the way he was. His style, his voice, his very presence 
have all become part of our identity, part of of our mythology.
<P>
	Dief loved politics. He was a career politician and he was proud 
of it. He considered politics and public service an honourable 
calling, the calling of a lifetime, and he gave it everything he had. 
You could love him or hate him-most Canadians fell into one of 
those two categories-but you could never for one second question 
the sincerity and the personal integrity of John Diefenbaker. You 
could disagree with him on an issue-which I often did on a lot of 
things from the Canadian flag to bilingualism-but you could 
never doubt his deep patriotism and love of Canada.
<P>
	Of course, Dief was a populist. Perhaps his greatest 
accomplishment was bringing the firebrand populism of the 
prairies into his House of Commons and into the Government of 
Canada. He never forgot who he was or where he came from. His 
connection to Main Street in Prince Albert connected him with the 
Main Street of every town and city in Canada and with the 
Canadians who lived and worked on those main streets. He was 
their champion. He stood up for them. He railed against the 
establishment, against Bay Street, against the Grits, against the 
socialists and of course very often against his own party. He never 
fudged. He never wavered. He took a side on an issue and he stood 
firm.
<P>
	Like all populists he loved the heat of the battle, the competition, 
the excitement. He loved campaigning. He was truly a great 
campaigner, whirling into town, diving into crowds, shooting at his 
opponents the Grits and the socialists with his arsenal of drama and 
humour. Dief used to say, ``I don't campaign, I just visit with the 
people''. Nobody ever connected better with the people than John 
Diefenbaker.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Above all, he felt at home in the House of Commons. He liked 
this place and I might add that, for a young 29 year old from 
Shawinigan, Mr. Diefenbaker's flights of oratory in this House 
were quite impressive. I used to sit in the last row-my seat was at 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14536"> 14536 </A></B>
<P>
the back over there-and listen to him, because this was quite the 
show as we say. His imposing presence, penetrating stare, theatrics 
and thunderous voice are all as clear in my mind as they were  32 
years ago when I first came to this place. For me-as for millions 
of Canadians-John Diefenbaker will forever epitomize the 
essence of this place.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Patriot, populist, parliamentarian, unhyphenated Canadian: John 
Diefenbaker was all of those things. He left our country a far richer, 
more interesting place than when he entered it 100 years ago today.
<P>
	During his life, he touched the lives of millions of Canadians. 
His legacy will continue to inspire Canadians, be debated among 
Canadians, always people taking different sides because that is the 
way Dief loved it. It will last for a long time because John 
Diefenbaker was a great Canadian.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
listening to the Prime Minister, I could not help but note the irony 
of his remarks and his experience in having the privilege of sitting 
in this House with the Right Hon. John George Diefenbaker.
<P>
	He draws his comments from his own personal memory, in 
contrast to myself who was not yet born when Mr. Diefenbaker 
became Prime Minister of Canada in 1957 with a minority 
government.
<P>
	I draw my remarks today from the collective memory of 
Canadians who will look back on this great man, sometimes with 
questions but most of the time with great admiration.
<P>
	It is important to note that John G. Diefenbaker did not get 
elected the first time he ran. He ran for office many times before 
being successful.
<P>
	At the outset of his life, he knew that the path he would walk 
would be his own and he remained true to that destiny. He became 
Canada's first western Prime Minister, the first Prime Minister who 
was neither of British nor French descent.
<P>
	He brought a unique and rare style of politics to Ottawa. He took 
the populist firebrand politics of western Canada and made it 
mainstream. He came to this place with very deep convictions of 
what Canada represented. Most of all, he had very deep convictions 
in regard to our rights and our responsibilities.
<P>
	In this regard, he meets one of the lasting tests of history. He has 
left behind a legacy that is still with us today: Canada's first Bill of 
Rights was the work of John Diefenbaker.
<P>
	He also brought to national politics a vision of northern Canada. 
He was the first national leader to understand what it meant for 
Canadians to embrace this great, massive land, what it represented 
in our minds and in our imaginations in its limitless potential that 
he went  on to describe as being something that extended from ``sea 
to sea to the northern sea''.
<P>
	John Diefenbaker's passion for Canadians and Canada helped to 
attract people from across the country to politics. I still meet people 
today who say to me that I am a Diefenbaker Tory. I am sure that 
colleagues in the House have from time to time met those samw 
people.
<P>
	I want to quote today one of those Canadians who was 
influenced by John Diefenbaker, the Right Hon. Joe Clark. He said 
following Mr. Diefenbaker's funeral in 1979: ``In a very real sense, 
John Diefenbaker's life was Canada. Over eight decades he 
spanned our history from the ox cart on the prairies to the satellite 
in space. He shaped much of that history, all of it shaped him''.
<P>
	What we may begin to appreciate today, 16 years after his death, 
is his impact on the way which we view ourselves as Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	John Diefenbaker helped form Canada into a country where it is 
possible for a man from Ontario but raised, educated and formed in 
the prairies to be embraced by all Canadians. He illustrated what 
one man can do in a country like Canada.
<P>
	There is no doubt that John Diefenbaker helped shape this 
country into a better, broader and prouder nation than the one 
before.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Diefenbaker had qualities and faults, but we have to give 
him credit for supporting, when he was Canada's Prime Minister, 
efforts to reach Canadians in order to promote individual freedoms. 
At the time, he was criticized for not supporting the Official 
Languages Act, but let us not forget that it is thanks to him if 
bilingualism was introduced in several Canadian institutions.
<P>
	And while he did not agree with some specific initiatives, he was 
always convinced of the importance of protecting individual rights.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There is no doubt that John Diefenbaker helped shape Canada, as 
I said, into a better place. As leader of the Progressive Conservative 
Party of Canada in 1995, I am very proud to be associated with 
him.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, John Diefenbaker was a passionate man. Passionate about 
his vision of his country, passionate in his attachment to his roots, 
firmly anchored in the dense and fertile soil of the Prairies.
<P>
	Throughout the career of this resolute man, one would be 
hard-pressed to find examples of half-measures, grey areas, 
sidestepping and gobbledygook. He belonged to a  generation that 
spoke and acted unequivocally. After returning from the Great War 
injured and with the rank of lieutenant, he suffered, a few years 
later, several defeats at the municipal, provincial and federal levels, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14537"> 14537 </A></B>
<P>
which helped him acquire his legendary determination, before 
coming to this House to which he was re-elected 12 times.
<P>
	Cut and dried as he was, it is not surprising that opinions about 
him are equally passionate on both sides. His career as a people's 
lawyer and the rejection he was subjected to made him sensitive to 
the plight of the disadvantaged and the workers. For example, he 
opened the door to the adoption of the federal health insurance 
policy.
<P>
	He showed the same generosity in the promulgation of the 
Canadian Bill of Rights. In 1961, he condemned apartheid. But 
francophones will also remember him as a fierce opponent of 
bilingualism. And who can forget his fight against the adoption of a 
Canadian flag?
<P>
	His attachment to England was coupled with an embarrassing 
coolness toward our American neighbours. But above all, he 
constantly refused to recognize Quebecers as a founding people, 
even denying Quebec's distinct character. Unfortunately, we know 
that his ideas gained widespread acceptance and that, 32 years after 
his government was defeated, the present government still refuses 
to recognize Quebec as a nation.
<P>
	Quebecers now have the ball in their court and they have to 
express their political will. But, no matter what people may say, 
nobody can accuse John Diefenbaker of backing away from a fight. 
He talked about the country, the language and the people that he 
loved so dearly.
<P>
	In the upcoming debate, he would not, of course, share the 
opinion of Quebec sovereignists. He would certainly be a fierce 
adversary, but I think he would understand that others, like him, 
feel the need to protect their identity, their language and the right to 
exercise their choice as a people.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Yes, he was a great fighter. I cannot help thinking that he would 
enjoy very much to be living now. He certainly would have been 
very much involved with the debate since its beginning. I think he 
would certainly fight for Canada as he thought Canada was, but he 
would understand that many Quebecers would fight for Quebec, for 
what they think Quebec is.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to join with other members in paying tribute today to 
the memory of John Diefenbaker on the 100th anniversary of his 
birth.
<P>
	John Diefenbaker has been described today by the Prime 
Minister and others as a prairie populist, as a man with his roots in 
the common people who sought to give  expression to their hopes, 
fears and dreams through the medium of politics and public policy.
<P>
	As a student I once attended a huge rally which he addressed in 
Edmonton's Jubilee Auditorium. The place was packed and there 
was no place left to sit except at the press tables on the platform 
behind where he was speaking. I took out a notebook and disguised 
myself as a scribe and ended up sitting about 20 feet behind him 
while he addressed about 5,000 people packed into a building that 
would hold about 3,500.
<P>
	As was his custom he had a large sheaf of papers on the podium. 
For the first 10 minutes he simply flipped through the pages 
touching lightly on a subject, assessing the feedback from the 
audience, moving lightly to another subject, touching lightly on it 
and assessing the feedback from it and so forth, until he had a fix 
on the concerns and the hopes of that audience.
<P>
	These he returned to with a vengeance, speaking directly to their 
concerns and hopes with an accuracy and a vigour that defied 
imagination. He had a peculiar ability to read an audience very 
quickly and to relate quickly and forcibly to the hopes and fears of 
his fellow Canadians.
<P>
	As a prairie populist John Diefenbaker was one of a select list of 
characters that cuts across party lines, including F. W. G. Haultain, 
the last great premier of the Northwest Territories; John Bracken 
and Henry Wisewood of the Progressives; William Aberhart, J. S. 
Woodsworth and Tommy Douglas. What set John Diefenbaker 
apart was that he was the only prairie populist in this century to 
become the Prime Minister of Canada.
<P>
	Like all of us he had weaknesses as well as strengths. He had 
detractors as well as admirers and supporters. However there was 
one point on which he could not be faulted and that was on his love 
and commitment to Canada, ``one Canada'' to use his favourite 
phrase.
<P>
	On behalf of my Reform colleagues, the people of Saskatchewan 
and the hundreds of thousands of Canadians who either loved him 
or hated him but were never indifferent to him, I pay tribute to John 
Diefenbaker and his commitment to one Canada, on the 100th 
anniversary of his birth.

School, Diefenbaker House and a statue of John Diefenbaker in 
Memorial Square. In addition we have Prime Ministers' Park. We 
will not quickly forget the legacy of John Diefenbaker in our 
community.
<P>
	I also express our gratitude to the lasting and profound legacy he 
left to our entire nation, including the very important Canadian bill 
of rights. Mr. Diefenbaker believed, as do the vast majority of 
Canadians, in the economic and cultural benefits expressed in a 
phrase that he was very fond of and used often: ``The economic and 
cultural benefits of one Canada, united now and forever''.

Prime Minister John George Diefenbaker.
<P>
	When John George Diefenbaker was elected Prime Minister of 
Canada I was six years old. Mr. Diefenbaker was 62 years old and 
had already been in Parliament for 17 years. Yet I had the honour, 
however briefly, of being a colleague of his when I like him was 
elected to the 31st Parliament of Canada on May 22, 1979.
<P>
	I remember walking into the parliamentary dining room and 
seeing Dief in the alcove to the left where Prime Ministers like to 
eat and feeling like I was now in authentic parliamentary company.
<P>
	It should be repeated of John Diefenbaker often that not unlike 
other parliamentary legends, some of whom are still with us today 
such as Mr. Knowles, he loved Parliament and all that it stood for. 
He understood Parliament. He knew it to be a place where different 
ideas and different idealists clash with each other and have it out 
with each other. The sanitized corporate boardroom view of 
Parliament which we see encouraged in some quarters today was 
not for John Diefenbaker.
<P>
	While we are talking about corporate boardrooms it is also 
appropriate to note that in my judgment John Diefenbaker was 
probably one of the last Prime Ministers of the country who served 
for any length of time, who was not at home in the company of the 
Canadian corporate elite. His politics though not socialist were 
populist and he was certainly more at home on Main Street than on 
Bay Street. That is why he was able, much to the distress of my 
party on occasion, to win ridings that otherwise should have been 
NDP.
<P>
	He was progressive for his time and for his party on human 
rights issues, on the equality of women, on social programs, on 
aboriginal issues, on South Africa and on  other such issues. One 
recalls with fondness his opposition to capital punishment, for 
instance. Most of all, though I concur with many of the critical 
analyses offered of his prime ministership, I remember Mr. 
Diefenbaker as a Canadian, an unhyphenated Canadian, who had a 
vision of Canada that far exceeded the banal images of the 
marketplace so commonplace in our way of speaking today.
<P>
	It was a vision of an independent Canada, a Canada that did not 
take its orders or its agenda from Washington, a Canada that 
determined its own way in the world and its own way of doing 
things. It was this independence that George Grant lamented the 
loss of when he wrote a ``Lament for a Nation'' after the fall of the 
Diefenbaker government and the acceptance of nuclear weapons by 
the government that followed.
<P>
	John Diefenbaker struck a chord in the hearts of many 
Canadians. It was not long after the election of 1979-three months 
actually-that his funeral train wound its way across the Canadian 
landscape. It was the last trip on the hustings for a man who loved 
politics, who loved Canada, who loved political life and who 
always said that next to the ministry he regarded politics as the 
highest calling.
<P>
	Finally, on a personal note, my exposure to John Diefenbaker 
came long before my election to Parliament or the few occasions 
on which I had an opportunity to discuss issues with him as a young 
person interested in politics, because I did have that opportunity. 
Some members may also know that I play the pipes. As a piper I 
had the task of piping him into the hall at a number of events in 
Winnipeg over the years. I remember one in particular at the 
Rossmere Curling Club when I could barely make it through the 
crowd to the front for the crush of people reaching out to shake 
hands with their Chief.
<P>
	Dief was fond of the phrase ``in my day and generation''. I am 
grateful that in my day and generation, however briefly, I had the 
opportunity to see that great Canadian in action. We should all hope 
when our day and generation are judged we will be able to say, 
however differently and however varied our ways of doing so 
might be, that we too served Canada with the loyalty and the love 
of this great country that John Diefenbaker demonstrated. May it 
always be said of us, as he said of himself, that though we might be 
on the wrong side from time to time, may we never find ourselves 
on the side of wrong.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last week, like all Canadians, I was deeply saddened to 
hear that Jean-Luc Pepin, who was one of my colleagues here in the 
House of Commons, had passed away.
<P>
	He was elected in 1963, at the same time as I was, to represent a 
riding close to mine, near Drummondville on the other shore of the 
Saint Lawrence, and we began our career together. We even went 
back to university together. At that time, we were expected to be in 
the House in the evening. We both took courses in administrative 
law, so that we would be able to come to the House if there was a 
vote. We became good friends. We both had the privilege of 
studying, if I can use the term, under Mitchell Sharp. Mr. Pepin had 
been appointed parliamentary secretary to Mr. Sharp when he was 
at Trade and Commerce; I became Mr. Sharp's parliamentary 
secretary when he moved to Finance.
<P>
	Jean-Luc Pepin was an intellectual who was actively involved in 
public life. One could not have wished for a nicer guy. He was kind 
to everyone, but at the same time he was extremely hard working. 
Any issue he was given would be examined in depth, so much so 
that he sometimes almost made himself ill through his 
thoroughness. I have rarely seen colleagues read through all the 
documents that had been prepared for them, but Jean-Luc Pepin 
certainly did.
<P>
	Jean-Luc Pepin also had a broad vision of Canada. He always 
searched for solutions to our problems, and his participation in our 
very animated discussions, both in caucus and here in the House of 
Commons, was always followed with great interest. He was always 
well informed and constantly sought out new solutions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	He was a very good minister. He started as Minister of Industry, 
Trade and Commerce. He was the first among the ministers to visit 
China right after we recognized China 25 years ago. He led the first 
businessmen's mission to Latin America. When today as Prime 
Minister I am involved in visiting the same area, I cannot help but 
think about the vision and wisdom of Jean-Luc Pepin in doing his 
work as Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce.
<P>
	I remember he unfortunately lost an election in 1968, and he 
came back. It was a very amusing moment, because after-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	When he lost the election, everyone deplored his loss and 
lamented the fact that Jean-Luc Pepin would no longer sit in this 
House. But suddenly, after a recount, he  was back. He showed us 
all the glowing editorials that he had received and just as he was 
about to use them in the House in powerful speeches, he was ousted 
again following a judicial recount. He was absent from this House.
<P>
	He served in numerous positions. He was a member of the 
Pepin-Robarts Commission and submitted a very important report 
which was widely discussed but which was not fully implemented. 
However, a good loser, he always accepted the decisions that were 
made, offering new solutions and never giving up. He chaired the 
commission on price and wage controls, something that was not 
easy to do at the time. He did so very tactfully and competently. Of 
necessity we became friends because when you are not from the big 
city of Montreal, when you come from the country, you tend to join 
ranks. He was a very good friend but first and foremost, he was an 
outstanding member of Parliament, an outstanding minister and a 
great Canadian. With his passing last week, our country has lost a 
great public servant.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on behalf 
of my political party, I would like to pay tribute today to Mr. 
Jean-Luc Pepin, who passed away a few days ago.
<P>
	Born in Drummondville in 1924, Mr. Pepin had a brilliant career 
both as an academic and a politician. He was first elected to the 
House of Commons in 1963 to represent the 
Drummond-Arthabaska riding.
<P>
	In 1968, under the Trudeau government, he became the first 
Quebecer ever to be put in charge of an important economic 
portfolio when he was appointed Minister of Industry. During his 
career as a member of Parliament and a federal minister, he was at 
the centre of several major reviews and often had to meet tough 
challenges, including implementation of the metric system, 
transport deregulation and the development of a more open 
relationship between Canada and the People's Republic of China.
<P>
	It is particularly important to mention the contribution of 
Jean-Luc Pepin as co-chairman of the Pepin-Robarts Commission, 
a working group set up to examine the constitutional and political 
problems facing Canada. Despite the extremely centralizing vision 
of the Trudeau government, this Quebecer had the fortitude to 
defend with conviction the concept of asymmetrical federalism. As 
we know, according to this concept, the province of Quebec would 
have been able to display its specificity and to have, as indicated in 
the commission's report, all the powers needed to preserve and 
develop its distinctiveness.
<P>
	The rest is history, as we say. Pierre Trudeau and the current 
prime minister turned dow the report before forever entrenching in 
the 1982 Constitution the principle of equality for all provinces.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14540"> 14540 </A></B>
<P>
	We will remember Mr. Pepin for his exceptional contribution 
to the political debate which is still going on today. We will 
remember how this Quebecer tried without success to ensure that 
the right of Quebec to develop as a distinct entity was recognized.
<P>
	On behalf of my colleagues in this House and on my own behalf, 
I would like to extend to his family and friends our deepest 
sympathy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
join with other members of the House in paying tribute to the 
memory of Jean-Luc Pepin and his contributions to the public life 
of this country over the years.
<P>
	On behalf of my Reform colleagues I would also like to extend 
our deepest sympathies to the Pepin family on their loss and indeed 
our country's loss.
<P>
	The media and other speakers today have made reference to the 
long list of achievements and contributions to our national life 
associated with Jean-Luc Pepin. These include his contributions to 
academic life, particularly at the University of Ottawa, his 
contributions as a senior minister of the crown, including his 
proposals as Minister of Transport for reforming the Crow's Nest 
freight rate, and his contributions as co-chairman of the task force 
on Canadian unity. Of course on the subject of national unity, if 
some of those proposals had been brought forward and acted upon 
more vigorously we wonder where we would all be today.
<P>
	What we find most memorable about the contributions of 
Jean-Luc Pepin is that in his case we not only remember what he 
did and proposed but we remember even more vividly and fondly 
the manner and the spirit in which he did it: his humour, his 
enthusiasm, and his positive outlook. I can remember being a 
young woman in Canada in my high school and university days and 
seeing a picture on television of some mysterious man that was so 
far away in eastern Canada. I remember that glint in his eye when 
he was being interviewed. It is a wonderful memory I carry of him.
<P>
	In a country where too often the spirit of pessimism prevails, the 
cheerfulness and optimism of a man like Jean-Luc Pepin should not 
only be remembered but imitated. In so doing we would be paying 
fine and fitting tribute to a man and his memory. May all of us in 
this House remember the remarkable role model he has been to us 
in Canada.
<P>
	We wish his family well and we sympathize with them.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):</B> I thank 
you, Mr. Speaker, for this opportunity to pay tribute to the late hon. 
Jean-Luc Pepin.
<P>
	Jean-Luc Pepin passed away a few days ago. This great 
Canadian, always gracious and charming, gave a good name to 
political life.
<P>
	I first met Mr. Pepin as a student at Ottawa University where he 
taught political science.
<P>
	Jean-Luc Pepin was first elected to the House of Commons in 
1963 as member for Drummond-Arthabaska where he served 
until 1972.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	A man of ideas which he expressed with the greatest of ease, he 
loved to serve his country. He was a firm believer in Canadian 
unity. He will probably be remembered for his significant 
contributions to Canadian life, especially his contributions to the 
Task Force on Canadian Unity know as the Pepin-Robarts 
Commission.
<P>
	In 1979, he was reelected, but this time as member for 
Ottawa-Carleton which he represented until 1984. For the most 
part, this riding later became the new riding of 
Carleton-Gloucester, as a result of the 1988 readjustment of 
electoral boundaries.
<P>
	It is for me a great honour to have been elected in the same riding 
as the hon. Jean-Luc Pepin who served it so well in the House of 
Commons as a minister and where he lived until his death.
<P>
	I salute a man who defended both our official languages and 
promoted bilingualism across Canada. I salute a man who 
promoted Canadian unity with integrity, compassion, elegance and 
charm.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
behalf of the NDP caucus, I join with others in the House of 
Commons in expressing condolences to the family of Jean-Luc 
Pepin and say a few words about him by way of recollection on the 
basis of my own experience in this House between 1979 and 1984.
<P>
	One should be honest and say that what I remember of Jean-Luc 
Pepin is fighting him on all fronts with respect to the Crow rate and 
VIA Rail cuts. He had the misfortune, I would suggest, of being 
assigned these tasks by the then Liberal government.
<P>
	I suspected at the time that he was not always completely happy 
in the role he was assigned, especially when it came to the VIA Rail 
cuts, because I know that his father worked for CN and he had a 
railway background. He sometimes looked a bit uncomfortable, but 
he handled everything. He handled those issues as he handled 
everything, with a great deal of grace, a great deal of generosity, a 
great deal of humour, and with a kind of philosophical touch that 
one does not see all that often here in the House of Commons.
<P>
	The thing I remember most about him was the sort of intellectual 
delight he took in argumentation and debate. He was one of the few 
members of Parliament I can  remember who sprinkled his debates 
on the Crow rate and other more seemingly practical issues with 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14541"> 14541 </A></B>
<P>
quotations or allusions to Sarte and Camus and Nietzche and 
various other philosophers whose works he was obviously familiar 
with.
<P>
	I remember him as a great parliamentarian, a great Canadian, 
someone committed, as so many have said, to Canadian unity. It is 
unfortunate that at this very critical time in our history we will not 
have the voice of Jean-Luc Pepin being able to contribute to the 
debate that is upon us about Canada's future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I 
heard members pay homage to Mr. Diefenbaker and Mr. Pepin 
today, I could not help thinking that these two men, although 
coming from different parts of the country and having had very 
different, maybe totally opposite experiences, if they were with us 
today would both speak with equal fervour about Canada, each 
with his own point of view, as some others members in this House 
would.
<P>
	Who knows, maybe it is a coincidence that we should be paying 
homage to both these men on the same day. As it has been said, Mr. 
Pepin was an intellectual but he was also a very sensitive man. He 
had an exceptional political career; that proves it is not always 
necessary to be aggressive to succeed in politics and it is not true 
that the political environment is always a very harsh one. On the 
contrary. Jean-Luc Pepin has always acted with a lot of tact and 
respect for others. It characterized his political career.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	I am happy to stress that fact today for the benefit of all those 
who wonder if political men and women are people who still 
believe in the values Mr. Pepin cherished.
<P>
	As my colleague just mentioned, Mr. Pepin was entrusted with 
very difficult departments and very complex issues. I am thinking, 
among other things, about the rail subsidies and the Crows Nest 
rate, two issues that were never easy to deal with, needless to say. 
He always took on the responsibilities with an exemplary sense of 
duty. He did the same thing when he co-chaired the Pepin-Robarts 
Commission. Colleagues from our party who had the pleasure and 
privilege of working with Mr. Pepin remember him as an 
absolutely exceptional man.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Jean-Luc Pepin and John Diefenbaker whom we have honoured 
today are two Canadians who, even though they came from two 
very different backgrounds, if they were with us in this House 
today would agree wholeheartedly on one thing and that is about 
Canada and its future.
<P>
	On behalf of the party I represent and the men and women who 
knew him in this House I want to pay a special tribute to him. I 
extend our condolences to his family. I know he will be missed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, on 
September 5, the right honourable Jean-Luc Pepin, one of the most 
significant figures on the Canadian political scene since the 1960s, 
died on the eve of his 71th birthday. The death of this former 
member of Parliament and minister caught us by surprise. All those 
who knew him were also caught by surprise, but we also witnessed 
his numerous achievements and his departure can only fill us with 
sadness and nostalgia.
<P>
	It was largely thanks to this great Canadian that our country 
adopted the metric system. It was mentioned earlier that it was also 
largely thanks to him that the Canadian government became more 
open to the People's Republic of China well before other countries 
did. The same goes for his work in the Department of Transport, 
with the elimination of the Crow rate and with Via Rail.
<P>
	We will also long remember him for the Anti-Inflation Board 
and for the Pepin-Robarts Commission, whose findings still remain 
relevant today in any discussion concerning relations between the 
federal and the provinces. I wish I could avoid being partisan, 
because Mr. Pepin always avoided excessive partisanship. But after 
listening to some remarks, I cannot help but mention that, during a 
dinner that was held about ten days before his death, we had the 
opportunity to discuss the political issue of the day, the 
referendum, and I wish to note that, even though he was almost 71 
years old, Mr. Pepin clearly said to me at the time that, if necessary, 
he would willingly agree to campaign for Canada.
<P>
	I wish to thank him as a personal friend, as one of his 
students-because I was one-as his assistant, as an admirer and 
now as the member for Ottawa-Vanier. I would like to extend my 
condolences to the Pepin family as well as those who were close to 
this great political man.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I first met the late Jean-Luc 
Pepin in 1979 when I was elected to this House. That was the year 
the Conservatives won the election against the Liberals.
<P>
	Every time there is a change of government there is also a 
change of caucus rooms because each party has a different size 
caucus. Jean-Luc Pepin was advising me as a newly elected 
member on what and what not to do. He always gave 100 per cent 
of his time. He was so intent on talking to me that when we arrived 
at the caucus room the camera lights all flashed and I did not know 
what was happening. What happened is that he was so engrossed in 
advising me that we walked into the wrong caucus  room. That is a 
bit of the humorous side of Jean-Luc Pepin. It shows how helpful 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14542"> 14542 </A></B>
<P>
he was to new members and when he spoke to us he gave 100 per 
cent. When he listened he gave 100 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister mentioned about his term when he was 
parliamentary secretary to the Hon. Mitchell Sharp. I happened to 
be his parliamentary secretary in 1982-83 when he was Minister of 
Transport. Yes, I along with the late Jean-Luc Pepin faced the Via 
Rail debates here and placards over our heads about the Crow bill, 
et cetera. He made the tough decisions. One thing about him is he 
listened to all sides before he made a decision. I think that is why 
he was so popular.
<P>
	His immediate family and extended family can take great pride 
in the fact that he was a great Canadian. But we have not lost him; 
he will always be with us.

	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is my sad duty today to rise in tribute to Dr. Charles 
Willoughby who was a former member of this House.
<P>
	Dr. Willoughby lived a long and very distinguished life 
practising medicine in the interior of British Columbia for many 
decades and serving as MP for Kamloops from 1963 through to 
1965 when Davey Fulton was serving in provincial politics. He was 
said by one of his successors in the riding, now Senator Len 
Marchand, to have been regarded as one of the finest gentlemen of 
his community.
<P>
	There are few Canadians who have been privileged to witness 
the unfolding of Canadian history as much as Dr. Willoughby who 
was born in rural Ontario 101 years ago when David Thompson 
was Prime Minister. He served in this House in the days of Prime 
Minister Pearson and Prime Minister Diefenbaker and indeed lived 
to see a fellow member of the class of 1963, the member from 
Shawinigan in turn become Prime Minister in 1993.
<P>
	Dr. Willoughby wrote two books, one when he was 99 years old. 
One is called <I>From Leeches to Lasers</I> and is about the development 
of medicine. The other is titled <I>Shuswap Memories</I>, his warm, 
vivid and sympathetic recollections of his years in the Shuswap 
country in the early decades of this century.
<P>
	Dr. Willoughby had four children, 20 grandchildren and 33 great 
grandchildren. I know everyone in this House offers their 
condolences to his family and friends at this sad time.
<P>
	While it is sad to say goodbye to such a distinguished British 
Columbian and Canadian, I am sure that all of us also hope to enjoy 
as long and as rich a life as that of Dr. Charles Willoughby.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
pay tribute to Dr. Willoughby and, on behalf of all the members of 
the Bloc Quebecois, offer my condolences to members of his 
family and his friends.
<P>
	Dr. Willoughby was a member of this House in 1963; you will 
understand that at that time I was only 21 years old and did not 
have the opportunity to know him. However, from the notes I have 
in front of me, I gather that he was 69 when he was elected for the 
first time to this House. I understand that Dr. Willoughby first 
made a career in medicine, devoting himself to his fellow men, and 
then at an age when most people take a well deserved retirement, 
he decided to devote a few more years of his life to the service of 
his fellow citizens of Kamloops.
<P>
	This is indeed remarkable, and it must be said that since he died 
this year at the age of 101, public life obviously rejuvenates and 
gives a taste for life. On behalf of all the Bloc Quebecois members, 
I reiterate our deepest condolences to his large family, to his 
children and grand-children and to all his friends.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to honour the memory of Dr. Charles James McNeil 
Willoughby who passed away September 5 of this year in 
Kamloops, British Columbia.
<P>
	Dr. Willoughby's life was a life of service to others. It is clear 
from his history that he with the support of his wife Marjorie 
recognized the full responsibility that comes with citizenship and 
actively sought to make his community a better place, a selfless 
characteristic we would all do well to emulate today.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	From all accounts he was committed to Kamloops and her 
people as a physician and surgeon with the Burris clinic for 40 
years, as a member of the Kamloops school board, as chairman of 
the United Appeal, and as the member of Parliament for Kamloops 
during the 26th Parliament. That commitment has now become his 
legacy, a legacy which has influenced many including his children, 
Marjorie, Lorene, Ann and John, his 20 grandchildren and his 33 
great grandchildren.
<P>
	During these times when outside forces pull against our families 
and our communities, people like Dr. Willoughby provide a strong 
and quiet leadership that inspires us to draw together.
<P>
	To his three surviving children, Marjorie, Lorene and Ann, and 
to his daughter-in-law Berte, I send on behalf of my colleagues our 
deepest condolences. I hope they will find comfort in the 
knowledge that their father will be remembered as a courageous 
man who embraced the responsibility of making this place a better 
one.

	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, all of us who 
knew him were sad to hear recently of the passing of Dr. Charles 
Willoughby.
<P>
	Dr. Willoughby was one of those rare individuals who certainly 
left a lasting impression with those who met him. I had the honour 
of knowing Charles Willoughby for more than 30 years, first when 
he was member of Parliament for Kamloops. He was one of those 
individuals who was admired by all. Even his political foes could 
not find a negative statement to make about him ever. He was loved 
by all who came in contact with him. He was a gentleman in the 
true sense of the word.
<P>
	As others have indicated, he was a very dedicated family man. 
He was an admired doctor for decades. Again he was one of those 
rare individuals in that every patient who came in contact with him 
loved him and admired him. He was certainly a respected author. 
He was a distinguished parliamentarian. He was a proud citizen not 
only of the city of Kamloops but of the world.
<P>
	Over the years I would encounter Dr. Willoughby at public 
functions and on the streets of Kamloops. He always had words of 
advice and suggestions and was always aware of the issues of the 
day. His family said that even beyond his 100th year when the 
evening news came on all became quiet to allow Charles 
Willoughby to be updated as to the events of the day.
<P>
	He was a wonderful individual. The people of Kamloops loved 
him to the end. Our hearts and our thoughts go to his family today.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay 
tribute to the hon. Dr. Charles James McNeil Willoughby.
<P>
	The Progressive Conservative Party of Canada lost a great 
colleague this year and the people of Canada lost a great Canadian 
with the passing of Dr. Willoughby at the age of 101.
<P>
	Before being elected to the House in 1963 as the member for 
Kamloops, British Columbia, Dr. Willoughby was a local icon who 
was very well known. He helped found and establish the very 
successful Burris Medical Clinic, a clinic which is still functioning 
and thriving today.
<P>
	As was mentioned by the minister from British Columbia, Dr. 
Willoughby wrote a very insightful book, <I>From Leeches to Lasers</I> 
which detailed the medical advances during his life. The title 
accurately illustrates what technological and medical changes Dr. 
Willoughby saw during his lifetime.
<P>
	Dr. Willoughby was renowned for being a staunch federalist 
whose love for his country was second to none. Even after his term 
as a parliamentarian Dr. Willoughby kept abreast of national events 
and is rumoured to have stopped to watch the evening national 
news every day regardless of what he had been doing.
<P>
	Dr. Willoughby's then Dominion of Canada lapel pin was his 
trademark. It is with great pride that I recognize his contribution to 
Canadian politics. Our deepest sympathy goes out to the family of 
this wonderful great man.

Speaker, I have the honour to present in both official languages the 
fourth report of the Standing Committee on Health, entitled 
``Towards Holistic Wellness: the Aboriginal Peoples''.
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 109, the committee requests that the 
government table a comprehensive response to this report within 
150 days.
<P>
	Your committee decided to undertake a study on the health of 
aboriginal peoples following a request by one of the national 
aboriginal organizations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Committee concentrated on the mental health of aboriginal 
peoples. It received written and oral evidence from numerous 
representatives of Indian, Metis and Inuit communities.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Following consideration of the evidence heard over the past year, 
your committee takes the position that all levels of government and 
representatives of aboriginal peoples must work jointly with 
communities to develop a comprehensive and co-ordinated plan for 
wellness.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Therefore the Committee asks that the federal Minister of Health 
propose to the meeting of health ministers the immediate 
establishment of a consultative mechanism to allow development 
of a national action plan to improve the well-being of aboriginal 
peoples and that she present every year a status report on the plan to 
Parliament.

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36, I wish to present a petition that has 
been circulating all across Canada. This particular petition has been 
signed by a number of Canadians from Alberta, Saskatchewan, and 
the Yukon.
<P>
	The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House 
that managing the family home and caring for preschool children is 
an honourable profession, which has not been recognized for its 
value to our society. They also state that the Income Tax Act 
discriminates against families who make the choice to provide care 
in the home to preschool children, the disabled, the chronically ill 
and the aged.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call upon Parliament to pursue 
initiatives to eliminate tax discrimination against families who 
decide to provide care in the home for preschool children, the 
disabled, the chronically ill or the aged.

from my riding of Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt but also 
signators from across this country, including places such as Bath, 
Ontario, Seeleys Bay, Lansdowne, Ontario, and also Victoria, 
British Columbia.
<P>
	The petitioners draw to the attention of the House that the Bloc 
Quebecois has publicly dedicated itself to a disloyal objective, that 
being the secession of the province of Quebec from the Canadian 
federation. Therefore, the petitioners call on Parliament to preserve 
unity, parliamentary tradition, and to protect the rights of all people 
of Canada by prevailing upon the Speaker of the House of 
Commons to recognize the Reform Party of Canada as the official 
opposition during the remainder of the 35th Parliament of Canada.

behalf of Canadians.

<P>
	This petition calls for a loyal opposition in the House of 
Commons. The petitioners call on Parliament to  preserve 
Canadian unity, parliamentary tradition, and to protect the rights of 
all the people of Canada by prevailing upon the Speaker of the 
House of Commons to recognize the Reform Party of Canada as the

	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, pursuant 
to Standing Order 36 I am pleased to present two petitions today.
<P>
	The first group of petitioners is extremely concerned about 
including the phrase sexual orientation in federal legislation. They 
believe this sets a very dangerous precedent for society.
<P>
	The second group of petitioners requests that the Government of 
Canada not amend the human rights act to include the phrase sexual 
orientation. The petitioners fear that such an inclusion could lead to 
homosexuals receiving the same benefits and societal privileges as 
married couples.

Question No. 172-<B>Mr. Strahl:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>With regard to the special retirement allowance for deputy ministers 
approved by Treasury Board on July 14, 1988, (<I>a</I>) how many individuals are 
currently benefitting from this allowance and (i) how much pension is each 
individual receiving from the federal government per annum, using figures 
broken down by the amount of the allowance and the amount of the remainder 
of their pension, (ii) what is the list of their names, (iii) what was the last 
employment position they held before receiving the Allowance, (<I>b</I>) how many 
individuals will be eligible to receive the special retirement allowance after the 
current fiscal year and (i) what is the list of their names, (ii) what is their 
employment position, (iii) how much will they be eligible to receive, using 
figures broken down by the amount of the allowance and the amount of the 
remainder of their pension, and since July 14, 1988, (<I>c</I>) how many deputy 
ministers have been recruited directly from the private sector, including crown 
corporations and what positions were they recruited from?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Twenty individuals are benefiting from the 
allowance. The amount of the pension received by each individual 
cannot be released since it is considered personal information in 
accordance with the Privacy Act. For the same reasons, the names 
of individuals in receipt of a pension from the federal government 
cannot be released, nor the amounts.
<P>
	It is not possible to determine how many people will be eligible 
to receive the special retirement allowance at a  future date for 
example, after the current fiscal year. Deputy ministers serve at 
pleasure and they must retire to become eligible; the decision to 
retire is not always communicated ahead of time. Furthermore, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14546"> 14546 </A></B>
<P>
eligibility for pension varies in accordance with age and service at 
the date of retirement.
<P>
	Since 1988 the number of deputy minister positions has been 
reduced by 19 per cent and one individual has been recruited 
directly from the private sector to a deputy minister position; he 
was the CEO at a consulting firm. Four other individuals appointed 
deputy ministers, since July 1988 had recent experience outside the 
federal public service.

(<I>a</I>) reoffend, are formally charged and subsequently sentenced on a charge of first

on a charge of second degree murder or, (<I>c</I>) reoffend, are formally charged and 
subsequently sentenced on a charge of manslaughter?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> In so far as 
the Ministry of the Solicitor General of Canada and its agency are 
concerned, the answer is as follows regarding the National Parole 
Board:
<P>
	Prior to July 1976, murder was separated into capital and 
non-capital murder. The category of non-capital murder was 
established on January 4, 1968. Prior to that date all murder was 
capital murder. The categories of first and second degree murder 
were created on July 26, 1976 when capital punishment was 
abolished.
<P>
	A review of statistical studies which examined the outcome of 
released murder and manslaughter offenders indicated that 19 
offenders previously convicted of a homicide offence, 
manslaughter or murder,were convicted and reincarcerated for a 
second homicide between 1920 and 1990. This research revealed 
that six offenders were convicted of a second murder. Thirteen 
offenders originally convicted of manslaughter were reincarcerated 
for another homicide offence, five for murder offences and eight 
for a second manslaughter offence. The following is a summary of 
the findings of these studies.
<P>
	On follow up of offenders previously convicted of murder, the 
National Parole Board 1990 followed murder offenders released 
between January 1, 1975 and March 31, 1990 to July 31, 19901. 
This study indicated that five persons originally convicted of a 
homicide offence were reincarcerated for a second homicide 
offence.
<P>
	There were 752 releases of murder offenders. Of these, 75 or 10 
per cent had been convicted of capital murder, 513 or 68.2 per cent 
of non-capital murder, five or 0.7 per cent of first degree and 159 or 
21.1 per cent of second degree murder.
<P>
	Five-0.7 per cent of 752 releases-released murder offenders 
were reincarcerated for a second murder while on full parole. All 
five had originally been convicted of non-capital murder. Of the 
five, three were subsequently convicted of first degree and two of 
second degree murder.
<P>
	Statistic Canada 1976 reported on a study which followed a 
sample of 232 murder offenders released on parole between 1920 
and July 1975.
<P>
	One murder offender-0.4 per cent of a total of 232-was 
convicted of a second murder.
<P>
	On follow up of offenders previously convicted of manslaughter 
the National Parole Board's 1990 follow up study to July 31, 1990 
of manslaughter offenders  released between January 1, 1975 and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14547"> 14547 </A></B>
<P>
March 31, 1990 revealed that 11 persons originally convicted of 
manslaughter were returned to custody for a second homicide 
offence.
<P>
	There were 2,950 releases of offenders convicted of 
manslaughter. Of these, 1,407 were released on full parole and 
1,543 on statutory release2.
<P>
	Five-0.4 per cent of a total of 1,407 releases of-those released 
on full parole were convicted of a second homicide offence: one for 
second degree murder and four for manslaughter.
<P>
	Six-0.4 per cent of a total of 1,543-offenders released on 
statutory release were convicted of a second homicide offence: two 
for first degree murder, two for second degree murder and two for 
manslaughter.
<P>
	Statistics Canada 1976 reported on research that examined 
manslaughter offenders who were involved in a second homicide 
offence between 1961 and 1974.
<P>
	Two offenders originally convicted of manslaughter and released 
on parole were subsequently reincarcerated for a second 
manslaughter offence between 1961-1974.

	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.): 
</B>Two public service personnel have been relocated from Vancouver 
area to Williams Lake. They are one EL-06 and EL-07, 
EL-Electronics. There are plans to hire one part time clerical staff 
for Riske Creek after April 1,  1995. No staff has been released at 
Riske Creek Loran C station. Modular office furniture has been 
purchased at a cost of $11,406.23 in lieu of building renovations. 
No personnel commute from Vancouver to Riske Creek at 
government expense. Overtime for period November 1994 to end 
of April 1995 was 167.5 hours at a cost of $11,959.57.
<P>
	The following is the 1995/96 budget for the station:

	Salary-452.3K<BR>
 	Overtime-57.2K<BR>
 	Other personnel 7.3K<BR>
 	Travel-4.3K<BR>
 	Fuel-7.3K<BR>
 	Other costs-157.1K<BR>
 	Total-685.5K
<P>
	This budget is in accordance with the cost figures utilized in the 
cost benefit study which determined that it was more cost effective 
to operate the Loran C station at Williams Lake with the Canadian 
Coast Guard, CCG personnel than using a contractor. The 685.5K 
budget is made up of the two following main elements:
<P>
	Personnel costs-516.8K<BR>
 	Other costs-168.7K
<P>
	Personnel costs, 516.8K are those to be compared to the contract 
cost, 680K, and are within the cost benefit analysis range costs of 
514K to 574K. The other costs, 168.7K, are related to the 
maintenance and repair of the equipment and had also to be paid by 
CCG when the station was operated by a contractor. The cost of 
operating the station from the November 1994 takeover to March 
31, 1995 was $253,287.00.

term projections because of the uncertainties involved. Instead, it is 
committed to put out two year rolling deficit targets and taking 
whatever actions are required in order to ensure those targets are 
met. By doing so the federal government will be moving on a firm 
path toward the government's ultimate goal of balancing the 
budget.

Question No. 211-<B>Mr. Calder:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Concerning Lyme disease in Canada, (<I>a</I>) how can some areas of Canada be 
reported as non-endemic when a thorough examination of vectors/hosts for the 
Lyme disease bacteria has not been conducted, (<I>b</I>) why has Lyme disease not 
been made a national reportable disease, (<I>c</I>) what is the total number and 
location of Lyme disease incidences in Canada, (<I>d</I>) what information is 
provided to health care providers to identify Lyme disease, (<I>e</I>) why are there no 
protocols to force health care officials to report cases of Lyme disease, and (<I>f</I>) 
why doesn't the government provide information for people to protect 
themselves against the disease?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib):</B> The following 
information is based on current information on the relevant tick 
vectors in Canada. The most significant of these ticks from a 
human health perspective are <I>Ixodes  scapularis</I> and <I>Ixodes 
pacificus</I>. Although <I>I. scapularis</I> have been identified in different 
regions of Canada, the only place in Canada where this tick species 
has been shown to be endemic at present is Long Point in southern 
Ontario which is an identified Lyme disease endemic area. 
Similarly, the important tick vector <I>I. pacificus</I> is endemic in parts 
of British Columbia and these have been identified as Lyme 
endemic

<P>
areas. If reports of the Lyme disease bacterium in other ticks 
species can be substantiated these endemic areas will be expanded.
<P>
	A disease is made nationally ``notifiable'' on the 
recommendation of the advisory committee on epidemiology, 
ACE. In 1988 a subcommittee of ACE recommended 12 criteria to 
determine the importance of a disease for making it nationally 
notifiable. On the basis of these criteria a number of diseases were 
scored high enough to be included in the list of nationally notifiable 
diseases; however, lyme disease was not included in this group. 
The methods, criteria and list of diseases were published in the 
Canada Communicable Disease Report in 1991, 20 April; vol 
17-16.
<P>
	The process used by ACE recognised that ``notification'' was not 
always the most appropriate method for studying the epidemiology 
of a particular disease and that other approaches such as the use of 
sentinel reporting sites or laboratory based reporting might provide 
more meaningful information in some circumstances.
<P>
	For question (c):
<P>
	Alberta-3<BR>
 	New Brunswick-9<BR>
 	Quebec-1<BR>
 	Ontario-210<BR>

<P>
	The Canadian consensus conference of Lyme disease published 
in two venues-the Canada Communicable Disease Report and the 
Canadian Journal of Infectious Disease-initially provided 
guidelines. Updated information when available has been 
published in the Canada Communicable Disease Report.
<P>
	The legal mechanism to ensure reporting of a specific disease is 
to make it ``reportable'' and the legal mechanisms for doing this 
reside at the provincial government level. For a disease to be 
nationally notifiable requires each jurisdiction to legislate 
separately for the disease to be ``reportable'' within that 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	Information is made available to the public from health units in 
the known endemic provinces of British Columbia and Ontario. 
The Ontario fact sheet is currently being updated.
<P>
Question No. 212-<B>Mr. Calder:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Concerning the Consensus conference on Lyme disease (1991), why has the 
statement not been updated with regard to (<I>a</I>) identification of endemic areas 
for Lyme disease in Canada, (<I>b</I>) identification of symptoms, and (<I>c</I>) methods of 
diagnosis by newer, more effective antibiotics?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> The 
consensus statement is the joint summary of opinion of all 
participants and as such stands on its own. Consensus conferences 
do not often have further updates to them and there has been no 
update to the Lyme disease conference. However there has been 
some addition information published in the Canada Communicable 
Disease Report on the identification of British Columbia as an 
endemic area for Lyme disease in Canada.
<P>
	In addition isolation of the Lyme disease bacterium from ticks 
collected near Thunder Bay, Ontario and Alberta has been reported 
in the Canada Communicable Disease Report and isolation of the 
Lyme disease bacterium from ticks in Prince Edward Island has 
been reported in an international journal as well as at an 
international borreliosis conference in Vancouver organized by the 
Vancouver, B.C. Lyme Borreliosis Society.
<P>
	These latter reports do not provide evidence that Lyme disease is 
endemic in Alberta, Northern Ontario or Prince Edward Island 
since the currently recognized relevant tick vectors have not been 
shown to be endemic in these regions but they serve to show that 
there may be a low level of risk for humans to contract Lyme 
disease in these areas.
<P>
	There has been no update on the topic of symptoms but the 
concensus conference statements are still basically applicable. As 
noted in the concensus conference statement, Lyme disease is an 
illness with dermatological, neurological, cardiac and/or 
rheumatological features. There may be localized manifestations of 
Lyme disease which relate to the erythema migrans rash, an 
expanding, erythematous skin lesion commonly seen at the site of 
the tick bite of many patients. In addition disseminated Lyme 
disease may include neurological forms of disease such as Bell's 
palsy, cardiac manifestations and arthritic involvement 
characterized by recurrent, brief attacks of large joint swelling in 
one or a few joints.
<P>
	Recommendations for the treatment of Lyme disease do change 
with time but the basic recommendations for treatment involve the 
use of various beta-lactam-pencillin family-and tetracycline 
antibiotics. Treatment regimes will vary depending on factors such 
as the stage of Lyme disease, the age of the patient, and the specific 
clinical manifestations of the patient. The topics of methods of 
diagnosis and antibiotic treatment have been further addressed by 
the Canadian Paediatric Society which published a position paper 
in the Canadian Medical Association Journal Volume 147 pages 
169-172, 1992.

Question No. 217-<B>Mr. Simmons:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>What action will the government take in reference to the claim made by the 
Auditor General in his May 1995 report to Parliament that, with respect to the 
Drugs Directorate and Medical Devices Bureau, (a) ``key issues identified in 
past studies still remain outstanding'', and (<I>b</I>) ``many of the changes 
recommended-are still not fully implemented'', and what specific measures 
are being developed to deal with high risk products and devices?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Regarding 
drugs, there have been a number of studies over the last ten years 
with many recommendations and many of them contradictory. 
Consequently, two years ago the drugs directorate developed a 
major re-engineering initiative called drugs directorate renewal 
and has been pursuing an intensive process in which all aspects of 
its operations have been reviewed and streamlined within an 
environment of scarce resources. Over that period of time the 
directorate has consulted fully with all stakeholders. The drugs 
directorate has made many changes to its programs and policies 
with the aim of streamlining operations and fixing ``known'' 
problems. While the auditor's report recognizes the strengths of 
this renewal exercise, it does not adequately recognize the progress 
made in several areas.
<P>
	The drugs directorate regulates a wide range of drugs, including 
radiopharmaceuticals, biologics and narcotics. These products 
represent different risks and the drugs directorate systems are 
designed according to these risks. Specifically in the area of high 
risk drugs, the drugs directorate has significantly improved its 
review performance without jeopardizing the well-being of 
Canadians. Approval times for submissions received and approved 
since January 1993, when a new policy was implemented, show 
substantial decreases in time taken.
<P>
	The government was and is continuing to take action with 
respect to the key issues identified in past studies and on specific 
measures to deal with high risk medical devices.
<P>
	As part of the review of federal regulatory program, the Minister 
of National Health and Welfare established in 1992 a medical 
devices review committee, known as the Hearn committee, to 
review the existing infrastructure and make recommendations on 
the regulation of medical devices in the future. The  committee's 
report, ``Direction for Change'', was released in August 1992. The 
report identified the key issues as well as made recommendations 
with respect to regulation of medical devices. The minister 
accepted the committee's recommendations in principle. 
Subsequently the health protection branch, HPB, developed a 
strategic implementation plan entitled ``Development Plan for 
Improved Medical Devices Program'' which was endorsed by the 
Hearn committee in April 1993.
<P>
	In accordance with the recommendations of the development 
plan, the following key issues have been addressed or are in 
process.
<P>
	Regarding re-engineering of the medical devices program, a 
separate ``medical devices bureau'' was established in September 
1993. To improve the level of service to its clients, the medical 
devices program was further consolidated by functionnally linking 
medical device staff in the five HPB regional offices to the bureau. 
Key management and staff positions have been filled within the 
bureau. An improvement in service has been achieved by 
developing and implementing internal standards operating 
procedures. The backlog of submissions awaiting review has been 
eliminated.
<P>
	Regarding risk based approach to manage medical devices in the 
Canadian market place, with the help of an advisory committee 
comprising medical devices stakeholders, a risk based 
classification system, RBCS, for medical devices has been 
developed. The intent of the risk based classification system is to 
ensure that a device is given an appropriate level of scrutiny based 
on the risk it presents to its user.
<P>
	A set of proposed regulations based on the risk based 
classification of devices has been developed and released to the 
program's clients for their input.
<P>
	Regarding cost recovery initiative the cost recovery initiative 
received approval from the Treasury Board on May 18, 1995. The 
program will charge a range of fees commensurate with level of the 
services provided to the medical device industry. The proposed fee 
schedule has been published in Canada Gazette I, June 10, 1995.
<P>
	Regarding improved communications with clients of the medical 
devices program, managers of the program now meet with 
representatives of medical device industry regularly to discuss 
matters of common interest.
<P>
	Consultation sessions are being held with the program clients to 
obtain their input in developing new regulatory requirements and in 
implementing cost recovery.
<P>
	In addition to the existing publications, information letters, 
medical devices alerts, dear doctor letters, it is your health, a 
newsletter entitled ``medical devices bulletin'' has been introduced 
to enhance external communications. The first issue was published 
in June 1995.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14551"> 14551 </A></B>
<P>
	A medical devices bulletin board service has been established 
to provide program related information to medical device clients 
electronically.
<P>
	A communication plan for the program is being developed with 
the help of a consultant.
<P>
	A new computer system has been installed to operate the 
program's various databases. Program clients have access to these 
databases.
<P>
	Regarding international harmonization the risk based 
classification system and proposed regulations were developed 
keeping international harmonization in mind.
<P>
	Mutual Recognition agreements are under consideration. Canada 
is negotiating with the European Union, EU, to ease market access 
for Canadian products into Europe and vice versa. The proposed 
agreement would enable Canadian manufacturers to meet EU 
regulatory requirements in Canada in a cost effective manner and 
simplify the process for Canadian exporters to get needed EU 
approval based on mutual recognition of testing and certification 
procedure.
<P>
	Similar negotiations are being initiated with the United States of 
America.

Question No. 219-<B>Mr. Simmons:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>With respect to the family violence initiative, (<I>a</I>) why did Health Canada 
choose not to renew the Initiative in March 1995, (<I>b</I>) what will happen to the 
community projects which were largely funded through grants under the 
Initiative, (<I>c</I>) what specific areas were deemed priorities following the 
federal-provincial consultation on ways of combating family violence, and (<I>d</I>) 
is Health Canada planning to develop a new policy on family violence in 
1995-1996?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Activities to 
reduce family violence have been extended for 1995-96 with 
resources of up to $30.28 million government wide. During the 
year the government will ensure that action is effective, focused 
and integrated into a broad federal strategy to reduce all types of 
violence, including family violence.
<P>
	About 74 per cent of the resources for 1995-96 will be used to 
support shelter housing, services for on-reserve First Nations and 
Inuit communities, and community action projects. As well, the 
National Clearinghouse on Family Violence will continue serving 
as a national resource centre for communities across the country.
<P>
	Twelve million, three-hundred thousand dollars of the $30.28 
million is being allocated to First Nations and Inuit communities. 
The funding will be used to help First Nations and Inuit 
communities continue prevention, intervention and treatment, 
research, evaluation and professional training to reduce family 
violence.
<P>
	Provincial/territorial governments, non-governmental 
organizations and other stakeholders have acknowledged that 
federal leadership is needed to co-ordinate a national, cross 
sectoral response to family violence. The  federal government will 
continue to play a leadership role on family violence within the 
resources allocated for the year, through co-ordinated, strategic 
activities. One of the federal government's objectives is to 
determine how best to integrate family violence work into a 
broader strategy to reduce all violence in Canadian society. The 
federal government, primarily through the justice department, will 
lead this activity. In addition, the federal government will continue 
to work with other levels of government, non-governmental 
organizations and the private sector to build on the work to date on 
family violence.
<P>
	During 1995-96 the federal government will support shelters for 
battered women and children, community based action, services 
for First Nations on-reserve and Inuit peoples, criminal justice 
reform, training of RCMP members, treatment programs for 
federal offenders, and the activities of the National Clearinghouse 
on Family Violence.
<P>
	Also during 1995-96 the government will review its family 
violence activities to ensure they are effective, focused and 
integrated into a broad, federal strategy to reduce all types of 
violence, including family violence.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> I have a request for an emergency debate. The 
hon. member for Roberval has today, prior to this afternoon's 
sitting, sent me a letter describing the matter he wishes to discuss 
today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
accordance with our Standing Orders, my comments will strictly 
concern the contents of my letter. Under Standing Order 52, I 
request leave for an emergency debate on the federal government's 
recognition of the legitimate right of the people of Quebec to 
decide, in the forthcoming referendum, on their political future.
<P>
	This request is particularly timely, considering the ambiguity 
that remains after today's Question Period. On September 12, 
1995, the Minister of Labour made contradictory statements about 
the federal government's recognition of the referendum results.
<P>
	The Prime Minister of Canada, on the other hand, did not clearly 
express the position of the federal government in this respect nor 
did he clarify satisfactorily what was said by the minister. A very 
substantial doubt remains, and the people of Quebec and Canada 
need to know the real position of the federal government regarding 
the results of the referendum exercise in Quebec. Disturbing 
comments made by the Prime Minister during Question Period lead 
us to conclude that his position would be not to accept the results of 
the referendum in Quebec.
<P>
	Considering the importance of what is at stake, you will 
understand, since it is impossible to consider, on short notice, 
another occasion on which the matter could be put before the 
House, I think it is in the public interest that parliamentarians 
should have a chance to discuss this fundamental question and 
express their views to the government as soon as possible. I wish to 
stress the urgent nature of this debate.
<P>
	In concluding, I simply wish to say I did some quick research 
and found that in 1977, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau moved a 
motion for debate on Canadian unity. The motion was accepted, 
and the debate was a very important one. After the speech from the 
Throne in April 1980, there were seven days of debate on the issue 
of national unity, and I found that the people who took part in these 
discussions stressed their importance at the time.
<P>
	In this perspective and considering what is now happening in 
Quebec, I think it would be important for the House of Commons to 
obtain approval for an emergency debate. Thank you.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Frontenac had the 
floor before question period. He has 11 minutes remaining.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can 
see that your memory is excellent. Not only did you recognize me, 
but you were also able to tell me that I had 11 minutes remaining. I 
shall take up at the very word were I left off.
<P>
	Let us now ask ourselves the question: does the Office of the 
Auditor General have the tools required to take on these new tasks? 
It is well known that producing the auditor general's report every 
year requires a lot of work. It is therefore reasonable to wonder 
whether the auditor general will have enough time, and enough 
resources particularly, to prepare, on top of it all, a specific report 
on the impact of the many contradictions contained in the remarks 
made by the Minister of the Environment.
<P>
	The answer to this question however was provided by the auditor 
general himself in his testimony before the Standing Committee on 
Environment and Sustainable Development. At that time, Mr. 
Desautels told the committee that, depending on the scope of the 
mandate given to the function contemplated, his office could carry 
out the related responsibilities.
<P>
	He also indicated that his office was already spending $4.5 
million per year, or 7.5 percent of its total budget, on auditing 
programs that have a direct impact on the environment. He figures 
that his office could fulfil its parliamentary obligations with an 
additional $4.5 million, which would bring to $9 million the total 
budget allocated to the environment alone.
<P>
	Officially, no amount has yet been set aside for this purpose. 
Unofficially, however, the auditor general has received the amounts 
he had requested in order to assume these new responsibilities. 
This fact and the  comments made by the minister during an 
interview she gave last October suggest that she had to do some 
arm-twisting.
<P>
	In fact, the minister's comments suggest that she understands the 
validity of the Bloc's argument that this mandate should be given to 
the Office of the Auditor General since, in a press release dated 
April 25, she describes this office as independent, influential and 
highly respected.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	The bill provides not only that the Commissioner of the 
Environment will report directly to the auditor general but also that 
his first duty will be to help him fulfil his mandate with regard to 
the environment and sustainable development. For example, the 
commissioner will examine how effective departmental action 
plans are in meeting the objectives set out in the departments' 
sustainable development strategies.
<P>
	Second, he will have to follow up on all petitions received from 
Canadian residents and dealing with the environment and 
sustainable development in accordance with the bill's provisions.
<P>
	Third, the commissioner will make any examinations and 
inquiries that he considers necessary in order to monitor the extent 
to which departments have met the objectives set out in their 
sustainable development strategies.
<P>
	Fourth, the commissioner will, on behalf of the auditor general, 
report annually to the House of Commons, including on the extent 
to which departments have implemented the plans set out in their 
sustainable development strategies, as well as on anything that he 
considers should be brought to the attention of that House in 
relation to other environmental issues.
<P>
	The official opposition does not intend, at least for the time 
being, to challenge the mandate that the minister wants to give to 
the commissioner of the environment. However, we deplore the 
fact that, ultimately, the commissioner will merely have the power 
to make suggestions.
<P>
	He will of course review environmental issues, look at citizens' 
concerns and follow up on these with the concerned departments, 
as well as conduct various studies and inquiries for the purpose of 
his report, as Mr. Desautels already does. But given the way this 
government has always treated the auditor general's 
recommendations, it can be assumed that the commissioner of the 
environment's report will be treated exactly the same way and will 
be left to gather dust on a shelf like so many other such documents.
<P>
	A few minutes ago, I listened with great interest to the tribute 
paid to the late Jean-Luc Pepin, who represented the riding of 
Drummond, just a few kilometres from my riding. Jean-Luc Pepin, 
who strongly believed in the  duality of Canada's nations, prepared 
a famous report, the Pepin-Robarts report. As you know, Mr. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14554"> 14554 </A></B>
<P>
Speaker, that report is still sitting on a shelf, buried under six 
inches of dust. The report tabled each year by the auditor general, 
Mr. Desautels, tells us about a few administrative horrors from this 
government, which triggers a big show lasting two or three weeks. 
It was the same when the Conservatives were in office. We talk 
about a lot about the report during the first week, a little less in the 
second week, and a great deal less in the third week. Then the 
report is tossed onto a shelf.
<P>
	Therefore, if we are going to spend nine million dollars a year to 
produce yet another report which will just collect dust, the official 
opposition will be quick to withdraw its support for this 
amendment to the Auditor General Act.
<P>
	A report should shake us up, stir us to action. I remember that, as 
the agriculture critic, I noticed in the last report that hundreds of 
thousands of dollars were spent on sunflower seeds to feed small 
birds.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	We spent almost a million dollars on a totally unwarranted 
expenditure, that was a waste, pure and simple. While some people 
in our society go hungry, we spend several hundred thousand 
dollars to buy sunflower seeds to feed birds.
<P>
	Worse, my political assistant in my riding told me this morning 
that he had received two calls about some headline in today's 
newspapers which stated that Canada is the second richest country 
in the world and that each of its citizens is worth a billion dollars. 
That is right: one billion, not one million. My riding office got a 
phone call from one of my constituents who says he is ready to sell 
his share at a reduced price. It is a bargain, at a thousand to one or 
even a million to one. If you want to make a good deal with my 
constituent, he is willing to sell for a good price. If you ran an ad in 
the <I>Courrier Frontenac</I>, in my riding, I am sure quite a few would 
be ready to sell.
<P>
	In a more serious mode, reports by the new commissioner of the 
environment and sustainable development should not be left to 
gather dust on a shelf, with no action taken, because it would be 
simply wasting $9 million annually.
<P>
	Like my colleague from Charlevoix just said, we are now closing 
down employment centres that are 85 per cent paid for by the UI 
fund, that is by the workers themselves. Considering that the fund 
is supposed to have a $6 billion surplus, not a deficit, this year, it is 
a disgrace that we should eliminate services that pay for 
themselves.
<P>
	It is really frustrating that workers should have to fight to keep 
their local employment centres that are functional and responsive.
<P>
	In the last minute remaining, I would like to remind you about an 
oil barge that is still sitting on the bottom of the sea, halfway 
between the Magdalen Islands and Prince Edward Island. Last 
week was the 25th anniversary of the sinking of that barge, 
obviously an accident. Need I ask which party was the ruling party 
in Canada in 1970? I remember which party replaced in 1984 the 
one that was in power in 1970, and the one that has now been in 
power for two years already under the Right Hon. Prime Minister 
and member for Saint-Maurice.
<P>
	However, this situation has been going on for 25 years. We do 
not need an auditor for the environment and sustainable 
development to know that this barge is down there, that it has 
rusted out and is now leaking hundreds of gallons of bunker C oil 
and oil contaminated with PCBs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Asselin:</B> The Prime Minister says that everything is 
hunky-dory.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Everything is hunky-dory, indeed. 
So we have an environmental catastrophe waiting to happen. I ask 
you to do something, Mr. Speaker, and tell this Minister and this 
government to wake up.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I thank you for your kind attention.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> It is important, Mr. 
Speaker, to very briefly indicate that if this bill is before the House 
in this form it is thanks to the efforts of the Minister of the 
Environment who certainly had to overcome a number of obstacles 
in ensuring that this measure would be advanced as legislation. 
Even if it does not fulfil all of the recommendations that the 
committee put forward it still represents a remarkable step forward.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	I listened to the intervention of the hon. member for Charlevoix 
and his remarks about the <I>Irving Whale</I> which were also made by 
other members in the course of the discussion today. One thing is 
certain. Had we had in place a commissioner on sustainable 
development monitoring and reporting, that kind of role would 
have permitted the catching much earlier of the shortcomings of 
the Department of Transport and other affected departments. It 
would have, if not prevented, at least rectified the matter much 
sooner. Therefore it is only fair to conclude that we are moving in 
the right direction with this measure.
<P>
	I must say the member for Comox-Alberni put forward in a 
very straightforward manner the criticism that one would actually 
expect from the official opposition. He did that in his usual frank 
style, which I fully respect. Of all of the points he made perhaps 
there was only one in which he was slightly off the mark, namely 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14555"> 14555 </A></B>
<P>
by saying that the proposals in the bill before us  today did not fulfil 
or reflect the promise made in the Liberal Party's red book.
<P>
	As far as I can recall, the bill before us reflects that promise very 
well. It is not proposing a clerk, as the member for 
Comox-Alberni repeatedly said. It is proposing the creation of a 
position of a commissioner, which is quite different from that of a 
clerk.
<P>
	Also it needs to be stressed that the commissioner and the bill 
create a completely new role in the Department of the Auditor 
General, because the act itself under which the auditor general is 
operating is being amended. Once the legislation goes through it 
will read: ``an act respecting the Office of the Auditor General of 
Canada'', as it does now, but will have added to it: ``and sustainable 
development monitoring and reporting''.
<P>
	This is not a minor step. It is a remarkable one. It inserts in the 
mandate of the auditor general the importance of monitoring 
sustainable development strategy and implementing the meaning, 
significance and the interpretation of sustainable development. 
That is no minor feat.
<P>
	It is sad that the member for Laurentides indulged in referendum 
matters and in the bashing of the Prime Minister in a manner that 
somehow serves another agenda then that of the bill before us. It is 
unfair and unreal to claim that the environment is being used by the 
federal government as a pawn to intervene or interfere in provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	For heaven's sake, as other reports from departments have done, 
the bill ensures that the measure being proposed is clearly and 
specifically restricted to the jurisdiction of the federal government. 
Therefore it is rather absurd to claim that the federal government is 
attempting, as the member for Laurentides said, to centralize, to 
impose massive centralization or to give more power to itself. The 
bill certainly does not do that.
<P>
	Moving on to the substance of the measure and having listened 
to the minister, it seems clear that her reference to 
benchmarks-and she dwelt on the subject at some length-is a 
very important one. In analysing this measure in committee and in 
passing it the reference was made that we would have to be 
extremely careful in examining how the commissioner would 
operate. By benchmarks I understand her to mean yardsticks, 
namely a way of measuring sustainability.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	The question is: How will sustainability be measured and against 
what? Will it be measured against the sustainable objectives of the 
department, or will it be measured against the sustainable 
development principles that are to be established by way of a 
regulatory process emanating from the law itself?
<P>
	I hope that the yardstick against which the commissioner will be 
auditing will be very firm, very  significant; will be one on which 
the entire federal jurisdiction will be able to agree; and will provide 
the necessary motivation and goals to move toward sustainable 
development. I suppose this is what the minister had in mind when 
speaking about benchmarks this morning. The yardsticks will have 
to be established in a manner that transcend those of internal 
regulations.
<P>
	When the House passed Bill C-46 and Bill C-48 some 18 months 
ago, I remember the term sustainable development was included in 
the two pieces of legislations creating the new Departments of 
Industry and Energy Mines and Resources. I have been asking 
myself ever since how those departments implement the mandate 
of the minister to achieve sustainable development against the 
adoption of which yardsticks and against the background of what 
principles.
<P>
	To be brief, it seems in essence the bill is about yardsticks of 
auditing which the committee will have to examine and the 
principles against which the yardsticks will be established.
<P>
	We have a number of sources for principles. The Ontario round 
table produced six guiding principles to meet sustainable 
development: first, anticipation and prevention; second, full cost 
accounting; third, informed decision making; fourth, living off the 
interest; fifth, quality over quantity; and, sixth, respect for nature 
and the rights of future generations. These are six good yardsticks 
and I submit them for consideration.
<P>
	There is also the question of looking at principles which deal 
with equity; integrated approaches to planning and decision 
making; integration of the economy with the environment, which is 
certainly a basic principle; and ensuring that the development of 
renewable resources and their harvesting remain sustainable.
<P>
	There are questions of virtually eliminating persistent and 
accumulative toxic substances, of adopting a pollution prevention 
approach, of protecting the ozone layer, of reducing greenhouse 
gasses and of conserving biodiversity.
<P>
	We are to examine quite a large collection of principles. I invite 
all members interested in this method to think about the necessity 
of principles and yardsticks and to provide the committee with the 
benefit of their advice and experience.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	The question of the definition of sustainable development might 
have to be examined in committee because the Brundtland 
definition is so global and so over-arching that it needs to be filled 
in somehow.
<P>
	A suggestion I have received is that the definition should be to 
the effect that sustainable development concerns the integration of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14556"> 14556 </A></B>
<P>
environmental sustainability  into the economic development and 
social development objectives of the federal government.
<P>
	At the present time there is a cabinet directive whereby all 
ministers are to include environmental considerations in policy and 
program memoranda prepared for them for submission to cabinet. 
This is done, I understand very dutifully and precisely. Some 
departments do it better than others. It is against this practice, it 
seems to me, that we should examine the question and the 
importance of linking the environment with economic and social 
objectives and perhaps improving the quality of the comments 
included in memoranda by ministers to cabinet.
<P>
	I suppose this will be one of the tasks the commissioner will 
have to face. The commissioner, also it seems to me, will have to 
be protected against the possible threat of decreasing resources 
made available to the auditor general. In other words, the role and 
the funding of the commissioner must be ensured so that they do 
not suffer in times of budget cuts. I am certain this matter will be 
taken into account fully.
<P>
	The legislation envisages the requirement within two years of 
the establishment of the commissioner of plans on sustainable 
development that each department will be requested to submit to 
the commissioner. The commissioner would then review them, 
monitor them and report in the proposed manner. It would be 
desirable in this process if Environment Canada were to volunteer 
the best possible example and be among the first and well within 
the two-year limit in providing its plan so as to give the other 
departments the example that is required and perhaps the advice 
that some departments will require in this respect.
<P>
	We will perhaps be wise to examine in committee the question of 
crown corporations that at the present time are not included in the 
bill and possibly the review or the monitoring and reporting on 
international agreements.
<P>
	These matters touch upon the sustainability of our economy and 
of the global resources particularly when it comes to delicate issues 
like the integrity of the ozone layer and the trend in climate change 
which are now being widely observed by meteorologists and 
scientists.
<P>
	One thing is clear. The bill certainly aims at integrating the 
environment into federal decision making. Once passed it will 
represent a good addition to the Canadian Environmental 
Assessment Act to which the minister referred earlier, to the task 
force on economic instruments and disincentives to sound 
environmental practices from which we hope to hear again, and to 
the more recently adopted document entitled ``A Guide to Green 
Government''.
<P>
<B>(1645 )</B>
<P>
	We should be very clear what is meant by incorporating the 
environment and sustainable development into the Auditor General 
Act. If we mean  balancing the economy with the environment, as 
some speakers have indicated in this debate, we would be missing 
the boat badly. The two cannot be balanced. It would be a serious 
mistake because first of all we implicitly declare that the 
environment is disconnected from the economy, that the two are 
not interrelated. In balancing the two-and the gesture itself is very 
revealing-we indicate also that in certain economic times the 
economy would receive all the attention and precedence and the 
environment would suffer and would be given different treatment 
at a lower level, a secondary level, one might say.
<P>
	I submit it would be a very serious mistake and give the wrong 
interpretation of sustainable development. We would be 
proceeding in the same manner that we did in the seventies when 
our agenda was limited to the protection of the environment 
whenever possible.
<P>
	We are now in a different phase, in the phase of a sustainable 
development. It means instead of integration, there should be a 
very strong correlation of the economy with the environment. They 
are one. They are interconnected. There cannot be a healthy 
economy in the long term unless there is a healthy environment as 
its foundation.
<P>
	It is for that reason that the interpretation and the definition of 
sustainable development in this bill and in government operations 
are so important. It is also for this reason that the question of 
principle becomes so crucial in the operations of departments when 
they do embrace-a step which we all welcome, as in the 
Department of Industry and in the Department of Natural 
Resources-the concept of sustainable development. However that 
embrace, that commitment has to be taken a step further and has to 
be fleshed out with a number of basic principles.
<P>
	I enumerated a few of these principles earlier, some taken from 
the Ontario round table and some taken from the <I>Guide to Green 
Government</I>-I applaud them all-which were signed by each 
cabinet minister including the Prime Minister. Those principles 
have now received an imprimatur, so to say, that is of great 
significance. It confirms the commitment of the government to 
sustainable development and to the principles fleshed out in the 
guide.
<P>
	In the time that is left to me I would like to indicate that in 
addition to promoting sustainable development the bill will also 
open the road to petitions from the public. The member for 
Laurentides this morning asked a number of interesting questions 
on the effectiveness of this procedure. We will be glad to explore 
the questions that she raised because they seem to be very valid. 
These questions will be forwarded to the minister who will then be 
required to respond to them.
<P>
	The commissioner will monitor and annually report to the House 
on the government's performance. In order to be effective in this 
auditing capacity the definition, as I  said, of sustainable 
development incorporating very clear principles against which the 
auditing will become possible is immeasurable and becomes of the 
greatest importance. We had cabinet endorsement in June of this 
year of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14557"> 14557 </A></B>
<P>
basic principle of pollution prevention. I applaud cabinet for 
having done that.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	We have adopted on a number of occasions, at home and abroad, 
a precautionary principle; that is, that we move and make decisions 
even when science is not 100 per cent in agreement, but sufficiently 
in agreement to warrant a certain policy action.
<P>
	I mentioned earlier full cost accounting and equity. In a country 
like Canada it is of the utmost importance we ensure that in the 
fisheries and in the forests we do not erode the capital but limit our 
harvesting to the interest produced by such resources.
<P>
	We have the delicate question of carbon dioxide emissions, 
which is part of the red book commitment. It is very difficult to 
implement. We had extensive discussions on this particular issue 
last spring in Berlin at the United Nations conference on climate 
change.
<P>
	We are a fossil fuel producing country and, therefore, we rely on 
it for a number of reasons. However, we must ensure in the long 
term that we gradually but systematically reduce our dependence 
on fossil fuels in the interest of the global community, to ensure 
that the climate trend is put back on the right track.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member for Davenport is a humble individual 
and a great parliamentarian. In his opening remarks he gave credit 
to the Minister of the Environment for bringing this bill forward. 
However, members of the House, in particular members of the 
environment committee and members of the environmental 
organizations in the country will know that the hon. member for 
Davenport, as the chair of the House of Commons Standing 
Committee on the Environment and Sustainable Development 
made the concept of environmental auditing the subject of the very 
first study of that committee in this Parliament. No sooner was the 
government elected than the hon. member for Davenport, as the 
chair of the committee, chose to make this the subject of study of 
that committee.
<P>
	It was an exhaustive study. Many witnesses were called. 
Members of the committee sat and studied for hours, days and 
weeks to come up with a very superb report. That report had few 
flaws in it. It was a report which many throughout Canada accepted 
as the very least that we could accept. The committee report could 
have gone one step further than it did and proposed an 
ombudsperson role, an investigative role which went beyond that 
of simply auditing and promoting the environment and sustainable 
development.
<P>
	When the report was released the foreword of the report was 
written by the hon. member for Davenport as the chair of the 
committee. The chair writes in the foreword of the report that as a 
result of its deliberation the committee has concluded that the most 
appropriate way to implement the government's proposed 
functions is through the creation of a commissioner of sustainable 
development in conjunction with an expanded role for the office of 
the auditor general. The committee believes the creation of a 
commissioner of the environment and sustainable development is a 
priority, one which appropriately answers the request of the 
government and which will provide the necessary momentum for 
the shift toward sustainability.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	The member for Davenport and the committee concluded that 
what was necessary as a minimum to meet the needs of the 
government's commitment to the people of Canada and the long 
term needs of the environment was a commissioner of the 
environment along with an expanded office of the auditor general. 
What we get in response from the Minister of the Environment is 
simply an expansion of the office of the auditor general. The whole 
proactive role of a commissioner of sustainable development as 
promoted by the committee does not exist.
<P>
	The member for Davenport as the chairperson of the committee 
spoke very well about what is yet needed in this bill. He outlined a 
number of things that were yet needed. I applaud him for that step. 
I asked him how he can rationalize his comments about the need for 
a proactive commissioner of the environment and his support for 
Bill C-83 which certainly does not do that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caccia:</B> Mr. Speaker, as usual the member for The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake has quickly identified the Achilles' 
heel.
<P>
	I can only indicate to him, drawing from my own experience, 
that when one goes to cabinet with a proposal one does not always 
get everything one wants. That applies also to committees. We did 
our best. We produced a report that we knew at the time was aiming 
a bit higher than the commitment made in our red book.
<P>
	As they say in political jargon: ``You win some and you lose 
some''. Because of this I started my remarks pointing at the fact 
that the Auditor General Act will now be changed in its title. It will 
also be changed to include a new mandate. While it is not all we 
would have liked, as the parliamentary secretary said earlier, it 
represents a solid step in the right direction. It is my hope that once 
the commissioner has proven his or her merits within the 
governmental organization and has proven through monitoring and 
reporting this is an extremely valuable role, the commissioner will 
be given the additional role of indicating, beyond reporting and 
monitoring, what the shortcomings are of a given policy, which is a 
very delicate step as we know.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14558"> 14558 </A></B>
<P>
	In committee I remember very clearly the auditor general 
warning us about giving this additional responsibility to the 
commissioner. I suppose it is good to start with what we have now 
even if it does not meet all of our expectations. We can build on 
the foundation through experience in the years ahead.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time has expired for questions and 
comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak on Bill C-83, an act to 
amend the Auditor General Act to create a commissioner of 
environment and sustainable development in the auditor general's 
office.
<P>
	I completely agree with the intent and purpose of the bill to audit 
and to examine groups, individuals and ministries with respect to 
the environmental sector. However, I must ask the question why.
<P>
	Why are we creating another aspect of bureaucracy to do that 
which the auditor general and the Minister of the Environment 
should by all rights do within the framework of their job 
descriptions.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	Is it not the responsibility of the Ministry of the Environment to 
actually monitor these things? We are creating another level of 
bureaucracy at a cost of over $5 million to the Canadian taxpayer. 
Why are we doing this?
<P>
	The bill is a metaphor for government. When we have a problem, 
and most hardworking members of Parliament will agree, we study 
it, we observe it, we report on it but do we act? Rarely. If we do, it 
is usually nibbling around the edges. We have what I call studyitis. 
Instead of acting on a problem, instead of addressing a problem, 
instead of getting the best solutions the country has to offer for a 
problem and implementing those, if only on a pilot project, we 
study it, we observe it and we report on it. That is what we are 
doing here.
<P>
	The purpose of that is to give the illusion we are actually doing 
something. When we are engaging in these studies and reports we 
give the illusion we are actually addressing a problem. In reality we 
are putting off the actual decision making processes for another 
time. It has been one of the most frustrating aspects of being in the 
House. I know that frustration is shared by many of my colleagues. 
That to a large extent is what the bill represents. We are creating 
something new to do what should already be done by existing 
structures within the government.
<P>
	Therefore we expose this aspect of bureaucratic expansionism at 
the expense of the taxpayer's pocket and should put the 
responsibility of these activities squarely back on the ministry's 
door and also back on the auditor general.
<P>
	Apart from that I have some constructive suggestions the 
ministry can devote its time to. Instead of spending another $5 
million of the taxpayer's money to do something that should 
already be done, let us look at some constructive ways the ministry 
can apply what it already has to some very pressing environmental 
problems that exist within our midst.
<P>
	There are at least 48 identified high risk areas that are 
contaminated within the country. As of March 1995, 11 were 
deemed necessary for remediation. The moneys were put forth to 
remediate these areas. At the end of 1996 only 13 further sites will 
be marked for remediation.
<P>
	That leaves a total of 24 sites of high risk to our country, 
particularly to the people who live around them, and to the 
environment. I cannot emphasize strongly enough these are high 
risk sites that demand attention for the people who live in the area 
and for the surrounding environment now-not next year, not five 
years from now but now. This would be a good thing for the 
ministry to look at.
<P>
	Furthermore there is absolutely no plan whatsoever to deal with 
these 24 remaining sites. Where is the money coming from? When 
will they be dealt with? I challenge the ministry to look at this now.
<P>
	To give members an example of how we are trying to offset the 
decision making process, in March 1989, $250 million was set 
aside to clean up contaminated sites. As of March 1995, how many 
were dealt with? Absolutely none. Furthermore there was no plan 
whatsoever to put this money to good use to clean up contaminated 
sites. It has only taken six years to get to the same state of affairs 
we were in six years ago.
<P>
	No plans exist to identify contaminated sites in Canada. We 
cannot address pressing environmental issues, areas that are 
contaminated, unless we identify those sites first. We have not even 
done that. That is the first step in addressing severely contaminated 
sites.
<P>
	For those sites that are identified, there is absolutely no idea how 
much it will cost to address the clean up of these sites.
<P>
	The federal PCB destruction program ended in March 1995. 
There is no plan now to deal with sites contaminated with PCBs 
and there are sites right now that pose a significant risk to 
Canadians living in their vicinity.
<P>
<B>(1705 )</B>
<P>
	Canada is a major producer of waste. We produce over 30 
million tonnes of waste a year or more than a tonne per person. We 
recycle about 10 per cent of that. That is not bad but it is not nearly 
what we could be doing. It is interesting to look at some European 
countries that have done a remarkable job in expanding their 
recycling programs to become more inclusive and to involve a  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14559"> 14559 </A></B>
<P>
larger segment of their population so their waste levels at landfills 
and land sites are greatly reduced.
<P>
	The ministry should also, instead of reinventing the wheel, look 
at countries that are doing a good job and see where we can be more 
aggressive with our recycling.
<P>
	Current landfill sites are filling up and it is becoming 
increasingly difficult to find sites for our waste products. Landfill 
sites we have are leaking contaminants to surrounding areas, a 
significant hazard again to those people and to the flora and fauna 
in the vicinity.
<P>
	It is interesting also to look at the costs. We want to spend $5 
million for the auditor general to do a job that should already be 
done. The costs for a clean up in Canada are in the order of $4.5 
billion per year, and it is expanding every year.
<P>
	Given the current fiscal restraints of the government and 
successive governments in the future, we ought to pay careful heed 
as to how we will be dealing with the wastes we are producing now 
and will be in the future. It will be a common, current and 
pervasive problem for all of us in this country.
<P>
	I speak from personal experience in my riding when I say the 
ministry has shown a deplorable inability to identify, prosecute and 
penalize individuals and industries that are right now 
contaminating our environment.
<P>
	If we are to deal with this problem we have to start immediately 
to stop the wilful neglect to the environment and the wilful 
dumping of hazardous wastes occurring as we speak. It is very 
important the ministry do this. I do not know why it is not taking a 
more aggressive stance with industries and individuals who 
continue to do this. Time and time again local communities have 
complained at length to the ministry. It is not being able to 
investigate these individuals and it is not prosecuting them as they, 
day in and day out, dump waste into our waterways and on to our 
land.
<P>
	The ministry also needs to be more aggressive in recovering 
costs where the polluter has been identified. It has not been nearly 
as forthcoming as it should be in trying to recoup this money. It 
could be very important not only to save money for the Canadian 
taxpayer but also give a very clear and distinct message to polluters 
that it is unacceptable for them to engage in this behaviour and if 
they do they will be penalized and forced to engage in the full cost 
recovery of cleaning up the sites they have polluted.
<P>
	I suggest the ministry look at the environment and sustainable 
growth in a global context. It is essential to understand that the 
amount of destruction we see to our environment is intimately and 
directly associated with human activity both in numbers of people 
and in the behaviour of those people.
<P>
	Right now there are over 5.5 billion people on this planet. By the 
year 2000 we will have 7 billion. By the year 2020 or 2030 we will 
have 10 billion to 11 billion people. The doubling time for our 
population has gone from thousands of years to the order of 25 to 
30 years. It has dropped down a decade.
<P>
	If we reflect on that for a minute we will see how important this 
issue is; our burgeoning population and the effect that will have on 
our dwindling resources. We simply cannot speak about sustainable 
development without addressing the problem of rampant 
population growth and human activity and the affect that has on our 
environment.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	It is also interesting to see that the gap is actually widening 
between population and the ability to provide the basic necessities 
for that population. When populations are unable to provide for 
their basic necessities we have a population under stress. When we 
have a population under stress it leads to conflict, population 
migration and a destruction of the local environment where those 
conflicts take place. If we want to speak self-centredly, it impacts 
on our defence budgets, our foreign aid and development budgets 
and it potentially costs Canadian lives. It also impacts on the 
resources we use here for our social programs and services to 
provide for refugees who have come to our country from areas of 
conflict to seek refuge and succour.
<P>
	I hope the ministry will look at this in the context of other 
ministries and also in international venues because nobody is 
speaking about this. If we start to speak about the subject we get 
accused of being neo-Malthusian. What a lot of rubbish that is. We 
have to be blind not to see that with a population expanding 
geometrically and the ability for our resources which are flattening 
out and in effect declining this gap which is widening will have a 
huge impact not only on countries half a world away but on our 
own. For the sake of us, our children and our grandchildren it is not 
only important but our responsibility to address these problems.
<P>
	Our environment is our world. What we do to our world and to 
our environment we do to ourselves. I hope the ministry will take it 
upon itself that rather than repeating what should already be done, 
rather than creating new bureaucracies and creating more 
opportunities to study and report on a problem, to develop some 
good solutions to these problems.
<P>
	Let us work with the people within our country and with our 
neighbours in other countries. Our environment is shared with all 
of our neighbours within our country and outside of our borders. 
What happens outside and within our borders is our business.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14560"> 14560 </A></B>
<P>
	I believe we as a country can take a leadership role in addressing 
some of the large and pressing problems with our environment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, in the last federal election the Liberal government said 
environmental and economic agendas must converge. That means 
all federal departments must act on this understanding.
<P>
	In our red book we stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Sustainable development-integrating economic with environmental 
goals-fits in the Liberal tradition of social investment as sound economic 
policy. Preventive environmental care is the foundation of the Liberal approach 
to sustainable development.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	To make this happen we promised Canadians one of the things 
we would do is appoint an environmental auditor general who 
would report directly to Parliament and have powers of 
investigation similar to those of the auditor general. I firmly 
believe Bill C-83 delivers on that commitment and more.
<P>
	The House owes congratulations to the Deputy Prime Minister 
and the Minister of the Environment for the leadership she has 
shown on this very important matter.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The environment and sustainable development must 
automatically be part of all the decisions made by the federal 
government. They must not be the result of thinking after the fact 
or be taken into account after the real decisions have been made; on 
the contrary, they must be an integral part of all government 
decision making.
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We need to do what we can to make sure that the environmental 
and sustainable development considerations are integral factors in 
the decision making of all federal government departments. That 
means decisions on new policies, programs, regulations and laws 
as well as the existing ones. It also means decisions on how 
departments manage their buildings, facilities and operations.
<P>
	Canadians deserve to live in a country that is prosperous and 
healthy and they demand that their national government take a 
leadership role in making this happen. Bill C-83 is a response to 
that demand. It shows Canadians that the government is serious 
about getting its act together on environmental issues. It shows 
Canadians that we are willing to change the way government does 
business and that we are not afraid to be held publicly accountable 
for what we do and what we do not do.
<P>
	By getting our house in order the federal government can 
promote the shift to sustainable development throughout Canadian 
society. This is what Bill C-83 is all about.
<P>
	I have been delighted to serve on the Standing Committee on the 
Environment and Sustainable Development. One of the first big 
jobs we tackled was to try and find the best way for the government 
to meet its environmental auditor general commitment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Last spring, the committee held wide-ranging hearings and 
submitted its report to the House in May.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am very proud of our work and our report. We had real input 
into how the red book commitment would be delivered and we had 
real input in the bill currently before the House.
<P>
	Under the skilled leadership of my colleague, the hon. member 
for Davenport, we wrote a report that called for enhanced 
environmental auditing of the government's policies, programs and 
laws. We wrote a report that says the government must be held 
accountable to Parliament and to the public for demonstrating 
progress in meeting objectives.
<P>
	We wrote a report that advocates going beyond the concept of 
simply creating an environmental auditor general and instead 
establishing an independent and influential commissioner of the 
environment and sustainable development.
<P>
	It became clear to committee members very early on in our work 
that much of what would be the audit responsibilities of the 
commissioner are in fact already carried out by the auditor general. 
We also recommended in our report that the auditor general 
continue to evolve this work and that the Auditor General Act be 
amended to meet new requirements in performing such a role.
<P>
	Bill C-83 does this. It establishes a commissioner of the 
environment and sustainable development and it does it right in the 
Office of the Auditor General. This is not, I repeat, not a retreat 
from our red book pledge. Instead, it is a better more effective way 
to carry out our pledge to Canadians.
<P>
	The Office of the Auditor General has clout. It is independent 
from government. It is well respected. It has solid expertise that 
can be put to use at once. For all these reasons the Office of the 
Auditor General can greatly enhance the auditing of the 
government's environmental performance as well as the 
effectiveness of the commissioner.
<P>
	Bill C-83 also augments the role of the auditor general. It gives 
him or her the clear legal mandate to include environmental effects 
along with the conventional considerations for the economy and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14561"> 14561 </A></B>
<P>
efficiency when reporting to the House of Commons. This ensures 
that  issues of environment and sustainable development are 
integrated directly into government thinking and planning. This 
kind of integration is what sustainable development is all about.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	However this is far from being the government's first initiative 
to foster sustainable development. Let me name just a few: the 
proclamation of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act; 
actions to green government operations; the task force on economic 
instruments and disincentives to sound environmental practices; 
and the initial follow-up to the task force in the last federal budget.
<P>
	Bill C-83 is just the most recent course of action to make the 
shift to sustainable development. This bill will promote sustainable 
development across all federal departments by requiring ministers 
to table in the House sustainable development strategies. The 
strategies must include their departments' objectives and plans of 
action to further sustainable development. All departments will be 
required to update their strategies every three years with ministers 
tabling the updates in the House.
<P>
	The commissioner will be keeping a close eye on this. He or she 
will be completely independent and will report directly to the 
auditor general on all of his or her environmental and sustainable 
development related duties. The commissioner will also assist the 
auditor general in addressing the environmental and sustainable 
development aspects of his general auditing work.
<P>
	One of the commissioner's most important duties will be to 
monitor and report annually to the House on the government's 
progress toward sustainable development. That means reviewing 
each department's sustainable development strategy. That means 
monitoring their action plans and reporting on their success. It also 
means reporting on anything related to environmental aspects of 
sustainable development that merits attention.
<P>
	The amendments are indeed historic and unprecedented and have 
far reaching implications for the way the federal government does 
its business. They ensure that no matter who the auditor general 
happens to be, environment and sustainable development will have 
a high profile in the work of that office. They force this government 
and all governments that follow to promote sustainable 
development practices within all federal departments and across all 
major economic sectors of our country. They will hold the 
government fully and completely accountable to the public for its 
performance in making the shift to sustainable development.
<P>
	Today I am proud to be a parliamentarian and I am proud to be a 
member of this government. We have taken a red book 
commitment and engaged Canadians in fulfilling it and indeed in 
going beyond it. We have taken a major step forward.
<P>
	No, as has been pointed out by other colleagues in the House, the 
committee did not achieve everything it hoped to achieve. That has 
been very candidly stated earlier by my colleague, the 
parliamentary secretary, and most recently by my colleague, the 
chair of the committee. However we have made a major step 
forward. We have taken a radical departure in the way government 
does business. We have taken a leadership role.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I would like the member who just spoke to clarify 
two things.
<P>
	The first has to do with accountability. As you know, Madam 
Speaker, from reading the bill the legislation calls for petitions 
from the general public, in other words those matters in which the 
public wants to hold the government accountable. Petitions from 
the general public that go to the new commissioner are simply 
handed over by the commissioner to the relevant government 
department for a response. That response is what holds the 
government accountable to the citizens of Canada; no 
investigation, no specific examination of the complaint, simply 
turning over the complaint to the department.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	In other words, on a matter which happened recently a citizen 
was concerned about the PCBs on the <I>Irving Whale</I>. Instead of that 
matter going to court and the court telling the government it fell 
short on this issue, the department simply said it was no problem, 
the environmental impact assessment was sufficient and the <I>Whale</I> 
would be raised. The courts came back and said that those nice 
words were not good enough, that the PCBs were not a part of the 
environmental assessment study and until they were the <I>Whale</I> 
could not be raised.
<P>
	Nice words of the department do not demonstrate accountability 
to the public. I would like the member to further clarify his 
statement in light of that comment.
<P>
	The other statement has to do with the clout of the auditor 
general. The member indicates that he supports the legislation 
because the auditor general has clout. I think I quote him correctly.
<P>
	In appearing before the committee, the auditor general 
acknowledged that the clout he has is embarrassment. The clout he 
has is by reporting. The public reads the report and the government 
is embarrassed. The government is embarrassed enough already on 
environmental issues. How is it that the clout an environmental 
commissioner would have would be any different from the 
embarrassment the government feels today?
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate the very good 
questions from my colleague opposite.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14562"> 14562 </A></B>
<P>
	First of all it is very interesting to me that the hon. member 
raises the issue of PCBs. PCBs have been a major concern in my 
own municipality for some 10 years now, particularly in my own 
riding of London-Middlesex. Let me say that when as the new 
member of Parliament for the riding of London-Middlesex I 
brought this concern to the attention of the Minister of the 
Environment and the Deputy Prime Minister she was very quick 
to respond in putting an end to a long process initiated by the 
previous Tory government to try to find a site for the destruction 
of these PCBs.
<P>
	This thing had dragged on for years. There was never a 
conclusion to it. They were spending lots of taxpayers' money. 
They had not come up with a proposed site and were planning 
really to force a decision on one of two or three communities 
unhappily in the riding of London-Middlesex. None of those 
communities was very excited about it.
<P>
	When I brought that to the attention of the minister, she took 
very quick action. She indicated there would be no need for such a 
facility in the city of London, that we had better options to enable 
us to eliminate PCBs without creating additional expensive 
facilities. I was very impressed with the response on that.
<P>
	On the member's comment about petitions from the public about 
pollution problems be they PCBs or whatever, what the member 
may have overlooked in my comments is the fact that ministers 
will have to table in the House plans for how they will deal with 
environmental issues within their ministry. There will be regular 
ongoing reviews of these plans. As the member who is more senior 
in this House than I well knows, that will give members in this 
Chamber many opportunities to take a shot at any issue they want 
to address themselves to in speaking for their constituents.
<P>
	In his first question the member referred to the courts. 
Fortunately in a democratic system like we have in this country I 
would submit that the courts will always be the last recourse in 
many cases. If the courts see fit to overrule government on 
environmental issues, then so be it. That is an important right we 
want to cherish.
<P>
	On the member's second question, he quoted me correctly about 
saying that the auditor general has clout. I can tell my colleague 
that the first standing committee I was honoured to serve on in the 
House was the public accounts committee. The current auditor 
general, Mr. Desautels, in my view has tremendous clout. When he 
comes to that committee on any subject-and he is the star witness 
as we all know-he is listened to very attentively by all members 
of the House sitting on the committee.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	I agree with Mr. Desautels that embarrassment is a major 
weapon in his arsenal. He told us time and  again-and I personally 
questioned him on it-that it was not his job to indicate new policy 
directions for any government but it was his job to indicate where 
governments fell short and where they might have been able to do 
better.
<P>
	If governments and ministers do not live up to the plans they 
have tabled and when reviews of the plans indicate shortcomings, I 
would hope the auditor general would be at the appropriate 
committee to embarrass the government of the day. I would 
welcome it, as would all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York-Simcoe, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, Canada has recently been declared the second wealthiest 
nation on earth. This is in large part due to our natural heritage.
<P>
	Canadians from coast to coast are privileged people who live in a 
great nation. We are a country of richly diverse temperate rain 
forests, prairie grasslands that expand wide on open horizons, great 
inland waterways, beaches full of the scent of ocean life, and 
fragile Arctic flowers that hang tenuously on to life season after 
season.
<P>
	Fresh potable water, clean air and arable soil are resources that 
cannot be fully valued. Once they are gone they cannot be replaced. 
More and more world conflict will arise from fighting over scarce 
natural resources. Human health is clearly linked to a healthy 
natural environment.
<P>
	In the spring of 1994 I had the honour of accompanying the 
Minister of the Environment to attend a G-7 ministers of the 
environment conference in Florence, Italy. At that conference they 
made it very clear to the Canadian delegation that the world was 
anxiously watching Canada. Canada, they told us, was one of the 
last countries of the world to contain large tracts of pristine 
wilderness.
<P>
	The delegates very eloquently told us how they learned too late 
about their mistakes. Vast tracts of forested land had been denuded, 
arable soil had been turned into desert, fresh waterways polluted 
and air made unbreathable.
<P>
	Paul Hawken, in his book ``The Ecology of Commerce'', paints a 
very bleak future for this planet. We currently use 40 per cent of the 
earth's biotic capacity to produce. In 40 years the earth's 
population will double. If we continue to use the earth's resources 
at the same rate with no change, in 40 years when the earth's 
population doubles we will use 80 per cent of the earth's biotic 
capacity to produce.
<P>
	Major ecosystem failure occurs at 60 per cent to 70 per cent. We 
have already experienced a major ecosystem failure on the east 
coast in the fisheries. The long debate over the ecological 
implications of our behaviour is over. We can see before our eyes 
what is happening. We feel the effects on our health. Our 
communities and  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14563"> 14563 </A></B>
<P>
industries know firsthand about the devastation of an ecological 
crisis.
<P>
	Canadians, from what polls indicate, are very concerned about 
their economic well-being and the economic health of the country, 
but underlying all these concerns the environment is still an issue 
they have a strong attachment to.
<P>
	In my one and a half years as vice-chair of the environment 
committee I have heard Canadians from all parts of the country, 
from all walks of life, both industry and environmental groups, 
First Nations people, scientists and lay persons, speak about their 
concerns regarding environmental degradation. I have heard senior 
representatives of large corporations talk with pride in their voices 
about environmental initiatives they are pursuing. We have heard 
from community groups, from band councils and from government 
agencies all outlining what they are trying to do to help Canadian 
society make the shift to sustainability.
<P>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	However it is not enough. Not everyone in industry, in the 
private sector and in the public sector is doing all he or she can. 
Government must show leadership, first by taking the initiative to 
model environmentally sensitive behaviour and, second, by 
developing best practices that can be used by others in the shift 
toward sustainability.
<P>
	The commissioner of the environment and sustainable 
development as outlined by Bill C-83 will go a long way in 
demonstrating leadership. First, it very clearly demonstrates to 
Canadians that the government is committed to sustainable 
approaches. Second, it will provide very good working examples of 
how we can make the move from theory to practice, from problem 
analysis to problem solving.
<P>
	One key issue addressed at the G-7 ministers of the environment 
conference in Florence focused on the practice of sustainability. 
How is the shift made in practical terms and how do we undertake 
green or environmental accounting? Through building on the 
efforts already initiated by the auditor general in the field of green 
auditing, the government can help to build capacity in Canadian 
society.
<P>
	Third, the government can show leadership in the shift toward 
sustainability by helping to co-ordinate and connect all efforts 
currently under way. Many undertakings are happening in various 
government departments that need to be documented and 
co-ordinated.
<P>
	Originally the committee had recommended a stand alone office 
of the commissioner of the environment to assess government 
policy proactively before it is implemented. I would certainly 
prefer the forward looking approach of this model as opposed to the 
rearview approach of the office of the auditor general. However 
this must be balanced by the added clout of the  office of the auditor 
general that Bill C-83 provides and the ability of the new 
commissioner to integrate fully ecological considerations with all 
government auditing functions.
<P>
	The government has fulfilled its red book commitment even 
though what is reflected in Bill C-83 is not exactly what the 
committee recommended because the committee recommendations 
differed from the red book.
<P>
	I campaigned on the issue of a commissioner of the environment 
and sustainable development in the office of the auditor general. I 
was very excited about the progressive nature of this campaign 
promise. I am very pleased that Canada will join New Zealand as 
the second country in the world to have a commissioner of 
sustainable development.
<P>
	In addition to amending the Auditor General Act to require the 
appointment of a commissioner of the environment and sustainable 
development, Bill C-83 sets out other things to support the shift 
toward sustainability. These include ensuring that environmental 
considerations in the context of sustainable development are taken 
into account in the auditor general's reports to the House of 
Commons, imposing requirements for responding to petitions 
received by the auditor general about federal environmental 
matters, and requiring that departments prepare and table 
sustainable development strategies in the House of Commons. All 
these will increase public accountability as the government 
exhibits leadership in the shift to sustainability.
<P>
	We have the resources in the country, the human talent and 
expertise and the rich, diverse natural heritage of our land to meet 
the challenges that face us as a nation; but as people must be 
nurtured, supported and protected. So must the land, the air, the 
water and all that they contain.
<P>
	I ask members of the House: Who ultimately owns these things? 
How can a document give full and absolute ownership to a forest or 
to a tract of land? Perhaps we should consider how the aboriginal 
peoples of the country view their relationship to the land. They do 
not individually own it. Rather they must care for the land. 
Anything that is done to the natural environment must be thought 
of in the way it will affect the seventh generation.
<P>
	As individuals our time on earth is fleeting. We are like a mere 
speck on the beach of time. Yet, in a fluttering second we can 
destroy that beach and all the life that depends on it for survival.
<P>
<B>(1740 )</B>
<P>
	It is time to challenge our unsustainable behaviours. It is time for 
the government to show leadership in the shift to a sustainable 
future in both the spirit and letter of the law.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, my colleague on the Standing Committee on 
Environment and Sustainable Development spoke to the fact that 
the committee preferred a stand alone office of a commissioner 
of the environment. She mentioned that however unfortunately it 
was not done and that the red book commitment had been kept.
<P>
	Could she elaborate on the keeping of that commitment and 
perhaps speculate at least and explain to the House why the 
committee's first option was not in fact brought to fruition?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Kraft Sloan:</B> Madam Speaker, as always people have 
different visions of where they might like to go. Certainly the 
Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable 
Development had decided on a particular vision after interviewing 
a number of witnesses and through discussions with committee 
members. We thought perhaps a stand alone commissioner might 
be the way to go in this regard.
<P>
	The red book commitment talked about a commissioner of 
sustainable development within the auditor general's office. The 
government in its wisdom decided to go with that particular 
position.
<P>
	Part of the discussion we had as members of that committee 
looking at the particular issue was the tradeoff of a stand alone 
office or the clout within the auditor general's office. Given the 
kinds of financial constraints the government is operating under, I 
think we can utilize the expertise that has already been developed 
in the auditor general's office and move in that direction.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I have a question for my colleague from 
York-Simcoe.
<P>
	Could she perhaps elaborate on the aboriginal concept of the 
seven generations? What exactly does it mean?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Kraft Sloan:</B> Madam Speaker, my understanding-and I 
guess it is the best way to state it-is that whenever anything is 
done to the natural environment, when we decide to intervene in 
the course of a waterway, when we decide to make changes on the 
land or if we decide to cut a forest, we have to think of the 
implications of the action on the seventh generation down the road.
<P>
	It is not just how it is going to affect us next month or in the next 
year. We have to think of the seven lifetimes of people who will 
follow us. When we are dealing with environmental issues they are 
very complex and often we do not properly extend the time 
horizon.
<P>
	One of the reasons I am so supportive of the concept of 
sustainability is that it takes into consideration ecological aspects, 
economic aspects and social aspects. Something I firmly believe in 
is intergenerational equity. Our children inherit what we leave for 
them, their children and so on to the seventh generation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it gives me a 
great deal of pleasure to join the debate since I was a member of the 
Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable 
Development and one of our first orders of business about a year 
ago was to examine the question of a commissioner for sustainable 
development.
<P>
<B>(1745 )</B>
<P>
	As earlier speakers have said, we listened to a great number of 
witnesses. I think we were pleased with our report. Now it is time 
to say that we are pleased with what the Minister of the 
Environment has presented and with the steps the government is 
going to take.
<P>
	An act to amend the Auditor General Act in order to establish a 
commissioner of sustainable development will put the government 
firmly on the path to meeting one of our red book commitments-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It would be the first.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Finlay:</B> The first of many. I want to deal with this act in 
three main areas. The first has to do with the definition that appears 
in the act. This was only one of the definitions that were presented 
to the committee. We had a lot of discussion about this. I believe 
we have chosen wisely and I am glad that the definition that arises 
out of the Brundtland report is the one that is in this act.
<P>
	Sustainable development means development that meets the 
needs of the present without compromising the ability of future 
generations to meet their own needs. As my honoured colleague, 
the member for Davenport, has already pointed out, this definition 
is crucial. This definition goes beyond balancing the economy and 
the environment. Up to a few years ago, when I asked this kind of 
question from an environmental point of view to members of the 
previous government I was told with a wry grin that there are jobs 
and then there is the environment. Our future is here, and it 
includes both jobs and the environment, both industry and the 
environment, all industries and the environment. That is a basic 
understanding I hope all in the House will acknowledge.
<P>
	Many people have seen industry and environment as antithetical 
and opposite. This definition goes well beyond that. Again, it is 
another case where many of our educational institutions, many of 
our businesses and industries, and many of our organizations in this 
country are somewhat ahead of the government. They are now 
teaching courses in waste management, in integrated resource 
management. Our ministries of the environment and industry have 
also stimulated the Canadian environmental industry, which is one 
of the fastest growing areas of our economy.
<P>
	Let us return for a moment to this definition. It says 
``development that meets the needs of the present''. This does not 
say the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14565"> 14565 </A></B>
<P>
wants of the present; it says the needs. That means we have to give 
it considerable  thought. We have to reach some agreements and we 
have to do considerable research. The basic fact we have to 
understand is that we live on a finite planet. Our resources, our 
land, our air, our water, and our energy are all limited. Right now 
we have all the air, polluted or not, that we are going to have. We 
have all the water, pure or not, fresh or not, we are going to have. 
And we have all the land, eroded or not, we are going to have.
<P>
	Considering that the extent of arable land on the planet is very 
tiny compared to the expanse of the oceans, the mountains, the 
deserts, and other parts of this fair earth that we cannot use, this is a 
basic tenet of all of our actions and it must become ingrained in the 
decisions we make in the House.
<P>
<B>(1750 )</B>
<P>
	It states ``without compromising the ability of future 
generations''. Politicians are good compromisers. We have to be 
sometimes. However, compromise is not possible when we are 
dealing with some of the present problems of the environment. In 
order to achieve sustainable development we cannot compromise 
on the pressing need to improve our performance in protecting the 
environment, in establishing sustainable industrial processes, and 
in managing our waste. The ``ability of future generations'' 
requires us to look a little into the future. We need to recognize that 
some of the problems that appear before us now are not the only 
problems that future generations may face.
<P>
	We know, as the hon. member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca 
pointed out, that the population of the earth is doubling now in 
decades, not centuries and not millennia. That is something we 
have to keep in mind, because future generations are going to have 
a much bigger problem than we have if we do not move toward 
helping to solve it. Our needs for energy will expand tremendously. 
Progressive climate change cannot be allowed to continue on and 
on, because the eventual result will be catastrophic.
<P>
	The global transport of toxics through air and water, which 
already affects much of our Arctic area and the Inuit and others 
who live there, is going to continue unless we start to reduce it.
<P>
	The time for compromise is gone. I think we have to get on with 
the job. Hopefully this bill will set us on the road to doing that as 
expeditiously as possible.
<P>
	The last part of the definition states: ``We must not compromise 
the ability of future generations to meet their own needs''. Since it 
is impossible for us definitively to know what those needs will be, 
it would be best if we erred on the side of caution and care, 
increased our respect for the environment and increased our efforts 
to become a conserving rather than a wasting and wasteful society.
<P>
	Again, as my colleague for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca said, we 
create a lot of garbage. We are the best in the  world at creating 
garbage. We are number one in garbage creation and waste. We 
would dearly like to become number one in the management of that 
and in getting rid of it.
<P>
	I would like to spend a moment on a fact that has been brought 
up by several other members. We talked about a commissioner of 
sustainable development. On the committee we wanted a separate 
office. We wanted a real proactive position. We find that we have in 
this act a commissioner, yes, within the auditor general's 
department.
<P>
	I think perhaps this is a place where our compromise was 
needed. Perhaps what we have in this act will in a number of ways 
accentuate the role of that commissioner. One of the things we 
heard in the committee from witness after witness was that the 
federal departments of this government were not particularly up to 
date or forward looking or in advance of those things that needed to 
be done to preserve the environment. In fact many industries and 
organizations told us that some of our departments did not obey the 
rules to nearly the same extent as the mining companies, the 
industries, and so on. We were shown quite clearly in the 
committee from the witnesses we saw and the trips we made, which 
were not many but were very effective, that this was so.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	Hence, the bill puts the commissioner in there to see that 
government puts its own house in order by greening policies and 
operations across all departments. We talked about co-operation, 
and that is needed.
<P>
	The commissioner will hold the government publicly 
accountable for its own environmental performance. The 
commissioner will promote sustainable development as an 
essential factor in making decisions at all levels of society and 
within all departments of government.
<P>
	Our departments must lead. After all, the Government of Canada 
spends more of the people's money than anyone else. It owns more 
of the land or is at least responsible for more of it. It employs more 
people. Hence it has to be in the forefront if we are going to meet 
the definition of sustainable development in this act.
<P>
	The commissioner will have to monitor and report annually to 
Parliament. He or she must know what the departments are 
planning. He must assist them in their planning and he must 
respond to the public and petitions from the public on 
environmental matters.
<P>
	Although under the old CEPA, Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act, there were only one or two requests from the public 
for some study or action to do with the environment, we would 
hope that the commissioner's office will focus the public's 
attention and provide a place where their concerns can be swiftly 
dealt with.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14566"> 14566 </A></B>
<P>
	A number of members have questioned making the 
commissioner part of the auditor general's office. My colleague 
from Simcoe Centre has pointed out that the committee's report 
asked for a separate office. However, I think the reasons provided 
by the Minister of the Environment are worth repeating. The 
auditor general already audits the environmental performance of 
federal departments, albeit after the fact. That is a function he 
fulfills.
<P>
	The commissioner will strengthen the auditor general's 
environmental effectiveness and make sure that the environment 
has a higher profile in his audits. The commission will have some 
added credibility as part of an expert, respected and independent 
office that now operates at arm's length from the government. That 
was an important part of the commissioner's mandate.
<P>
	Given the government's commitment to fiscal restraint and 
affordable services, it seems preferable to strengthen an existing 
organization rather than create a new separate office.
<P>
	Finally, the commissioner will be funded from existing 
resources.
<P>
	It has been a pleasure to speak with respect to the environment. I 
am committed to sustainable development and to the environment. 
I look forward to the first report from our commissioner, whoever 
that might be.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, we are 
talking about sustainable development, a very important issue. We 
must not pollute the waters where we swim nor the water we drink. 
Otherwise, we risk poisoning ourselves. We must not pollute the air 
we breathe if we want to avoid intoxication.
<P>
	We should take measures to ensure that not only future 
generations, but our own will have the opportunity to really 
appreciate and fully enjoy nature, the world around us.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	When we speak about an auditor for the environment, I think the 
idea is very interesting, but I cannot help having some reservations. 
I would like to share these with you. I am sure my colleague will 
then reply and allay my concerns.
<P>
	You know, Madam Speaker, that we already have an auditor 
general who, year after year, each and every year, presents a very 
extensive report on the administrative failings of the federal 
government. God knows this report is not a small document. The 
auditor publishes an imposing series of volumes every year.
<P>
	If we felt, when the report is tabled, that results were not only 
expected, but were in fact there, that they had been delivered, I 
would say to myself: auditing works, we have set up mechanisms 
whereby the government is  responsible to the public, and the 
government changes course as required.
<P>
	But this is really not the case. I am thinking of the Commissioner 
of Official Languages. As the Vice-Chairman of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Official Languages, I repeatedly have occasion to 
regret the fact that, despite his good efforts, the Commissioner of 
Official Languages still failed to achieve the results he was hoping 
for and even that, recently, in February, his budget was cut. He is 
not alone. Many government agencies and departments are in the 
same situation, but that does not help him do his work.
<P>
	So, of course, my honourable colleague says that the 
environmental auditor will be able to call attention to failures, but 
that is not enough. Knowing that things are going badly is a step in 
the right direction, but being unable to do anything or being 
unwilling to do something is a more serious matter.
<P>
	Will we once again, and this is the heart of my question, be faced 
with a situation where, well aware of the corrective action to be 
taken, we must once more regret the fact that such action was not 
taken? Perhaps my honourable colleague can answer my concern?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Finlay:</B> Madam Speaker, I say to my hon. friend that we 
must walk before we run. Rome was not built in a day. Everybody's 
budget has been decreased except two.
<P>
	In last year's budget the only department that was not hit very 
hard was the environment ministry. For a very good reason this 
year it was the department of aboriginal affairs and northern 
development. More aboriginal people need more help.
<P>
	I share my colleague's concern that we are not doing everything 
that needs to be done, or that can be done. That is exactly why we 
need the commissioner. The auditor general's function is to audit 
what has been done. The commissioner's function is to do 
something before it is done to see that the plans are going to work.
<P>
	I have no magic wand. We cannot make everything work at once 
but we can at least try to get on with it if we all understand what the 
problem is and what the goal is.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I listened with interest to the member's speech. I 
wonder if he could clarify a couple of areas for me.
<P>
	He made the statement that Canada was the largest creator of 
garbage in the world. Maybe he could tell us where he got that 
information and how he developed the thesis that Canada of all 
places is the largest developer of garbage in the world. I am sure it 
is something that all Canadians would like to know more about. 
Could he tell us the scientific facts and how he arrived at that 
conclusion.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14567"> 14567 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	The second comment I was concerned about was in regard to 
global warming. I remember growing up in the seventies when 
environmentalists said that in five years if we were not careful the 
rivers would boil. I would like the member to share with us where 
he received this information. In his statement who is speaking for 
science in his comments?
<P>
	I feel he has left out an important aspect. If he wants to make a 
statement about something, he should back it up with some facts.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Finlay:</B> Madam Speaker, I want to correct one thing I said.
<P>
	Canada is the greatest per capita user of energy in the modern 
world. My hon. friend has corrected me. We are second in the per 
capita production of waste. The U.S. is first in the production of 
waste, second in the per capita use of energy. These are not figures 
I made up in my head. They are well recognized all over the globe. 
They come out of the Brundtland commission study. There is not 
any great secret about it. It is one of those things we have to keep in 
mind when we look at other countries and worry about population.
<P>
	We sometimes say we have our population under control. We are 
pretty well at a zero base population except we receive a lot of 
immigrants which is fine. However India and China are not zero 
base populations.
<P>
	The fact is that one Canadian uses something between 20 to 100 
times as much of this earth's resources as one Indian or one Central 
American or one African. It depends on which country we are 
talking about, how developed and how undeveloped.
<P>
	Concerning global warming, someone said the rivers were going 
to boil in five years. That is science fiction. The fact that the breast 
milk of Inuit mothers has 20 times-far more-dioxins in it than 
the breast milk of mothers in Montreal is not science fiction. It is 
fact.
<P>
	Just as we have deplored for some years the attitude of American 
presidents that acid rain was some figment of the scientist's 
imagination or that the accumulation of toxins in the St. Lawrence 
River was some figment of a naturalist's imagination, we find of 
course that it is not, that the beluga whales are diseased, that acid 
rain kills the lakes in northern Ontario and northern Quebec, 
Lapland and so on. We are not dealing with science fiction. We are 
dealing with facts.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
very pleased to speak to the amendments to the Auditor General 
Act. This is a very important bill and one of the best things we have 
done as a government so far.
<P>
	It will create profound changes in the way government operates 
in this country. It will integrate the environmental agenda with the 
economic agenda. As  well, one of the two or three most important 
challenges that we as a society and as a world face in the next 50 
years is the environment.
<P>
	We have been reminded in the last couple of weeks with different 
stories in the media of how much of a challenge this is. In fact it 
astonishes me to hear Reform Party members who seem to dismiss 
the idea of the environment as a major concern.
<P>
	We have seen reports on global warming. A report last Monday, 
September 11 in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> indicated that global experts, 
the international intergovernmental panel which has been studying 
for years the issue of global warming, after years of saying they 
were not sure of this and years of denying it was a real problem, 
have finally come to the point where they are saying, yes, we 
accept that the level of global warming we are seeing has to be 
caused in part at least by human actions. It is human activity which 
is contributing to global warming. We cannot ignore it.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	Even if we were not absolutely sure that our actions were 
contributing to global warming, to pollution and problems world 
wide, even if there was a 50 per cent chance there are some things 
we can do to stop it, are we not wise to be on the right side? I think 
we are.
<P>
	We have also heard stories about the ozone layer. I heard about a 
week ago that the hole in the ozone layer over the Antarctic this 
summer is twice as large as the year before. The things that are 
happening to our world can have a major impact on us.
<P>
	The idea of global warming to people in Canada sounds great 
because we live through some pretty cold winters, especially here 
in Ottawa. I can tell the House it is always milder and more 
pleasant in Nova Scotia. Winters throughout the country are very 
cold. Therefore, global warming sounds nice.
<P>
	In today's Halifax <I>Daily News</I>, a Canadian Press story reported 
some things that have happened this year as a result of the very hot 
summer. In 1989 I heard that four out of five of the hottest 
summers on record occurred in the 1980s. I am sure that has 
changed because in some respects this summer was one of the 
worst on record in terms of heat.
<P>
	There was record destruction by forest fires across North 
America. There were terrible floods in southern Alberta. Toronto 
recorded the most humid summer in 30 years. In rural Ontario there 
was one report of 500,000 chickens dying in one weekend due to 
heat. We saw hurricanes. We have seen hurricanes before. They are 
not unusual. In the southern U.S. and on the east coast we saw 
terrible damage from hurricanes. All of these things added together 
have to mean that something is happening.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14568"> 14568 </A></B>
<P>
	The summer of 1995 was the third hottest on record and maybe 
the muggiest. In Chicago more than 500 people died in a heat 
wave. In England it was the driest summer in 200 years. Those 
who say that we should not worry, that it is not getting hotter or 
that these are not really problems, should reconsider because these 
things have a great impact.
<P>
	I mentioned the ozone layer. We have all become more aware 
over the last year since weather reports include UV readings of how 
much of a concern this must be. We know the impact of UV in 
terms of skin cancer. We should also be aware that if the ozone 
layer is depleted further and UV rays get through the atmosphere it 
can have a devastating effect. It is a gradual effect but more and 
more ozone depletion each year gradually stunts crop growth. If the 
ozone layer becomes thinner crops cannot grow. That is absolutely 
scary to the world. It seems to me that the environment must be a 
priority for the country and across the planet.
<P>
	It makes sense that we are making it a priority to amend the 
Auditor General Act. In the red book the Liberals say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Sustainable development, integrating economic with environmental goals, 
fits the Liberal tradition of social investment as sound economic policy. 
Preventive environmental care is the foundation of the Liberal approach to 
sustainable development;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The government is serious about promoting sustainable 
development. It is serious about being held accountable for its 
environmental actions and environmental planning. It really must 
be. Canadians want and deserve a prosperous, healthy country in 
which we and our children can work to achieve our aspirations.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This is also reflected in departmental decisions concerning the 
management of buildings, facilities and operations. The proposed 
amendments to the Auditor General Act before the House will 
permit, to a large extent, to achieve the kind of integration we are 
seeking. They are a key element of the government's response last 
fall to the first report of the Standing Committee on the 
Environment and Sustainable Development entitled ``The 
Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development''.
<P>
	The committee was of the opinion that, even though it is critical 
to examine measures taken by the government, it is even more 
important to make sure that environmental considerations are a 
basic planning element in every department. The committee asked 
that the environmental audit of government policies, programs and 
legislation be stepped up.
<P>
	The committee believed that the government must report to 
Parliament and to the public the progress made to meet these 
objectives.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The committee advocated the government go beyond the idea of 
just an environmental auditor and instead establish a commissioner 
of the environment and sustainable development. In these proposed 
amendments to the Auditor General Act the government will 
establish a commissioner. We will meet all of the objectives of the 
committee's report.
<P>
	The amendments do contain at least one significant departure 
from the committee's report, which is to create the commissioner 
of the environment and sustainable development not as a separate 
position but within the existing framework of the auditor general's 
office. This is not in any way a retreat from our red book pledge. 
Instead it is a smarter, more effective way of carrying out the 
pledge.
<P>
	The Office of the Auditor General has clout. It is independent of 
the government. It is well respected and it has expertise. For all 
these reasons it can greatly enhance the auditing of the 
government's environmental performance.
<P>
	There is another advantage to this innovation. Within the work of 
the auditor general issues of environmental and sustainable 
development will be integrated directly with economic 
considerations. This kind of integration is what sustainable 
development is all about.
<P>
	What then is the substance of these amendments to the Auditor 
General Act? These modifications establish the function of the 
commissioner for the environment and sustainable development 
inside the Office of the Auditor General.
<P>
	We all know that every year when the report of the auditor 
general comes out there is a blaze of publicity. Everyone is aware 
of that. We can now expect an equal impact for reports of 
environmental failures or shortcomings of government. The fair 
publicity we know ministers will feel is going to be a powerful spur 
to action because it applies to every minister in every department. 
At times this may make things uncomfortable for those of us in 
government, especially the ministers. However, the government is 
prepared to accept that discomfort if the end result is better 
government for Canadians and a better environment for all of us.
<P>
	The scope of these changes is more far reaching than a simple 
institutionalization of the control and reporting procedures on the 
conduct of the government relating to ecology and sustainable 
development.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	More plainly put, these amendments challenge federal 
departments to take environmental action. In this sense, they go 
further than the red book commitment in vigorously promoting 
sustainable development.
<P>
	Under the amended act, each department will have two years to 
develop its own sustainable development  strategy which will be 
<P>

<B><A NAME="14569"> 14569 </A></B>
<P>
tabled in the House of Commons by the minister in charge. The 
strategy must be geared to results and must set out the department's 
objectives and the action plan to meet them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In effect, every minister will thus become a sustainable 
development minister. For example, the industry minister will be 
responsible for that portfolio and also for ensuring the Department 
of Industry operates in an environmentally sound way. The same is 
true of the foreign affairs minister, the transport minister and every 
other minister in cabinet.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	This is a big step forward in moving sustainable development 
from concept to reality. The departmental strategies will assist the 
auditor general and the commissioner in not only monitoring the 
government and preparing their reports to Parliament but will also 
serve as benchmarks by which the commissioner and auditor 
general can assess each department's performance in making the 
shift to sustainable development.
<P>
	This is not a one-shot affair to be undertaken with fanfare and 
then quickly forgotten. Every three years each department must 
update its sustainable development strategy and its minister must 
table that update in Parliament.
<P>
	Thanks to these changes, Canadians can get a better idea of how 
government is responding to the environmental challenge we face.
<P>
	The auditor general will be empowered to receive petitions from 
the public on environmental questions and then will pass those 
petitions to the minister responsible for the particular area, who 
must respond within a certain time.
<P>
	I can see how that could have an impact in my riding. In my 
riding of Halifax West in the community of Five Island Lake there 
is a former salvage operation site where there is a big problem with 
PCBs and other heavy metals and toxins. The clean up of that is a 
big problem. Right now it is considered an orphan site because the 
small business which operated it for so long really does not have 
the wherewithal to enable us to go after it for the costs. It needs 
some kind of funding. I do not want to keep pursuing the federal 
government. This kind of thing would help to create pressure to see 
that it is made a priority.
<P>
	That will be the overall impact of the bill. It will help to ensure 
that environmental issues become a higher priority hopefully 
across the country, hopefully across our society but certainly within 
government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The number and the focus of the petitions received by the 
ministers and the status of these matters will be monitored, and the 
commissioner will report to the House of Commons on the results 
obtained.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The amendments also require the commissioner to report 
annually to the House of Commons on behalf of the auditor 
general. These reports can focus on anything related to sustainable 
development, whatever the commissioner considers important 
enough to bring to the attention of the House. In particular, the 
commissioner's annual reports will indicate how far departments 
have gone in meeting the objectives and expectations they have set 
for themselves in their strategies.
<P>
	The annual report of the commissioner will not be the only 
report to the House of Commons on the government's 
environmental performance. These amendments will ensure that 
environmental observations will continue to be included in the 
auditor general's reports as well. That is important because the 
auditor general's reports are more general in scope. They will 
include the considerations of economy, efficiency, effectiveness 
and the environment as well. Indeed, one of the commissioner's 
duties will be to assist the auditor general in preparing aspects of 
these reports referring to the environment and sustainable 
development.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The auditor general alone will be responsible for appointing the 
commissioner of the environment and sustainable development. I 
am sure the auditor general will choose someone with excellent 
professional qualifications and strong personal commitment. This 
will guarantee that the commissioner will be sufficiently at arms' 
length.
<P>
	A decision on the funding for this position will be made once 
these amendments have been adopted. But let me assure you that 
there will be sufficient funding to guarantee these amendments will 
be implemented effectively.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The government is wasting no time in moving to meet its 
obligations under the proposed amendments. The government is 
committed to ensuring the promotion of thinking green as a central 
component of decision making at all levels of government and I 
hope eventually at all levels of our society.
<P>
	The Prime Minister and all ministers have signed a guidebook 
entitled ``A Guide to Green Government''. It will help all federal 
departments make sustainable development their business. That is 
good news. It will also serve as a curriculum for the commissioner 
when she or he reports on the success departments are having in  
<P>

<B><A NAME="14570"> 14570 </A></B>
<P>
integrating sustainable development practices into their own 
activities.
<P>
	Sustainable development is a shared responsibility requiring the 
co-operation and involvement of Canadians from all walks of life. 
In preparing sustainable development strategies departments must 
involve stakeholders. That is one of the requirements of this bill. 
Thinking green is a central component of decision making at all 
levels because of the bill.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	Departments will be required to report annually on their progress 
and they must provide information on the number, type and status 
of environmental assessments they are conducting.
<P>
	Another example of the government's commitment was the 
proclamation of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act last 
January. This legislation will ensure the environment is formally 
integrated into the project planning process of the federal 
government.

	Through the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency the 
government is already working hard to make sure environmental 
assessments of new government policies and programs are done 
and done well. These are important measures that establish a 
framework for sustainability at the federal government level.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	For years, governments have talked of sustainability and 
declared their support in this regard. It has always been difficult, 
however, to ensure these commitments are met.
<P>
	This is why environmental groups have long demanded an 
independent control and reporting function focussing on 
environmental actions. They saw this as a way to force the 
government to keep its promise. And just as obstinately, our 
predecessors in government have resisted having to keep their 
word.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Liberal government has a different approach. We are not 
afraid of openness, because that is what Canadians want. It might 
worry us to be criticized when there are shortcomings on the 
environment but it can only do us good in the long run. Therefore 
we are making sustainable development the priority it ought to be.
<P>
	This is another important step along the path to sustainable 
development and a healthy future for all Canadians. I recommend 
quick passage of this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the speech of the hon. member. He did 
make one error. He said the Reform Party does not care about the 
environment, which is not true at all. We have a comprehensive 
blue book policy on the environment. It is just that we like to be 
logical. We  do not like to hear all sorts of generalities quoted as if 
they were scientific facts.
<P>
	We could well question our confidence in an intergovernmental 
expert panel which concludes that there is global warming after 
observing the disastrous results of government experts managing 
things like the fisheries. These governmental panels are quite good 
at destroying the environment while at the same time arguing they 
are protecting it.
<P>
	The hon. member quoted from the <I>Globe and Mail</I> that the ozone 
layer was opening up a huge hole. However he forgot to mention 
that the <I>Globe and Mail</I> also mentioned that the scientist who had 
first discovered the ozone holes has now said he realizes it is part of 
a cycle and that it may not be a dangerous phenomena at all.
<P>
	In addition he mentioned that we just had the hottest summer in 
200 years but he did not mention what caused the hottest summer 
two hundred years ago. What does he think caused the hottest 
summer on record 200 years ago? It could not possibly have been 
the CFCs from refrigerators or the emissions from automobiles. I 
wonder if maybe the jury is still out on this whole thing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Regan:</B> Madam Speaker, my bet is Britain has only been 
keeping records of that sort in Britain for 200 years. Therefore it 
was the hottest in at least 200 years, maybe longer.
<P>
	There are certainly changes in the environment. We know we 
have had an ice age. Temperatures go up and down over a long 
period of time. However when we see it happening much more 
rapidly it tells us something. We ought to wake up and realize it.
<P>
	I have reasons for saying Reform Party members do not show the 
concern I would like them to show.
<P>
	They may say in their blue book that they care about the 
environment, but what I see in their speeches and in their 
comments is a lack of being convinced that the environment is a 
real problem. I think it is a big problem, and I wish they would 
share that view.
<P>

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It being 6.30 p.m., the 
House stands adjourned until 10 a.m. tomorrow, pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.30 p.m.)
