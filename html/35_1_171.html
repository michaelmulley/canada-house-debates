because the inclusion will infringe on the historic rights of

and association, therefore the petitioners call on Parliament to 
oppose any amendments to the Canadian Human Rights Act or 
to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms which would provide for 
the inclusion of the phrase sexual orientation.

section 718.2, would give special provisions based on sexual 
orientation, therefore the petitioners pray and request that 
Parliament not pass Bill C-41 with section 718.2 as presently

``sexual orientation'', as the behaviour people engage in does 
not warrant special consideration under Canadian law.

Canadians have been harassed, beaten or even murdered in

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ)</B> 
moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the House condemn the government for the refusal by the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage to publish the government's decisions concerning funding 
for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) for the next three years, thus 
causing an ominous threat to loom over the CBC's French-language network.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She said: Madam Speaker, today's debate will be on the 
following motion, which I am submitting to this House with the 
support of my colleague from Mercier:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the House condemn the government for the refusal by the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage to publish the government's decisions concerning funding 
for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) for the next three years, thus 
causing an ominous threat to loom over the CBC's French-language network.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This motion has become necessary because of the Canadian 
heritage minister's refusal to be open and confirm the 
information his deputy minister gave the President of the CBC 
on the day the budget was tabled in this House. According to this 
information, in the next three years, the CBC will have to absorb 
some $350 million in cuts, despite this government's formal and 
oft-repeated commitment to stable multi-year financing for the 
CBC.
<P>
	This lack of openness on the part of the minister and this 
stubborn denial of the facts show contempt for CBC employees. 
They create a climate of insecurity which can only harm our TV 
network. That is why our motion today condemns the minister 
for not disclosing all the cuts planned at the CBC. This course of 
conduct is also being denounced by the francophone press.
<P>
	For those who know how to read and listen, the government 
had made clear commitments to the CBC. On October 4, 1993, 
the Canadian Conference of the Arts distributed a questionnaire 
aimed at finding out the main political parties' respective 
positions on culture and communications. The Liberal Party of 
Canada responded as follows: ``By slashing funding for national 
institutions like the CBC, the Canada Council, the National Film 
Board and Telefilm Canada, the Tories have done great harm and 
shown how little they care about cultural development. Their 
savage cuts will hurt the next generation of performers, reduce 
the number of writers, composers, dancers and other creative 
artists, and undermine our cultural production. The 
development of our cultural organizations will be stunted. 
Cultural life outside the major cities will decline. In short, our 
country will weaken to the point that it will have to fulfil its 
cultural aspirations with foreign products''.
<P>
	The Liberal Party went on to say: ``A Liberal government will 
be committed to stable multi-year financing for our national 
institutions''.
<P>
	This was the first firm commitment the Liberal Party made 
during the election campaign and it was reiterated in the red 
book, which says: ``Canada needs more than ever to commit 
itself to cultural development. Instead, the Conservative regime 
has deliberately undermined our national cultural institutions. 
Funding cuts to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the 
Canada Council, the National Film Board, Telefilm Canada and 
other institutions illustrate the Tories' failure to appreciate the 
importance of cultural development''.
<P>
	After this impressive illustration of Tories' failures, the 
Liberals go on to state in their red book that they ``will be 
committed to stable multiyear financing for national cultural 
institutions such as the Canada Council and the CBC. This will 
allow national cultural institutions to plan effectively''.
<P>
	Almost as soon as he took office, the minister claimed to be a 
friend of the CBC. On February 3, 1994, he announced the 
appointment of Anthony Manera at the head of the CBC. In a 
letter to Mr. Manera and in the  press release he issued at the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10754"> 10754 </A></B>
<P>
time, he stated his firm intention, as government member, not to 
impose further cuts to the CBC.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	By the end of the fall, the word was that the Canadian 
Broadcasting Corporation would not escape the finance 
minister's bistoury. However, to Mr. Manera everything still 
appeared to be clear. Testifying before the heritage committee 
during the hearings on he CBC, Mr. Manera maintained that the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage had indeed promised him that the 
CBC would continue to receive multiyear funding. In his mind, 
the heritage minister's commitment was firm and unequivocal.
<P>
	On that occasion, the hon. member for Richelieu asked Mr. 
Manera: ``When you took the position, did you have a solemn 
commitment from the government to maintain that financing on 
a stable basis for a certain period, which is for five years starting 
with the 1994-95 budget? Did you have a commitment of that 
sort, before taking the plunge, with such a vision of the CBC?'' 
And Mr. Manera said, directing his answer to the chairman of 
our committee: ``Mr. Chairman, the answer is yes''.
<P>
	But now it would seem that all of us misunderstood, starting 
with Mr. Manera.
<P>
	On January 25, the Minister of Canadian Heritage was 
reported by the Canadian Press as stating that anyone who 
understood that there would be no cuts to the CBC 
misunderstood him.
<P>
	I am quoting from a Canadian Press article. It says the 
heritage minister did not rule out further cuts to the CBC, saying 
that the government had never promised that the corporation 
would be spared in the upcoming budget. The federal plan 
announced last year to stabilize CBC finances should not be seen 
as a pledge to keep the broadcaster's budget at current levels, 
said Mr. Dupuy. He added, and I quote: ``If it was interpreted as 
freezing the situation, it was the wrong interpretation''.
<P>
	Oh, dear. Then everyone who read the Liberal Party's 
response to the Canadian Conference of the Arts was mistaken. 
Then, we all misinterpreted what was written in the red book, the 
press release and the letter signed by the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage, the last two which were issued to the press on February 
4 and in which the minister firmly committed himself to 
maintaining CBC's funding.
<P>
	The budget confirmed what the minister had been hinting at. 
The budget plan tabled in the House on February 27 announced 
that the CBC's budget for the next fiscal year would be cut by 4 
per cent, which translates into $44 million.
<P>
	The budget plan also stated that, over the next three years, the 
government would be cutting $676 million from the budget for 
funding crown corporations which fall under the Department of 
Canadian Heritage's mandate. The same day, the deputy 
minister sent the CBC president an information brief on the 
breakdown of  the $676 million in cuts. The table in the brief 
clearly showed that the CBC would have to absorb $44 million 
in cuts for 1995-96, $97 million in 1996-97 and $165 million in 
1997-98. Unprecedented cuts, even under the Conservatives.
<P>
	The $15 million which the Department of Foreign Affairs 
used to pay each year to fund Radio Canada International should 
also be added to the cuts, because the corporation will now have 
to pay it. The president had already stated that he would not 
preside over the crown corporation's demise, so he resigned.
<P>
	What did the Minister of Canadian Heritage do to support his 
president? Nothing. He merely said that Mr. Manera was aware 
of the cuts and even added that Mr. Manera had informed him 
that he intended to resign a few weeks earlier. One day he stated 
that the only figures which his deputy had given to Mr. Manera 
were those contained in the budget; the next, he said the 
opposite. He admitted that Mr. Manera had obtained documents 
on program review.
<P>
	These documents show that the government plans to cut the 
CBC's budget by more than $300 million over the next three 
years. Mr. Manera did his homework, he let the public know 
about it, and then, he resigned.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	That was on February 28. On March 15, in the afternoon, it 
was the turn of the vice president of the French TV network. 
Meeting first with her staff and then with the press, Mrs. Fortin, 
in a presentation which was exceptional, I must say, insisted on 
setting the record straight for her employees. Seven hundred and 
fifty positions will be abolished on the French television 
network of the CBC, since it will be losing $60 million over 
three years as a result of the cuts agreed to by the heritage 
minister.
<P>
	What will be the consequences of these cuts? Well, there will 
be fewer cultural productions, fewer in-house productions, 
fewer television serials and less Canadian content, and all this in 
the age of the information highway. However, the heritage 
minister continues to pussyfoot around. No, there are no other 
cuts than the ones announced in the budget; no, the CBC did not 
inform him of any layoffs. In an editorial published in <I>La 
Presse</I>, editorialist Pierre Gravel talks about the lack of 
openness on the part of the heritage minister, and I quote: 
``Instead of being straightforward and behaving like a minister 
conscious of the seriousness of the issues, Mr. Dupuy only 
answered with a metaphor, in very poor taste, about the fact that 
when you let the ewe out of the barn, it comes and relieves itself 
on your doorstep''.
<P>
	Yet, the budget mentions $676 million in cuts to the crown 
corporations which come under Heritage Canada, namely the 
CBC, Telefilm Canada and the National Film Board. Mr. Manera 
did, in fact, receive a letter from the minister, and the minister 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10755"> 10755 </A></B>
<P>
now admits that under the program review a plan for cuts was 
indeed produced. We are now used to the pussyfooting of the 
Minister of  Canadian Heritage. Chantal Hébert, a reporter with 
<I>La Presse</I>, mentioned it in an article entitled: ``The variable 
time of Minister Dupuy''. His controversial statements have 
become his trademark.
<P>
	In an article published on March 4, Mrs. Hébert said that, in 
the case we are dealing with, the minister ``sent smoke signals in 
all directions, and gave as many different interpretations of 
events as there are days in the week. His public declarations 
contradicted the outgoing president, his top civil servants and 
what he himself has said unequivocally on the same issue''. 
While the heritage minister is getting ready to drastically cut 
parliamentary appropriations to CBC-SRC through the back 
door, the chairman of the Canadian heritage committee, the 
member for Don Valley West, is appearing on the front porch, 
ready to talk.
<P>
	He appeared twice on ``Le Point médias'', on Radio-Canada; 
he has appeared on CBC ``Prime Time''; he is appearing on any 
possible forum available to him, more often than not replacing a 
heritage minister who would rather stay silent. And what is our 
heritage committee chairman saying on all these forums? He is 
saying that the future of CBC-SRC lies in a formula somewhat 
similar to PBS, in the United States, an under-financed public 
network which, according to Madeleine Poulin, of ``Le Point 
médias'', reaches only one per cent of the population.
<P>
	Of course, he says, somewhat reluctantly-since he is after all 
a man of culture-, that French television is slightly different 
from English television because, as he told ``Le Point médias'', 
the Quebec environment is not yet a multi-channel one. The 
member for Don Valley-West was clearly implying that Quebec 
was slightly behind the rest of Canada, because fewer viewers 
have cable, but that it is only a matter of time before we are 
engulfed in the multi-channel universe. After all, he said, we 
already have TV5, and, to a degree, we are already being 
invaded by French-speaking European television.
<P>
	It is not a coincidence if the committee chairman is displaying 
in such a manner his personal feelings on public broadcasting. 
We feel that he has been given a mission. He is preparing public 
opinion for a radical shift in policies regarding Canadian public 
broadcasting.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	In the guise of sharing his personal opinion, the chairman of 
the committee is revealing to us the views of his government and 
is preparing us accordingly. Make no mistake: public television 
for the Liberal government amounts to a Canadian version of 
PBS.
<P>
	This vision is perhaps fine for English Canada, which in any 
event seems to be having quite a bit of difficulty finding a niche 
in the multi-channel universe, as the committee chairman so 
eloquently put it. But this vision is completely wrong where 
French television and Radio-Canada in particular are 
concerned.
<P>
	And that, furthermore, is what Radio-Canada, TVA, the 
Union des artistes, the Guilde des musiciens and the Association 
des producteurs de films et de télévision du Québec had to say at 
the information highway hearings now being held by the CRTC. 
In the present multi-channel universe, French television 
occupies a generalist niche, and this is not just some theory, but 
hard reality.
<P>
	Of the 50 most popular French-language television 
productions in Canada, 47 are produced here in Quebec, where 
we are just as exposed to the multi-channel universe as our 
English-speaking cousins in Toronto. Radio-Canada reached 
3.9 million viewers last February 5 with the independently 
produced <I>made in Québec</I>.
<P>
	Knowing that French television is under-funded compared to 
its English counterpart, one wonders what we could achieve if 
we were on the same financial footing as the English arm of the 
CBC.
<P>
	A recent poll by Som-Radio-Québec revealed that 53 per 
cent of Quebecers opposed cuts to the CBC, and 7 per cent 
thought there should be an increase in its parliamentary votes. 
Perhaps the fact that 60 per cent of Quebecers say they like their 
television network is not enough for English Canadians, who 
take decisions about the French network without even viewing 
it.
<P>
	This is why Michèle Fortin said that the disappearance of 
Radio-Canada's public television from the generalist niche, 
where it reaches large audiences never reached by Canadian 
English-language stations, is collective suicide. Mrs. Fortin 
quite rightly recalled that, in Quebec, PBS-type public 
television niches are already occupied by RDI and 
Radio-Canada, for example.
<P>
	So, as the CBC French network Vice President, Mrs. Fortin, 
has also noted, the member for Don Valley West does not watch 
French television, like others, for that matter, who wish to 
impose on it a solution that is perhaps better suited to the 
English network.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois will oppose the loss of CBC French 
television. We have already lost a lot. Like my fellow citizens 
from Rimouski, I have witnessed the closure of three local TV 
broadcasting stations in the lower St. Lawrence in 1990. Acting 
as it did, the CBC French network deprived the region's 
inhabitants of the opportunity for debate, for the exercise of 
democracy.
<P>
	In the coming debates, the government will try to make us 
believe that no decisions have yet been taken. Indeed, they have 
been taken, just not announced, that is the difference. In the 
coming debates, the government will try to make us believe that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10756"> 10756 </A></B>
<P>
it will replace parliamentary votes by new funding sources to be 
suggested by the heritage committee.
<P>
	It is no secret that the member for Don Valley West told ``Le 
Point médias'' that the committee's mandate was to study the 
sex of angels, in other words, to find long term sources of 
funding for the CBC French network, not just for next year or the 
year after.
<P>
	In the coming debates, the government will try to make us 
believe that the committee of three experts that it will soon set 
up to study the complementarity of the mandates of Telefilm, the 
National Film Board, and Radio-Canada as well as of their 
funding might change the situation for Radio-Canada. The 
government will get no one on this side of the House to believe 
such nonsense.
<P>
	The government might attempt to say that cuts were imposed 
on Radio-Canada, but it will convince no one. The impact of the 
$10 million cuts made to Radio-Québec, as difficult as they 
were, has nothing in common with the $60 million cuts made to 
the CBC French network.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	The government may also try to make English-speaking 
Canadians think that we do not care about their national 
television, but that is not true. If we are focusing more on the 
French CBC today, it is mainly because its vice-president has 
announced the effects the forthcoming cuts would have on our 
television.
<P>
	We would not have the presumption to tell English-speaking 
Canadians what their television should be like. As for the 
Reform Party, it will probably say how pleased it is to see that 
the heritage minister is implementing part of its program.
<P>
	Indeed, the Reform Party did propose to reduce the CBC's 
budget by 25 to 30 per cent in the taxpayers' budget it presented 
a few weeks back. This proposal in no way takes into account the 
role public television plays in Quebec and in French Canada nor 
does it meet the expectations of French-speaking Canadians.
<P>
	I will conclude by quoting the French television 
spokespersons who appeared before the CRTC: ``The policy 
proposals that will be drafted in the months to come will focus 
on one major and crucial objective, the promotion and 
preservation of French-Canadians' identity. Our current 
broadcasting system requires its partners to make a lot of room 
for Canadian content, and that has furthered the expression of 
our cultural identity and has contributed to the growth of 
audio-visual production in both our official languages. We 
should not let what we have acquired so far be jeopardized''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to the hon. member's speech. Like 
her, I am a staunch supporter of CBC's French language network 
and of the CBC.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I listened with great sympathy to what the member opposite 
had to say. I am a great supporter of both radio and TV as far as 
the CBC is concerned. That includes Radio Canada 
International. I like the fact that by radio we can reach out not 
only to Canadians of both languages but to all those interested in 
Canada, whether they speak English or French, whether they be 
in the English speaking world abroad or in la francophonie. I am 
a great supporter of that.
<P>
	I like the fact that from coast to coast to coast Radio Canada 
and the CBC are there in both languages. The northern service of 
the CBC is a particularly fine example of what is being talked 
about. It deals with the most remote areas of the country. It spills 
over into Greenland, which is related to Denmark, and into 
Alaska. Our voice is heard in both languages throughout the 
north.
<P>
	It is partly as a result that French is one of the languages used 
in simultaneous translation by the legislature of the NWT in 
Yellowknife. It is one of the eight languages it functions in.
<P>
	As a member from Ontario, from a riding where less than two 
per cent of the population speaks French, the French language 
services are a very special feature of the CBC. In Ontario we 
have La Chaine, a provincially based French language service 
and it has great support throughout the province.
<P>
	The CBC is a billion dollar a year corporation. We know that 
like large government, large corporations have problems. They 
have financial problems. They have organizational problems.
<P>
	Many members here have had experience with the CBC. I am 
told the CBC is top heavy, and in particular is middle heavy. It is 
heavy in the middle management area.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	It has excellent artistic people on air, on camera who write and 
produce things. A great deal of the resources go into middle and 
upper management areas.
<P>
	Does the member not think any billion dollar corporation in 
Canada should be examined from the point of view of its 
efficiency with great detail in these difficult financial times?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question. It goes without saying that we must absolutely 
ensure that-with a budget of one billion dollars-CBC is 
managed efficiently. We must ask ourselves the right questions 
but, more importantly, we must get answers.
<P>
	I sit on the heritage committee and its members almost 
unanimously agree that we are somewhat disturbed by the 
corporation's lack of transparency when it comes to really 
telling us how it is managed. There are many things which we do 
not know about. For example, we do not know the exact cost of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10757"> 10757 </A></B>
<P>
the corporation's head office.  Only recently did we find out how 
much it costs to pay this group of bureaucrats, lawyers, 
secretaries, specialists or experts-whatever you want to call 
them. It costs the corporation $15 million just to appear before 
the CRTC every year. This $15 million is almost money thrown 
out the window since, after all, the CRTC cannot take away 
CBC's licence. The corporation is governed by an act. So these 
positions could be cut.
<P>
	Sure, there are positions which can be cut. But I am concerned 
that these cuts might affect artistic workers or creators. If three 
or four vice-president positions are eliminated, I will not rise in 
this House to question that decision. It goes without saying that 
cuts can be made. The head office is useless, but no one can 
answer that question.
<P>
	Do we still need a large engineering service, at a time when 
the information highway is becoming a reality? Unfortunately, 
we did not take on a leadership role in that regard. There are 
many questions to be asked. However, the problem is the 
situation in which we find ourselves; it is the uncertainty in 
which the minister keeps us. He does not say things the way they 
should be said. Will cuts be made? Yes, they are mentioned in 
the red book. The figure is $679 million, but the government 
continues to claim that it is $44 million. This is the problem.
<P>
	I read an article in which a minister claimed to be a person of 
substance. That must be the case only when he is talking to the 
media, because so far we have no evidence of that when he 
speaks in this House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
find it particularly unfortunate today that the Bloc has chosen to 
bring this issue to the House for a couple of reasons.
<P>
	We have thousands if not tens of thousands of people who 
presently cannot get to work or even if they could get to work do 
not have the materials with which to conduct their jobs. It is 
estimated the strike by the rail workers which the Bloc is 
stopping will cost the economy $3 billion to 5 billion. When the 
Bloc comes to the House to discuss this issue, I find it really 
unfortunate.
<P>
	Speaking specifically to the motion of the Bloc, why is it-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Order. Your question 
should be directed to the previous speaker and her comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Madam Speaker, I was coming to that. Why is 
the Bloc motion dealing only specifically with the issue of 
Quebec? If it is the official opposition, why is its motion not 
more encompassing with respect to the question of CBC?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I made it clear in my speech that I would talk 
specifically about the French-language network of the CBC 
because this is the one I know best and because Mrs. Fortin was 
the only vice president to make her position known. The vice 
president of the English-language network probably never 
thought that there would be cuts because he believed Mr. 
Manera. So he did not do what he had to do and he still does not 
know where to cut in the English network. For her part, Mrs. 
Fortin was ready to adapt to the new situation.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	Since my colleague mentioned the train, I will tell him that if 
the proposals from the official opposition were accepted, we 
could easily resolve the rail strike. If we could have a little bit 
more co-operation than confrontation in this House, the 
problem could be solved in the next three hours.
<P>
	It is fine to debate our respective points of view, but if we 
were to stop arguing for the sake of arguing, we could solve the 
real problems.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a 
great pleasure to rise on behalf of the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage and speak on a motion from the opposition concerning 
significant and continuous support of the CBC by this 
government.
<P>
	Discussions about the CBC cannot be but emotional, 
undoubtedly because the CBC is so dear to Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Each night Canadians tune in to CBC news to keep up to date 
with the new challenges facing the country and the government. 
As Canada's first source of public information and as a source of 
national pride, the CBC is acutely aware of the challenges that 
must be met for Canada to achieve a sustainable level of 
prosperity.
<P>
	The CBC is Canada's largest cultural institution. It is the 
guardian of the Canadian experience. The voices of Canadians 
echo through its history and its archives. For most of this 
century Canadians have sought their reflection, which they 
found in the CBC.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Since it was founded in 1937 by the then Liberal 
government,the CBC has been the main instrument of the 
Canadian broadcasting policy. As a true reflection of our 
country's growth, the CBC has adjusted to the new realities with 
the passing decades.
<P>
	Reflecting the Canadian situation at the time, the 1968 
Broadcasting Act conferred a far-reaching mandate to the CBC: 
to broadcast everything, in fact, so as to please everybody. This 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10758"> 10758 </A></B>
<P>
mandate was quite appropriate in 1968, since the CBC, 
particularly the CBC television network, was the only service 
many Canadians had access to in a world where broadcasting 
was still made through waves.
<P>
	Nowadays, the conditions are drastically different. Apart 
from technological progress, among them the multichannel 
broadcasting, Canada can now rely on dynamic and innovative 
private producers. This means that the CBC does not have to 
produce all its own programs, particularly its entertainment 
programs. Thus, the CBC now buys about 46 per cent of its 
English-speaking and French-speaking programs from 
independent Canadian producers. These programs complete its 
in-house programming.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In recent years the CBC has been focusing increasingly on 
bringing Canadian programming to Canadians. To counter the 
dominance of U.S. mass culture, the CBC's primary concern has 
been to attract large audiences to Canadian programming. That 
is just what the CBC has been doing.
<P>
	Witness the success of CBC productions like ``Road to 
Avonlea'', ``La Petite Vie'', ``North of 60'' and ``Scoop'', to 
name only a few. CBC programming, especially in drama, has 
achieved excellence over and over again.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The problems and challenges of the French language network 
are not those of the English-language network. Indeed, the 
French-language market is more limited and concentrated than 
the English-speaking market. This creates conditions and an 
industrial structure that are quite different than in English 
Canada. This government recognizes that these two different 
situations call for different policies.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	The French network of the CBC has done an excellent job in 
Quebec, where it is very important to French-speaking viewers. 
The province has its own star system and many artists from 
Quebec are well known in all French-speaking households. The 
network has been a useful springboard for French-speaking 
artists and has contributed to the creation of a strong 
Franco-Canadian identity.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Not since the advent of television has the CBC been asked to 
accelerate its evolution to the extent that technology and 
finances are demanding today.
<P>
	However the public must never be the missing link in the 
CBC's evolution. Last fall the public joined the Standing 
Committee on Canadian Heritage in its journey toward a new 
future for the CBC that will be more than brave new words. It 
will be a future that will ensure the survival of the fittest source 
of Canadian content, the CBC.
<P>
	The road to CBC's success was paved with new definitions, 
new ideas and new ways of dealing with the realities of the time. 
The most recent exercise of this kind dates back to 1991 when 
one of the elements of the CBC's mandate was reaffirmed: ``to 
contribute to a shared national consciousness and identity''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The funding provided to the CBC accounts for more than 60 
per cent of the total federal funding provided to cultural 
organizations under the Department of Canadian Heritage. The 
CBC could be compared to an orchestra that provides a 
showcase for all the cultural instruments.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The CBC has allowed the community of Canadians to develop 
regionally and nationally while always being in tune with each 
other's concerns. The CBC can legitimately take credit for being 
the link that allowed the far flung communities of the second 
largest territory on earth to define themselves as Canadians. The 
CBC is the lenscrafter of Canada's vision of itself and the world. 
It magnifies our cultural sovereignty and helps us see our way 
clearly through many challenges ahead.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Minister of Canadian Heritage thinks that the present 
context, characterized by all these challenges and changes, 
gives us an opportunity to re-evaluate the role that public 
broadcasting plays and must continue to play, given the 
increasing globalization and the existing social and economic 
situation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The epicentre of the first tremor of challenge can be found in 
the realm of technology. Consider the multiplication of 
television channels which is already considerable and which 
satellite and digital compression are about to render 
astronomical.
<P>
	One may ask what purpose public broadcasting serves when 
services and choice proliferate and the line between public and 
private television, once clearly defined, seems to be blurring. 
The response to that challenge is that the role of the public 
broadcaster has never been greater, nor the need for it more 
urgent.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	These multiple choices, coming for the most part from outside 
Canada, will be dictated essentially by the logic of commercial 
television, which is different from that of public broadcasting.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10759"> 10759 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	If public television is to survive it is in its best interest to 
flaunt the characteristics that distinguish it from commercial 
television. It is by firming its difference that public television 
justifies its social values.
<P>
	Public broadcasting cannot be guided solely by commercial 
considerations in so far as it has quite a different mission to bear 
witness to society's progress to affirm our national identity. The 
true mission and values of the CBC form the source of its appeal 
to many Canadians.
<P>
	Public broadcasting is an instrument designed to democratize 
culture and information and showcase the Canadian 
contribution on the world stage. That is the public service in 
public broadcasting and one important reason why it should not 
be sacrificed entirely to the demands of commercial advertising.
<P>
	We understand that as a public corporation facing low tide 
fiscally, the CBC needs to launch itself as a cultural vessel 
custom built for these leaner times. We are confident that CBC 
management will be able to navigate through uncharted waters 
ahead.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	In the 1995 budget funding for the CBC was set at 4 per cent 
below previously scheduled levels. This will amount to a 
savings of $44 million for the coming year.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As the opposition speculates about the contents of the 1996 
budget, the Minister of Canadian Heritage has been hard at work 
laying the foundations for a stronger CBC.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We already know that important changes are taking place 
within the broadcasting industry. Fundamental changes beyond 
budget reductions and advances in technology leading toward 
greater diversity are expected to translate into more 
competition, fragmented audiences, a major investment in 
technology and potentially higher costs for Canadian 
programming.
<P>
	In television the advent of digital video compression will 
make direct broadcast satellite distribution possible and 
increased capacity for cable undertakings will make the 
500-channel universe a reality.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The government must ensure that the private and public 
Canadian broadcasting system is ready to compete at the 
national and international level, on the information highway and 
in all the mega-networks of the future.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The review by the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage 
of the role of the CBC combined with the other supporting 
initiatives of the government, the information highway advisory 
council, the examination of the direct home satellite issue, the 
mandate review of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the 
National Film Board and Téléfilm represent the comprehensive 
integrated  approach that will result in sound government policy 
which will take Canada and Canadian cultural products 
successfully into the information age. The approach will allow 
Canadian broadcasting and Canadian culture both English and 
French to thrive.
<P>
	As the opposition speculates about the contents of the 1996 
budget the Minister of Canadian Heritage has been hard at work 
laying the foundation for a stronger CBC.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	According to the Bloc Quebecois, it is a threat that can only be 
eliminated by the publication of speculative projections for the 
next two years.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member's motion refers to some ominous threat 
looming over the CBC's French language network. The motion 
wrongly attributes this threat to a decision of the government to 
publish only the precise funding level of the CBC for the coming 
fiscal year.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	By speculating on the possible number of people that will 
have to be laid off by the CBC, the opposition does nothing to 
help the cause of our public broadcasting system and adds to the 
climate of uncertainty felt by employees affected by the cuts.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to end on a curious note. It seems strange to me 
that the entire basis of the motion is the hon. member's concern 
over the contents of the 1996-97 federal budget which should 
only matter to her after the separatists lose the referendum. Her 
heated comments are evidence of a referendum campaign gone 
stone cold.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
parliamentary secretary indicated that the CBC should be the 
body involved in defining our identity as Canadians.
<P>
	I have heard that point before in the House from members 
opposite. I have had no calls from my constituents asking for 
anyone to define them as Canadians. I have heard of no calls 
from my colleagues' constituents to help them define 
themselves as Canadians. I certainly feel no need personally to 
have anyone define me as a Canadian. I am a Canadian and I am 
happy and proud to be one. I do not need anyone to define what a 
Canadian should be.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	Has the hon. member had calls from her constituents for a 
definition of Canadians? Maybe the hon. member could refer to 
letters and petitions she may have received as well as calls about 
the definition of Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10760"> 10760 </A></B>
<P>
	Furthermore, does the member feel that the CBC, a crown 
corporation, would be the body her constituents would go to 
for a definition of what a Canadian is? Going to a government 
organization to get a definition of what we should be as 
Canadians sounds a little strange to me. I would like the hon. 
member to respond to those questions.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Guarnieri:</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member asked me 
if I have had discussions with my constituents about the CBC in 
recent days. If that is the benchmark the hon. member uses 
simply to gauge the importance of the CBC, then there is a 
serious omission, if he will forgive me, in the hon. member's 
education.
<P>
	Yes, I have had numerous discussions with my constituents 
about the CBC. It has been a topic of conversation recently and it 
has certainly been highlighted in the press. The Reform Party's 
view of the CBC is really the same view the Spanish trawler has 
of the last turbot. The Reform fantasy budget would fish the 
CBC into extinction. The Liberal approach offers the 
opportunity for the CBC to grow and thrive in a new age of 
broadcasting.
<P>
	One reason the Liberal budget has been so well received by so 
many people throughout the country is that they understand our 
cuts are not based on some ideological vendetta against cultural 
communities. They are based on necessity and not on the type of 
philistine intolerance shown by the Reform Party of our cultural 
programs. Our budget is driven by a genuine necessity of 
concern for the programs that Liberals have built and Liberals 
will continue to build in the next century.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> Madam Speaker, I listened attentively to my 
hon. colleague, whom I know very well for we have been 
working together since the beginning on the heritage committee. 
But I do feel there are limits to trying to mislead people. Truly, 
this government seems to be affected by the untruth syndrome. 
There is no more serum left to cure it because they have 
exhausted all the supplies available, for they have failed all the 
tests they underwent throughout their existence.
<P>
	We are not speculating about the number of positions that will 
be cut, we are taking the word of the vice-president on it. That is 
not speculation. We are not only concerned about what will 
happen, but also sick and tired of hearing the minister telling us 
lies in the House, not telling us the truth and misleading us from 
start to finish. People are fed up. That has to stop. We need the 
real figures because it is imperative for both the francophone 
and the anglophone networks to know exactly where they are 
going in order for the CBC to really evolve.
<P>
	The hon. member stated that the minister, instead of 
speculating about the years ahead, is laying down the 
foundations of the CBC. Foundations my eye. He is destroying 
those foundations. He is not building them up, but demolishing 
them. So, Madam Speaker, what is the  hon. member waiting for 
to wake up within her government, before there is no more 
public television left? Everybody knows public television 
comes with a price tag. Every decent, self-respecting country 
has a public television network, and that does not prevent 
private television from existing beside it. We are not asking for a 
status quo regarding the CBC's finances. We know there is some 
clean-up to be done. But we are asking the government to stop 
making these deep cuts and preventing the president of the CBC 
from getting the corporation back on its feet, on the right track.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	What is the hon. member waiting for to stand up-she is the 
parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage-and to wake her minister up so that he will stop 
destroying this essential cultural tool?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Guarnieri:</B> I fully agree with the hon. member there are 
limits to misleading people. The motion she just submitted 
misleads the Canadian public. I think the president of the CBC 
showed at a sitting of the committee she attended that he 
understood fiscal realities much better that the official 
opposition does.
<P>
	I would like to remind her of what Mr. Manera, former 
president of the CBC, told us. I will find the quotation because I 
want you to hear the very wise remarks he made. Here is what he 
told us: ``Mr. Chairman, we of the CBC, acknowledge that the 
financial situation facing the country is indeed serious and we 
certainly cannot escape, nor should we intend to escape, the 
austerity measures that have to be taken in order to bring our 
finances in order''.
<P>
	As you can see, the former CBC president had a realistic point 
of view. It is quite clear that, as a government, we will 
reexamine the role of the CBC, and the standing committee, 
three members of that committee and the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage all work very hard on this. I hope the hon. member will 
be patient enough to wait for the advice of a committee she sits 
on. Future budgets will provide the CBC with the resources it 
needs to carry out its redesigned role.
<P>
	We know what our commitments are. I want to give 
assurances of that to the hon. member, and I think it is about time 
that the Bloc woke up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ.):</B> Madam Speaker, when 
the parliamentary secretary refers to her committee, I hope she 
is kidding. There are two distinct components in the CBC, the 
French network and the English network, but the committee 
which she is a part of comprises a majority of English-speaking 
people, who are Liberal on top of that. It is therefore pretty 
difficult to get parity.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10761"> 10761 </A></B>
<P>
	It is like putting Dracula in charge of a blood bank. Would 
she please explain to us how she intends to be fair in this 
committee, where anglophones form the majority, so that the 
interests of the francophones in the CBC are defended?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Guarnieri:</B> Madam Speaker, I wonder what the member 
is trying to make me believe. Does he want me to believe that the 
Bloc members are wasting their time in the committees? 
Personally, I have a lot of respect for the work of the members of 
the committee. I do not think we have wasted our time. We will 
reflect on this and recommendations will be presented at the end 
of the process for the minister's consideration.
<P>
	I find the Bloc's interest in the CBC ironic and I often wonder 
what lies behind this passionate interest in an entirely Canadian 
cultural institution. Why does the Bloc reject the country which 
has created an institution it admires?
<P>
<B>(1110 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hugh Hanrahan (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the Reform members will be splitting their 
time today.
<P>
	It gives me great pleasure to rise today to discuss this motion 
which has been put forward by my hon. colleague from the Bloc 
Quebecois.
<P>
	It is important to note that it seems a little particular that we 
are debating this issue in the House when this exact issue is 
before the heritage committee. We as a committee have been 
reviewing the CBC for quite some time, focusing primarily on 
the issue of the role of the CBC in a 500 channel universe.
<P>
	When the committee began this endeavour in September of 
last year, our mandate also included how to fund the CBC and 
report to the finance minister with recommendations for 
budgetary cuts in this year's budget. That timetable was 
postponed. We then set a new tentative date to conclude and 
make our recommendations to the House as a whole by the 
beginning of March. It is obvious the committee did not meet 
that timetable.
<P>
	Presently we are still reviewing the CBC. No action plan or 
recommendations are in place. Therefore perhaps it is 
appropriate that the Bloc has introduced this motion to debate 
this issue on the CBC.
<P>
	It is also abundantly clear to me and to most Canadians that 
this government is unwilling to deal with the fundamental issues 
such as the CBC and its financing. Since our arrival in Ottawa 
this government has introduced discussion paper after 
discussion paper while ignoring the pleas of Canadians for 
action.
<P>
	If we look at the Liberals' latest budget, we see they have 
begun to sing from the same songbook as the Reform Party. 
Canada's national debt and deficit have moved from the back 
burner to the mid-range burner. These notorious tax and spend 
Liberals are beginning to  see the flaws in such a policy, yet they 
are still attempting to hold onto all government entrenched 
programs through an ever decreasing amount of resources.
<P>
	The fact is however that Canada does not have a revenue 
problem but a spending problem. This spending problem is 
perpetuated by the fact that the federal government continually 
spends billions of dollars on programs that could be done by the 
private sector at no cost to the taxpayer. This would ensure that 
the necessary funding would be available for priority 
departments such as health, education, defence and veterans 
affairs.
<P>
	In terms of privatization, this government has taken a step in 
the right direction, however it has not gone far enough. Every 
ministry has one or more areas in which the government is 
providing a service which is in competition with the private 
sector or could be done more effectively by the private sector.
<P>
	We as a government must balance our books which means all 
areas of public financing must be evaluated for efficiency, cost 
and effectiveness. It is for these reasons we are looking at the 
financing of the CBC.
<P>
	The CBC's primary mandate should be the provision of 
distinctive culture specific information and drama 
programming. In an increasing multichannel environment the 
current mandate to provide a wide range of programming that 
informs, enlightens and entertains is too broad.
<P>
	It is also clear that the mandate of the CBC is to provide 
Canadians with predominantly Canadian programming. What 
Canadians are being subjected to is extremely questionable in 
terms of meeting this prescribed mandate.
<P>
<B>(1115 ) </B>
<P>
	The issue is no longer whether the CBC has adequate funding. 
That has passed long ago. Rather, it is the structure of the CBC. 
In particular, the CBC has not adjusted to the realities of the 
marketplace. It is outdated, highly centralized and expensive.
<P>
	We must constantly remind ourselves that the Canadian 
broadcasting environment has changed radically since the 
original conception of the CBC.
<P>
	New technologies and new services change viewing tastes and 
fundamental changes in advertising behaviours have 
transformed the broadcasting environment. Do not forget that in 
a world where the CBC is no longer the only national service, 
does it make sense to use scarce public funds to subsidize the 
provision of commercial television programming?
<P>
	In this new world of broadcasting, consisting of many more 
options to television viewers, public broadcasting cannot 
effectively maintain the objective that it is all things to all 
people.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10762"> 10762 </A></B>
<P>
	It is therefore essential for survival in this multichannel 
universe that the public broadcaster be willing to reinvent 
itself. It is quite evident the corporation is unwilling to do that.
<P>
	The president and the former president of the CBC stated 
revenues were not their mission. We must therefore as 
parliamentarians address this area for them. Since revenues are 
not the mission of the CBC, what is?
<P>
	How can a private company such as CTV make revenues its 
mission while still adhering to Canadian content regulations? 
CTV last year spent $488 million while the CBC spent $561 
million on Canadian content programming. This is not a huge 
difference considering we spent over $1 billion for the operation 
of the CBC and nothing on CTV.
<P>
	CTV spends close to the same as CBC on Canadian 
productions. The difference is that one is government owned and 
one is privately owned. One is a drain on the public purse, the 
other adds to the public coffers through taxation of profits.
<P>
	Had this government privatized the CBC it could have saved 
the taxpayer approximately $800 million and this number does 
not include revenues that would have been generated from the 
sale of approximately $1.5 billion in assets, which the CBC 
currently holds.
<P>
	The sceptics will rise and say that if we privatize the CBC, 
Canadian culture will perish, Canadian culture cannot survive 
without government intervention. Surely they jest. Canadians 
are extremely talented. They produce, write, paint, create. They 
do this not because the government says it is okay, but rather 
because they want to create. The fruits of their labour will sell if 
it is quality, and it will not if it is not.
<P>
	Art and culture should be created not because government 
thinks it is so, but because the artist wants to do it. The more 
government gets involved, the more things seem to go awry.
<P>
	I would like to make a comparison between the privatization 
of Air Canada, Petro-Canada and the possibility of similar 
action being taken with regard to the CBC but I see my time is 
running out.
<P>
	I would like to amend the motion of the Bloc. I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word ``years''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1120 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, if I 
understood the main thrust of the hon. member's comments, he 
certainly encourages the government to privatize the CBC.
<P>
	I noticed in the Reform fantasy budget it mentioned cutbacks 
of some $360 million. I wonder if the hon. member could 
delineate what the Reform game plan would be for the CBC.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanrahan:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for the 
opportunity to deal with the question.
<P>
	What I would recommend very clearly is that we look at a 
number of possible options with respect to the privatization of 
the CBC. The first option would be an outright sale to the 
highest bidder.
<P>
	While I recognize the beginning of a trend to cut the CBC's 
budget, what concerns me is that we are going to continue to cut 
the CBC and have it die the death of a thousand cuts. There will 
be nothing left at the end of it. If it is going to be viable, saleable, 
I recommend we sell it while it still has strength.
<P>
	Another possibly would be a simple public share issue which 
would divest the government of the entire company. A third 
option, although I do not particularly favour it over the other 
two, is mixed ownership involving public and private investors, 
as we have done with other companies.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, in addressing the motion on funding for the CBC 
brought forward by our honourable Bloc colleague, it is passing 
strange that this motion on a supply day should take place when 
we have almost a national crisis on our hands with the rail strike. 
I do not see how talking about the CBC is of any import 
alongside that problem. Nevertheless, here we are faced with it 
today.
<P>
	I will paraphrase the hon. member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata when she addressed a Reform motion 
on the CBC last June. She said although the Reform Party may 
disagree emphatically with the way certain situations are dealt 
with at the CBC, it does not support the motion presented by the 
Bloc member for Rimouski-Témiscouata.
<P>
	If we look at the history of the CBC we see it was the genesis 
of the Aird commission in 1929, although it did not officially 
become the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation until 
Mackenzie King's Liberals rewrote the Broadcasting Act in 
1936. The last revision of the Broadcasting Act came in 1991 
under Brian Mulroney's Tories.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	However, over that time the mandate of both French and 
English CBC has remained relatively unchanged. Is it possible 
for a mandate nearly 60 years old to still be valid, particularly in 
an age of technological change such as we have now?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10763"> 10763 </A></B>
<P>
	The forerunner of the CBC, the Canadian Radio Broadcasting 
Commission, suffered from underfunding, an uncertain mandate 
and inappropriate administrative arrangements. The same is 
true in part of the CBC today.
<P>
	If we look at these problems separately, we must first address 
the issue of underfunding. We know Canadian taxpayers cannot 
afford to increase the roughly $1 billion in subsidies the CBC 
already enjoys. The Liberals' answer was to pass legislation for 
the CBC to borrow money. This is certainly not the answer, as it 
only increases Canada's already enormous debt load.
<P>
	The Liberals have also considered taxes on things like video 
rentals and movie tickets to fund the CBC. This is also 
unacceptable, as Canadians are already overtaxed. Therefore the 
only solution would appear to be privatization to allow the 
corporation to become competitive and raise funds through the 
private sector by means such as increased advertising. There is 
no reason the CBC does not have the capacity to compete 
commercially.
<P>
	The second problem of an uncertain mandate can best be 
illustrated by looking at how Canadian politicians view the role 
of the CBC. Last June in the House the Prime Minister said: 
``The law says in defining the mandate of the CBC that it must 
inform people on the advantages Canada represents. This is the 
reason for the creation of the corporation''.
<P>
	One day later on CBC radio the Deputy Prime Minister stated 
the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation has a responsibility to 
acknowledge that one of its responsibilities is to promote 
Canadian unity.
<P>
	Neither of these interpretations reflects the reality of the CBC 
mandate which is to provide a wide range of programming that 
informs, enlightens and entertains, and to reflect Canada and its 
regions to national and regional audiences while serving the 
special needs of those regions.
<P>
	While this example points to part of the problem with the 
uncertainty with the CBC's mandate, it also illustrates the way a 
public broadcasting service can become politicized and even 
manipulated by its political masters. I believe privatization 
could address this problem as market forces would quickly force 
the CBC to find its niche while still promoting Canadian culture. 
It would also remove the potential for political interference.
<P>
	The final problem that existed with the CRBC 60 years ago 
and is still relevant for today's CBC is inappropriate 
administrative arrangements. The CBC receives more than $1 
billion in taxpayers' money to operate yet still has a deficit of 
$45 million in its operating budget. In the last year about 2,000 
jobs have been cut at the CBC in an effort to become more 
competitive. Despite these drastic cuts to the staffing budget, 
CBC's deficit continues to grow. There is simply no incentive at 
the administrative level to ensure a healthy bottom line.
<P>
	Privatization appears to be the only acceptable method of 
dragging the mother corp into the fiscal realities of the 1990s 
and beyond.
<P>
	Let us look specifically at the CBC French operations of 
Radio-Canada. A recent news report suggests that up to 750 of 
the 2,500 employees at SRC may be cut as a result of funding 
cuts. The vice-president of French television, Michèle Fortin, 
admitted in the same article: ``Those who will suffer most from 
probable cuts are not viewers. We can supply to the public 
programs of the same quality and content if we purchase them 
from private producers or other networks''.
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	If that is truly the case, and we have no reason to doubt Mr. 
Fortin, then what is this ominous threat looming over the CBC's 
French language network which my hon. Bloc colleagues are so 
concerned about?
<P>
	We should also look at an independent survey conducted by 
the CROP polling firm in October of last year. In that survey, 
French speaking Quebecers stated that the quality of 
programming on privately operated TVA was equal to that of 
government funded Radio-Canada. In fact, in all areas the 
respondents rated the two stations equal.
<P>
	However, when asked if: ``Because Radio-Canada is 
subsidized and the other networks are not, that creates unfair 
competition'', 56 per cent of French speaking Quebecers agreed 
while only 39 per cent said no.
<P>
	Similarly, when French speaking Quebecers, many of whom 
we might presume are Bloc supporters, were asked if 
Radio-Canada's public funding should be cut because of the 
federal government's deficit problems, 55 per cent said yes 
while only 37 per cent disagreed. They are roughly the same 
percentages.
<P>
	The same arguments I presented for the privatization of 
English language CBC are relevant to French CBC. The only 
way to ensure a viable Radio-Canada into the 21st century is to 
make the operation responsive to market forces and to take 
advantage of modern satellite technology.
<P>
	For example, CBUF-FM, the CBC's French language FM 
radio station in Vancouver, has a staff of 25 and an annual budget 
of $2.2 million. Its average audience in any given quarter hour 
over its entire broadcast area is 100 people. That is according to 
the Bureau of Broadcast Measurement.
<P>
	The same is true of Edmonton's French language station 
CHFA which has a staff of 32 and an annual budget of $2.4 
million. Again, according to BBM figures, the station is 
fortunate if its audience tops 600.
<P>
	In just these two examples we see how $4.6 million in tax 
dollars are being spent to service 700 people. That is almost 
$6,600 per listener. This is not very efficient.
<P>
	If these services were privatized and forced to depend on local 
advertising it is quite likely they would be forced to close. 
However, with the advent of modern satellite  technology it is 
quite possible to maintain a small staff of reporters in both 
markets that would provide local stories and features via satel-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10764"> 10764 </A></B>
<P>
lite to be included in regional and national programming. This 
would not only save taxpayers millions of dollars but would also 
allow Radio-Canada to fulfil its mandate and get out to the 
people of a minority language where it is needed.
<P>
	The time for bleeding heart motions such as the one before us 
today is over. We must address today's situations based on 
today's realities, not some teary eyed, romanticized vision 
based on the way we did things in the good old days. Times have 
changed.
<P>
	Today's fiscal realities will undoubtedly mean restraint and 
government downsizing. However, tomorrow's technology 
means we have an opportunity to provide government services 
and information in ways politicians of even 15 years ago never 
dreamed.
<P>
	For this reason I urge the House to vote against this 
near-sighted motion of yesteryear and leap into the 21st century 
by listening closely to the ideas my Reform colleagues and I 
have and will present during the course of the debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened to the member's 
remarks and I share a different view of the CBC. The Liberal 
Party founded the CBC in 1934. I have always believed that it 
was one of the great instruments that held the country together.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	I believe also that in remote regions of our country where the 
private sector would not necessarily make the investment and 
take the risk, that the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation is 
there to make sure that every part of the country is 
interconnected and we can all feel as one.
<P>
	A lot of things have been developed in Canada that have 
defied economic logic or to use business terms, earnings per 
share per quarter. We are not running a business here. We are 
building a nation. The criteria that one uses when building a 
nation and developing a set of values and a character for a nation 
are totally different from the value system used when running or 
building a business.
<P>
	I would like to think that the Canadian Broadcasting 
Corporation is something that should be looked at in terms of 
building a nation and not just as a stand alone profit centre.
<P>
	I regret that the Minister of Finance and the government have 
had to make the cuts in the budget to the CBC. Many people at 
the CBC are constituents of mine. I spent many a long hour 
having a glass of cranberry juice with Larry Zolf on the Danforth 
where he would reminisce about the contributions various 
artists have made and how some have grown through their 
exposure on the CBC. Right now all of these things are being 
jeopardized because the international bond  markets, the people 
who control the real flow of capital, are holding the gun to our 
brain. I regret that and I know most members do.
<P>
	Can the member not see that perhaps when we get our fiscal 
house in a little better order over the next few years that as a 
galvanizing agent we would go a long way to find something 
better? Would he not then, once our fiscal house is in better 
order, see that the CBC is something we should reinvigorate and 
make sure that it continues to build on that long history of 
pulling the country together?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> In response, Madam Speaker, I have to say first 
that we have a long road ahead of us before we get our fiscal 
house in order.
<P>
	We are well aware of the situation. We are still $560 billion in 
debt. The deficit reduction program introduced in the latest 
budget is inadequate to cope with the situation. We are paying 
more and ever more money into servicing that debt. In two to 
three years time with the Minister of Finance rolling the moving 
target, we are still going to be in deep trouble if in fact we have 
not hit the wall before then.
<P>
	I have to negate the argument ``in time''. I do not know when 
that time is going to come.
<P>
	My second point in response would be that essentially the 
hon. member is living in the past. I concede that the CBC in 
times gone by has furnished part of the glue that has held the 
country together.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Order. I am sorry, the 
hon. member's time has expired.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to second the motion presented by my colleague, the 
member for Rimouski-Témiscouata. The motion reads as 
follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the House condemn the government for the refusal by the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage to publish the government's decisions concerning funding 
for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) for the next three years, thus 
causing an ominous threat to loom over the CBC's French language network.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	First, I will give a brief background. Then, I will describe the 
present situation and analyze its impact on the French-speaking 
community of Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	Before starting, however, I would like to point out that, unlike 
the government, I will use both terms, that is SRC and CBC, to 
refer to the two sectors of our public television instead of SRC in 
the French version of documents and CBC in the English 
version. For greater clarity, the term SRC will refer only to the 
French network and the term CBC, to the English network. You 
will see later the importance of this distinction.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10765"> 10765 </A></B>
<P>
	Under the precedent Conservative regime, many cuts were 
made. In 1990, certain services were abolished, 1,100 jobs were 
cut, three local television stations were closed, eight stations 
were transformed into information production offices. These 
cuts resulted in savings of $108 million.
<P>
	These measures were vigorously denounced by the Liberals. 
The famous red book put it this way: ``Funding cuts to the 
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the Canada Council, the 
National Film Board, Telefilm Canada, and other institutions 
illustrate the Tories' failure to appreciate the importance of 
cultural and industrial development''. Those are the words of 
the Liberals in their red book.
<P>
	And it went on: ``A Liberal government will be committed to 
stable multiyear financing for national cultural institutions such 
as the Canada Council and the CBC. This will allow national 
cultural institutions to plan effectively''. It would be difficult to 
find better intentions concerning culture and the SRC.
<P>
	What is the situation today, following the tabling of the 
budget in February? On that famous day, February 27, 1995, we 
learned the extent of the budget cuts which would affect the 
Department of Canadian Heritage. We learned that this 
department's budget would be cut by $676 million over the next 
three years, in other words, 23 per cent of its global budget.
<P>
	These cuts would affect the budgets of the CBC, Telefilm 
Canada and the National Film Board, which would be reduced 
by 4, 4 and 5 per cent respectively. In the case of the CBC, 
depending on how you understand the figures, it means a 
minimum cut of $44 million for the 1995-96 fiscal year. 
Furthermore, the day after the budget, the government decided 
to transfer Radio Canada International to the CBC and that 
accounted for an additional amount of approximately $12 
million.
<P>
	At the same time, the minister announced that the government 
would review thoroughly the terms of reference of the CBC, the 
NFB and Telefilm Canada. The CBC mandate would be 
examined, according to him, within a framework similar to that 
of the study being done by the Standing Committee on Canadian 
Heritage on the role of the CBC in a multichannel environment.
<P>
	We must remember that, before the budget was introduced, 
the CBC already had to support a loss of revenue of $180 million 
because of the cuts previously made by the Tory government and 
a decrease in commercial revenues. The former president, Mr. 
Anthony Manera, was already worried that these cuts could kill 
public television for good.
<P>
	Nevertheless, the Liberal government, in spite of the rhetoric 
of the red book, will not be impressed by so little, and certainly 
not if it is the Minister of Canadian Heritage talking.
<P>
	And the saga goes on. Right after the budget was tabled, on 
February 28, it was announced that Mr. Manera would talk to the 
employees to explain the financial situation of the CBC. The 
explanations remain vague because figures can be seen 
differently by different persons. Yet, everybody agrees that in 
April 1995, the CBC will have to cut between $40 and $50 
million to offset this loss of revenue, also called the structural 
deficit.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	On the same day, Mr. Manera announced his resignation as 
chief executive officer of the CBC, when his mandate was 
supposed to end in February 1999, that is in four years. Talk 
about an early retirement!
<P>
	In support of his decision, Mr. Manera alleged personal 
reasons, which the Minister of Heritage hurried to repeat using 
these words: ``Mr. Manera has resigned for personal reasons; 
everything else has been totally invented''.
<P>
	By ``everything else'', the minister was referring, among 
other things, to the scenario of a $300 million reduction in the 
budgets of the CBC over the next three years. I would recall that, 
on his appointment to his position, in November 1993, Mr. 
Manera had demanded assurances from the minister that no 
huge cuts would be applied to the CBC. At that time, the same 
minister had made a commitment to give the CBC multi-year 
financing. He even went so far as to promise Mr. Manera that 
there would not be any more budget reductions at the CBC. He 
had dared describe himself as a ``friend of the house'', meaning 
the CBC, when he had been appointed as the Minister of 
Heritage. That is too much!
<P>
	We must realize that we are not talking about ancient history 
here. We are talking about November 1993, just 18 months ago. 
We are talking about assurances that were given by a minister to 
one of the most important departments of his government. How 
sad and shameful.
<P>
	Mr. Manera, who seems to have been somewhat more lucid 
than his minister, came back by setting the record straight: it was 
a cut of not only $44 million that the CBC would suffer, but of 
$350 million by 1997-98. The government was getting ready to 
reduce the total budget by 23 per cent over three years. All this 
after the minister had confirmed to his president that there 
would be no more cuts.
<P>
	How did the minister respond to his president's statement? 
First, as I said earlier, he repeated that Mr. Manera had resigned 
for personal reasons. According to the minister, there was no 
relation between this resignation and the budgetary cuts 
announced. He said he knew that Mr. Manera was going to 
resign and that his resignation was for personal reasons. 
Somehow, Mr. Manera made it clear in his speech to the 
employees that he was resigning because of the budget cuts. 
This is quite a lack of communication. This minister is no doubt 
fully proficient in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10766"> 10766 </A></B>
<P>
area of communications. He went on to  say the same thing again 
on March 16 in similar circumstances.
<P>
	In Montreal, the vice-president of the CBC French network, 
Mrs. Michelle Fortin, could already foresee the impact the 
announced cuts would have on the operations of her 
organization. On March 15 and 16, she called a meeting of her 
employees to take stock of the situation. According to her, the 
organization in Montreal would suffer cuts of about $60 million 
and there would be a downsizing of some 750 jobs over the next 
three years.
<P>
	In answer to a question asked in this House in that regard, the 
minister said he knew nothing about the downsizing and tried to 
justify his position by saying that the CBC, his ``official source'' 
of information, had made no official decision. Need we remind 
you that the president and chief executive officer had already 
resigned and declared that he had no intention of presiding over 
the implementation of the new budget.
<P>
	I would like to go back briefly to the minister's statements, in 
the order in which he made them. We saw that when he received 
Mr. Manera's resignation on February 28, the minister said it 
was for personal reasons. The day after, on March 1, he only 
mentioned again the figures contained in the budget. On March 
2, we learned that Mr. Manera recognized he had received from 
the deputy minister of Heritage a secret document outlining the 
scope of the cuts for the three following years. The members of 
this House were treated to blatant nonsense.
<P>
	While the opposition had that document in hand and was 
quoting it, the minister refused to admit that the figures were 
right. According to him, this document is based on assumptions 
which are part of a program review undertaken by another 
minister. All this when we know that the cuts depend on 
Cabinet's decisions. Where was the hon. minister? Is he not a 
member of the Cabinet? It seems that Radio-Canada employees 
and executives are better informed than the minister about the 
situation that is prevailing in this organization. In fact, on March 
18, the <I>Gazette</I> published the information that Mr. Alain Pineau 
of the CBC had announced that the regional stations were 
threatened by the budgeraty cuts.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	For the time being, it is more than appropriate to wonder what 
the minister has to gain by hiding the truth, since evidence 
points in that direction. We also have to wonder if further cuts 
are not going to be announced soon. We have to wonder what 
major initiatives the minister intends to put forward within the 
national television, and what political implications they will 
have.
<P>
	It is interesting to look at the public opinion about these cuts 
in the French network. A recent SOM poll released last week by 
<I>La Presse</I> showed that 60 per cent of respondents want the 
subsidies allocated to the CBC maintained or increased. It seems 
the public can only praise CBC-SRC for the way it does inform 
Canadians and increase their general knowledge. In Quebec, the  
results are even more impressive since one Quebecer out of 
three are opposed to the cuts Radio-Canada is facing.
<P>
	That raises a completely different issue: the gap in the 
audience ratings between Canada and Quebec. Quebecers listen 
a lot to national television whereas only 12 per cent of their 
English-speaking counterparts watch it. This is a big difference 
which should, in theory, have an impact on the subsidies allotted 
the two networks. Up until now, however, viewer ratings were 
not among the criteria used to determine budget allocations. We 
pay more attention to the production costs of the programs, 
which are higher in English Canada than in Quebec. This is a 
vicious circle in which we have been trapped for a long time and 
which has been raising questions for many years.
<P>
	Let us turn to the announcement made by the minister with 
regard to the CBC mandate review. For the French network, this 
announcement raises a lot of concerns. Indeed, we know that 
English Canada is generally not happy with the CBC, as far as its 
cost-quality ratio is concerned. For $1 billion, many people 
think that we could get more for our money. As I said, this vision 
is not shared in Quebec where people are satisfied with the 
performance of Radio-Canada which is reaching, on average, 35 
per cent of the viewers. Once again, we are faced with the 
dilemma of the two solitudes.
<P>
	Once again, these two solitudes have different needs and 
tendencies. Could the government decide it woud be politically 
correct to invest more in the French network, which has good 
ratings, than in the English network that is not very popular? 
Can we imagine that the Canadian federalism could be flexible 
enough to allow for the government to be very generous with the 
French network, while reducing drastically the subsidies 
allotted to the English network? This question has not been 
debated yet. We must also ask ourselves what would be the 
consequences of the budgetary cuts.
<P>
	In his brief to the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage, 
the CBC spokespersons mentioned the possible impact of the 
reduction of its budgets. They said that the CBC would have no 
choice but to put thousands of people out of work. They added 
that their services would have to be drastically reduced and that 
no part of the mandate of the CBC would be left untouched.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance said recently that any important 
reduction of the CBC budget would require a review of its 
current mandate. The citizens, the corporation employees and 
this House have the right to know where the minister and his 
government are going with the CBC. The Canadian public will 
not tolerate any longer the mysteries and the balderdash of the 
minister. Therefore, tell us what to do.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, as I listened to the member 
for Quebec talk about national institutions and our commitment 
to national institutions I did not understand where she was 
coming from. That party is committed to dismantling national 
institutions; that is its whole mission here. Have the Bloc 
members suddenly had some kind of a conversion they have not 
declared in public? Are they trying to figure out a way to 
recommit themselves to Canada by pushing the CBC? I cannot 
figure them out.
<P>
	The member also talked about our commitment to stable, 
multi-year budgets. The member is absolutely right. It does say 
that in the red book.
<P>
	One of the difficulties we have and which all Canadians 
should know is that we are trying to rebuild an economy that was 
literally on its knees. Our recovery is fragile. We are starting to 
get a little steam, but what does the Bloc Quebecois do this 
week? It refuses to let us table our back to work legislation so we 
can get our national transportation system going. This causes a 
ripple effect beyond imagination.
<P>
	For an example I will use a sector that I had some association 
with, the automotive sector. It is not just the assembly plants 
that are brought to their knees, it is all of the small and medium 
size auto parts manufacturers that ship to these plants. The Bloc 
Quebecois right now is hurting the chances for a renewal of this 
country's economy even more so by shutting down our ability to 
rebuild this economy by keeping our transportation system in 
order.
<P>
	The best hope and the best long term chance the CBC in all of 
its facets has in terms of restoring itself to the funding and 
renewed strength we would all like to see is by the Bloc 
members committing themselves to rebuilding the economy of 
all of Canada rather than thinking about their own parochial 
interests. Does the member not see that?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my 
colleague for his questions and remind him of the commitments 
the Liberals made on multi-year financing to allow the 
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to make a balance sheet for 
several years instead of operating on a piecemeal basis, as it is 
the case now.
<P>
	When it sat in the opposition and during the election 
campaign, this government made promises that I do not think it 
can keep now. My colleague seems to be particularly concerned 
about the economic situation and he would like the Bloc to bring 
forward solutions to deal with some economic problems and the 
economic recovery.
<P>
	I have here some figures. For instance, defence spending, 
which amounted to $11 billion, will be cut by 4.97 per cent, the 
budget for the advancement of women will be cut by 30 per cent 
and the budget for culture and communication will be cut by 23 
per cent. Those figures show where the priorities of this 
government are: cutting by 23 per cent the budget for culture, 
which amounted only to $1 billion, and the budget for the 
advancement of women, which amounted only to $10 million, 
while defence spending is only reduced by 4.97 per cent. What 
about your priorities for economic recovery? We wonder.
<P>
	In answer to another question that the hon. member asked 
about the railway problem, the opposition proposed some 
alternatives and I think that if the government had listened to 
them, perhaps we would have reached a decision very quickly.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, since 
its beginnings, la Société Radio-Canada-The French language 
counterpart of the CBC-has been the voice of Canada's 
francophone population and the mirror of our culture.
<P>
	Sociologists will tell you just how closely the birth of the 
Québécois identity is linked to the cultural programming that 
Radio-Canada broadcast into our living rooms. Thanks to 
Radio-Canada, francophones in all parts of Canada have seen 
and recognized themselves. The network has offered shared 
experiences to all and, through its programs, opened up a 
window on the world. In more recent years, Radio-Canada has 
allowed the world to learn about our culture, our way of life, and 
our values.
<P>
	We are all proud of Radio-Canada's achievements. We are 
proud because they are closely linked to the success of our 
broadcasting policy. This policy, which is set out in the 
Broadcasting Act, ensures high calibre programming in French. 
The Act stipulates that ``English and French language 
broadcasting, while sharing common aspects, operate under 
different conditions and may have different requirements''.
<P>
	And in fact, la Société Radio-Canada has managed to give us 
quite unique programming, programming that has been highly 
successful and is even the envy of some on the 
English-language CBC side.
<P>
	Thanks to this broadcasting policy, French-language 
programming obtains unbelievably high audience ratings, year 
after year. Nineteen of the twenty most popular 
French-language shows, and forty-seven of the fifty most 
popular French-language shows are produced in Canada. Yes, 
they are produced in Canada. And these programs are popular 
because they are good, their quality is universally recognized. 
This explains why a series like ``Les filles de Caleb'' has been 
sold in over forty countries.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10768"> 10768 </A></B>
<P>
	Some people will say that this series owes its success to those 
who made it, which is true. We are indeed lucky to be able to 
count on such talented artists. Some of them have had their 
talents recognized abroad and have decided to work there. 
Gifted though they may be, however, not many of them could 
have reached such heights without the help of government 
policies and support to the cultural community.
<P>
	Among the federal institutions which contributed in this way, 
I should mention Telefilm Canada, the National Film Board and 
the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications 
Commission.
<P>
	Not only has Radio-Canada played a leading role in the 
process of cultural affirmation, it has also played an 
incalculable role with regard to linguistic affirmation. As 
explained by the Authors of the report of the Task Force on 
Broadcasting Policy, also known as the Sauvageau-Caplan 
Committee: ``Francophones are well aware of the importance of 
radio and television in strengthening the language. The best 
known example is the sports vocabulary, which was almost 
completely anglicized, even in France. Two Radio-Canada 
announcers, Michel Normandin and René Lecavalier, had to 
develop new terms to describe the games they were announcing 
and the French equivalents they developed were adopted so 
wholeheartedly that competing private broadcasters, print 
media and sports fans gradually began to use them, and they 
eventually became an accepted part of the language.''
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	However, not only do francophones benefit from good quality 
programming, they are also able to receive broadcasting signals 
from a variety of sources. In the first place, there are the 
conventional television services: Télé-Métropole and 
Télévision Quatre Saisons, as well as two French-language 
educational networks: Radio-Québec and TVOntario's La 
Chaîne.
<P>
	In addition to these, there are a number of specialized 
services: Réseau des sports, Météomédia, Canal Famille, TV5, 
Musique Plus and, just recently, Réseau de l'information, RDI. 
This last service addresses a need that had been identified within 
the Canadian broadcasting system. I hasten to add that the Bloc 
Quebecois itself had demanded that such a service be 
established. RDI went on the air January 1, 1995, and since then 
it has been doing an admirable job of covering events in Canada 
and elsewhere.
<P>
	All these services provide a range of programming more 
varied than that available in any other francophone country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Furthermore through TV 5 the federal government has been 
able to ensure that the influence of Canada's francophone 
culture spreads to the four corners of the earth. TV 5 broadcasts 
in Europe, Africa, the United States, Latin America and the 
Caribbean. We anticipate that its signal will soon be picked up in 
Asia. In all these  parts of the world a Canadian traveller staying 
in a place with the necessary receiving equipment will be able to 
watch Bernard Derome and numerous other broadcasts 
produced in Canada.
<P>
	One cannot speak of Radio-Canada without mentioning its 
regional presence, particularly outside Quebec where its 
programming had considerable impact in communities such as 
my own in St. Boniface which until recently had the impression 
that mass media were inevitably anglophone. Collective 
identities in minority communities began to emerge thanks to 
Radio-Canada.
<P>
	There is no doubt that the review of the corporation's mandate 
and the budget cuts the government had to impose will require 
some realignment. However the need for realignment had 
become unavoidable because of the 500-channel universe and 
the information highway.
<P>
	The reality is that we are going through a period when 
certainties will be tested, when change will be the only constant, 
when our creativity will be our chief resource and unfortunately 
when public funds will continue to be in limited supply.
<P>
	This does not mean that we are giving up. We must find 
common solutions to ensure the continued vitality of French 
language culture and to ensure the relevance of our national 
institutions based less on the resources allocated to them and 
more on the imagination we are capable of showing. The 
committee on heritage has already taken steps in this direction. 
We must continue our deliberations and come up with 
innovative solutions.
<P>
	Radio-Canada will measure up to the challenges. It will be 
able to fulfil its present mandate as well as any other mandate 
that it might be given. Its past accomplishments has secured it a 
promising future.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
welcome the opportunity to speak to this motion, which I will do 
from a different perspective. The Bloc was extremely critical of 
the minister's lack of openness this morning because the 
announcement made by Michèle Fortin may seriously handicap 
a powerful instrument for the transmission and production of 
Quebec culture.
<P>
	But first of all, I would like to respond to members who 
wondered why we were defending the Canadian Broadcasting 
Corporation, since it is a federal institution and we want to get 
out of Canada.
<P>
	I would like to read a quote from what Pierre Elliott Trudeau 
said in 1967 in <I>Le fédéralisme et la société canadienne 
française</I>: ``One way of offsetting the appeal of separatism is by 
investing tremendous amounts of time, energy, and money in 
nationalism, at the federal level. A national image must be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10769"> 10769 </A></B>
<P>
created that will have such an appeal as to make any image of a 
separatist group unattractive. Resources must be diverted into 
such things as national flags, anthems, education, arts councils,  
broadcasting corporations, film boards''. This is what Pierre 
Elliott Trudeau wrote in <I>Le fédéralisme et la société canadienne 
française</I>, HMH, 1967.
<P>
	We are defending the CBC's French network, which we feel is 
at risk because of imminent cutbacks, because we are aware that 
despite the mission Pierre Elliott Trudeau wanted to give the 
network, Radio-Canada has been a very important vehicle for 
the transmission and production of Quebec culture, although we 
could have dispensed with some of the bias involved.
<P>
	Altogether, it is part of our living heritage. This is an 
institution that belongs to us, and we want to make sure it will 
not only continue to exist but will be able to improve the quality 
of its productions. In fact, Radio-Canada is the depository of a 
collective resource, a collective instrument that is essential to 
our culture, and the Minister of Canadian Heritage has no right 
to trifle with the future of this powerful collective instrument of 
Quebec culture.
<P>
	I may recall what was said by Gérald Leblanc on tv-it was 
not on Radio-Canada-last Sunday. The following gives some 
idea of the ratings of French television in Quebec compared with 
those of Canadian tv productions in the rest of Canada: ``When 
the Royal Air Farce, an excellent comedy program, reaches one 
million viewers out of a potential 20 million, it celebrates and 
breaks open the champagne. However, every week, 
Radio-Canada and TVA together regularly reach a viewership of 
three million or more out of a potential seven million''.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	He added: ``If we were to obey the dictates of the market, 
Radio-Canada would be affected, cuts would have to be made, 
but the CBC could not survive''. Far be it from me to suggest 
that we should take away the CBC's means to survive. We are 
only too aware of the significance culture holds for the future of 
a people and a nation. We can state forcefully that no people, no 
nation, with the exception of the United States perhaps, can let 
the powerful instrument which creates and conveys its culture 
become hostage to the marketplace.
<P>
	I add that the CBC is the only broadcaster that has strong 
Canadian content during peak hours. All other Canadian 
television networks have a low domestic content, around 20 to 
30 per cent during peak hours, which can seriously affect 
Canadian culture. As for us, we chose this morning to show how 
important Radio-Canada is to the Quebec culture and how much 
we want not only to know what the government is planning but 
also to block its plans to deprive the SRC of its means. We care 
because the goals of the SRC are intrinsic goals, they are the 
collective goals it was created to achieve. That is why we cannot 
afford to let Radio-Canada be deprived of its means.
<P>
	Mrs. Fortin, to whom I listened with great pleasure, was 
defending wholeheartedly in her own energetic way the role of 
this public television network which she compared to public 
schools. We never say that public schools are not profitable and 
must be financed in some other way. Public television has an 
important role to play. At least, it plays an important role in 
Quebec and it can play that role even better. We think that our 
colleagues from English Canada could ponder with us ways of 
strenghtening Canadian culture.
<P>
	Being a francophone in North America can be difficult since 
we represent a little more than 2 per cent of the population and 
we are surrounded, submerged by English language channels. To 
remain a country not only with a distinct border but also with a 
distinct national identity, Canada-which does have its own 
culture, though sometimes it is not easily differentiated from 
that of the United States-must protect its public television.
<P>
	I would like to say a few words about culture. If in fact we 
attach so much importance to public television and to television 
in general, it is because television is, along with other 
audiovisual techniques, the main vehicle of culture nowadays. It 
is not only a vehicle of that culture which exists and which we 
shall try to define, it is also an extremely important forum for 
cultural production.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	When one realizes the public reached by Radio-Canada and 
TVA in Quebec, when one realizes the impact popular programs 
may have on the people, how these programs can strenghten its 
cultural identity, give rise to debate, question actions, attitudes 
and values, one realizes how alive our culture is, nurtured of 
course by our heritage, our history, the arts and all that cultural 
production embraces, but digested and distributed in another 
form, vehicled by the media of our times.
<P>
	In this era of telecommunications, which is still full of 
surprises, it is a means, the most important means of 
distribution, development and production of culture.
<P>
	Figures alone are not enough when we are talking about such 
an important instrument, which defines what people will think 
and are thinking and what affects Canadians' current and future 
desire to live together. This is what nationalism is all about. This 
is why we say that there are two countries within this country. 
We keep seeing it-every day. And what we want is sovereignty, 
because we think it is better for our people.
<P>
	At the same time, we are aware that Canadian culture as well 
warrants clearer definition. It too needs to find expression in a 
world in which it is perhaps more threatened than francophone 
culture, because it shares a common language with the United 
States, which is more than a neighbour; it is the prevailing 
influence of our time. And if, because of this, Canadian minds 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10770"> 10770 </A></B>
<P>
are fed American values, images, references, history, action and 
activities, I would take the liberty of saying that one must draw 
one's own conclusions and take no delight in the  fact that 
English Canadian public television reaches such a small portion 
of the population, quite the contrary.
<P>
	Of course, there are my hon. colleagues beside me who say 
that culture does need the help of the state. I would challenge 
them. The state does not create the cultural product, the artist. 
However, without a way to live, without sufficient means, few 
artists, artistic endeavours and cultural productions would 
survive, particularly in today's world. We must remember, here 
again, that the CBC is in competition with American 
productions, which have 20 times the resources.
<P>
	We have chosen to talk about the CBC because our culture, its 
life and its evolution, depend in part on the continued 
availability of resources. Just as in the past, during the 
Renaissance, people needed patrons, the patrons are now being 
replaced by the state, by states.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	No people, no self-respecting nation can afford not to support 
this great tool which television has become.
<P>
	It must be said that the audiovisual medium requires a lot of 
resources. You and I can make video clips, but to produce 
programs which can compete with other programs coming from 
all over the world, we need resources. Otherwise, all the talents 
available to us will either be under-utilized or not used at all.
<P>
	Culture is what defines a people, a nation. It is its soul. Its way 
of being. It is not static. It implies a knowledge of the past. It 
implies the handing down of the cultural production of previous 
generations. But it also implies a certain intermixing. It implies 
that each generation has to embark on the creative process using 
the same basic tools. But, in the long run, it is culture, this way 
of being, which guarantees that globalization will not reduce all 
cultures to the one with the most resources. This is what is really 
at stake in the present situation when we talk about all these 
numbers.
<P>
	In 1992, in a fantastic speech he made in Montreal, Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali said: ``The sound globalization of modern life 
implies the existence of strong cultural identities, since an 
excessive or ill-conceived globalization could crush various 
cultures and melt them down into a uniform one, which would 
spell nothing good for the world''.
<P>
	He added: ``Individuals need an intermediary between a 
universe too large for them and their solitary status, for the mere 
fact that, at the start, they need a language to understand and 
decipher the outside world. What they need are practical 
alliances and a framework of cultural references, to sum it up, a 
passport to the world''. Television is that passport to the world 
for most young people. That is why it is a national 
responsibility. This passport contributes the most to the creation 
of future societies, because it does not act alone.
<P>
	I digressed a little, but now return to Mr. Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali's speech. ``Nation-states, which transcend the 
physically closer alliances of family, clans or villages, fill these 
needs. A nation has a common reason for existing, which is the 
first step towards the universal, towards a universal civilization. 
An orderly world is a world of independent nations which are 
open to each other and respect each other's differences and 
similarities''. This is what I call the fruitful logic of 
nationalities and universality.
<P>
	To defend the Société Radio-Canada and the CBC, the Bloc 
Quebecois says ``stop''. Culture is the soul of the people, and if 
culture is not given sufficient means, the growth of these little 
people, these small states, will be stunted in a world 
overshadowed by the giant we all know well.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
first of all, I would like to congratulate my hon. colleague for 
Mercier on her excellent, and in a large part spontaneous, 
intervention. It shows how much culture, whether it is Quebec 
culture or Canadian culture, is dear to her heart and how much 
she knows about the fundamentals of its development.
<P>
	I would like my colleague to comment on what I am going to 
say, because my understanding of the present debate on the 
future of the CBC reminds me of other debates we have had on 
the future of Quebec culture and Canadian culture.
<P>
	Just remember the whole copyright issue which is so 
fundamental to the development of Canada and Quebec from a 
cultural point of view. Remember also everything related to the 
information highway where Quebec, because of its different 
language in North America, is not recognized, not invited to 
participate. This is extremely serious. It is also excluded 
because of the centralizing nature of Canada.
<P>
	Another example is what happened with Ginn Publishing, 
where English Canada sacrificed for peanuts a Canadian 
publisher, simply because we are considering ourselves more 
and more as vassals of our American neighbour.
<P>
	This debate on the CBC shows that it is essential to the 
preservation of the future of English Canada, of the English 
Canadian culture. As to the Quebec French speaking culture, we 
are preparing the future so that it will be preserved. I would like 
my colleague to comment on this subject, that is the American 
influence on these issues.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Madam Speaker, that is in fact the underlying 
basis of my remarks. We must not think that, in this world where 
the economy plays such an important role, we cannot afford to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10771"> 10771 </A></B>
<P>
invest in culture. Because culture is the very essence of our 
identity.
<P>
	More than that, very concretely, the cultural industry is the 
main showcase for our cultural talents and products. This 
industry also needs encouragement.
<P>
	The fact that Quebec cannot sign international agreements, 
negotiate its own bilateral contracts or participate in regulatory 
talks, that it is thus often unable to develop direct expertise, that 
it cannot address some problems such as copyright matters, and 
that it cannot continue regional and local production, for 
example, because it cannot afford it and because the resources 
come from Ottawa, all contribute to its erosion, if we continue 
with this comparison.
<P>
	The French, who are the unchallenged champions of culture, 
invest heavily in their culture, their heritage, their television, 
their arts community.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	We could say that they know how important this industry is, 
but they also know how closely it is tied to their place as a 
middle power in the world. They know that culture is the glue 
that makes people want to live together. They know that it is 
extremely important to allocate all the resources and all the 
energy they can to this industry.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.): </B>Madam Speaker, I will preface my comments on the 
motion before us by the following preliminary remarks because 
I want to make myself perfectly clear.
<P>
	First, I have the profound conviction that there is a need in our 
country for a national public broadcaster. I am convinced that 
this broadcaster is essential to our cohesion and the 
development of our culture, as both francophones and 
anglophones. After listening to a fair number of my colleagues 
opposite, I am happy to see that they support the position I have 
always defended. Inasmuch as they continue to support this 
position I just heard our colleague mention, I am very pleased 
with their contribution. We are working together to ensure that 
Radio-Canada remains a large corporation and continues to 
contribute to the development of the francophone culture in 
Quebec and elsewhere in Canada.
<P>
	My second introductory observation concerns the 
relationship between the government and Radio-Canada. I think 
that there is no ambiguity there either. There has been much talk 
about this issue. The government, and the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage in particular, always made it clear that we respect 
Radio-Canada's autonomy, as essential to this great institution 
but also to freedom of press, which we wholeheartedly support.
<P>
	So, what is the government's involvement? Well, 
Radio-Canada belongs to all Canadians and the government is 
responsible to ensure that this public property is managed 
properly and well run. That responsibility takes a specific form 
with budgeting, in so far as budgetary appropriations are part of 
CBC's budget, and I will get back to this, and with appointments 
to the board of directors and, of course, to the executive level of 
the corporation.
<P>
	The government can express opinions, as I just did, on general 
issues related to CBC's position in the world of 
communications. We can express such opinions. We state our 
general policy, so that CBC's managers can develop their plans 
and their management strategy in compliance with the federal 
government's vision and main policies.
<P>
	The third point is that the review and the decisions made 
concerning CBC are part of a larger initiative, namely the 
development of what is called the information highway. The 
information highway will, of course, provide information, but it 
will also contain numerous and significant cultural elements. 
There is no ambiguity here. As spokesman of the Canadian 
government, I keep saying that we hope that Canadian content 
will be prevalent on that information highway. As I said earlier, 
and opposition members support that position, it is important 
that the information highway helps promote Canadian culture, 
which includes the French-speaking Canadian and Quebec 
culture.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	What should we do now? There are three basic institutions 
which belong to Canada and which can help create this Canadian 
content. The largest one of is CBC, of course, but there are also 
the National Film Board and Telefilm Canada. These agencies 
are in the sound and picture business and, to be sure, very 
important decisions will be made this year, in 1995, regarding 
the creation of sound and pictures by Canadian producers.
<P>
	Numerous studies commissioned by the Minister of Industry 
and myself are currently being conducted regarding this issue. 
There is a reference to the CRTC, an advisory committee on the 
information highway, as well as several other committees at 
work. All this will lead us to make fundamental decisions a little 
later on this year, when the consultation process will have 
brought together all the elements we need to elaborate our 
policies, the architecture of the information highway and the 
traffic regulations for this highway.
<P>
	I think it is important to say these things, because it is within 
this context that the CBC and the two other agencies I mentioned 
must make their contribution. It is only natural to address this 
issue and to consider the way the CBC will be able to play its 
part.
<P>
	This brings me to the decisions announced in the Budget 
which will especially affect the CBC. There are three of them. 
Nothing complicated, only three decisions. First, the 
government will undertake a fundamental review of its support, 
and the mandates of, the three agencies I mentioned.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10772"> 10772 </A></B>
<P>
	Of course, the object of this review is to ensure that these 
three agencies are in the best position possible to play their 
roles on the information highway. When I talk about the 
mandates of these agencies, I use the expression in the large 
sense. I do not mean only a sentence in a piece of legislation. 
I think it would be wise, while we are examining all our 
communications, to review this particular aspect of the 
mandates. This was the first decision that was announced. I will 
have the pleasure, very soon, to announce the members of the 
group that will carry out this review and the very specific terms 
of their mandate.
<P>
	The second decision announced in the budget was the transfer 
of Radio Canada International back to the CBC. This decision 
was made because it was found that the CBC should again 
assume the responsibility for this agency. I know this will have 
repercussions on the budget but the conditions and budgetary 
aspects of this transfer can be the subject of various discussions 
between the CBC and the government.
<P>
	Finally, there is the parliamentary appropriation for the 
coming fiscal year. This appropriation provides for a 4 per cent 
reduction in the CBC's base budget as far as the parliamentary 
appropriation for this fiscal year ending soon is concerned. So, 
why were so many questions asked, since these decisions are 
clear?
<P>
	We were asked why the parliamentary appropriations for a 
second and third fiscal years were not announced at the same 
time. The answer is simple. If we are serious with our review of 
the mandates and our study, it would be wise to wait for the 
results of this examination and for the recommendations that 
will follow before deciding on the CBC's budget for the second 
and third years.
<P>
<B>(1245 ) </B>
<P>
	To drive from Ottawa to Montreal, one does not need as much 
gas as if he or she would be to go to Quebec City. Thus, there is a 
link between the mandate and the budget, as the CBC's chairman 
indicated many times publicly. Thus, we answered that question 
and we will have mandates redefined when preparing for the 
next budget, for next year's budget.
<P>
	Another thing we have to take into account is the work of the 
House heritage committee. This is a review of the CBC and it 
includes, as indicated by the reference, or it will include, I hope, 
a review on other possible sources of funding the CBC could 
have access to. That report is not the only document that 
mentions possible new funding sources for the CBC.
<P>
	How could we set future budgets permanently when basic 
elements of the fiscal situation of the CBC are not yet known?
<P>
	To conclude, I would like to say that I agree with a view that 
has been expressed by members on both sides of the House: It is 
important that radio and television programming by our public 
and private broadcasters provide the bulk of what is transmitted 
over our information highway.
<P>
	A few weeks ago, I was in Brussels for a meeting of the G-7 
communications ministers. It turned out that I was the only 
minister who was also in charge of cultural matters. The 
message I had was essentially what I just said. We cannot 
discuss setting up an infrastructure without first discussing the 
content it will carry.
<P>
	After my remarks, there was no more talk of a comprehensive 
information infrastructure; all of the talk was about a new 
information society. That is very important in my view. I got 
unanimous support, including from the American delegation, 
when I said that the content that will be carried over those 
international information highways should reflect different 
cultures and languages instead of a standardized content that 
would not be positive for creative artists around the world.
<P>
	That will conclude my remarks. We are in the process of 
developing important policies. I know this is a difficult period. 
We cannot ignore the present fiscal limitations that everybody 
understands. We have decided that we should all contribute to 
bringing down the deficit. We should not fool ourselves: this 
government has a tough fiscal policy, but that policy is 
supported by 70 per cent of Canadians. I am pleased to add that 
all agencies that report through me told me that they understood 
the fiscal situation of the government and that they were ready to 
co-operate, so that we can eliminate a deficit that makes it so 
difficult to govern this country.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank the minister for taking the 
trouble to come here to get his message across. There are a few 
questions I would like to raise.
<P>
	But first, I thought it was interesting that he had a clear 
itemized message for us. Last year, we spent the year, from the 
time we were elected until the end of June, sitting two days a 
week on the Canadian heritage committee and listening to 
people who came to talk about the electronic highway, to be told 
that Mr. Manley and Mr. Dupuy, the two ministers, formed a 
committee that would ask the CRTC to look into the information 
highway.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	Now we are starting all over again. The same people who 
came before the committee will do the same before the CRTC.
<P>
	The minister said earlier: ``I cannot announce the budget cuts 
for next year or for the year after''. Not according to our sources, 
which made it very clear in the newspapers and on television 
that the cuts for next year were already known. He said: ``We 
cannot do that, because I asked a lot of people to look into the 
matter''. Well, that is precisely what the Canadian heritage 
committee has been keeping itself busy with for the past six 
months. It has heard the testimony of many people who came 
and talked about the CBC. And even before our report was 
released, we already knew this report would be submitted to a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10773"> 10773 </A></B>
<P>
committee of three experts and  we knew as well that the 
decisions had already been made.
<P>
	This year, $44 million will be cut. If the government cannot 
announce next year's cuts because it is waiting for the findings 
of a committee which has yet to be appointed, on what basis did 
it make its cuts this year? I am not saying that the status quo is 
what we wanted, financially speaking. Not at all. But the 
government did not even wait until the committee finished its 
work or, because it failed to take the longer view, give it its 
mandate soon enough for the work done by our committee to 
have an impact on the budget.
<P>
	We asked whether we should work a little faster so that we 
could have an impact on the budget. We never got an answer. 
The sad part is that taxpayers' money had already been invested 
in the SECOR studies on the situation at Telefilm and the 
National Film Board. Since that was not satisfactory, another 
study was ordered. The government thinks everything will be all 
right, thanks to the information highway. It is like deciding to 
build a controlled access highway across Canada and getting rid 
of our other highways. Even with the information highway, we 
still must keep our other highways.
<P>
	The government is letting one of those highways-the 
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation-go to pieces by putting it 
in a financial situation that is unacceptable at this time, without 
taking the time to make the right decisions and without taking 
the time to ask, for instance, whether it is necessary to maintain 
CBC headquarters, to send the corporation each year to the 
CRTC, and so forth. Many areas will be affected by cuts. 
However, when the government announces it will cut so many 
positions, it will not necessarily be the vice presidents, so that 
we can keep the people who are involved in production.
<P>
	How can the minister guarantee that we can do this? Someone 
will have to administer the $180 million in foregone revenue, 
the $44 million that has just been cut and the $15 million it will 
take to manage Radio Canada International. Can we have the 
assurance that those who lose their jobs will not be the 
performers, producers and creators? How can the government 
guarantee it will remove people who are not directly involved in 
production but are part of a bureaucracy that has to issue 
cheques in Ottawa to pay people who take part in television 
broadcasts in Nova Scotia, for instance?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dupuy:</B> Let us speak first about the respective roles of the 
CRTC and of the heritage committee. They do not deal with the 
same issues, although these issues are related.
<P>
	The CRTC's terms of reference deal with competition 
problems arising between the cable industry and telephone 
companies. These problems cover a series of issues which are 
industrial, commercial or cultural in nature, but which do not 
come under the terms of reference of the Canadian Broadcasting 
Corporation.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	Specifically, in view of the importance given by the 
government to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, it was 
very important not to let a whole discussion on the architecture 
of the electronic highway take place while ignoring the 
broadcasters, particularly the biggest of them all.
<P>
	That is precisely why I wanted a thinking process on the 
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation which would be open to all 
parties and to all the people who would decide to testify.
<P>
	As for the relationship between the reports that the heritage 
committee will produce and the last budget, of course, it would 
have been possible for the heritage committee to report very 
quickly, but I believe that it did what had to be done. It took the 
time to think about this and it also gave us the time to think. We 
have targeted a fiscal year, but that is precisely in order to 
benefit from the advice that the heritage committee and the 
other advisory organizations will give us.
<P>
	There is nothing unusual for a government, whether a Liberal 
one or other, that has always determined in its budget the 
commitments for the next fiscal year, to continue to do so. This 
world is not a world of absolute certainty; it is changing. And we 
are indeed going through a period of huge changes in the field of 
communications. It would have been irresponsible to say: ``We 
are going to take decisions for the next 15 years'', when 
everything is changing and we have not yet seen the results of 
this serious work which is being done.
<P>
	This also brings me to a comment on studies. There have 
indeed been many studies. We are up to here in studies. But this 
time, we are not initiating a new study, let there be no confusion 
about this. We are trying to have people synthesize the data, to 
help government bring the elements together and prepare some 
specific recommendations. So we are certainly not trying to 
delay things, on the contrary, we want to accelerate the process.
<P>
	We must not forget that by next summer, next fall, we will 
begin to see the preparation of the next budget. This is exactly 
what the deadlines will force us to do. By the time the next 
budget is ready, I hope we will have answers which will be 
satisfactory for the CBC.
<P>
	I must say I disapprove of the attitude of the Bloc Quebecois. 
They are trying to cause uncertainty, precisely in the mind of 
those they pretend to be protecting. Those who will suffer most 
will be the craftsmen, the people who will feel distressed by this 
confusion the Bloc is trying to create, for reasons that are not 
always clear. I will not go into details. However, I feel we should 
explain the truth and the process to those who, after all, are at the 
origin of all productions. That is what we are trying to do and I 
hope my colleagues will cooperate to ensure that these people, 
who have always contributed in a remarkable way to the 
Canadian culture and the Quebec culture, will understand we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10774"> 10774 </A></B>
<P>
want to help  them and give them a mandate where they will 
truly have a role to play.
<P>
	It is false to say that government is trying to kill the CBC. On 
the contrary, the government is trying to ensure that the CBC 
will be the most efficient instrument, the best institution with 
the best policies, to carry out the new mandate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the Bloc motion reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the House condemn the government for the refusal by the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage to publish the government's decisions concerning funding for 
the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation over the next three years, thus causing an 
ominous threat to loom over the CBC's French-language network.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	In essence the Bloc is chastising the government for not being 
accountable on spending decisions. Naturally I agree with that. 
My party agrees with that. We believe very much in the principle 
of accountability.
<P>
	If turnabout really is fair play, and I believe it is, I have some 
questions for the Bloc. Where does it get off blocking the 
business of an entire nation on the whole issue of back to work 
legislation and the railway strike? How accountable is the Bloc 
being to its own people in its own province of Quebec who are 
losing pay, jobs, business and markets because their party will 
not stand up and act for them? Where is its concern for the 
unemployed now?
<P>
	I really feel the Bloc is letting people down. It has acted 
irresponsibly throughout the whole process and has thwarted the 
democratic will of this place. That is why I find it ironic that it 
would put forward a motion that would force a degree of 
accountability on the government.
<P>
	Let us talk for a moment about accountability and about the 
motion. The motion is too narrow. The separatist government of 
Quebec talked about how it would protect minorities in Quebec, 
but there is no mention of CBC English language services in the 
motion.
<P>
	I have to ask why that is. Just how deep rooted is its 
commitment to minorities in Quebec? Not very, I suggest. I 
believe all the statements it has made about being fair to 
minorities is sugar coating. It is a vain attempt to draw in people 
who are not francophones in Quebec to vote for the Parti 
Quebecois in the referendum. I believe it is vain.
<P>
	Let us talk for a moment about why accountability with 
respect to the CBC is so important. Obviously accountability is 
important at any time, but it is especially so when the future of 
the CBC literally hangs in the balance. We have a $550 billion 
debt and a deficit of about $30 billion. It is an understatement to 
say that our fiscal situation is extremely serious.
<P>
	In considering the whole issue we have to ask ourselves 
whether as parliamentarians we will be accountable and 
responsible. We have to ask ourselves why we need a CBC in the 
first place. Do people really want some kind of institution called 
the CBC, or do they really want interesting programs that deal 
with issues not dealt with by private broadcasters at this time at 
a cost that recognizes our fiscal constraints? That is the real 
question. I will talk more about it in a moment.
<P>
	Let us talk about the different divisions of the CBC. People 
who listen are largely happy with what they receive on CBC 
radio. However, I firmly believe that the CBC's choice of issues 
to explore betrays a liberal bias and truly lacks balance on some 
social and political issues. If the CBC were to fix that it would 
have a larger audience than it has today.
<P>
	I also believe all kinds of efficiencies could be built into CBC 
radio that would make it function a lot better than it does today. 
On the whole, however, relative to some of the other services the 
CBC provides radio is in relatively good shape.
<P>
	The real problem is with CBC English language television. I 
commend a recent article in the Montreal <I>Gazette</I> to members of 
the House. It was by W. Paterson Ferns and is probably the best 
description of not only some of the problems with the CBC but 
also some of the solutions. I am mostly addressing English 
language television when I talk about this matter.
<P>
	Mr. Ferns made four major points. He said that the CBC 
should start over, that it should start as if the page were blank, by 
a commitment to focusing programming. Mr. Ferns described 
Britain's channel 4 as a model and pointed out that it had a 
mandate to serve all of the people some of the time. Not all of the 
people all of the time but just all of the people some of the time, 
in other words to really sharpen that focus.
<P>
	The question Mr. Ferns asked explicitly and implicitly in his 
article was: Why in the world should the CBC be broadcasting 
American programs? It makes no sense. Those programs flood 
over the border on cable systems. We do not need the CBC to 
rebroadcast them. To its credit I believe the president has 
recognized that it is a crazy idea. Certainly the chairman of the 
CRTC has talked about it. It is a crazy idea and we should move 
away from it.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	Another question is why we are broadcasting programs the 
private networks are already carrying. Why is the CBC so 
heavily involved in sports? Obviously TSN is more than happy 
and more than prepared to pick up carrying hockey games and is 
already doing so. Do we really need hockey on the CBC? Why is 
the CBC bidding to pick up Olympic coverage? Why is it 
bidding twice as much as CTV was prepared to bid to pick up 
Olympic coverage? It is a huge issue and at a time of fiscal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10775"> 10775 </A></B>
<P>
constraint it is an important issue. It is something the  heritage 
minister and the leadership of the CBC have to address.
<P>
	We have to ask ourselves and the CBC has to ask itself what 
types of valuable programming are not on the menu of private 
broadcasters right now. I do not think that has been done yet. We 
see a lot of programming that is currently covered by either the 
major networks, by the Americans or by the specialty channels. 
That should be a cue to us that we must move away from it.
<P>
	Mr. Ferns also talked in his article about the need for thin 
administration. He pointed out that Britain's channel four 
limited its administration to 10 per cent of the total budget. It is 
very difficult to examine the CBC figures because they are just 
not available. When we look through the annual report of the 
CBC it is not obvious just how much money is spent on 
administration and it does beg the question: What is it 
attempting to hide? Why can we not see those figures?
<P>
	The motion brought forward by the Bloc asks the right 
question and it should be asked of all the CBC: Why are 
spending decisions not being made public? Then the question 
that flows from that is: Why is the CBC not forthright about how 
it spends all its money?
<P>
	The CBC's percentage of administration to budget is unclear, 
as I pointed out. However we know the CBC has a very old style 
hierarchy of management. It has several vice-presidents and 
several senior managers in Ottawa. It has more senior managers 
at the regional level. There has to be a lot of money spent on 
administration, given the type of hierarchy.
<P>
	Mr. Ferns also raised that leadership in a network should be 
comprised of programmers. I must admit that at first I took issue 
with that point, being concerned about the fiscal side. However 
if safeguards are built in there is some sense in the idea.
<P>
	I point to the private sector and the great success of Moses 
Znaimer who has brought tremendous success not only to City 
TV in Toronto but also to MuchMusic and the Bravo channel, 
one of the new speciality channels that can be found on networks 
around the country. I believe it is enjoying a measure of success.
<P>
	Visionaries like Mr. Znaimer are probably better able to 
anticipate public tastes and better able to see needs than perhaps 
they are sometimes perceived by the public. That is why Mr. 
Znaimer has been hugely successful. Perhaps one of the reasons 
the CBC has not been successful is that it has been too 
administratively driven in the past. Even with people like Mr. 
Watson there was so much bureaucracy in the way and such a lot 
of baggage attached to the CBC that it was very difficult for the 
programming vision to get down to the field level and to drive 
the CBC agenda.
<P>
	There is a lot to be said about what Mr. Ferns suggested with 
respect to the CBC and other public and private broadcasters 
around the world. A program maker should lead that institution.
<P>
	My experience is as a broadcaster who came up on the 
programming side as opposed to the administration or the sales 
sides. I have seen many successful private sector operations 
being driven by people with a good sense of programming, a 
sense of what people want from programming. From a personal 
standpoint I think it is really true.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	A program producer who heads up an organization may 
indeed be the best choice as long as the organization is 
accountable. It has to be accountable not just to a board of 
directors but to its advertisers, its viewers and taxpayers. This is 
something that has not happened with the CBC to this point, nor 
with the government when it comes to not sharing information 
that is important to taxpayers, namely how their money is spent.
<P>
	An institution such as the CBC must be accountable to 
Parliament not in name only but really accountable. There 
should be an annual review of the CBC by this body in a deep and 
probing way so that if things are going off track we have 
immediate recourse: We can jump in and make some changes as 
appropriate.
<P>
	Also Mr. Ferns indicated that news and current affairs shows 
should be bought from a reputable source and all shows should 
be commissioned from the independent sector. That makes a 
tremendous amount of sense. He argues that the corporation 
should not make, that it should buy. The CBC invests a 
tremendous amount of resources-time, money and 
manpower-in producing programs when there is a huge 
creative sector out there that could provide and would compete 
to provide the CBC with all kinds of programming. It should 
avail itself of that.
<P>
	That type of competition would lead to better programming. It 
would also lead to cheaper programming because people would 
go the extra mile to get their costs down to win the bid and 
ultimately get a program on the CBC. That makes sense. Why 
invest money in bureaucracy, administration, bricks, mortar and 
equipment when it can obtain programs directly from the 
makers of programs?
<P>
	The analogy in the article was that book publishers did not 
hire authors to sit in a room and produce novels which they then 
published. Book publishers buy the finished product. It makes 
all the sense in the world. That is exactly what the CBC should 
be doing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10776"> 10776 </A></B>
<P>
	In summary, we cannot afford the CBC as it is now. To simply 
parrot what happens on other networks is a complete waste of 
money, talent and time. People do not watch the CBC as it is 
now. Advertisers do not support it. While there are a few 
popular programs, CBC English language television is 
generally not held in high esteem.
<P>
	This impression is only compounded when the CBC and the 
government shroud themselves in secrecy. Given this veil of 
secrecy, who among us is not tempted to ask the obvious 
questions: What does it have to hide? What is it afraid of?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for his remarks, which I 
listened to carefully. He mentioned at the start that he was 
surprised to discover we wanted to talk about television, when 
we were preventing the trains from running.
<P>
	I think it is extremely important to remind him once again, 
-we said it a number of times this morning. It is not really 
relevant, but, since the subject has been raised-had the 
government accepted the Bloc's proposals, the bill would have 
been adopted a while back and the trains would probably have 
started running by now. So, do not blame us if the trains are not 
running and no one is looking after the economy.
<P>
	Looking after culture is in fact looking after the economy. It is 
not only when the trains are running that the economy exists.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> He also felt our motion was somewhat 
limited, because we referred only to the French network. 
Throughout his speech, my colleague talked only of the CBC. 
This is perfectly understandable. He knows the CBC better than 
I ever will, and I know the SRC better than he ever will. Since 
there are really two peoples, two nations, two cultures, two of 
everything in this country, and people want to deny this fact, it is 
not surprising that they find our motion limited when we talk of 
the French network.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	What I think is also important to point out, and I have the 
figures to back me up, in our concern about the famous cuts at 
the CBC, is what proportion each of the English and French 
networks will get. It is also perhaps important here for the 
people in this House and for everyone watching us on television 
to know that, for an hour of news, the SRC gets $7,000, while the 
CBC gets $18,000. For an hour of variety programming, the 
SRC gets $30,000, the CBC, $141,000. For a drama program, the 
SRC gets $68,000, and the CBC gets $99,000.
<P>
	We can therefore readily understand that, with less money to 
begin with, there will be even less money to produce our 
programs, if the cuts are made the same way. The problem is that 
the SRC's programs are popular. The BBM ratings for the SRC 
are positive. What  program on the CBC can claim to have 4 
million viewers?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Not one.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> Not a single one. The best CBC programs 
barely reach a figure of 10 or 12 per cent of viewers. In round 
figures, in very very generous terms, this means some 2 million 
viewers. We are therefore definitely not talking about the same 
order of magnitude, other than to say that a lot of people watch 
television, and if we had the same resources as the CBC, even 
the anglophones would probably start watching the SRC, 
because they would find it interesting.
<P>
	Does my colleague not think that we have reason to worry 
about the present situation, since we are told that the 
information highway is the answer which, in a way, is like 
saying that we will solve the question of the CBC in 20 years? 
But what about this year or next? It seems logical that we should 
worry about keeping a general interest television network since, 
according to statistics given at the heritage committee, there are 
places in the West, for example, where rural populations can get 
only one TV network, the CBC. The same is true for some parts 
of Quebec.
<P>
	Then would it not make sense to try to find a way to reach that 
market? I have nothing against helping private enterprise, but 
should we not also try to maintain a general interest television 
network for the whole Canadian community, French speaking as 
well as English speaking? What does he think about that?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate the hon member's 
question. She talked about several things but I would like to 
comment on what kind of service should be provided to people 
in remote areas.
<P>
	It is a legitimate responsibility of the CBC to provide service 
in remote areas. I completely accept that. However, there is a 
larger question and one I posed in my talk which is, does it 
always need to be the CBC? Is it really important that it be a 
particular institution, or is it the service itself that is important?
<P>
	Sometimes that service can be better provided by a private 
sector broadcaster. When talking about news and current affairs, 
there is no doubt in my mind that the private sector can and has 
produced shows which are as good as those on the CBC.
<P>
	I would argue that people in some of those communities 
should have the choice of bringing in either a private sector 
broadcaster or the CBC. It should be ultimately driven by them.
<P>
	While it is a legitimate role for the CBC, it does beg the bigger 
question: Is it really the institution we want there, or is it a 
certain type of programming? That is probably what people 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10777"> 10777 </A></B>
<P>
really want. At the end of the day it should be up to them to 
decide what kind of service they want brought in.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	If it is something they cannot get otherwise, then it is 
something the government should provide for them. That is 
probably a good use for the CBC northern service. In talking 
about TV broadcasting, if people in a community would rather 
have CTV than CBC and it requires building a transmitter, then 
personally I do not see a problem with bringing that service in 
instead of CBC.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I have 
great interest in taking part in this debate today.
<P>
	It is seemingly unusual that only yesterday I was in the House 
arguing and defending the budget program of the government. 
At that time my hon. colleagues in the Bloc were saying: ``Cut 
more. You need to cut more. You have not done enough. The 
province of Quebec is sitting in a sinking ship and we are not 
doing enough''. Today, they are speaking the reverse argument. 
``You are doing too much. You are hurting us. Do not do that any 
more''. What is it going to be?
<P>
	It is clear to most people in Canada that the status quo is not 
good enough. As we approach the 21st century we have to 
change. We have to change as a government, as a country and as 
a people. The status quo which is being defended by the Bloc 
Quebecois is not satisfactory.
<P>
	While talking about the status quo, it is interesting to note the 
problems we are having with our rail industry today. That is part 
of the same argument in some ways because some of these 
contractual agreements have matters in them that go back 
almost a century.
<P>
	I was surprised to learn that blacksmithing is a job description 
which is still available in the CN. One has to be a blacksmith to 
get certain types of jobs. This is the kind of thing the Bloc 
Quebecois is defending, blacksmithing, as we approach the 21st 
century. I do not think that is good enough.
<P>
	I can say that the people of my riding in which General Motors 
is a major feature are not at all impressed by the ability to 
manage this economy that the Bloc Quebecois has shown so 
clearly. We try to manage and people are stopping us from doing 
that.
<P>
	We share the North American continent with our 
tremendously large neighbour to the south. This neighbour has 
tremendous resources, huge programming and cultural 
diversity. It is exporting its culture all over the world. Programs 
come easily across the border. Indeed as we go to better 
telecommunications devices it is going to be almost impossible 
to avoid that kind of culture penetrating the North American 
milieu. That affects our culture, both English and French.
<P>
	I have always been a supporter of the CBC. I have always 
believed it is necessary to foster Canadian culture. What we 
have to do is to foster it in an affordable way.
<P>
	Clearly the CBC has been a vanguard of supporting culture 
both in English Canada and French Canada. I note that Canada is 
an exporter of French programming and clearly therefore, it has 
been a success. It has been a success not only of the CBC but also 
of our federal system which has recognized the need to foster 
these industries, to get them going and let them flourish.
<P>
	As we approach the 21st century, it is clear we have to change 
the way we conduct our government and the way we do business. 
It is clear that governments want to withdraw from direct 
management of different types of industry, whether they are 
cultural or direct industries like CN Rail and let others do that 
for them. It does not mean the government wants to abdicate 
Canadian culture, far from it. The object of the exercise is to 
find a better and more efficient way to deliver the same thing.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	The CRTC has a mandate which does just that. New licences 
have just been issued. The basis of that licensing program was to 
foster and assist Canadian culture.
<P>
	I remember not too many years ago when the finance 
department brought in an incentive to support both the French 
and English Canadian film industry. I was a little pessimistic at 
first. I am always pessimistic about tax driven investments. 
However it was very successful both for the French and English 
people in Canada who developed a movie industry. Once again, 
Canada was an exporter of French language programming to the 
world.
<P>
	We have now slowly moved out of the tax incentives for that. 
Once we get a child going, it is no different from a family. If we 
think about it, when our children reach a certain age it is time for 
them to go out on their own. It is time for them to do their own 
thing. That is really what we are saying about the CBC.
<P>
	Even after these cutbacks the CBC will still have funding of 
$1.4 billion. We can hardly consider that a small amount of 
money in support of cultural broadcasting in Canada regardless 
of what language it is in.
<P>
	We are not saying to the CBC that it has to cut a lot of jobs, 
which possibly it will. We are saying that it has to redefine 
where it is going in this country. It has to define the things it can 
do well and rethink some of the things that perhaps it should not 
be doing any more.
<P>
	I had a discussion with some journalists one day. They 
thought it was unusual that the CBC could have journalists in 
just about every town in this country whereas other private 
broadcasters had to rationalize that and make it more efficient. 
This is what we are asking the CBC to do, to become more 
efficient so it can be slowly weaned off the public payroll.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10778"> 10778 </A></B>
<P>
	The motion very clearly is talking about the concern of the 
reduction in funding. I ask my colleagues in the Bloc, what 
would the alternative be? Would the alternative in meeting our 
deficit targets be to transfer this tax on the poor, the needy, the 
unemployed? Those are the alternatives. We have to get our 
deficits in order. That is the commitment we have made to the 
Canadian people. I can say that the Canadian people are very 
happy about the leadership we have taken in these areas.
<P>
	I know there are many new broadcasting ventures. My 
colleague from the Reform Party mentioned CITY-TV in 
Toronto which has a tremendous array of new broadcasting 
programs. In other words it is not necessary to have publicly 
funded broadcasting companies simply carrying on with this 
type of production.
<P>
	The bottom line is that it is necessary. The taxpayers are 
saying we have to get our economic house in order. The 
taxpayers are on the hook even after all of this is over for $1.4 
billion. Taxpayers want to be able to see what they are getting 
for that money. In some ways they are getting valued service for 
that.
<P>
	Most people in Canada will continue to support cultural 
funding for broadcasting, but at a significantly reduced level. 
That is only reasonable. We have to focus on the things which 
possibly are missing, those things that perhaps need a bit of help 
right now, but those other areas which can stand on their own, we 
can let them fly.
<P>
	In conclusion, it upsets me very much to see that members of 
the Bloc Quebecois simply want to carry on with the old systems 
of the past. They do not want to be flexible in seeing how we can 
change government financing. More important, they do not want 
to assist their cultural industries from the infancy stage to 
fruition.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to speak on the motion of the hon. member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata. I am a supporter of the CBC, of its 
domestic and international services, in both official languages.
<P>
	I was shocked to see that the motion states that an ominous 
threat looms over the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and, 
in particular, the CBC French language network. In no way is the 
government threatening our public broadcaster. Far from it. The 
government has acted in a responsible fashion to balance the 
need of all Canadians to continue to receive high quality radio 
and television services in both official languages with the 
requirement to take immediate steps to put its fiscal affairs in 
order.
<P>
	In addressing this motion, it would be extremely useful to 
compare the Canadian broadcasting model with examples of 
similar efforts in other countries. Canada is not alone in its 
search to develop answers to the questions facing public 
broadcasting. All around the world countries and public 
broadcasters have been  grappling with changing environments, 
changing technology and changing viewer patterns.
<P>
	The sweeping changes affecting public broadcasting began in 
the 1980s. That decade was marked by a large increase in new 
terrestrial, satellite and cable channels. These new channels 
provided the public with an unprecedented range of options in 
their viewing choices. In Europe alone the number of terrestrial 
commercial channels increased from four in 1982 to 58 ten years 
later in 1992. In the 1990s the global broadcasting community 
began to come to terms with the arrival of new direct to home 
broadcast satellites. These new satellites have further explosive 
growth potential in the development of new television channels.
<P>
	Let us be clear on one thing today. The world is not sounding 
the death knell of public broadcasting. Countries around the 
world are rethinking the role of public broadcasting and are 
seeking to adapt these broadcasting systems to meet the 
challenges created by the changing environments. In fact, we 
see few reasons to believe that the changing broadcasting 
landscape will mean that public broadcasting will be frozen 
from our televisions and our radios any time in the near future.
<P>
	In the United States the organization representing public 
television stations recently issued a report summarizing its 
concerns surrounding the role of public broadcasting in the 
information age. According to the conclusions of this report, 
public television's strength in the multi-channel universe will 
derive from its position as an integrated production and 
distribution network for special interest programming. As in 
Canada, U.S. public television seeks to serve American 
audiences through high quality and informative programming 
which cannot be obtained elsewhere.
<P>
	Clearly a role will remain for public broadcasting. Defining 
that specialized role will be the key for policy makers, like 
members of the House, in countries around the world. The new 
realities of the multi-channel universe have forced many of the 
world's public broadcasters, such as the BBC and Japan's NHK, 
to undertake comprehensive reviews of their activities.
<P>
	In July 1994 a very comprehensive white paper on 
broadcasting was completed in Great Britain. This widely 
discussed document examined the many challenges facing one 
of the world's most venerable public broadcasters, the BBC. 
Like the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the BBC must 
confront increasing competition because of new technology and 
services. Like the CBC, the BBC must attempt to face these new 
challenges in an era of limited resources.
<P>
<B>(1335 ) </B>
<P>
	The British government and the select committee studying the 
matter both agreed that the BBC in its present form cannot go on 
forever. But within that recognition for the need for change at 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10779"> 10779 </A></B>
<P>
the BBC was a very real affirmation of the vital role of the 
British public broadcaster.
<P>
	In the British government's view, a key objective for the BBC 
will be reflecting the national identity of the U.K., enriching the 
country's national heritage. Furthermore, the BBC is committed 
to providing diversity and choice in high quality programming 
which informs, entertains and educates the public it serves.
<P>
	Japan has also recognized the worldwide challenges facing 
public broadcasters as a result of the expansion of broadcasting 
competition and technologies. The Japanese public broadcaster 
NHK has undergone an internal discussion concerning its role 
and responsibility as a public broadcaster. This review 
culminated in the publication in 1993 of NHK's ``Future 
Framework'' document which addressed the new challenges and 
prospects of broadcasting such as multi-media, multi-channel 
access, high definition television and satellite broadcasting 
services.
<P>
	This report also reaffirmed NHK's commitment to quality 
journalism and to the provision of first rate information 
services. Furthermore, the Japanese public broadcaster has 
adapted to the growing globalization of the broadcasting 
industry by increasing its involvement in international 
co-productions and other initiatives.
<P>
	NHK now has agreements with organizations in over 30 
countries. In addition, NHK broke with its tradition of 
producing its programming almost exclusively in-house and 
began commissioning work from outside production firms.
<P>
	Public broadcasters around the world are striving to fulfil 
their public mandates. In most instances they are fulfilling a 
unique purpose in their broadcasting environment, a purpose 
that the private sector will not necessarily ever feel the need to 
fill. This is because private broadcasters have entirely different 
goals from those of public broadcasters. Private broadcasters 
respond not only to the preferences of their audiences but to the 
expectations of their advertisers.
<P>
	The Government of Canada will not stand by and let Canada's 
rich tradition of public broadcasting, in both official languages, 
stagnate or be overtaken by technological advances or other 
changes in the audio-visual environment.
<P>
	The government has taken notice of the international 
precedence and finds the lessons learned by others highly 
instructive. But more than just watching how other countries are 
coping with change, the government has demonstrated its 
leadership by putting into place a forward looking strategy to 
find Canadian solutions to the challenges facing our distinctive, 
dual language public broadcasting system.
<P>
	This strategy includes a fundamental review of the mandate of 
the CBC, the National Film Board and Telefilm Canada within 
the context of the entire Canadian audio-visual sector. It is a 
review that has been made urgent by technological and market 
changes. It is a review that has been made necessary because of 
the fiscal realities facing the country.
<P>
	The Government of Canada is clearly demonstrating its 
confidence in the future of public broadcasting by examining the 
mandate of the CBC in the light of the new realities of the 
country's communications environment.
<P>
	As I have stated already, our re-examination of public 
broadcasting is not unique in the world. It is our firm 
expectation that our approach to the challenges of public 
broadcasting will serve as a model and a source of inspiration 
for other public broadcasters and nations around the world.
<P>
	I have received many letters and phone calls of support for the 
CBC from people in my riding and others. For example, Orra 
Henan, Alex Robertson, Floyd Howlett, Ricky Cherney, 
members of the Peterborough Symphony Orchestra, the art 
gallery, the theatre guild, teachers and students have approached 
me about the CBC. One of them, Alex Robertson, refers to the 
CBC as the glue which keeps this nation together. I want to say 
to all of those people that I appreciate their support. I agree with 
them about the role of public broadcasting in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	I disagree with the view of the Reform Party which says that 
its first option would be to put the CBC on the chopping block 
and sell it to the first comer. The Reform Party has no sense of 
what a nation is, no sense that we are here to run a nation, not a 
business. I do not think it has a sense of the role of government. 
The government should be involved in public broadcasting. I 
disagree with its point of view.
<P>
	I also disagree with my colleagues from the Bloc. I do not 
think the CBC, a corporation which even after the proposed 
changes will still have a budget of well over $1 billion, should 
be immune to the changes which face the rest of us in society, 
which face public servants, the private sector and all of us as 
citizens.
<P>
	The CBC is an institution which should be supported. Like our 
other institutions it should be streamlined to deal with the 
present financial circumstances so we can have a smaller, more 
effective organization which contains the seeds or the 
foundations for future public broadcasting and which will be 
even stronger when its budgetary situation improves.
<P>
	Therefore, I intend to vote against the member's motion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10780"> 10780 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my 
colleague for taking the trouble today to speak on the motion I 
presented this morning. I appreciate it very much.
<P>
	I would like to ask him a question. You may have heard the 
numbers I gave earlier, illustrating the funding imbalance 
between the CBC and Radio-Canada. I will repeat them for the 
benefit of new viewers and listeners: for an hour of news, the 
SRC gets $7,000, while the CBC gets $18,000; for an hour of 
variety programming, the SRC gets $30,000, the CBC, 
$141,000; for drama, the SRC gets $68,000, and the CBC, 
$99,000.
<P>
	Given the success of French TV programs across the 
board-for the audience to ``La Petite Vie'' to reach four 
million, some English speaking viewers must be secretly 
looking at it, otherwise it would be extremely difficult to find 
four million francophones who would feel like looking at the 
same program at the same time-would it not amount to 
penalizing SRC for its success to arbitrarily apply the same cuts 
to the French and English networks?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Adams:</B> Madam Speaker, as the member knows, I have 
followed the debate as well as anyone else here today. When I 
spoke earlier I stressed the fact-as I will try to do in my 
remarks now-that I strongly support the CBC, the SRC and its 
services in both languages. I support that across the country, as I 
mentioned this morning.
<P>
	I support the French language service in the north. I support it 
in the rural areas. I support the English language service in 
Quebec. I support and I enjoy the fact that the international radio 
service, Radio-Canada International, is distinct in the fact that 
we reach out to fellow Canadians when they are abroad and to 
other people in both official languages. I greatly support the 
existence of the services in both languages.
<P>
	To answer her question, I deliberately used the word 
streamlining rather than downsizing. This really means that we 
are. We inherited a government which because of debt is 
functioning at two-thirds of its effective capacity because 
one-third of our money is spent on interest. We inherited that. I 
am not pointing the finger or laying blame. That is a fact.
<P>
	In order to get rid of the debt we undertake a dangerous but 
very necessary exercise. We have to make the government which 
is already functioning at two-thirds capacity even smaller in 
order to get rid of the debt so we can come back as a fully 
effective national government. I believe that very strongly. All 
the cuts we make have to be such that they streamline what is left 
so that in every ministry we leave the seeds for a future ministry 
which could be more powerful. In every program we leave the 
seeds, the foundations for a 100 per cent stronger program in the 
future.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	To answer the question about the CBC, we as a government 
have made very different cuts in all our ministries. We cut one 
ministry by 55 per cent. One ministry is growing by a small 
percentage and in the all the others we have very carefully 
decided what the cuts should be. That is streamlining.
<P>
	When we get inside the ministries or inside the programs, I do 
not believe the House can do it. I believe we have to tell our 
ministries that with the budget we have given, they should do the 
same.
<P>
	My answer to the member's question is the CBC should 
manage its own affairs and determine itself where the cuts 
should be made.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
found it strange to hear the speaker before me say that he is for 
the CBC and the Société Radio-Canada. He says he is for them, 
yet he would cut their budgets. This is like a mute person saying 
to a deaf person: ``Watch out, I think a blind person is watching 
us''. This is the kind of thing that the Liberals are saying today.
<P>
	The issue is more complicated than that, when we reflect on 
the extremely important motion which the hon. member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata tabled regarding the corporation. In 
fact, the current Liberal Party is behaving exactly as the party 
always has. That is, the party accedes to power using slogans 
which are tossed out completely once in office.
<P>
	Let us quickly touch on the 1970s. One of Trudeau's weapons 
in his election campaign against Stanfield was the promise that 
he would never control prices and salaries. Six months after 
being elected, Prime Minister Trudeau announced price and 
salary controls. This is the doublespeak party.
<P>
	A little later, along comes the election of the 1980s, which 
toppled the Clark government. We remember. They said that 
they would never raise gas prices. Six months after the election, 
gas prices were up 65 cents.
<P>
	The Liberals made three big commitments during the election 
campaign. One was to reduce the deficit. After the election, the 
deficit had grown from $13 billion to $38 billion. They also said 
they would reduce unemployment. One year after the election, 
there were 1,5 million unemployed, when there were 800,000 
before it. The party which says one thing and does another.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10781"> 10781 </A></B>
<P>
	They said that they would clamp down on government 
spending. Within one year of the election, expenditures had 
risen from $85 million to $110 million.
<P>
	What about the referendum in the beginning of the 1980s, on 
May 20. Keep in mind that they said that they were committed to 
meeting Quebec's traditional aspirations, and that they were 
willing to risk their seats. Two years later, Quebec was stabbed 
in the back. Who held the knife? The current leader of the 
Liberal Party, who has always been behind the post-election 
changes in tune.
<P>
	During the referendum, they warned us that the dollar, which 
was then worth about $1.03 American, would tumble to 80 
cents. They published small dollars which had an 80 cent value 
and a drawing of Bérubé, a Quebec minister at the time. The 
so-called mighty dollar. But, what happened under the Trudeau 
government two years later? The dollar fell to 69 cents. With the 
Liberals, post-election facts always tell a completely different 
story than pre-election promises.
<P>
	They also talked about unemployment and about a deficit that 
they would get under control. They threw all of it, everything 
they promised us so that we would say yes in the referendum, out 
the window and said they did not give a darn. Then, they 
proceeded to do the opposite. That is typical of the Liberals.
<P>
	Now reconsider the 1993 election. What did they promise in 
their red book? What did they promise during the election 
campaign? Think about the free trade issue. They were 
vehemently against it.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	One month after the election, our friend the Prime Minister 
rolled over and made even greater concessions in signing the 
free-trade treaty in Ottawa. That is an example of the Liberals' 
double talk.
<P>
	They used to stand against patronage and loudly denounce the 
Conservative Party's political appointments. However, after the 
election, they had to reward their friends. They had to prove 
Senator Rizzuto right. What did they do? For example, they gave 
Michelle Tisseyre, a Liberal candidate who was defeated in a 
Quebec riding, a nice little six month contract worth $49,000 
with the Privy Council. A little private contract equivalent to a 
$98,000 annual salary. They made Camille Samson responsible 
for political appointments. They appointed Jacques Saada to a 
$100,000 a year position with CIDA. What did the rat pack, 
those Liberals who used to denounce patronage, do while their 
party was busy rewarding its friends?
<P>
	Whatever happened to the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell? As was said in a newspaper, the 
lion has turned into a mouse. He is now applauding and 
supporting these political appointments. He applauded when 
Mr. Dion, a so-called constitutional expert, was quietly given a 
$10,000 contract with the Privy Council. The only reason why 
we know about this is that a journalist managed to dig it up. 
Otherwise, we  never would have known. Mr. Dion was used to 
objectively defend federalism on public affairs programs, while 
in fact he was only a salaried employee of the Prime Minister's 
Office, paid through the Privy Council.
<P>
	Whatever happened to the rat pack? Where are they now? The 
new Liberal mice have remained silent. The language changed 
after the election. They used to talk about unemployment. The 
Liberal Party critic ``rent his clothes'' in protest against the 
Valcourt cuts. Ah! In the first budget tabled a few months after 
the election, the UI reform proposed by the current Minister of 
Finance called for ten times more cuts than under former 
Minister Valcourt, but the hon. members, including the rat pack, 
who used to shout their disapproval in this House, kept their 
mouths shut.
<P>
	What could be said about our defenders of the farming 
community? What did the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell used to say when defending the 
farmers in his riding? That he would never accept cuts. Today, 
he finds it normal when a budget cuts subsidies and guaranteed 
income by 30 per cent each. He finds it normal. They said before 
the election that they would defend the public service. What did 
they do less than a year after the election? They cut 45,000 jobs. 
This is what the Liberals call normal and they are happy. Such is 
the Liberal Party. It makes two kinds of speeches: one during the 
election campaign and another one after.
<P>
	The same is true when it comes to job creation. The Liberals 
campaigned by promising jobs, but there is no mention of job 
creation initiatives in the Minister of Finance's budget. The 
Liberals also claimed that they were the protectors of French 
culture outside Quebec. They promised to do everything 
possible. Now, these same Liberals remain silent when their 
government reduces by five per cent the operating budget of 
French-speaking and Acadian associations outside Quebec.
<P>
	Where are the French-speaking Liberal members who were 
going to speak up for francophones within their party, so as to 
ensure that the French fact remains a reality in Canada? Where 
is the member for Restigouche-Chaleur? The member for 
Carleton-Gloucester? Why will they not speak up? Why do

	Let us now look at the cultural sector, where the situation is 
even worse. Take the issue of copyright and the legislation 
imposed by the Liberals a few months ago. What did the Liberal 
Party say to the Canada Council? The official commitment made 
by the Liberals to the Canada Council regarding copyrights was 
that they would make it a priority to review the Copyright Act, 
since they understand the importance of copyright. They said 
that they would reorganize the administrative structure and 
review the decision made by the Conservatives to split this 
jurisdiction between two departments. The Liberals made this 
commitment and then, all of a sudden, they came up with a 
Copyright Act which was exactly like the Campbell legislation. 
Again, one speech before the election and another one after.
<P>
	Then they addressed the cultural issue. What did they have to 
say about the Canadian Conference of the Arts? What 
commitment did they make? To representatives of the Canadian 
Conference of the Arts who asked them: ``Does your party 
recognize the significance of our national cultural institutions, 
like the CBC, the Canada Council, and so on, and does it 
guarantee their survival?'', the Liberal Party of Canada stated 
that the Conservatives, by cutting the budget of such national 
institutions as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the 
Canada Council, the National Film Board, and Telefilm Canada, 
really did hurt these agencies and show that they did not care a 
lot about our cultural development. A Liberal government, they 
said, would be keen to provide a stable multi-year budget to our 
national institutions. Again, we have two languages, one during 
the election campaign and something completely different once 
the Liberals were elected and in a position to govern. Two 
languages from the forked tongue Liberals.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I see that you are indicating that I must stop for 
now and resume after the question period.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleague, you will be able to resume 
after question period. It being 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing 
Order 30(5), the House will now proceed to Statements by 
Members.

	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
March 31 is the International Day for the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination, a day that challenges all people and their 
governments to take a stand against racism and racial 
discrimination.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In a pluralistic society such as ours, racism is one of the most 
destructive forces preventing people of all origins from sharing 
equally in the country's prosperity.
<P>
	Canada is a country built on diversity. Young adolescents in 
my riding have understood this message clearly, and this is why 
I would like to draw attention to their efforts to promote 
cross-cultural dynamics. I am speaking of the Multi Media 
group, which, next Saturday, will present original works, such 
as poems, drawings, choreographies, photographs and songs 
reflecting their hope of living in a racism free world.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Whether we are going to live with each other in 
compassionate understanding and mutual harmony and then in 
collective prosperity is a matter that will be decided in the future 
by our actions today.
<P>
	I urge all members of the House to join with me in carrying 
this message to the people of Canada.

	<B>Mr. Réjean Lefebvre (Champlain, BQ):</B> The president of 
Canadian National, Mr. Paul Tellier, said on television this 
morning that the working conditions enjoyed by CN employees 
were too generous for the economic context of the 1990s. Mr. 
Tellier's attitude clearly indicates the bad faith of management 
in this dispute.
<P>
	I find astounding that Mr. Tellier would make such a 
statement, since he amply benefits from Canadian National's 
generosity. With a salary of $345,000 and an annual allowance 
of $51,752, and not forgetting an interest free loan of $300,000, 
Mr. Tellier is in fact the best paid public servant in the entire 
government machine.
<P>
	This gentleman is in no position to be talking about the state's 
so called generosity toward its employees. Rather than make 
statements on television, he should do what he is paid to do and 
negotiate in good faith with his employees in order to reach a 
quick solution to the dispute that is affecting the entire Canadian 
economy.

	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, after the genocide of last year when over one million 
people were murdered there exist half a million orphans inside 
Rwanda and 1.2 million refugees in camps in Zaire and 
Tanzania.
<P>
	Of the $22 million which Canada has already given, none has 
entered Rwanda because of conditions placed by donor 
countries that no humanitarian aid enter Rwanda until all the

<P>
ugees return. However, they cannot return because there is no 
food in the country.  Furthermore, the refugees in the camps are 
under the boot of armed thugs of the defeated regime. They use 
aid as leverage to control these helpless refugees to retrain them 
for another war.
<P>
	The government in Kigali is equitable and broad based, made 
up of both Hutus and Tutsis. However, they are receiving no help 
whatsoever to get up on their feet and produce a peaceful front to 
those outside the country who would like to restart the carnage.
<P>
	I implore the government to convince the international 
community to help the government in Rwanda. To not do this 
makes a mockery of our justice and lays the groundwork for 
another genocide.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Beauce, Ind.):</B> Mr. Speaker, everyone in 
Canada is seriously affected by the rail strike. It has already 
taken its toll on the country's economy, with disastrous 
repercussions. Production losses in many sectors have been 
brought to our attention.
<P>
	It is never desirable for the government to force people back 
to work with special legislation, but in this case, this exceptional 
measure is warranted. Let us hope that the major changes which 
are necessary can be made to rail transportation in a way that 
helps management reach all of its goals while helping unions 
protect workers' rights as much as possible.
<P>
	The government should also update the Labour Code and 
propose mechanisms which ensure that essential services will 
always be provided while leaving room for management and 
workers to work out their differences.
<P>
	It is certainly possible to negotiate in good faith after back to 
work legislation, and I encourage the government to introduce 
its bill as soon as possible.

	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last night in Winnipeg, on the eve of the International 
Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, I attended the 
20th annual media human rights awards sponsored by B'Nai 
Brith Canada. The evening highlighted the vigilant role the 
media plays in protecting human rights.
<P>
	Earlier today the 1994 annual report of the Canadian Human 
Rights Commission was tabled in the House. It states: 
``However diverse our species may be, all human beings remain 
worthy of respect''.
<P>
	The issue of human rights is about the integrity of any one 
person which, if violated, destroys the soul of any nation and the 
very essence of our humanity. Racial discrimination violates 
human rights.
<P>
	Therefore on this day we must renew our national resolve to 
uphold human rights and eliminate all forms of racial 
discrimination, thereby ensuring human dignity and peace 
among all Canadians.

health care workers who devote themselves to improving the 
lives of those who face the challenge of a learning disability on a 
daily basis.
<P>
	From infancy to old age learning disabilities affect Canadians 
of all ages in a wide variety of ways. Disabilities range from 
minor inconveniences to very serious physical, psychological 
and emotional limitations which must be managed if the 
affected persons are to maximize their potential and lead full, 
active and rewarding lives.

his 29-year political career.
<P>
	He served as mayor of his hometown in Hanover, he was a 
cabinet minister at Queen's Park and chief whip for the federal 
Tories when the late John Diefenbaker held power.
<P>
	During World War II he served in the bomber command of the 
Royal Canadian Air Force where he was shot down and held as a 
prisoner of war from 1942 to 1945.
<P>
	In 1957 he ran federally and was elected as the MP for 
Grey-Bruce, where he was re-elected four times.
<P>
	In 1967 he left Ottawa and was elected the provincial member 
for the Grey riding, a position he held until his defeat in 1975. 
During his time at Queen's Park he became minister of revenue

	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
week, the Minister of Foreign Affairs said that he too was 
concerned, like the official opposition, about the unstable 
situation in Burundi, and he stated the following: ``It is sad that 
the ethnic conflicts which occurred in Rwanda and ended in 
terrible bloodbaths could now surface in a neighbouring country 
and trigger a similar tragedy''.
<P>
	However, Canada's honourary consul in Bujumbura said 
today on the CBC that he was not worried and that there was no 
comparison between Rwanda and Burundi, since the ethnic 
breakdown of the population is totally different.
<P>
	We must ask ourselves whether this analysis contradicts the 
minister's and whether it calls into question Canada's capacity 
to speak with one unified voice and to really promote 
preventative diplomacy.

the House today to comment on a remarkable story of growth.
<P>
	The province of which I speak surged ahead of all other 
provinces in 1993 and its real GDP rose 5.1 percent, more than 
double the national average of 2.2 per cent. Both international 
and interprovincial exports rose and record crop and livestock 
production lifted farm incomes substantially. Labour income 
also rose markedly, accompanied by a significant jump in 
consumer spending.
<P>
	How did this happen? Was large scale government 
intervention in the economy the cause of this excellent growth 
rate? No, it was not.
<P>
	The growth that has occurred in Alberta, a province which has 
cut its spending by nearly 20 per cent in the last two years, is the 
result I am talking about.
<P>
	To all of the McCrakens, the Whites, the Hargroves and the 
Axworthys of the world, if you want growth that benefits all 
citizens in Canada, do not increase government spending, cut it.

<P>
	In my province of New Brunswick there are many lumber 
mills dependent on rail. As well, our ports have been greatly 
affected as they also depend on the rail lines.
<P>
	I ask the House to allow legislation to be passed with 
unanimous consent which will quickly put an end to this labour 
dispute. I also ask the government to undertake a consultative 
process between labour and management that would result in a 
settlement that is fair and equitable while at the same time 
ensuring CN and CP are not at a disadvantage compared with 
their transportation competitors in the U.S.
<P>
	I recommend to the government that a human resources sector 
consultative study be established for the Canadian railway 
sector. This would allow both management and labour to jointly 
study the changing business environment and the challenges 
facing the railway industry in Canada now and to the year 2000.

ship to the U.S. and to Quebec when the St. Lawrence Seaway is 
open.
<P>
	National Gypsum is loading a ship at this moment, only 
partially and with great delay and extra costs because it does not 
have enough gypsum at the dockside. This company will have to 
lay off more than 100 men by week's end if the trains are not 
moving. The same may be said of companies throughout Nova 
Scotia as well as companies in Quebec and every corner of the 
country.

refused to allow the House to bring an end to the economic chaos 
that has enveloped our country due to the rail strike in progress.

	What is frustrating about this is there is no honourable basis

might see it as helping their battered agenda.

	My union constituents will not suffer due to their hard won

borne by all Canadians through higher prices and increased 
taxes.

	We also must consider the workers in supplier plants who do 
not have the good contracts auto workers enjoy.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, Commissioner Hope's report on labour relations in 
the rail transport sector points out the federal government's 
troubling behaviour during the negotiations leading to the 
current impasse. Mr. Hope concludes that the government was 
guilty of interfering in this dispute by systematically supporting 
the employers' position.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Transport admit that the federal 
government's partisan pro-management attitude during the 
talks is responsible for the failure of negotiations and for the 
current dispute?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I think that solving the problem in Canada's rail system 
is in everyone's interest. We much appreciated the fact that 
CAW president, Mr. Hargrove himself, said that special 
legislation was the best approach.
<P>
	Some people understand full well that Canada's rail system 
must operate so that materials and products like those of Ford, 
GM and Chrysler can be moved. I have no idea with whom the 
Leader of the Opposition is speaking because all those with 
whom we have spoken, without exception, told us that, after 18 
months of talks, the time has come to find a solution allowing 
the Canadian economy to continue to grow.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, although the minister says that Mr. Hargrove 
supports the government's position and the bill, the CAW 
president does not want the bill to apply to his own members. 
What kind of support is that? Let the law apply to the others, but 
not to his union.
<P>
	How dare the minister defend his government's role in these 
talks when Commissioner Hope stated, and I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``The controversial and provocative aspects of the employers' 
demands are found in the partisan role played by the government 
in supporting the position of the railways''.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, every Canadian recognizes that the Government of 
Canada has a responsibility to maintain a transportation system 
that is viable, that is competitive, that is affordable.
<P>
	There is no doubt that over a long period of time every effort 
was made by the unions and by the employers to try to find a 
solution to this problem. They have not been able to succeed.
<P>
	We regret very much that companies, farmers, people across 
the country are faced with a situation that is very unfortunate, 
very difficult to overcome.
<P>
	All I ask the Leader of the Opposition to do is to listen to what 
Canadians are saying, listen to what Quebecers are saying, and 
make sure that we can get the railroads back in operation so that 
we can find a solution to the problem that has escaped the 
negotiators on both sides of the table for 18 months.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Hope report clearly states that the real 
responsibility for the current labour dispute lies with the federal 
government.
<P>
	Given the current deadlock and its serious consequences, will 
the Prime Minister agree to set aside House rules and pass this 
afternoon a back-to-work law imposing a 60 day mediation 
period between the parties without the right to strike or lockout 
employees, so that a negotiated settlement can be reached?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his offer. I think that the 
best solution is to pass the legislation immediately. Otherwise, 
if we wait 60 days, we will end up with the same problem. We 
will have lost a whole week, and will still end up with the same 
problem in 60 days.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	I think that public opinion in Canada at this time is clearly that 
these problems must be resolved quickly. I have received 
telegrams from Quebec aluminum plants, for example, some of 
which are located in the riding represented by the Leader of the 
Opposition, which have  been forced to cut production. It is the 
same thing for Kruger Inc. in the Mauricie region and for the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10787"> 10787 </A></B>
<P>
lumber industry in the northern part of my riding, in Parent, and 
so on.
<P>
	That is why we decided that, under the circumstances, the 
quickest way-and I give the hon. member the opportunity to 
co-operate by withdrawing his objection so that the bill can be 
passed this afternoon.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister was just offered in good faith by the official 
opposition an honourable way to settle the rail dispute once and 
for all.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister hide behind his trigger-happy 
minister's proposal? How can he hide behind this proposal and 
reject the official opposition's offer to settle the dispute this 
afternoon to the satisfaction of all interested parties, in 
compliance with work rules and without affecting workers' 
rights?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I can understand the frustration of the opposition, 
which is trying to make up for the mistake it made yesterday. 
This government's priority is job creation. We must ensure that 
there is a rail transportation system to deliver the goods 
produced by Canadian workers to the markets, so that we can 
have more jobs in Canada, not fewer because of a strike that is 
against national interest.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, must 
the Prime Minister be reminded that our proposal has been on 
the table since yesterday and that it is a clear proposal? If he did 
not understand the proposal, that is his problem.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> It is now clear that the only ones to blame for 
the rail dispute dragging on are the Prime Minister and his 
government.
<P>
	I have a question for the Prime Minister. Can he tell us frankly 
if he is being totally honest when he says he wants the matter 
settled-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order, please. Dear colleagues, the honesty of 
the members of this House is never to be questioned. I would 
therefore like the hon. member to withdraw his remark.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> No problem, Mr. Speaker. You understood that 
I regard the Prime Minister as an honest man. No problem there. 
Being the honest man that he is-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> We just wanted to remind the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> -as I wanted to point out-can the Prime 
Minister tell us why the government has suddenly turned its 
back on mediation, which was accepted as an appropriate 
solution in the dispute affecting the port of Montreal? What is 
really keeping the Prime Minister today from accepting our 
proposal and settling the rail dispute this afternoon?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, all the means available to the government had been 
used earlier to try to settle this conflict amicably and now we are 
confronted with a national strike of all the railways in Canada. 
The government had to face up to its responsibilities and present 
a bill to settle the matter.
<P>
	I realize the press is creating the impression that it is only the 
Bloc Quebecois, but the NDP opposed unanimous consent too. 
Western farmers know that we are thinking of their best interests 
in settling this strike rapidly.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on Wednesday, Department of Finance officials will be 
meeting with Moody's to try to persuade them not to downgrade 
Canada's AAA credit rating. It is widely believed that what 
Moody's wants to know is the timetable and the plan for 
bringing the federal deficit to zero, something that was not 
contained in the finance minister's budget.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	My question is for the finance minister. What will his officials 
be telling representatives of Moody's?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have made it 
very clear to Canadians and to the investment community that 
our goal is to balance the books. We intend to get there as 
quickly as possible.
<P>
	The best way to do this is to have a series of short term targets. 
That will allow us to hit our targets as we have done for the first 
time in over a decade.
<P>
	At the same time, contrary to the doom and gloom on the other 
side, we shall be pointing out to Moody's that this country has 
one of the best productivity records in the world, that inflation is 
very low, that we are creating jobs at an unparalleled pace. In 
fact, we will be pointing out to them that Canada has the best 
growth record of any country of the G-7.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, to balance the books as the minister says, he will have 
to reduce federal spending by $24 billion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10788"> 10788 </A></B>
<P>
	There is no indication in the budget of how that is going to 
be done or when it is going to be done. In my discussions with 
lenders and investors last week the one question they all had 
was when and how is the federal government going to eliminate 
the deficit and not just reduce it.
<P>
	I ask the Minister of Finance this question. When and how 
does the Canadian government plan to eliminate the federal 
deficit? Will he tell Canadians and Parliament what he is being 
asked to tell Moody's and investors? When and how?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have made it 
very clear that we intend to eliminate the deficit. I have also 
made it very clear that the best way to do that is to set a series of 
short term targets, not to allow the decision to be postponed by 
long term targets.
<P>
	Surely to heaven the leader of the third party ought to know, 
having looked at what the Tories did for 10 years, that federal 
long term targets or targets such as those placed in his own 
budget based on faulty assumptions and false input, simply will 
not do the job. We are far more interested in results, not in 
incredible projections.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the markets are not asking for short term targets. They 
are asking a simple question. When and how will the minister 
eliminate the deficit and not just reduce it?
<P>
	Given the uncertainty in the financial markets, the 
government should stop being coy and plainly tell the House 
when and how it plans to eliminate the deficit. If there is not a 
plan then the minister should tell us and we will help him 
develop one.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Is there or is there not a 
government plan and a timetable to eliminate the deficit? If 
there is will he tell his finance minister to disclose that to the 
Canadian people and not just to Wall Street?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the international 
financial community has made it very clear to us that what it 
wants is results.
<P>
	It does not want a whole series of projections. It has had it 
with projections. What it wants is results and that is what it has 
received from the government.
<P>
	I would ask a question of the leader of the third party. When he 
talks about the uncertainty in international markets he is very 
sincere. Does he really think that he helps his fellow countrymen 
and women when he goes outside the country's borders and casts 
doubt on the quality of the budget or the financial projections?

this is a fundamental abdication of our responsibilities

<P>
	Considering that eight Canadian provinces out of ten already 
prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and that the

<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

been a great bureaucrat. He has been in foreign affairs for almost

good choice to be named as ambassador after the great service

English is required, while in the English ad, only the knowledge 
of English is necessary.

Canada to Asia will not be guaranteed French-language service?
<P>

must abide by the Official Languages Act. I want to thank the 
hon. member for asking this question. I will certainly have the 
opportunity to examine why Air Canada acted in this manner, 
but I still hope that we will be able to settle the issue, because 
Air Canada has gained access, since last year, to the Japanese

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr.

Toronto had no commuter trains and at least 20,000 passengers

<P>
	I understand that a number of other countries are interested. In 
any sale our first obligation is to our NATO allies but, as the

arms are subject to certain very strict criteria.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr.

answer to the following question.
<P>
	Not more than a year ago Turkey bombed Kurdish villages 
killing many civilian women and children. This morning 
Turkish war planes and 35,000 troops resumed their offensive 
against the Kurds in northern Iraq. Given the state of tension it is 
unlikely that Turkey would refuse to use CF-5s in a future 
campaign regardless of any written guarantee.

violations?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence

the question is premature because there is no deal between

5,500 women will die as a direct result of the disease in 1995.

	There are many possible risk factors. Tobacco was raised 
yesterday as a possible risk leading to breast cancer. There are 
risks factors with diet, genetics and many others. Not enough 
work has been done in the area and I intend to do something 
about it.

	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Healath.
<P>
	The minister declared on Friday that the federal government, 
despite the large cuts in transfer payments to the provinces, 
holds all of the strings needed to ensure that the five great 
principles, the untouchables of the Canada Health Act, will be 
respected.
<P>
	Must we gather from the minister's statements that the 
national forum on health will unilaterally review the Canada 
Health Act and identify the changes to be made, without giving 
the provinces, who are responsible for administering the health 
system and who will have to absorb these budget cuts, the right 
to negotiate anything?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I have said this many times, and so has the Prime 
Minister: the principles enshrined in the Canada Health Act are 
not negotiable. The national forum on health is studying the 
future of the health care system and of the health of Canadians.
<P>
	The forum will make some recommendations, which we 
might accept, and the provinces will be given the chance to 
review the same issues. Both parties want to help each other, 
because we both know that we have one of the best health care 
systems in the world and we want to keep it that way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
supplementary question is for the Prime Minister, because I am 
no closer to understanding than I was before that answer.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister, who is also the chairman of the 
forum on health, have any explanation for the fact that the 
provinces are not participating in the forum other than that he 
intends to impose national standards on them which they will 
never have had the opportunity to negotiate?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if I recall correctly, we discussed this issue when the 
forum was announced, and we determined that we were not 
interested in having the provinces participate. Later on, we 
invited each one to have a representative on the forum. They all 
declined.
<P>
	We offered them a spot but they refused to take part. It is a 
forum; there are no conditions, and all are free to express 
themselves. Canadians know that I listen a lot. So every time I 
go there, I listen. It would have been my pleasure to listen to the 
provinces, but they denied me this pleasure.

using a stun gun and his fists.
<P>
	Considering that his fists were probably not lethal weapons, 
my question is for the justice minister. Stun guns are prohibited 
weapons under section 90(1) of the Criminal Code. Mr. Watson 
admits to having the prohibited weapon in his possession. 
Would the minister confirm if the gun was confiscated and if Mr. 
Watson was charged with having an illegal gun in his

	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	If the Liberal government goes ahead with its planned 
legislation, wealthy Canadians will be compensated for estate 
taxes paid in the U.S. under a new agreement signed in August. 
The agreement is retroactive to 1988 and will cost Canadian 
taxpayers over $2 billion in compensation, by giving families 
with estates worth over $600,000 in the U.S. a foreign tax credit 
in Canada.
<P>
	Does the minister have the courage to say no to this 
outrageous legislation, or does the Liberal government plan to 
create a new $2 billion tax loophole for the wealthy?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, primarily because 
of some of the noise and static around the member I had a little 
difficulty understanding. However I understand the question 
referred to the tax protocol that was signed with the United 
States. The member is nodding.
<P>
	We have made sure that Canadians are not subject to double 
taxation. Yes, Americans are not subject to double taxation as 
well arising out of the same piece of legislation.
<P>
	The member will understand that it is very important for the 
Government of Canada to protect Canadian citizens. I am sure 
he will understand, when he talks about the large amounts of 
money involved which he says we should be saving, that the 
amount is roughly what the railway strike will cost us if we do 
not deal with it. One might ask the member why he is not 
prepared to support the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my supplementary question is for the same minister.
<P>
	This has become more and more curious. The Mulroney 
Conservative government supported this tax break for the 
wealthy. The Liberal government opposite supports this tax 
break for the wealthy. It is a $2 billion tax break for very wealthy 
Canadians who have estates in the U.S.
<P>
	Will the minister give Canadian taxpayers a break and cancel 
this deal of a lifetime for wealthy Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as a result of this 
piece of legislation we are now able to tax Canadian snowbirds 
who have gone south and we are able to prevent double taxation.
<P>
	As the hon. member knows, in the last budget and in the one 
before we probably closed more loopholes than any Canadian 
government has done since the Prime Minister was finance 
minister.

<P>
	Much of the recovery in the economy has been driven by 
export markets. Durham and Oshawa have benefited since 
automobile production is a big feature in the area.
<P>
	When can other small and medium size businesses, their 
employees and consumers generally see some relief?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
once again confirms his reputation for articulate economic 
comment. He is absolutely right when he points out that the 
recovery has been largely export oriented and to that extent has 
been one legged.
<P>
	I must say we are beginning to see the signs of increasing 
consumer confidence. The statistics this week from Statistics 
Canada demonstrate that consumer confidence is up sharply. 
Retail sales were up again in January for the fifth time in six 
months.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Transport. On March 17, the 
minister responded to a question from the official opposition by 
stating that the privatization of Marine Atlantic Inc. would 
resolve the matter of this company's foreign flagging of its 
ships.
<P>
	Is the minister not aware that, by not bringing all of the ships 
of Marine Atlantic Inc. back under Canadian flag before the 
corporation is privatized, he is condoning this practice, which is 
followed by many Canadian shipowners, contrary to our 
economic interests?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is no doubt that the question of foreign flagging at 
Marine Atlantic is one we wanted to address once the matter was 
raised.
<P>
	We have determined it has been ongoing, depending on the 
vessel, for a number of years. As I indicated to a colleague of my 
hon. friend in the House yesterday, we have asked the president 
of Marine Atlantic and the board to look into the potential for 
the commercialization of all the activities of Marine Atlantic.
<P>
	Certainly we will be addressing the question my hon. friend 
has put to me one way or another. If the commercialization 
proceeds, we will have to take into account the implications of 
reflagging the vessels prior to sail. If the commercialization 
does not go forward, we will review the matter in the light of my

The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, due to 
question period, I was interrupted for an hour since we are to 
follow Standing Orders, which we agree to do. I was discussing 
the official opposition's motion concerning funding for the 
CBC, along with the amendment proposed by the Reform Party.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
	I recalled my surprise at seeing the Liberal Party renege on 
commitments it made during the election campaign. I must say 
it was not an entirely unexpected surprise. Traditionally the 
Liberal Party has always sung two tunes: one for the election 
campaign and one for after the campaign, and the two are 
diametrically opposed.
<P>
	In my introduction, I recalled the agricultural double talk. For 
example, when the Liberals were in opposition, they were 
committed to supporting the dairy producers, defending article 
XI and maintaining subsidies. Well, once they are in office, what 
do they do in their budget? They cut aid to farmers and to dairy 
producers by 30 per cent. They also cut the income support 
program by 30 per cent.
<P>
	I also mentioned unemployment. During the election 
campaign, they said that their priority was to fight 
unemployment and create jobs. Once they are in office, the 
language and the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10795"> 10795 </A></B>
<P>
speech change. The latest budget speech contained no job 
creation measures whatsoever. It has become a joke.
<P>
	I was at the Sorel and Bécancour employment centres last 
week. What was the joke of the day? The question went: What is 
the difference between a Liberal MP and an unemployed person? 
The answer: The unemployed person has worked in the past.
<P>
	We have reached a point where people no longer believe in 
this government. They do not believe the government will make 
good on its promises. It was the same thing when it came to 
defending the Acadians and the francophones outside Quebec. 
We saw francophone MPs from the rest of Canada claiming 
during the election campaign that they would defend the French 
fact here in the House of Commons and throughout Canada. But 
when there is a 5 per cent cut in the operating budget of their 
association, they say nothing. Not one francophone MP from 
outside Quebec rose to denounce the policy of the Liberal Party 
once it took office.
<P>
	The same thing happened in a number of areas. With respect 
to copyright, for example, they made a written commitment in a 
document submitted to the Canada Council to take action to 
bring copyright under the exclusive jurisdiction of the 
Department of Canadian Heritage. Once elected, they turned 
this responsibility over to the Minister of Industry, and gave the 
heritage minister power to make recommendations only.
<P>
	The Liberal Party always sings two different tunes: one when 
it is going after the vote and another when it is in power.
<P>
	It was the same thing with free trade. They fought against free 
trade for years and denounced it during the election campaign, 
but once in office, they were not only all for it, but wanted it 
extended to other countries. The Liberal Party has always 
operated this way: it sings one tune before it is elected and 
another tune after.
<P>
	I could give other examples. There is patronage, for instance. 
They criticized the Conservatives for making patronage 
appointments, but once in office they turned around and in less 
than six months gave out more than 300 appointments to friends 
of the party, under the expert guidance of Senator Rizzuto. And I 
mentioned the example of Michelle Tisseyre, Camille Samson 
and others.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> You are a very 
experienced parliamentarian; you should always comply with 
the Standing Orders of the House and avoid identifying 
members of the other place.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not refer to the Senate but 
to one particular senator. I think that the Standing Orders allow 
me to identify one particular senator but not, as you pointed out, 
to refer to the Senate, that must be called the other place.
<P>
	In any case, I will drop the word ``senator'' and use only the 
name ``Rizzuto''. This individual, who made the 
recommendations regarding patronage, is still the party's 
bagman and advisor on appointments like those of Camille 
Samson, Michelle Tisseyre and Jacques Saada, who was 
appointed to a $100,000 a year post with CIDA.
<P>
	It is typical behaviour for the Liberal Party to use a 
completely different language after coming to office. Even 
though they promised to do away with patronage and political 
appointments, they have since enthusiastically embraced this 
practice. The party still engages in double talk, especially its 
leader who, throughout his years in office in the 1970s and 
1980s and since 1993, still says one thing before the election and 
another thing after. They think voters are fools.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	This review of Liberals' unkept promises and double talk is 
clearly reinforced today by our discussion of the funds allocated 
to the CBC. In this regard, I would like to quote the red book 
commitments made by the Liberal Party during the election 
campaign. The red book says on page 88: ``Canada needs more 
than ever to commit itself to cultural development. Instead, the 
Conservative regime has deliberately undermined our national 
cultural institutions''.
<P>
	The Liberal Party said, and I quote: ``Funding cuts to the 
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the Canada Council, the 
National Film Board, Telefilm Canada, and other institutions 
illustrate the Tories' failure to appreciate the importance of 
cultural development''. That is what it said before the election, 
but after the election, it was the first one to cut, to the tune of 
$300 million, financing on which the CBC depends, attacking 
CBC's French network in particular.
<P>
	Here is what the Liberal Party promised in its red book: ``A 
Liberal government will be committed to stable multiyear 
financing for national cultural institutions such as the Canada 
Council and the CBC''. This is a far cry from what is going on. 
Yet, the minister continued to claimed in this House that he did 
not know exactly how extensive the cuts would be at the CBC; it 
could not be that much. Perhaps it was a little more than that. He 
contradicted himself at least five times in the past two months 
regarding possible cuts at the CBC, when a solemn and specific 
commitment had been made in the red book to stable multiyear 
financing. This goes to show once again the difference being in 
an election campaign or in office makes when you are the 
Liberal Party.
<P>
	I will conclude on this as I am almost out of time. I know this 
will make my colleagues opposite very sad because they would 
like to hear more-I scan see them hang their heads in shame for 
sacrificing their principles, the ideals they stood for and their 
red book to the party line. They will stop at nothing to be in 
power. They take after their leader. Power at all cost: make all 
the promises necessary to get there, but once in power, never 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10796"> 10796 </A></B>
<P>
mind  about making good these promises. Sooner or later, they 
will face the same reaction they faced in 1984, that is to say 
complete rejection from Halifax to Vancouver of this kind of 
behaviour, this double talk they have cultivated.
<P>
	I will leave you with a recommendation the CRTC made 
concerning the CBC, stating that it will be imperative that the 
policy proposals to be developed in the coming months focus on 
a central and fundamental objective, which is to promote and 
preserve the identity of French Canadians; at present, our 
broadcasting system demands from its partners that they allow 
Canadian content to take up much room, which has encouraged 
the expression of our cultural identity and made possible the 
development of audiovisual production in both official 
languages of this country. It concluded that we should not give 
up any ground in this respect.
<P>
	That is what the CBC should focus on, and the current 
minister is away off the track in refusing to give serious thought 
to maintaining stable financing, at the expense of the CBC's 
French network in particular, which is the highest performing. 
They crack open a bottle of champagne on the English side when 
they reach one million listeners, while on the French side, this 
many people listen in daily.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to the comments made 
by the Conservative or rather the Bloc member, since he has a 
tendency to change his mind, who accuses the Liberals of 
singing two tunes. Coming from that member, and particularly 
that political party, this is quite a statement.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, today we heard the Bloc Quebecois raise an issue 
with which you are very familiar, namely the situation of 
French-speaking Canadians outside Quebec. This is the last 
straw. The hon. member and his colleague, the member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata, are now telling us that they are 
defending French-speaking Canadians outside Quebec who 
have a right to be heard. However, yesterday, when some 
French-speaking Canadians outside Quebec made comments 
which they did not appreciate, they said that these people did not 
have a right to speak on the issue and should mind their own 
business.
<P>
	Have you noticed that those who talk about the Liberals 
singing two tunes are doing precisely that? Rather than allude to 
the two different tunes of the Bloc, it might be more appropriate 
to refer to the two faces of that party. Those who sing two tunes 
have two-you guessed it, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	The hon. member opposite claims to be CBC's protector-and 
I am pleased to see that Bloc members support anything with the 
word Canadian in it-and accuses the government unfairly and 
unreasonably. Is he aware that us French-speaking Canadians 
outside Quebec, at least where I come from, enjoy RDI, CBC's 
French-language network, la Chaîne française, and Quatre 
Saisons? Indeed, French-speaking Canadians  from Ontario can 
listen to all these channels, in a united Canada.
<P>
	The member opposite, who talks out of both sides of his 
mouth, wants to deprive us, French-speaking Canadians living 
outside Quebec, of these bilingual institutions which allow us to 
enjoy these cultural vehicles to which we are entitled. Why, on 
the one hand, does the member claim to protect CBC and 
French-speaking Canadians outside Quebec while, on the other 
hand, both he and his fellow Bloc members do their utmost to 
deprive us of what we have gained?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am amazed at the comments 
made by the hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, 
especially when he said I could not make up my mind. He was 
critical of the fact that I was first a Conservative and that I am 
now a member of the Bloc Quebecois. Well sir, at least I have the 
courage-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. In his previous 
comments, the hon. member for Richelieu seems to have been 
right about the other place, and I appreciate his comments, 
which show his experience, but at this point I must remind him 
to speak through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Thank you for calling me back to order. I 
was going to say I was amazed when the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell said I was someone who could 
not make up his mind. I changed parties but I did not change my 
way of thinking. The principles that led me into politics were no 
longer compatible with the principles of the party to which I 
belonged. The party had changed, and to remain true to my 
principles, I had the courage to cross the floor of the House and 
sit on this side, first as an independent member and 
subsequently as one of a group of eight members who formed a 
political party.
<P>
	When the hon. member saw his party renege on its 
commitments regarding unemployment, renege on its 
commitments regarding agriculture, renege on its commitments 
to protect French culture in Canada by cutting 5 per cent of 
funding, renege on its commitments to maintaining the public 
service, renege on its commitments with respect to the CBC, did 
he have the courage to cross the floor and sit down on this side of 
the House, as I did in 1990 when the party I served failed to live 
up to my principles?
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	That is what I did, but the hon. member, according to an 
article in <I>Le Droit</I>, ``this lion in the opposition is now a mere 
mouse''. Indeed he is. That is my response.
<P>
	Now if he really believes in the CBC, I also believe in the 
CBC's French network, but if he really believes-when he 
mentioned the RDI, I commented that some areas do not have it 
yet, but because there is a French network, because there is an 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10797"> 10797 </A></B>
<P>
RDI, why would his department jeopardize their existence? That 
is what today's debate is all about.
<P>
	Why would the government not guarantee funding? Why not 
guarantee funding for the CBC over a five-year period? That is 
what it is not doing and that is what we want it to do. We want the 
government to stop operating on the sly and to stop 
contradicting itself from one day to the next. That is what we 
want from the minister. Give us the facts, give us stable budgets, 
maintain what has been achieved by the French network, 
consider that the CBC's French network is more productive than 
the English network, provide the same funding for the news on 
French and English radio stations, provide the same funding for 
variety programs and for all sports programming.
<P>
	What we want from the minister is a fair deal and the same 
guarantees he, his party and his prime minister promised the 
corporation during the election campaign and in the red book.
<P>
	That is what we are asking today. Why does the hon. member 
who asked me a question not have the courage to say: ``Yes, I did 
promise that, yes, we were supposed to do that and we will 
support the Bloc's motion to put pressure on the minister who no 
longer has a clue what his department is all about''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville-Milton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as important as the question of future funding levels of the CBC 
is, I feel that a more fundamental issue must also be addressed in 
the House today, namely, the importance of public broadcasting 
in Canada.
<P>
	I intend to use this opportunity to remind my colleagues on 
both sides of the House about why we remain deeply and 
fundamentally committed to public broadcasting in Canada.
<P>
	It is widely recognized that the CBC television services of 
tomorrow must necessarily play a much different role than the 
role they were intended to play over three decades ago. Today, 
Canadians enjoy a wider range of programming and services 
than ever before. Although these changes are significant, they 
are only a preview of what we can expect in the broadcasting 
industry in the future.
<P>
	In recent months we have been the recipients of many new 
services through cable and as the hearings before the CRTC on 
convergence attest, much more is to come. Indeed it is 
legitimate for members to wonder when we hear so much about 
the so-called death stars and the 500 channel universe, what the 
role of the public broadcaster will be in this environment of 
increasing choices.
<P>
	As surely as the CBC is a vital topic today, so it will be even a 
decade from now. True, the government has a historical position 
of supporting the CBC and of supporting Canadian culture. At a 
time when a virtual communications revolution is taking place, 
Canada needs more than ever a strong cultural identity. No 
single instrument is more vital to the development of that 
national identity than the CBC.
<P>
	The corporation is the single most important employer of 
writers, actors, musicians, dancers, film makers, directors and 
many other talented, creative people who shape our vision of 
ourselves. Nowhere else on the television dial can one see the 
commitment to quality Canadian programming that one can see 
on both the English and French language networks of the CBC.
<P>
	With two mainstream broadcast television networks, one 
French and one English, a television wing of the northern 
service and 24-hour all news cable service in both English and 
French, CBC television brings Canadians together. The CBC has 
the awards, both domestic and international to prove it.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	In a country as vast as ours the CBC alone provides some 
remarkable services. In addition to the television services 
already mentioned, it operates four mainstream radio networks, 
AM and FM in French and English plus a northern service 
transmitting in many native languages, including Cree and 
Inuktitut to name but two. These are the only radio networks in 
Canada and they reach about 98 per cent of the population.
<P>
	If one visits some of our more remote corners it is easy to 
understand how much it can mean to a librarian in Iqaluit, for 
example, to know that her sister in Chester, Nova Scotia and her 
father in Nanaimo, B.C. are all listening to ``Morningside'', are 
all sharing that common Canadian experience. It is that sense of 
connectedness that is the essence of public broadcasting today. 
It is this commonality of experience which we must be able to 
continue to share. We live in an era of increasing specialization 
but Canadians can obtain almost anything they want on demand.
<P>
	The question is, are they sharing experiences the way they 
once did? Our ability to record what we want and to watch it 
later, almost any time, can make for very selective and singular, 
some would say isolating, interpretations of our identity. As our 
national public broadcaster, the CBC must be strong enough to 
produce the quality Canadian programming that Canadians want 
to watch, the kind of programming that provokes discussion the 
next day, the kind of programming that helps Canadians share 
experiences that make us Canadians.
<P>
	The former chairman of the CBC, Patrick Watson, said it far 
better than I can when he addressed the Paul Nitze Centre of 
Advanced Studies at John Hopkins University in Maryland in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10798"> 10798 </A></B>
<P>
1994. At that time he said: ``Canadians, like Americans, will be 
spending a  tremendous amount of time whizzing out to the outer 
reaches of this new communications universe''.
<P>
	More than ever, if the particular kind of civil society that we 
have put our money on is going to survive, we are going to need a 
foundation to start from and return to, something like a media 
hearthstone, so that whenever we select one of the channels that 
belong to our own public broadcaster, it will be so clearly ours 
that Canadians will be able to say to themselves: ``We are 
home''.
<P>
	After all, that is what good public broadcasting is about: 
providing a sense of home in a universe that is expanding all the 
time. It does not mean that the CBC can expect increased levels 
of public funding. To expect that in light of the fiscal situation 
the government is facing would be neither realistic nor 
responsible to the future generations who must pay our debts. 
Likewise, it does not mean that the CBC must perform exactly as 
it has in the past, for this too would be ignoring reality.
<P>
	Times have changed and so have our tastes and our 
expectations. The Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage 
has heard from many excellent witnesses about the importance 
of public broadcasting and about alternative ways of doing 
things. It is time for the government to take the next step, to 
review the legislated mandate parliamentarians have conferred 
on the CBC to ensure that we are not asking it to perform tasks 
which are no longer necessary, given the new services that are 
available to us or possible, given the resources available today. 
We must decide how best the CBC can enhance our feeling of 
connectedness as we enter the new millennium. I look forward 
to the upcoming announcement by the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage in this regard.
<P>
	In closing, I would be remiss if I did not salute the men and 
women who serve the CBC today and have done so in years past. 
Their enduring commitment to public broadcasting and public 
service are valued deeply by the government. As we endeavour 
to resolve the challenges facing the CBC in the days ahead, we 
will do our utmost to act with wisdom, diligence and respect for 
the cultural treasure they have so painstakingly created.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
very interested in listening to the member as she spoke about the 
responsibility of the CBC generating the quality of 
programming that Canadians want.
<P>
	I was also interested that the hon. member is continuing with 
the age old idea the Liberals have had that if anything is good it 
is going to have to be created by the government, that there must 
be government intervention into the creation of the Canadian 
identity and that there must be government intervention into 
creating a feeling of connectedness. These are wonderful terms 
but at a cost of $1.1 billion, I wonder how connected Canadians 
really feel.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member could help me understand this 
concept. We are spending this gargantuan amount of money to 
create the quality of programming Canadians want and at the 
same time, the number of viewers, particularly of English 
language television, is dropping through the floor. Does she 
really feel we are getting the kind of value for the taxpayer's 
dollar we should be if she is after quality of programming that 
Canadians want yet the CBC is dropping viewers by the 
bucketload?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Brown (Oakville-Milton):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not 
surprised by the opposition member's response to my remarks in 
the sense that I did speak strongly about the government's role in 
providing public broadcasting and the importance of public 
broadcasting.
<P>
	Unlike the opposition member, I do not share his utmost faith 
in the marketplace delivering everything of value to all the 
citizens of this country. As a matter of fact, in this particular 
industry, that is broadcasting, while the private marketplace 
provides a service it has failed miserably to provide the kind of 
Canadian programming the CBC has managed to do in both 
official languages.
<P>
	There is nothing preventing private broadcasters from 
creating more Canadian programming. However, particularly on 
English television, which he chooses to highlight, it is clear they 
can make a lot more money, according to the rules of the 
marketplace which they follow, by importing American sitcoms 
and simply rebroadcasting them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> The CBC can.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Brown (Oakville-Milton):</B> No. Eighty per cent to 85 
per cent of CBC's programming in prime time is Canadian 
programming. Just about the same percentage is American 
programming on the private networks.
<P>
	By the latest figures released, we know the market does not 
help us to create a national vision of ourselves and does not help 
us tell our stories to each other. Therefore, I and this government 
still believe there is a role for government in the broadcast 
industry and in the creation, encouragement and evolution of 
Canadian culture for both francophones and anglophones in this 
country.
<P>
	The member mentioned a gargantuan expenditure of money 
on the CBC. I guess that would depend on where one's values lie. 
Perhaps the member believes as I do that this country has a 
leading role to play in the development of a higher level of 
civilization in this world. We have not done a bad job of it 
having been named number one in the world by the United 
Nations. Perhaps the member values the things that Canadians 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10799"> 10799 </A></B>
<P>
have valued over time, things like caring for each other, a sense 
of community, an abhorrence for useless war. If he did, he would 
not see the expenditure of money on the public broadcaster as 
gargantuan.
<P>
	Some in this country would encourage us to spend more, 
believe it or not, and to reduce the gargantuan expenditure of 
money for example on our military. To some that is an obscene 
expenditure of money. They think the creation of arts and 
culture, which makes for a more highly civilized nation, is a 
valuable expenditure of money. I guess it all depends on one's 
viewpoint as to value for dollars spent.
<P>
	This nation wishes to retain its identity, to hold on to the 
things that make us different from our friends to the south. They 
are our friends but we do not want to imitate them, their social 
structures, or their social problems for sure. Therefore, it is 
absolutely necessary that we strengthen our identity as 
Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	It is necessary that we know who we are and that our children 
know who they are and that they are different. They are not 
English as the English in England. They are not French as the 
French in France. They are not North Americans as those 
citizens in the United States. They are different and they are 
special. We are poised between Europe and the United States as 
our main cultural influences. Therefore, it is more important 
than ever that we take strong measures as the representatives of 
the people in this government to ensure that the public 
broadcaster continues to play a strong role, a publicly funded 
role, in helping us to determine the vision of ourselves today and 
a better one for the future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for her 
presentation and for clarifying her position and her replies. It is 
very gratifying to realize that on the Canadian heritage 
committee, we have a member across the way whose position is 
not that far from the position of the Bloc Quebecois on the need 
to defend public broadcasting, the CBC-SRC as we have known 
it, with whatever adjustments will be necessary because of 
changing technologies.
<P>
	I have a comment and a question. What separates us is the 
concept of Canadian identity. This is a recent invention. There is 
not just one Canadian identity. There are two Canadian 
identities, two founding peoples here. More than two, if we 
include all our First Nations. In this bilingual country, which is 
French speaking and English speaking, there are two national 
identities and two cultures, which is reflected in our television 
programming. So that is what separates us, and nothing is going 
to change that. That is why we want to leave. We want to leave 
you with your Canadian identity and assume our Quebec 
identity. Those are all fundamental reasons, because we will 
never buy this Canadian identity concept.
<P>
	That being said, I wonder whether the hon. member- Mr. 
Cauchon, let me say what I have to say.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> There is a time and a place 
for such conversations, but meanwhile, I would appreciate it if 
hon. members would speak through the Chair. The hon. member 
for Rimouski-Témiscouata.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> You are right, Mr. Speaker, and I thank you 
for calling me to order. I would also ask the hon. member for 
Outremont to speak through you.
<P>
	This is what I wanted to ask the hon. member. Does she see 
public broadcasting as based on the system we know today, as an 
entity that will eventually absorb new technologies, or does she 
see a PBS style network?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Brown (Oakville-Milton):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think from 
the committee my colleagues opposite know I am never going to 
be satisfied with a PBS style public broadcaster.
<P>
	I find it appalling that at regular occasions what are probably 
fine upstanding citizens have to stand up with a tin cup and beg 
for donations. I find it appalling that our neighbour to the south 
does not value the PBS programs, which indeed many of us and 
many of its own citizens enjoy, sufficiently to fund it without 
having the tin cup approach. I would certainly fight against that 
to the death. You can count on it.
<P>
	I cannot let the hon member's comments go unchallenged 
from the point of view of the identity issue. My colleague says 
there is no single Canadian identity but rather, there is a 
francophone one, an anglophone one, and an aboriginal one. She 
says that is why she wants to leave.
<P>
	The thing is, the government does not want to allow that to 
happen because when my colleague says they want to leave, she 
is referring to those of her people with a francophone identity 
who live within the confines of the province of Quebec, which 
after all is only a geographic designation.
<P>
<B>(1540 ) </B>
<P>
	There are many other Canadians who see themselves with a 
francophone identity and live outside the borders of Quebec. I 
ask my colleague why she would want to abandon those who 
share her sense of identity by leaving them and creating a new 
country from which they would be excluded.
<P>
	I have just one other point. The fact is that all identities and all 
nations evolve and emerge with time. While we all have the 
identity of our roots, there is such a wonderful opportunity here 
for me to try to understand my colleague's identity, the identity 
of her birth and for her to try to understand mine and for all of us 
together to try to understand the identity of the aboriginal people 
and indeed of our newcomers. It is as we understand each other 
that perhaps that search for understanding becomes the 
foundation of what is truly a Canadian identity for all of us.
<P>

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member preceding me commented on 
identity saying that our identity in Quebec was simply a matter 
of geography. I think other factors have to be taken into 
consideration. It must be remembered that we are the people 
who arrived from Europe first bringing a French culture to 
America, with Quebec as its focus.
<P>
	There was also a French America in North America as a 
whole. The first French to arrive in Quebec, the ones who settled 
in Canada, followed the Mississippi, reaching as far as 
Louisiana and the Rockies.
<P>
	If, today, the number of francophones in Canada is less than 
what is was 125 or 130 years ago, it is perhaps more because 
they were denied the right to be educated in their own language 
and to grow in their own language. This happened in Manitoba 
and Alberta, among other places, at the end of the 19th century. 
Had they enjoyed this right, Canada could have become a truly 
bilingual country. We could have avoided the present situation 
in which we discover two completely different realities. We 
could live as neighbours in harmony. The only way, in our 
opinion, is for us to opt for sovereignty and for Canada to find a 
way to deal with its American neighbours.
<P>
	Did the hon. member in her presentation not limit our identity 
by making it a matter of geography, in a very restrictive and 
rather embarrassing way for Quebecers, when we are in fact as 
much a part of Canada's history as the anglophones and the 
aboriginal peoples? Is this not limiting us to very little and 
admitting that the Liberal Party's knowledge of Canada is 
limited to the image handed to it, particularly by the picture the 
Prime Minister can paint of it?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The period for questions 
and comments is over. At 3.40 p.m. the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup began his speech for a 
maximum of 20 minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> I am sorry, I got confused in my presentation.
<P>
	I will now go back to the motion presented by the member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata. It reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the House condemn the government for the refusal by the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage to publish the government's decision concerning funding for 
the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) for the next three years, thus 
causing an ominous threat to loom over the CBC's French-language network.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This motion got my attention and my support right from the 
start for various reasons. First of all, it clearly identifies the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage as being responsible for the very 
ambiguous situation the CBC-SRC is in at the present time, 
which affects both its listeners and employees. There is great 
uncertainty regarding the future role of the corporation and the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage is to be blamed for it.
<P>
	The minister's attitude discredits any expertise that might 
have developed within the Canadian public service and the 
CBC-SRC. It also discredits the function of the minister since 
we have repeatedly and systematically been told by the 
president who resigned, Mr. Manera, and by the vice-president, 
Mrs. Fortin, that there will be significant and drastic cuts at the 
CBC-SRC. These statements were not made on the sly. Mrs. 
Fortin held a two hour televised teleconference which was 
broadcasted across the country, during which she explained the 
impact of the cuts to all the services of Radio-Canada. One of 
her listeners said that Mrs. Fortin had shared her anguish and 
feelings of powerlessness with her audience. She said she did 
not know what the future holds for the French network of the 
CBC.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	Therefore, following this evaluation by an employee which 
reflects the feelings of people following this presentation, the 
official opposition asked the minister to tell us what the impact 
of the cuts would be. The only answer we got was that no cuts 
were planned when, in fact, documents available from the CBC 
show that a program of cuts is in the works. They mention cuts of 
$44 million for 1995-96, more than $96 million for 1996-97 and 
$165 million for 1997-98.
<P>
	Such cuts are already part of the CBC's future and it must plan 
its actions accordingly. When dealing with television or radio 
production, decisions must be made months in advance to 
determine which serials will be shown in the years ahead and 
what will be the direction followed by the corporation. The 
vagueness of the minister and the lingering uncertainty he is 
fostering are doing tremendous damage to the future of the 
corporation.
<P>
	Why did the official opposition consider important to draw 
the attention of the House on this subject on a designated day? It 
is because we realized that, after all is said and done-and there 
is a lesson to be drawn here for both networks of the Canadian 
Broadcasting Corporation-because of the quality of 
programming, because of the way Radio-Canada has managed 
to identify with Quebec, there is during prime time about 87 per 
cent of Canadian programming and only 13 per cent of foreign 
programming. Its impact was that TVA, a private network, 
followed suit and used a mix of 73 per cent Canadian and 27 per 
cent foreign programming. TQS made sure it had 65 per cent 
Canadian content. We realize that Radio-Canada really has the 
power to promote Canada's and Quebec's culture because of the 
content of the programs it airs and makes known.
<P>
	The English network is much less able to do this because it 
does not capture as much of its potential audience and, for 
example, networks like Global carry 80 per cent foreign content 
during the same time slot, from 7 to 11 nightly. Pay television 
carries 94 per cent foreign content. The CTV network, which is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10801"> 10801 </A></B>
<P>
in some ways an overblown take-off from TVA, carries 75 per 
cent foreign  content. Therefore, there is a significant difference 
in the audiences' perceptions, which Radio-Canada has been 
able to use to develop a complicity with its audience and to 
ensure the propagation of the country's culture in a way that the 
English network has not necessarily been able to do.
<P>
	Some may believe that higher budgets made it possible to 
obtain these results. The opposite is true. If we look at the spread 
in production costs, the average amount allocated per hour of 
programming at the Société Radio-Canada is $18,390; at the 
CBC, the amount is $37,496. The average cost of one hour of 
news on Radio-Canada is $7,000; on CBC, the same thing costs 
$18,000. The average cost of one hour of French variety shows 
is $30,000; in English, it is $141,000. Therefore, we cannot 
attribute Radio-Canada's success in capturing a bigger audience 
and in propagating Canadian culture to its budget. There are 
other reasons.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	If we stubbornly continue to cut the CBC's French-language 
network, this will eventually have a direct impact on the 
quantity and quality of production. We are no longer cutting fat 
and looking for surpluses. This will have a direct impact on 
production and, among other things, on the ways we collaborate 
with the cultural community.
<P>
	In the past, the French network often contributed to the 
dissemination of all art forms by giving contracts for concerts, 
dance performances and other cultural activities. In the future 
however-as was announced at Mrs. Fortin's press 
conferences-spending cuts will have a negative effect on 
cultural production and the potential for adequate cultural 
dissemination. The CBC's French-language network is being 
unfairly penalized, since cutting 25 cents out of every dollar 
does not have the same effect as cutting 35 or 50 cents from $4 or 
$5. The cuts will have a much more detrimental impact on the 
French-language network. In this regard, I think it is important 
for the House, which is preoccupied with sound budget 
management, to ensure that the cuts are fair.
<P>
	The cuts currently planned at the CBC do not reflect a 
commitment to the fair distribution of public funds. The first 
person responsible for this misinformation is the minister 
himself because, by refusing to give us the real figures, he is 
adding to the insecurity of CBC employees and of all those who 
want this network to continue providing in the future the type of 
collaboration for cultural dissemination that it used to offer in 
the past.
<P>
	Mrs. Fortin also said during the closed circuit TV program in 
which she explained the impact of the cuts that national 
television would never be the same, because there will indeed be 
major consequences for francophones in all Canadian 
provinces. CBC's French-language network is somewhat like an 
umbilical cord linking all French-speaking Canadians to the  
national production made in Quebec, while also allowing the 
broadcast of regional productions.
<P>
	During consultations on the social program review, I travelled 
across the country last year and I can tell you that, in several 
regions, the French network only has the bare minimum to 
survive. The decisions to be made regarding CBC's 
French-language network could have the effect of depriving, in 
a significant way, access to information in French for part of 
Canada, and that could go two ways, in the sense that, for 
example, French-speaking people in Vancouver, Edmonton or 
Charlottetown would neither have access to information from 
Quebec, nor be able to familiarize the rest of Canada with their 
reality.
<P>
	The cuts will result in a less varied and more limited 
programming for these people, given the drastically reduced 
budget of the corporation. Choices will have to be made and the 
whole French-speaking community outside Quebec may end up 
paying the price, possibly even more so than the majority in 
Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Manera resigned from CBC because the commitments 
made to him when he joined the corporation were not adhered to. 
After the public announcement of cuts by the vice-president of 
CBC's French-language network, and after the minister's 
claims that he is not sure whether cuts will be made, the 
employees of these networks are even more disheartened.
<P>
	I much prefer the attitude of Mrs. Fortin, who says they will 
sit down together and see if they can still make interesting things 
in spite of the cuts to be made, to that of the minister, who 
refuses to provide the exact numbers. Indeed, Mrs. Fortin seems 
much more aware of the needs of the corporation's employees, 
that is those who ensure the daily production.
<P>
	What can we do to ensure that, in the future, CBC's 
French-language network can continue to fulfill its mandate 
without being adversely affected to the point where it would no 
longer be able to provide the same quality programming for the 
Canadian public? I think the minister should provide the 
accurate figures regarding the cuts to be made and then ask 
employees of the corporation, those who work there, to tell him 
where these cuts could be made and what their impact will be.
<P>
	For example, I was told that, each year, or on a regular basis, 
CBC must spend $15 million to get CRTC's approval for its 
programming. Considering the anticipated cuts-we are talking 
$45 million for the first year, 1995-1996-$15 million could 
significantly help reduce the impact of such cuts.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10802"> 10802 </A></B>
<P>
	People might be willing to make cuts at corporate 
headquarters because, as is the case with other organizations, 
it is obvious that in the different branches, different service 
points of the CBC, staff is already at the minimum required to 
ensure adequate production and adequate coverage of 
information, whether it be in the cultural or other sectors.
<P>
	Would it not be possible for the corporation to make a special 
effort at headquarters? Could we not, as a result, possibly delay 
the effect the cuts might have on production in the short term? I 
think that these are avenues that could be studied in the future. 
Maybe we could ask the minister to consider these suggestions. 
And let us remember that this is happening in a context where 
the federal government is saying that francophone minorities in 
Canada are important to it. They want to make sure that they 
receive quality services. They want the French fact to be alive 
and well everywhere in Canada. On the other side of the House, 
and on this point I concur with the hon. member for Richelieu 
who spoke before me, they sing two different tunes. There is one 
for the election campaign, the election platform, and another, 
which is the reality that the Liberal Party is promoting as a 
government.
<P>
	If we take away from the French communities of Canada the 
possibility of expressing who they are, we are going to widen the 
gap between elements to a point which will not leave the French 
fact in Canada enough vigour to survive. By taking even more 
from them we would be like depriving them of oxygen. I think 
that the Minister of Canadian Heritage, who is in a way 
responsible for culture in Canada, should ask himself very 
serious questions before taking such action.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	We have the feeling that, after telling us during the first weeks 
following the election that he was a good friend of the CBC and 
would ensure that the corporation had all the resources needed to 
develop, the minister became a lackey to the finance minister 
whose job is to cut expenditures.
<P>
	His inability to properly defend culture in Canada and his 
narrow vision which encompasses only one Canadian culture are 
enough to convince him that we do not necessarily need two 
healthy television networks and that we could cut the oxygen 
supply to one of them so that we would only have one Canadian 
identity. We could come back to the bilingual television network 
we had in the beginning, but that would not reflect the reality in 
our country.
<P>
	I think it is important for this House to consider the motion 
before us today and to ensure, first of all, that the minister 
clearly indicates where the cuts will be made-what seems to 
me like a responsible thing to do-and second, that no cuts will 
be made in areas that could hurt production and the delivery of 
adequate services to Quebecers and Canadians alike.

	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
question for the hon. member. Is culture in Quebec so fragile 
that it takes Radio-Canada to keep the culture together? I 
suggest the culture has not been built by a radio or television 
station or network. The culture has been built by centuries of 
people working, playing and living together.
<P>
	After all those centuries is the culture so fragile that we need a 
government owned television and radio network to sustain it? 
That seems absurd to me. I would like the member to respond to 
the question.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, there are more than two oceans in 
Canada. There is also an ocean of difference between the hon. 
member's position and my own. I am starting to understand 
some of the identity problems of English Canada. If a member of 
this House considers that culture is not transmitted by the 
media, by radio and television and the information highway and 
the rest, all the different ways we communicate, I am beginning 
to understand why some people have trouble distinguishing the 
border between Canada and the United States.
<P>
	What I have just heard gives me the impression that they 
could live anywhere on this planet, that being Canadian or 
American is the same thing. And I realize why they are so afraid 
we will leave. They think that after we have left, the Canadian 
identity will cease to exist.
<P>
	Before the advent of the printed media and the electronic 
media, culture was transmitted orally. A people was distinctive 
in terms of its artistic endeavours, its inventions, its scientific 
progress and its trading traditions. These are the elements that 
together represent the culture of a people.
<P>
	Media like the CBC, both the French and the English 
networks, use images to show us the country we live in and the 
people who live there with us. Wanting these media to survive 
and produce quality programs does not mean our culture is 
fragile. It proves the importance of communicating that the 
culture.
<P>
	That is why, for instance, we have networks like TV5 that 
group francophone television channels from all over the world. 
The English networks do the same. I think it is important to 
realize that in the global village of the future, in the world of 
tomorrow, networks like the CBC are the tools of the future. 
Wanting to maintain the CBC does not mean our culture is 
fragile. It means ensuring that it has a future and that it can take 
its rightful place, in Quebec or in Canada, depending on what 
Quebecers decide.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it seems that 
the government has decided to axe the CBC. We are told that 
cuts of about $375 million will be made over the next few years. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10803"> 10803 </A></B>
<P>
The minister also seems  unwilling to disclose these cuts, but we 
do not know why. That is the question that we are asking 
ourselves today.
<P>
	As a member of Parliament who is promoting the sovereignty 
of Quebec, and seeing that the current government is axing the 
CBC, I ask myself this question: Would it be preferable for the 
government to simply privatize the CBC, so that the money 
saved could be used to reduce taxes in Quebec and to allow the 
government of Quebec to support Radio-Québec? 
Radio-Québec could then respond to the needs of Quebecers the 
same way as the CBC has done it before, since it will not be able 
to do so in the future.
<P>
	What does the hon. member think of this suggestion?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not think it is strictly a question 
of privatizing the national network. In Quebec and Canada, 
there is the issue of production. For example, in order to ensure 
an adequate coverage and the broadcasting of programs 
reflecting what we really are, it was decided long ago in Quebec 
that we would create Radio-Québec. Because Quebecers had 
worked for the CBC, they also wanted to be involved in a 
television which would picture Quebec adequately in the future. 
That probably brought about much higher expenses than what 
should have been.
<P>
	The solution probably lies in better defined jurisdictions. It 
should be clear who is responsible for an area, who will have the 
power to levy taxes and who will have the spending power. 
Someone should have the authority to sign international treaties, 
on networks like TV5 for example, in order that we may be sure 
the money is really spent on production and not on some 
competition which is not always appropriate and which causes 
useless expenditures and squandering.
<P>
	Today, we refuse to question the principle of the existence of 
the CBC, but we are cutting its air supply at the source. Well, 
why not try to seek the solution elsewhere? Perhaps we should 
first understand that there are two cultures in Canada and that 
each of them must have the adequate tools to ensure its own 
development.
<P>
	It is also easy to see the ripple effect of the CBC on the quality 
of programs and on the fact that the French network airs many 
more Quebec content programs during prime time hours. These 
programs promote what we are and, for various reasons, they are 
quite superior to whatever is shown on the English network. 
Therefore, we can be proud of the results, at least on the Quebec 
side.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin Cauchon (Outremont, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I had 
a chance to read the motion introduced by the hon. member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata and I can say that I was not surprised at 
all.
<P>
	Members across the aisle have a philosophy which is behind 
all the actions of their party. I have said and I repeat that the 
members of the Bloc Quebecois are not in this House to defend 
the interest of Canadians and Quebecers. They are here for one 
reason only, their own interest, which is the separation of 
Quebec at any cost.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	Once this leitmotiv and this philosophy are understood, it is 
not surprising to see motions like the one we now have before us. 
Why such a motion? It is simple. It is because the CBC has for 
many years promoted the Canadian identity and our culture and 
it has promoted what we are. The CBC has played a role in our 
unity and in the development of the French fact in Canada, not 
only in Quebec but also outside Quebec, because there are 
indeed francophones outside Quebec, a reality that very much 
frightens the Bloc Quebecois. Therefore, it is not surprising to 
see that kind of motion which is an attempt to adversely affect 
the CBC, this national monument and institution of which I am 
extremely proud.
<P>
	Indeed, we are in a period of fiscal austerity. The federal 
government is in a period of fiscal austerity and so are the 
provinces. The Minister of Finance's budget, and may I remind 
you that this budget has been tremendously well received by all 
Canadians, which proves that this government is a responsible 
government, has lightly touched the budget of the CBC in an 
effort on the part of the minister to put some order in the 
government's fiscal house.
<P>
	There is some bad faith on the other side of this House. I think 
that this budget indicates clearly the intentions of this 
government regarding the CBC that we want to preserve. There 
was a small reduction in the budget. As you know, the budget of 
the CBC is in excess of $1.1 billion. There is a budget reduction 
for 1995-96. What we are saying is that we want to go ahead 
with a reform of the CBC that will take into account the 
evolution of Canadian society, of our political context and of our 
country as a whole.
<P>
	When we talk about reform, we always talk about changing 
the institutions so that they can evolve at the same pace as the 
rest of our society. That is what we intend to do with the CBC.
<P>
	It is not in the interests of the official opposition that we go 
ahead with our reforms. Their sole objective is to show that the 
system does not work so that they can eventually bring about the 
separation of Quebec. They create a very destructive climate 
that unfortunately serves no one's interests.
<P>
	When we were elected to form a new government, we said that 
we would proceed with major reforms. Such reforms can be 
implemented if everybody works together and pulls in the same 
direction. However, that is not good enough for the official 
opposition. Of course, they take their orders from their party's 
head office in Quebec City and since their party is in power in 
Quebec, the orders are not to co-operate with the federal 
government. They are afraid that co-operation could lead to a 
solution to the present situation and to a slide toward Canadian 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10804"> 10804 </A></B>
<P>
federalism which would be in the best interests of all the 
provinces and in line with the Canadian reality.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	Quite the contrary, they chose to withdraw from the process, 
unfortunately. The head office, the Parti Quebecois in Quebec 
City, has unfortunately done so in many areas, such as the 
environment. In that area, they have withdrawn from a 
Canada-wide consultation committee-Quebecers should know 
these facts-a committee set up to fine tune the relationships 
between provincial governments, to fine tune Canadian 
federalism and to make Canada grow and also, by the same 
token, to make Quebec grow.
<P>
	Those are the actions taken by these people who want to go 
backward instead of moving forward. You know, when we say 
we want to go ahead with reforms, and also to strive to create a 
better system, this is possible. The Minister of Finance 
demonstrated that in his budget.
<P>
	Let us consider, for example, the issue of social program 
reform. How many provinces asked us, in the area of social 
programs, for some decentralization in order for them to gain 
more autonomy and to be able to shape programs, to a greater 
degree, according to local, regional and provincial realities? It 
was nearly a unanimous request.
<P>
	When we look at the finance minister's budget, we find a 
positive answer. We see that there is some decentralization and 
that we created a new Canadian social transfer, a transfer that 
gives provinces more autonomy and that invites provinces to sit 
down with the federal government and develop national 
standards that would apply coast to coast.
<P>
	That is what Canadian federalism, an evolving federalism, is 
all about. That is the new political reality. It is a reality that 
requires politicians throughout Canada to work together in 
co-operation. But those people do not want to function, they do 
not want to move forward.
<P>
	Instead of spending their energy on improving Quebec's 
position within the Canadian federation, they choose to waste 
public funds. That is something. In 1995, instead of trying to get 
the public finance in order, instead of trying to take measures so 
that Quebec can still have a place within the federation-an 
enviable place, an important one-and be influential 
internationally, the newly elected government in Quebec simply 
tries to achieve one goal, separation, and to do so, it uses public 
funds and wastes them shamefully.
<P>
	The regional commissions on the future of Quebec are a good 
example of that kind of waste of public funds. They represent 
not only a loss of money, but also an incredible loss of time. I 
can assure you that I am a true Quebecer and that when I see 
members opposite do what they are doing now, I know deep in 
my heart that we are not making any progress with them. They 
have a negative vision of things.
<P>
	Canadian federalism did contribute to the development of the 
French language in Canada and to the development of the 
French-speaking people living outside Quebec. And the federal 
government will keep on doing so, it will keep on improving 
Canadian federalism.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	And that is not all. Not only does Canada permit the 
francophone community within its walls to reach out, but, as the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs mentioned, Canada is also involved 
in the international francophone community and enables the 
francophone face of Canada to shine internationally.
<P>
	We do it and we do it alongside the Province of Quebec, since 
the Province of Quebec sits at the table of the international 
francophone community at the invitation of the federal 
government. We are so successful at this that we recently 
established TV5 with other francophone countries. Is there any 
finer international success than TV5? Is there any finer success 
for the francophone community than TV5? Therefore federal 
government actions shine forth not only nationally but 
internationally.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to say that, if we work hand in hand, 
we could protect our invaluable CBC and, doing so, could also 
enable it to provide the same services in the future it has 
provided in the past. These services have enabled the French 
language to shine forth and allowed Canada to express its 
linguistic and cultural duality not only coast to coast, but around 
the world.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would point out that we do not have to listen 
to anyone who is not working constructively and who is bent on 
destroying the country. We also do not have to listen to anyone 
who, when it comes time to act in their own bailiwick, does 
something far worse than we can do. Take, for example, the 
issue of Radio-Québec. To go back to the beginning, for all of 
these reasons, you will see that the hon. member's motion was 
predictable when we look at the principles underlying their 
political actions, and I find it quite unfortunate that they take 
nobody's interests into consideration. The only interest they 
serve is their own, and their interest is to see the day Quebec 
separates. If we work together, let me tell you because I have 
travelled in the province of Quebec many times, we can give 
Quebecers what they want, a progressive and constructive 
society.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be here a long time if I 
say everything I have to say about what was just said. In any 
case, I probably will use up the five minutes I have at my 
disposal. On to my reply.
<P>
	He says that there is a philosophy behind each of our actions. 
So much the better. This is what gives us depth and allows us to 
think articulately. I just heard a bunch of unrelated comments on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10805"> 10805 </A></B>
<P>
various issues, but almost nothing about my motion. He seized 
the opportunity to talk about everything and anything.
<P>
	Francophones outside of Quebec, of course we know they 
exist. We have reminded the House of their existence since we 
were elected. The Liberals forgot about them for the nine years 
they were the opposition. They forgot about Quebecers. They 
forgot about Francophones outside of Quebec. They did not even 
speak French in the House anymore. It was us who put French 
back on the map. We were the ones who built it up again, not the 
hon. member for Outremont, not the Liberals opposite who 
forgot about French for nine years. They have nothing on us 
when it comes to this issue.
<P>
	He did not realize that the budget cuts Radio-Canada's 
funding by $679 million over three years. He did not even read 
the whole thing through. That is only for the Department of 
Canadian Heritage, and half of it would have gone to the CBC. 
The member accuses us of acting in bad faith. He talks about a 
reform. We have nothing against progress. I believe that 
everyone should have access to the information highway. But in 
the meantime, can we continue to walk on a gravel road? Can we 
keep our television? The member also said that if we all worked 
together, and went in the same direction-this is beginning to 
sound like the ewe the minister spoke of the other day.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	On a more serious note, he says that the CBC reflects a 
Canadian reality. This may be true for the English-language 
network, but the French-language network reflects the Quebec 
reality. Just ask Mrs. Fortin who, when she appeared before the 
heritage committee, was told to try to better reflect the Canadian 
French-speaking reality. For example, with adequate funding, 
CBC's French-language network could produce soaps from the 
Prairies.
<P>
	The member referred to the head office. He said that we work 
for the head office, or as some would say, the mother house. I 
was brought up by nuns and I have no problem with the concept 
of mother house. In the context of multinational corporations, 
we often refer to head offices. But what do they do with their 
subsidiaries, with Michel Bélanger, Daniel Johnson and 
Stéphane Dion? This is no better. It is exactly the same thing. 
The head office in this instance is Power Corporation.
<P>
	The member also referred to what he called-hear me out, I 
want to get this right-the NCST, the new Canada social 
transfer. I hope this will not turn out to be what we anticipate. 
The member alluded to the costs incurred by the commissions. 
He said the exercise was a waste of time. To respect democracy 
and consult people is now a waste of money. This is 
preposterous. How much is spent on Canadian unity? Two 
hundred dollars a day for each of the spies in each of the 
commissions. You can figure out the total, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	The member crows about the international Francophonie, 
which is in fact the result of the efforts of the leader of the 
opposition when he was Canada's ambassador to France, as well 
as then Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and then Quebec 
Premier Pierre-Marc Johnson. These three true Quebecers cared 
about the future of Francophonie, not about seeing 
French-speaking Canadians disappear through assimilation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cauchon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not realize I had annoyed 
the hon. member so much. We will return to a situation of calm 
and talk about serious things, that is, the CBC.
<P>
	I will be brief. When they say there is a philosophy behind 
their thinking, which gives them vision, it is unfortunate that 
this vision is not shared by anyone in Quebec, because they see 
things only one way and that is from the standpoint of 
separation, which I find unfortunate.
<P>
	She talks of the hearings of the regional commissions, but we 
could say a few things on the subject. All that they have done is 
prove the vision of the present federal government right. People 
told the opposition member's head office that they wanted 
attention to be paid to the debt and to the deficit, that they 
wanted attention to be given to the issue of job creation and that 
they wanted attention to be paid to economic development.
<P>
	How is it that only the hon. members opposite have failed to 
understand? For the past year and a half we have been busy 
organizing public finances and reforming government 
machinery, and I must add, successfully. The latest budget of the 
Minister of Finance is remarkable.
<P>
	In opposition, they refuse to hear what the people are saying. 
It is quite simple, however. They have to let go of something that 
dates from bygone days, from the 1960s. Quebec has changed.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	Quebec now has its own instruments of economic 
development. Quebec is a Canadian power, which now is felt 
worldwide. These people are acting as if we were still in the 
1960s. They are reacting as if they had been colonized. I do not 
feel they are part of my generation.
<P>
	In conclusion, I am proud to be a Quebecer. I have no 
complex. I am proud to belong to the big Canadian family and to 
go forth together with these people.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simon de Jong (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with interest to other government members 
talk about the importance of the CBC and what great friends they 
are of the CBC. With the government and its members having 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10806"> 10806 </A></B>
<P>
introduced a budget that severely cuts the CBC, one could say 
that with friends like that who needs enemies.
<P>
	I listened particularly to the member talk about the need to 
reform, the need for a new CBC and how the reform should take 
place in a co-operative way. I agree that there are new realities, 
modern realities and a need for change, but I would like to ask 
the member: Is the government not going at this a little 
backward?
<P>
	Before introducing cuts and changes to the budget, it has to 
first think through where it wants to see the CBC end up. 
Everybody agrees that with the cuts the CBC cannot fulfil its 
legislative mandate.
<P>
	Why has the government not first thought through what type 
of public broadcasting it wants before it introduced the cuts? 
Could government members explain what the CBC should be 
like with these cuts? What is the vision of the member and the 
government of a new ``reformed CBC''?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cauchon:</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague's question is quite 
interesting. He says that we are going ahead with major cuts. I 
believe we did not read the same budget.
<P>
	The budget says that we are reforming the CBC budget as a 
whole for 1995-96 but we did not talk about cuts afterward. We 
are doing exactly what the hon. member would like the 
government to do. We are going ahead with major reform of the 
CBC's mandate because the government is aware of the 
financial situation of the country.
<P>
	We have to take care of the financial situation. At the same 
time we have to look into the future. In so doing we have to look 
at reforming the whole system. We have to look at the social 
safety net and at reforming the system. We will do the same with 
the CBC.
<P>
	I believe my colleague's question is a bit premature at this 
stage because we did not announce any major cuts to the CBC. 
There is $1.1 billion a year in the budget for the CBC. There is 
something for the year 1995-96 but thereafter we are doing 
exactly what the member would like us to do. We are reforming 
the system.
<P>
	I am sure the Minister of Canadian Heritage will come back to 
the House after the standing committee looking at the reform of 
the mandate makes a decision.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will try to get back to the motion without 
getting overly excited. The motion says the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the House condemn the government for the refusal by the minister of 
Canadian Heritage to publish the government's decisions-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would like to start from that point. The member for 
Richelieu made a brilliant speech regarding the double talk of 
the Liberals these last thirty years. He gave us numerous 
examples where pre-election decisions are not implemented 
after the elections, where pre-election promises are not kept 
after the elections. This is in fact double talk, but there is also a 
lack of transparency when one refuses to tell the facts, when one 
prefers to remain  silent. It is the thrust of the motion introduced 
today in the House.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	I would like to read one or two little paragraphs from the red 
book, because they make an accurate description of the CBC's 
present situation. In the little red book, a few sentences relate to 
the CBC- this one, for example: ``At a time when globalization 
and the information and communications revolution are erasing 
national borders, Canada needs more than ever to commit itself 
to cultural development. Instead, the Conservative regime has 
deliberately undermined our national cultural institutions''. So 
this was a criticism this government was making then of the 
Conservative government.
<P>
	I go on: ``Funding cuts to the Canadian Broadcasting 
Corporation, the Canada Council, the National Film Board, 
Telefilm Canada, and other institutions illustrate the Tories' 
failure to appreciate the importance of cultural and industrial 
development''. I draw the attention of members to the fact that 
the government is doing now exactly what he considered 
unacceptable on the part of the Conservative Party.
<P>
	This is what Liberals wrote in their little red book, before the 
elections, of course: ``Liberals recognize not only that the 
promotion of cultural industries contributes to enhancing 
Canadian identity, but also that cultural products create jobs at 
home and bring in revenues from abroad''. What do we see later 
on? Job losses, lay-offs and also, probably, losses of revenue. 
Here is a last little sentence, again from the red book: ``Finally, a 
Liberal government will be committed to stable multiyear 
financing for national cultural institutions such as the Canada 
Council and the CBC''. That is, the opposite of what we are 
doing now. ``This will allow national cultural institutions to 
plan effectively''. We can see the consequences of the decisions 
made today.
<P>
	This is why Mr. Manera resigned. Because he could not plan 
for the long term. When you are a high level manager wishing to 
manage public affairs in a coherent manner, you demand 
coherent funding, which was not given. The cuts to the 
CBC-SRC fly in the face of the position stated in the little red 
book. We are denouncing the discrepancy between the decisions 
being taken and the government's stated position, as we have 
done every time it has not been true to its position.
<P>
	I would like to point out that we are not the only ones to do it. 
Some government members also denounce this kind of activity. 
I will mention, among others, my hon. colleague, the hon. 
member for Gander-Grand Falls, who spends the greater part 
of his time haunting the corridors at Revenue Canada and who, 
every couple of months, explains either in this House or in the 
press, how his government refuses to go and get the money 
where it should, in the pockets of rich Canadians who are not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10807"> 10807 </A></B>
<P>
paying any taxes. It is not the Bloc Quebecois who is saying this, 
but the member for Gander-Grand Falls.
<P>
	I will also mention the remarks made by my hon. colleague, 
the member for York South-Weston, who tells us that every 
time the government goes after or wants to go after social 
programs, it is doing exactly the same thing it was denouncing 
when the Tories were in power. It is not the Bloc Quebecois who 
is saying this, it is the Liberal member for York South-Weston. 
I am also coming back to the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, who delivered a cutting speech in this 
House on how Canada's social programs did not cause the 
country's deficit. He concluded his speech on this issue by 
saying that he would probably vote against the budget. We will 
see what happens when the time comes.
<P>
	This means that this method of doing things, which we 
denounce today, was amply decried by the hon. members of the 
current government. Of course, the minister does not wish to 
disclose anything when answering questions in the House. He 
has answered about 10 questions already, I think, regarding the 
CBC's budget versus the statements made outside of the House 
by the management of the CBC. The minister refuses to get his 
feet wet. The CBC's president is forced to resign, saying that 
$350 million will be cut, yet the minister refuses to confirm this 
figure.
<P>
	Ms. Fortin says that 750 positions with the French network 
will be cut or abolished, yet the minister refuses to confirm the 
figure, claiming that it is all still hypothetical. Lastly, the media 
state unanimously that the minister's statements are 
inconsistent.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	We are not the ones saying it, it is the newspapers who are 
saying it every day. There will be major cuts which will have a 
dramatic impact on both networks, but will probably hit the 
French network harder than the English one. There are actually 
great discrepancies between the two networks. I am referring to 
what the hon. member for Rimouski-Témiscouata explained to 
us so well when she said that, in general, television programs 
produced for the French network cost less than those produced 
for the English one, and have a bigger public.
<P>
	I am also referring to a report submitted to the committee by 
the Coalition pour la défense des services français de 
Radio-Canada. This coalition represents producers, artists and 
others involved in producing French-language services for the 
CBC. According to a summary of its agenda-I believe the 
House should hear this-the coalition for the defence of CBC 
French-language services denounces the disproportionate 
distribution of program resources between Canadian public 
television programs, depending on whether they are going to 
anglophones or francophones.
<P>
	Further, Canadians are not entitled to public services of 
equivalent quality, if they are French speaking or English 
speaking. This is not only unfair, but in violation of the 
CBC-SRC mandate, as stated in the Canadian Radio-television 
and Telecommunications Act. The coalition's support to the 
renewal of the French and English networks licences is 
conditional upon this iniquity being remedied. It recommends 
that the CRTC attach to the renewal of CBC-SRC licences the 
obligation to provide both networks with equal program budgets 
by the year 2001.
<P>
	In its report, the coalition identifies three specific areas that 
require particular attention and to conclude asks that the CRTC 
step in to force the CBC-SRC to act on these problems as a 
matter of priority. We know where all this leads: to drastic cuts. 
All under the pretext of having a budget to produce and an 
enormous debt to deal with.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has in fact tabled recently in this 
House a budget with teeth. This budget does have teeth, but not 
for just anyone. It does not have teeth when it comes to family 
trusts for example. Family trusts will finally be abolished, but 
only in four years from now, to give those who have an interest 
in family trusts to get their most trusted tax consultants and 
review the whole gimmick that enables them to avoid taxes.
<P>
	This budget has no teeth when it comes to tax havens. There 
are still tax havens and those who use them to keep their profits 
outside of the country do not pay a cent in taxes in Canada.
<P>
	This is not exactly a budget with teeth for the banks either. 
Banks will be required to make a small effort. Peanuts, really, 
considering the astronomical profits they made this year. While 
individual taxpayers are asked to tighten their belts to the last 
notch, the banks get away with doing hardly anything.
<P>
	On the other hand, this budget definitely has teeth as regards 
the little people. That is obvious. It bites into the tender flesh of 
our farmers, milk producers and wheat producers. Of course, it 
calls for some assistance to be provided to allow Western wheat 
producers to adjust, but nothing for Quebec.
<P>
	It bites into UI. The UI system is not for the rich, but they bite 
off huge chunks of it anyway, without even swallowing the 
deficit. That is the beauty of it that if we have drastic cuts 
affecting the little people, it is because we have a growing 
deficit and debt.
<P>
	All the cuts made this year will not prevent this deficit and 
debt from growing, which means that more cuts will be required 
next year. The effects of the cuts announced this year will not be 
felt for another seven or eight months.
<P>

<P>
	This budget also compromises the future of our young people 
by forcing them to pay more to enrol in school in the hope of 
getting the few jobs that will be left when they graduate-and 
young people came to the Hill to show us that they understood 
this. So we end up with well-educated unemployed workers who 
are 80 per cent in debt. That is their lives. A big budget, indeed.
<P>
	They are already salivating over their proposed reform of the 
old age pension plan. A 72-year old man came to see me 
yesterday in my office. As a good Canadian taxpayer, he had just 
filed his income tax return. This individual earns $23,000 a year. 
Because he claimed a capital gains exemption this year as a 
result of selling his house on paper, he will have to pay back his 
old age pension benefits, which amount to $4,600 for the year. 
There are now many people in the same situation who, while 
preparing their tax returns this month, will realize the extent of 
the cuts that have been announced but will only be felt in a little 
while.
<P>
	I heard my hon. colleague tell us with a smile up to his ears 
that this budget had been well received throughout Canada. I am 
not sure that we read the same newspapers. Some fairly 
well-known people were quoted in the newspapers. The day 
after the budget was tabled, Roy Romanow said that it was 
``un-Canadian''. And he used this term repeatedly. An indignant 
Bob Rae claimed that health care and social assistance budgets 
would be cut. All the newspapers headlined that Bob White was 
in a state of shock. And the CBC president resigned just after the 
budget was tabled.
<P>
	In the meantime, alone in Quebec in the shadow of Michel 
Bélanger, the so-called great defender of Quebec's interests, 
Daniel Johnson does not say a word. To stay on the subject of 
sheep, this could be called the silence of the lambs.
<P>
	All these measures do not change anything. The debt will 
continue to grow and the government will have to cut even 
deeper next year, just to fill in the holes. And the CBC's budget 
will be affected.
<P>
	That is why we tabled this motion, to stress that the heritage 
minister should undertake to give us accurate figures in order to 
avoid creating an unhealthy climate. The minister himself 
claims that he is responsible for this portfolio and that he is a 
friend of the house. I think it would be in the House's interest to 
be given accurate figures and to know exactly what decisions 
have been made by this government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guy H. Arseneault (Restigouche-Chaleur, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today, in this House, French-speaking members from 
outside Quebec were criticized on a few occasions. We also 
heard the Bloc Quebecois claim to be the protector of 
Francophonie outside Quebec. I wish to correct that view and 
make a comment based on an article published yesterday in a 
New Brunswick newspaper, <I>L'Acadie Nouvelle</I>, and written by 
the editor,  Mr. Nelson Landry. The article is entitled <I>The flower 
and the pot</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Following the war of words involving the Fédération des communautés 
francophones et acadienne du Canada, the FCFA, and Bloc Quebecois member 
Suzanne Tremblay, the two sides respectively deserve the flower and the pot.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. When we read an 
excerpt from a newspaper or other document, the rules are the 
same as if the words were our own. Consequently, we have to say 
``the member for'', instead of naming the person.
<P>
	The hon. member for Restigouche-Chaleur.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Arseneault:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The flower goes to the Fédération des communautés francophones et 
acadienne du Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Even if the stand taken by the FCFA on the referendum issue is not as firm as it 
should be, it is now clear that the federation is on the No side, something which 
was not quite clear a few weeks ago.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The FCFA hopes that Quebecers will vote no but, unfortunately, it will not go 
any further in its efforts to convince them of the virtues of federalism.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The federation deserves a flower for clarifying its stand, but only one. It will 
get the bouquet when it takes on the role that it should assume regarding this 
issue and actively participates in the No campaign, as is the wish of the vast 
majority of French-speaking Canadians outside Quebec.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The pot goes to the Bloc member for Rimouski-Témiscouata.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That member should think twice before opening her mouth. That could 
prevent her from talking nonsense as she did last week, when she said that the 
only way to save the French language in Canada is through a sovereign Quebec.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Such comments clearly show how little Quebec politicians know about the 
French fact outside Quebec.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As for the ``meddling'' argument, it is getting pretty thin. The Quebec 
referendum is a national issue, no matter what the hon. member and others say, 
and francophones outside Quebec have as much right to speak to this issue as 
Quebecers.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Francophones outside Quebec have kept silent for too long, which explains 
why it took so long before they obtained their language rights in some 
provinces. From now on, they will be heard loud and clear on issues which 
affect them, including the Quebec referendum.</BLOCKQUOTE>
The article is signed by Nelson Landry.

<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not sure if that was a 
question or a comment. My hon. colleague just talked about 
interference, but I do not know if he is making this quote his 
motto or if this statement reflects his opinion. Obviously, there 
is one thing which is clearly recognized by everybody in 
Quebec, which is that the future of Quebec will be decided by 
and only by Quebecers. I want to remind you of a famous 
statement made by Mr. Bourassa who is not a die-hard 
sovereignist: ``Quebec is now and for ever free to make its 
choices and master of its own destiny''. This is exactly our 
position.
<P>
	The hon. member for Restigouche-Chaleur-a marvellous 
riding I had the opportunity to visit and  where a lot of Acadians 
make you feel very welcome-quoted an article where it is said 
that were are wrong to argue that the only way for a nation to 
survive is to become sovereign and that one of my colleagues 
should think twice before making such a statement. But I would 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10809"> 10809 </A></B>
<P>
heartily agree with such a statement. The survival of Quebecers 
will only be accomplished through Quebec's sovereignty.
<P>
	You only have to think about all the minority groups 
throughout French Canada. In almost every part of the country, 
they were gradually assimilated over a number of years, and if 
there are French-speaking Canadians living outside Quebec 
nowadays, it is because with Quebec in the Canada 
confederation, these people can have a real political balance. 
However, we no longer think of ourselves as Canadians. We are 
Quebecers, and Quebec is our only country. So, we will become 
Quebecers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as we all 
know, we are debating a motion on the Canadian Broadcasting 
Corporation and the cuts it has suffered in the last budget.
<P>
	The comment I would like to make, and my colleague will 
have the opportunity to add to that when I am finished, is that the 
budget as a whole does not seem to be based on a corporate plan. 
What I mean by that is that the cuts appear to have been made at 
random. The CBC has had its share, as well as other government 
agencies and programs. There are consequences to all of that. 
The Americans have an expression for this type of random 
cutting and the consequences that follow.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	They call it dynamic scoring. What is it exactly? Well, it has 
been discovered that when cuts are made in one place, there are 
macro-economic consequences elsewhere. It means that in 
trying to save money here, we force people into unemployment 
there, which creates, in the economic cycle, a decline whose 
effects we do not always take the time to measure in advance. 
So, do we know how many businesses who provide services to 
the CBC will see their sales reduced because of these budget 
cuts that will force the CBC to buy fewer services from them?
<P>
	Do we know how many people will be laid off? Do we know 
how many of these people will be unable to find a new job in 
their area of expertise or in another area? Do we know by how 
much welfare costs will increase in each of the provinces? We 
have to realize that what happens with all these cuts-and the 
cuts to the CBC are no exception-is that the federal 
government is saving some money but is forcing the provinces 
to spend more on welfare. Not only have we shifted the problem, 
but we may well have made it worse.
<P>
	No macro-economic study supports the effects of what the 
Americans call dynamic scoring. We are making cuts at random, 
we do not have specific targets, we do not know where that will 
lead us and I think it is something that Canadians have a right to 
know. I would like my  colleague to comment on my perception 
of the way we are not being governed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all I would like to tell 
my hon. colleague that this is the first time I hear the phrase 
``dynamic scoring''. If I understand well, this is a little like 
skeet shooting, or shooting on the fly, at random, haphazardly. I 
think there is at least one conclusion that can be made in this 
House for the information of everybody here: a government 
cannot be run like a business. We often hear business people 
telling us that the government should be run like a business.
<P>
	Unfortunately, that is not possible, strictly speaking. While a 
company can lay people off and get rid of a problem because it 
has too many employees, the government, acting on behalf of a 
nation, can never do that without getting stuck with the problem. 
In other words, the government will have the people laid off on 
its hands in one way or the other, whether through 
unemployment insurance or social welfare; and, in the absence 
of major social measures, there will be increased violence and 
more social problems, people will go without medication or 
have incredible problems.
<P>
	Therefore, the government can never be totally run like a 
business, and I think dynamic scoring works even less for a 
government than for a business. Indeed I think budgets are made 
and cuts are made here and there-anyway it has been indicated 
in a document here-somewhat equally across the board, 
whereas we should have very specific cuts, as if made with a 
surgeons's blade.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: The 
hon. member for Ontario, Multiple Sclerosis; the hon. member 
for Québec, the Advisory Council on the Status of Women; the 
hon. member for Charlesbourg, National Defence; the hon. 
member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Land Claim.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simon de Jong (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to participate in this debate. While I agree with 
much of what the motion before us states, I must also hasten to 
add that I agree with the amendment introduced by the Reform 
Party that would strike out the words after the phrase ``for the 
next three years''.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	I must chide the Bloc members. As the official opposition 
they must also concern themselves with the whole country. The 
government has done a disservice to the CBC not just in Quebec 
but to the CBC and public broadcasting across this country. 
Therefore, I hope the amendment introduced by the Reform 
Party will be accepted by the House so we can vote in favour of 
the whole opposition motion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10810"> 10810 </A></B>
<P>
	The need for public broadcasting like that of the CBC is 
greater today than ever before. Both government members and 
Bloc members have mentioned this. Reform Party members 
have basically spoken against the CBC suggesting that it should 
be privatized and sold. I find them to be a bit sinister or really 
naive.
<P>
	Historically, every political party in Canada, whether from 
the left or the right have agreed there is a need for the state to 
intervene and to play an activist role in order to maintain a sense 
of national identity and a sense of cultural identity. The reality 
of a small, populated country like Canada living next to a very 
large, dynamic country like the United States means that if we 
are going to maintain a sense of who we are, we are going to have 
to do something in a collective way.
<P>
	As I have mentioned before, all the political parties, whether 
it was the Conservative Party, the Liberal Party, the New 
Democratic Party or the old Social Credit Party, whether they 
were parties to the left or the right, have agreed on this basic 
premise, except of course for the Reform Party. That is why I 
wonder whether the Reform Party really understands the 
national interest in this sense or whether it is naivety or sinister 
intent.
<P>
	If we did not have institutions such as the CBC, if we did not 
have a more interventionist government policy when it came to 
cultural issues, imagine what Canada would be like. Imagine 
what Canada would be like if we did not have the CBC. We 
would be totally Americanized. We would not have the jobs. We 
would not have the ability of Canadians to hear and see each 
other.
<P>
	It is in the national interest to maintain a strong Canadian 
cultural policy and a cultural identity so that we as citizens can 
hear and see each other. To let the market decide in the way the 
Reform Party advocates is doing a disservice to the country 
because we will not be able to hear and see each other.
<P>
	Market forces will operate and market forces are such that it is 
cheaper to have an American program on television during 
prime time than it is to have a Canadian program. The 
economics are such that it does not make any sense in terms of 
profit to have and produce Canadian programs. I would think 
that Reform members would understand that.
<P>
	Let us turn to the record of this government. It has not been a 
good one when it comes to cultural matters. It started off with 
Ginn publishing. It has the inability or lack of desire to stand up 
for Canadian publishing companies to ensure they remain in the 
hands of Canadians so that Canadian writers will have their 
works published.
<P>
	Then we come to the budget. The minister of heritage had 
given public assurance to the CBC that its funding would not be 
cut, that it would have stable funding for the next three years. 
Despite that fact, lo and behold on budget night we realized, it 
realized and the country realized the dimension of the cuts.
<P>
	It is now obvious from the budget that the CBC cannot carry 
out its legislated mandate. The government and the minister 
particularly have done a disservice by giving a false sense of 
security to public broadcasting and the CBC by stating that its 
funding would be assured for the next three years. It gave public 
broadcasting in this country that assurance. It was a false 
assurance and the government and the minister have done a 
disservice.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	Instead of the government thinking through what type of new 
public broadcasting should be initiated before it announces cuts, 
it instead has done the whole thing backward. It has announced 
cuts and who knows, maybe more will be coming. Rumour has it 
that we might see a budget this coming fall with more cuts.
<P>
	Rather than having a vision as to what a new form of public 
broadcasting should mean in Canada and how we can get the 
resources together to fulfil that, the government starts from the 
opposite direction. It decides how much it is going to cut and 
then lets the pieces fall where and how they may. That is not 
careful planning. It is not smart management. It is 
mismanagement. It is running the terrible danger of public 
broadcasting destroying itself in this country.
<P>
	The reform and changes government members talk about 
occurring out of blind cuts and slashes rather than something 
that is being done in an intelligent manner are now occurring 
within the CBC. The debate within the CBC now is whether it 
can adjust to the cuts other than just by cutting and cutting or by 
starting first to rethink what public broadcasting can and should 
be and then working from the ground up.
<P>
	In other words, the government is starting in the wrong 
direction and in the wrong way. Rather than rethinking things 
through and starting from the bottom and working up, it is 
jumping in with cuts and cuts. It is not thinking through what 
those cuts will mean and how they will be implemented. There is 
no blueprint, no vision about what public broadcasting should 
be.
<P>
	I do not have much time in this debate but I would like to put 
on record some of my suggestions and my vision of what public 
broadcasting should be.
<P>
	It should start from the ground up. The regions and regional 
broadcasting should be the heart and core of public 
broadcasting. I would be furious if all the cuts were done at the 
regional 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10811"> 10811 </A></B>
<P>
level and the head office was not touched at all. I am critical of 
past CBC cuts for not attacking the head office and instead 
attacking the regions as was done in the 1980s.
<P>
	I think we all agree and I think the people within the CBC also 
agree that the head office remains bloated. It does not need the 
hundreds and hundreds of people in the financial section. I 
believe there are 200 people dealing with the relationship of the 
CBC, the CRTC and the government. It can be much meaner and 
leaner on that level.
<P>
	The CBC has to be based on the regions, the alliances and the 
networking in which producers, creators and reporters can work 
at the regional and local community level. The national system 
should be an alliance, a bringing together of the different 
regions forming a national system.
<P>
	The internal relations between management and employees 
have to change. They are changing. It is already happening. It 
has to be accelerated. Sitting in on the committee, I heard some 
very positive things of what the CBC is doing.
<P>
	For example in Windsor, a station that was shut down, the 
CBC and the employees got together and said: ``Okay, let us 
reopen this''. It is operated in an entirely different way. 
Producers, technicians, reporters and performers are all working 
together in a non-adversarial, non-hierarchical way. Lo and 
behold, even the reporter or the producer will carry the camera, 
or plug in the lights. There is not a strict code that differentiates 
the jobs that the different unions and the different technicians 
and people do. It is a whole different way of operating a station.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	I understand this is working well and it is exciting. It is a way 
the new creative juices can flow. That is exciting. As I see a 
reformed public broadcasting and a reformed CBC, I would like 
to see the winds of experiment done all across the country.
<P>
	In the same vein, another point I would like to bring forward is 
a more syndicalist approach as a solution to the problems of the 
CBC. I know in the first round of cuts in the 1980s the CBC shut 
down the Saskatoon station. I understand that the employees in 
Saskatoon wanted to run the station. They tried to buy the 
equipment to run the CBC station in Saskatoon themselves.
<P>
	This should be highly encouraged. The workers within the 
CBC should have the ultimate control, not some hierarchy in 
head office in Ottawa or Toronto. It is the local actors, the local 
producers, the local reporters, the local technicians working 
together in a co-operative way operating our television and 
radio stations. A more syndicalist approach is what I would 
advocate as a model for the CBC to seriously consider.
<P>
	In closing, I must mention my disappointment with the 
Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage. I am an associate 
member and not a full time member on the committee. This 
committee has been meeting since last fall and it still has not 
tackled the fundamental issues. It keeps going around in circles. 
Part of the problem is that  this government has no sense of 
leadership and no vision to present to the committee.
<P>
	If anything, I would tend to think that the government 
members on that committee are more divided among themselves 
as to what direction public broadcasting should be going in. 
There is no understanding that the degree of cuts the CBC is 
facing will necessitate a total change in the mandates. We have 
not had a discussion in terms of seriously looking at the 
mandates. I would tend to think that much of the work the 
committee has done has now been made obsolete by the speech 
the Minister of Finance delivered on budget day. We have to go 
back to square one and look at what the legislated mandate of the 
CBC is and start from there.
<P>
	The government's lack of vision and lack of direction when it 
comes to public broadcasting is doing a disservice to the CBC. 
This government is being driven by the finance department, not 
that we do not have a serious problem when it comes to debt and 
deficits. Politics in Canada will be defined in terms of how 
different political parties propose to deal with the debt and 
deficit.
<P>
	This government's reaction to public broadcasting is not a 
wise one. It is not an intelligent one. It is not one that has been 
thought through. It is being driven by the finance department. In 
the end, it might cost Canada even more money or loss of the 
resources we have built up over the years in our public 
broadcasting system.
<P>
	Hopefully, the House will accept the amendment of the 
Reform Party and that we will be able therefore to support the 
motion as presented to us by the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 5.15 p.m., it is my

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="COMMUNICATIONSSECURITYESTABLISHMENT">COMMUNICATIONS SECURITY ESTABLISHMENT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from December 13, 1994 consideration of 
the motion and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
evening we are debating a motion put forward by the hon. 
member for Scarborough-Rouge River. The motion states that 
the operations of the Communications Security Establishment 
should be reviewed by another body, notably the Security 
Intelligence Review Committee or SIRC.
<P>
	The Communications Security Establishment or the CSE 
carries on two functions. It listens to other people's 
communications and tries to ensure that no one listens to us. It is 
a spy organization supposedly involved in foreign intelligence. 
This sounds very interesting, knowing the kinds of technology 
out there, which allow the spies to gather all sorts of private 
information.
<P>
	Today it is possible to intercept any telephone call, any telex 
or any fax. In fact, with a fairly inexpensive piece of equipment 
in the back of a van it is possible to reproduce through 
electromagnetic radiation emissions what somebody is typing 
on their computer screen three blocks away. This is called 
electromagnetic eavesdropping.
<P>
	According to a House of Commons special committee report 
entitled ``In Flux But Not In Crisis'' dated September 1990, this 
technology has important implications-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I wonder if we 
could ask the co-operation of the House. So we might proceed 
with Private Members' Business in an orderly fashion, would 
those members who have business outside the Chamber please 
take it outside the Chamber.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> Mr. Speaker, thank you. For a moment I thought 
I was still in question period. The report that was commissioned 
by the House of Commons special committee entitled ``In Flux 
But Not in Crisis'' dated September 1990 said that this 
technology has important implications with respect to 
individual rights and freedoms.
<P>
	The report states that it is likely that CSIS uses this 
technology in its operations. The CSE is capable of employing it 
as well and that it shares information with CSIS. The report 
questions whether these intrusive techniques are used against 
Canadians and landed immigrants. There is even some question 
whether electromagnetic eavesdropping technology constitutes 
an offence under the current provisions of the Criminal Code. 
People 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10816"> 10816 </A></B>
<P>
using this technology can go undetected because there is no need 
to break and enter or trespass other people's property in order to 
use it.
<P>
	The report goes on to state that the committee believes the 
CSE should get a judicial warrant before using electromagnetic 
eavesdropping. Does the CSE do this before beginning its 
investigations of foreign governments, foreign companies or 
foreign individuals? Who knows?
<P>
	There are a lot of things we do not know about this 
taxpayer-funded operation. We do not know how much it spends 
because its budget is buried somewhere in the Department of 
National Defence expenditures. We do not know how many 
people work there because those numbers are not published. We 
do not know whether the CSE is doing what it is supposed to do 
because it has no mandate. All we have are educated guesses.
<P>
	In a background paper entitled ``The Communications 
Security Establishment: Canada's Most Secret Intelligence 
Agency'' dated September 1993, a parliamentary researcher 
concludes that in 1991 the CSE's budget was in the $100 million 
to $125 million a year range. This figure did not include an 
additional $150 million in personnel and other support provided 
by Canadian forces.
<P>
	The same background paper places the number of employees 
at 875 in June 1993 although that does not include the 1,100 
persons assigned from Canadian forces to operate in various 
monitoring stations in Canada, Bermuda and Germany.
<P>
	The cold war is over. We may be involved in some minor 
external skirmishes over fish and some major internal battles 
over who stays in Canada and who does not and what stays in the 
federal budget and what does not. The rationale for keeping the 
Canadian public in the dark about this secret agency no longer 
exists, if it ever did in the first place.
<P>
	The bigger danger is that this agency gets involved in 
something that it has no business in, like spying on Canadians, 
or that it does something illegal.
<P>
	Right now the CSE is accountable to no one. It is true that the 
Minister of National Defence approves the major capital 
expenditures of CSE and its annual multiyear operational plan 
and its major initiatives that have significant policy or legal 
implication, but the CSE reports to the deputy clerk of security 
intelligence in the Privy Council on policy and operational 
management. The right hand cannot be held responsible for what 
the left hand is doing and vice versa.
<P>
	No government agency should escape review. Every 
government agency should be accountable to someone or some 
body that is accountable to the Canadian public. Canadians have 
a right to know whether the CSE actually spent $125 million or 
even $275 million in 1991. Right now we do not know that. 
Furthermore, they have the right to know how much was spent 
last year and what the budget will be for next year.
<P>
	The CSE has 875 listeners on its payroll who are intercepting 
communications of foreign government, foreign companies and 
foreign individuals. Someone should be watching and listening 
to the listeners.
<P>
	My colleagues and I will support the motion made by this 
member on Private Members' Business and any amendments 
that will make this body more accountable to the Canadian 
public. My understanding is there are two amendments to this 
motion. The first is by the member for Bellechasse which asks 
the CSE to table an annual report in the House on its activities.
<P>
	The second is by the member who proposed this motion in the 
first place. The second amendment changes the motion so that 
an independent body rather than SIRC reviews the 
Communications Security Establishment. This amendment 
serves to further strengthen the motion. I commend the hon. 
member for Scarborough-Rouge River for putting forward this 
motion and I hope he gets the support from all of his colleagues 
in the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to speak on this subject.
<P>
	I am aware that my colleague is going to prepare an 
amendment to the motion, which I am very pleased to see. 
Without actually mentioning the amendment I believe he will 
pose it by a point of order perhaps after I finish speaking.
<P>
	I want to make three definitions. I will be using them quite 
frequently. CSE is the Communications Security Establishment. 
CSIS is the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. SIRC is the 
Security and Intelligence Review Committee.
<P>
	I am very pleased about the amended wording. It puts the 
intent of what the hon. member wants to do in better perspective. 
It is important at this stage because it is really essential to the 
understanding of why the amendment to the motion was put 
forward.
<P>
	I want to define foreign intelligence. Foreign intelligence 
refers to information or activities concerning the capabilities, 
intentions or activities of foreign states, corporations or persons 
in relation to the defence of Canada or the conduct of 
international affairs of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	It may include information of a political, economic, military, 
security or scientific nature. Canada, unlike most of our allies, 
does not have an offensive foreign intelligence service.
<P>
	However, like most countries Canada has established modest 
means to collect and analyze foreign intelligence. Since World 
War II the main departments of the Government of Canada that 
have been major actors in the foreign intelligence sectors have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10817"> 10817 </A></B>
<P>
been the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade 
and the Department of National Defence.
<P>
	The Canadian Security Intelligence Service was established 
in 1984 under the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act. It 
has a specific mandate as our domestic intelligence agency. It is 
charged with protecting Canada's security and is to provide 
security intelligence respecting potential or actual threats to 
Canada or to Canadian citizens.
<P>
	There are two principle threats to national security that CSIS 
was established to investigate under the authority of the CSIS 
act. These threats are espionage directed against Canada by 
foreign states and seriously politically motivated violence that 
can take the form of terrorism.
<P>
	The CSIS act establishes a strict regime for CSIS 
investigations to ensure that the rights and freedoms of 
Canadians are preserved while protecting Canadians from these 
threats to their safety and security. It is evident there will be 
problems with the Security Intelligence Review Committee's 
looking at the Communications Security Establishment.
<P>
	The Security Intelligence Review Committee was established 
specifically to review the Canadian Security Intelligence 
Service which, unlike the CSE, does not have a direct role in the 
foreign intelligence sector.
<P>
	The CSIS act spells out exactly what SIRC is meant to do. The 
CSE mandate under its SIGINT program is the collection, 
analysis and reporting of foreign intelligence in the context of 
the government's foreign intelligence policy.
<P>
	Therefore it would not be appropriate at this time to amend 
the CSIS act which falls under the responsibility of the Solicitor 
General to incorporate within SIRC's mandate an institution 
like CSE which after all falls under the responsibility of the 
Minister of National Defence, whose accountability is 
established through other means.
<P>
	Moreover, SIRC already has a variety of investigative duties. 
It deals with complaints and acts as an appeal board with respect 
to security assessments and security influenced decisions under 
the Citizenship and Immigration Act.
<P>
	The sensitive intelligence responsibility of both 
organizations needs separate and distinct oversight 
mechanisms. CSIS therefore is Canada's domestic intelligence 
agency, with SIRC which has a mandate and the expertise to 
oversee such activities.
<P>
	CSE is a foreign intelligence organization and the skills and 
knowledge base required to review foreign intelligence activity 
is totally different.
<P>
	CSE has two programs. First, it provides technical advice, 
guidance and service on the means of federal government 
telecommunications security, including aspects of electronic 
data processing. The elements of this program are referred to in 
the business as INFOSEC, information security.
<P>
	The other aspect is signal intelligence, SIGINT as it is known 
in the business. There has been concern raised in some quarters 
that CSE operates without adequate accountability. It may be 
useful to outline in more detail what I understand to be the 
accountability stature of CSE in place right now.
<P>
	The Minister of National Defence is accountable to 
Parliament for CSE. The minister approves CSE's capital 
expenditure, its annual multiyear operational program and, with 
appropriate deputy minister level consultations, approves major 
CSE initiatives with significant policy or legal implications.
<P>
	The chief of CSE is responsible to the deputy minister of 
national defence for financial and administrative arrangements 
and to the deputy clerk, security and intelligence and counsel in 
the Privy Council Office for policy and operational matters. 
Both of these deputy ministers report directly to the Minister of 
National Defence for these CSE matters.
<P>
	In addition, arrangements have been put in place that CSE 
responds to the government's foreign intelligence requirements 
in a manner that is lawful, effective and sensitive to changes in 
international relations. That is very important and it includes the 
following provisions.
<P>
	It has an in house legal counsel from the Department of 
Justice and consults with senior justice officials on legal issues. 
It submits strategic plans and all new policy proposals for 
review by the interdepartmental committee on security and 
intelligence. It is subject to Department of National Defence 
administrative review mechanisms.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	CSE operates within all Canadian laws, including the 
Criminal Code, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
and the Canadian Human Rights Act. Furthermore, it is fully 
subject to review by the offices of the Privacy Commissioner, 
the Official Languages Commissioner, the Auditor General and 
the Canadian Human Rights Commission. A broad 
accountability system for CSE is thus in place.
<P>
	The special committee on the CSIS act, while recommending 
that SIRC oversee CSE, also stated it had found no evidence of 
abuses by CSE. Obviously the government would consider 
appropriate means to strengthen oversight for the CSE if a clear 
need were demonstrated.
<P>
	CSE is an integral part of the foreign intelligence sector I have 
described and plays a crucial role in that sector. What it does not 
do, as the Minister of National Defence and the Prime Minister 
have already assured the House, is target Canadians. We must 
take care that whatever course of action we decide does not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10818"> 10818 </A></B>
<P>
weaken CSE's ability to support our national interest. That is the 
decision which faces us now.
<P>
	We want to create an efficient, economical and appropriate 
form of oversight for this agency, one that enhances current 
accountability mechanisms without impeding the intended and 
mandated function of CSE or SIRC.
<P>
	The proposed amendment by my colleague will lead us in the 
right direction. I look forward to the support of my colleagues in 
the House which I hope and believe is forthcoming.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in relation to this motion there has been significant 
consultation back and forth across the House. I think you would 
find the consent of the House to make the following 
amendments.
<P>
	I believe we will have the consent of the hon. member for 
Bellechasse for the withdrawal of his existing amendment 
proposed in connection with this motion; second, that the 
motion be restated to clarify intent and to incorporate the intent 
of the amendment made by the hon. member for Bellechasse.
<P>
	Therefore, the amendment would read as follows. I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting all of the words after the word 
``should'' and by substituting the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Establish an independent external mechanism to review the operations of the 
Communications Security Establishment, CSE, similar to the role played by the 
Security Intelligence Review Committee for the Canadian Security Intelligence 
Service and table a report annually in the House.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> First of all, I would like to 
know whether the hon. member for Bellechasse wishes to speak 
on his amendment. Does he withdraw the amendment?
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker, 
I agree to the withdrawal of my amendment the way the hon. 
member for Scarborough-Rouge River described it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	(Amendment withdrawn.)
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
someone said earlier, the member for Bellechasse withdraws his 
amendment and subscribes to the amendment presented by the 
member for Scarborough-Rouge River, which we, members of 
the Bloc, intend to support, as I have already said.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	Listening to the speech made earlier by the parliamentary 
secretary to the Minister of National Defence, I asked myself a 
few questions on the meaning of what the member said about the 
CSE being accountable to the Department of National Defence 
at the administrative level and to the clerk with respect to its role 
and its latitude, so to speak. I find it a bit strange that we count 
on the Department of Defence to monitor the administration of 
the CSE.
<P>
	I made the effort to do some research in the Defence budget 
and I will give you a few examples which are very obvious when 
we find out that it was the Department of Defence which 
monitored the CSE.
<P>
	I noted a case concerning the acquisition of a Secure 
Telephone System-Phase 1 for which the estimate was 
established at $8,824,000. When the acquisition was made, the 
cost rose to $14,151,000, 61 per cent higher. It was the role of 
the Department of Defence to monitor the CSE's administrative 
costs.
<P>
	Here is another example. From April 1 to March 31, 1993, 
money was invested in a Restricted Access System for which the 
estimate was initially established at $23 million. When the 
acquisition was made, the system's cost shot up to $51 million, 
117 per cent over budget. And it was still under the 
administrative responsibility of the Department of Defence.
<P>
	One more example. On March 31, 1994, work was finished on 
an integrated teleinformatics network, approximately 75 per 
cent of which was for the use of the CSE. The projected cost was 
$41,650,000, but it ended up costing the modest sum of $78 
million. That was also a project under the administrative control 
of the National Defence.
<P>
	I have many more similar examples of purchases of highly 
sophisticated electronic surveillance or telephone equipment, 
software, etc. Like many other stakeholders in this issue, we 
have determined that the CSE was to serve the Department of 
Foreign Affairs, the RCMP and also the Department of National 
Defence, that its main function was to collect information from 
communications outside Canada, but that it was not ever 
supposed to collect information from communications 
happening within Canada. However, the official opposition 
signalled several cases where it had done so and the Prime 
Minister denied it at first. Afterwards, he said that orders had 
been given so that it would never happen again and that was 
corroborated by the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of 
National Defence.
<P>
	The Minister of Defence also said that the CSE was under his 
trusteeship, and that of his deputy minister, and that no other 
form of control was necessary since we knew very well what was 
the role of the CSE, the Communications Security 
Establishment, and that in no way, shape or form could there 
ever be some 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10819"> 10819 </A></B>
<P>
eavesdropping into communications between Canadians or 
within the boundaries of Canada. And now, a Liberal  member 
presents a motion for the review of the CSE operations and the 
Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party support it. I support this 
motion wholeheartedly and I will even add that, in my opinion, 
this motion is a very positive statement that should lead to the 
monitoring of the CSE operations. That is very important.
<P>
	I would also like to add that this is only a motion.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	Will we take the discussion further and really pass legislation 
to monitor the actions of the Communications Security 
Establishment? As I was illustrating with some examples, on the 
administrative level, I am not sure that the monitoring by the 
Department of Defence is adequate.
<P>
	I have quoted four or five examples where spending of 
millions of dollars had almost doubled on three occasions, and 
more than doubled on a fourth one. When this motion is 
unanimously passed in the House, it will be important to follow 
it up and to pass legislation which will allow for the 
management of the administrative aspect as well as the specific 
role of the CSE. We will then be able to monitor its interference 
in Canadian communications in order to insure that it does not 
intrude in the private lives of citizens, parliamentarians, 
business executives or other prominent people who may be 
asked to make decisions and whom the CSE could follow closely 
and sometimes monitor or report on, providing information 
which, under our Canadian system, is not acceptable.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to say that we support this motion. 
However, I would like to indicate that, unfortunately, we will 
have to return, in this motion, and probably in this bill, to the 
administrative deficiencies within the Department of Defence 
which the Auditor General has raised on several occasions.
<P>
	When we see in the budget of the defense department that the 
costs allocated to the CST may vary between $200 and $255 
million because Defense budgets contain some sophisticated 
material which will be used by the CST and for the 
communications of the defense department, I believe that a 
separation of some sort between these two elements should be 
integrated in the bill which will follow this motion. This will 
allow for a better control of the CST spending which, I believe, 
is sort of lost and not well administered by the Department of 
Defense since in the maze of acquisition of certain material too 
modern or ultramodern, it is impossible to say if the material is 
used at 100 per cent by the CST or at 20 per cent by the 
Department of Defense for the Navy or the Air Force.
<P>
	I have read the last five year budgets and I had some difficulty 
understanding in each case what was linked to the CST. I believe 
that situation should be clarified in order to avoid that a budget 
be assessed at $200 or $250 million and be confronted, after an 
evaluation for the acquisition of material, to increases of more 
that 112 to 117 per cent at the time this material is acquired.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak today on Canada's national 
security system and on the unique role played in that system by 
review agencies.
<P>
	The amended motion before us calls for the establishment of 
an independent external mechanism to review the operations of 
the Communications Security Establishment or CSE.
<P>
	I agree with the motion. It is my view that Canadians would be 
well served and would feel safer and more comfortable if they 
knew that this component of our national security system was 
overseen by both a cabinet minister and by an independent 
oversight committee.
<P>
	Experience gained over the last decade with the Security 
Intelligence Review Committee which oversees the Canadian 
Security Intelligence Service may hold important lessons for the 
future.
<P>
	The Security Intelligence Review Committee or SIRC was 
designed as a unique body to provide review for one particular 
agency, CSIS, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. It 
provides an appeal mechanism as well for matters involving 
security clearances that are from time to time required under 
certain statutes.
<P>
	SIRC was to fulfil its responsibilities within the framework of 
a national security system that is wider than SIRC and wider 
than CSIS and includes the Communications Security 
Establishment.
<P>
<B>(1825 ) </B>
<P>
	If the motion before us is to be successfully implemented, 
care must be taken to ensure that any new review body would 
have an appropriate role with respect to CSE. It must contribute 
as well in a positive way to what I would suggest is a delicate 
balance between the national interest and individual human 
rights, the hallmark of Canada's national security system.
<P>
	In 1984 the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act and 
the Security Offences Act were established. In these statutes a 
new legislative framework was created to govern Canada's 
national security system. The new legislation was designed to 
create the balance I talked about, a balanced and accountable 
system for the protection of Canada's national security interests 
and for the preservation of the democratic way of life of its 
people.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10820"> 10820 </A></B>
<P>
	Balance must be a distinguishing feature of any new 
legislation involving CSE, just as it is a distinguishing feature 
of the CSIS-SIRC legislation. I should like to categorize some 
balances that we need to maintain.
<P>
	First, we need to protect national security that has to be 
balanced by respect for individual rights and freedoms.
<P>
	Second, we need to provide the service with sufficient powers 
to produce effective security intelligence which we should then 
balance by statutory controls and strong policy direction.
<P>
	Third, as with CSIS there is a need to employ certain intrusive 
techniques. These should be balanced by the requirement for a 
prior authorization by a minister of the crown and the Federal 
Court, or at the very least that is what we do under the CSIS act.
<P>
	Finally the need for secrecy must be balanced by ministerial 
accountability and informed independent review. The principles 
of ministerial control and accountability are central to Canadian 
parliamentary democracy. The CSIS act ensured that the 
Solicitor General would have full knowledge and power of 
direction over policy. The act also equipped the minister with 
the means to direct and guide the service.
<P>
	There is also independent review through SIRC. 
Responsibility for the independent external review function was 
given to the Security Intelligence Review Committee that 
reports to Parliament through the Solicitor General. The unique 
role of SIRC is an innovative and important component of our 
national security system in the CSIS act. SIRC's review role is a 
cornerstone of the accountability framework established by the 
CSIS act and an important element of our national security 
system. SIRC has a mandate to review the propriety of CSIS 
activities with emphasis on the delicate balance between 
national security and individual freedom.
<P>
	Given SIRC's importance as presently constituted, it is my 
view that it would be inappropriate to expand its mandate to 
encompass review of CSE. Such a change would have the effect 
of either diffusing SIRC's functions with respect to CSIS or of 
diminishing ministerial accountability.
<P>
	I am certain hon. members would not wish to see SIRC's 
effectiveness diminished by such outcomes. To expand SIRC's 
mandate to review CSE would almost certainly mean increasing 
significantly the present number of SIRC members. This would 
require adding to SIRC's staff that has acquired an enviable 
expertise in the domain of security intelligence on a domestic 
basis. The skills and the knowledge base required to review 
foreign intelligence activity are totally different from that 
needed to review a domestic security service like CSIS.
<P>
	We need to examine closely the significant implications of 
what is being proposed in the motion before us. We are not 
without guidance. The experience we have acquired over the 
past decade with the existing  national security system can stand 
us in good stead by looking at CSIS and by looking at the roles 
that the minister and SIRC play in relation to CSIS. I would 
suggest that we look closely at those lessons and apply them to 
the motion before us today.
<P>
	The proven effectiveness of the national security system 
designed more than a decade ago is an excellent foundation upon 
which we can build. As we consider the motion our intention 
should be to continue the good work that has gone before, to 
build on that experience, and to create satisfaction within the 
community and within our country that the Communications 
Security Establishment is also accountable.
<P>
<B>(1830 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hon. member for 
Scarborough-Rouge River has given indication that he would 
like to have the final response under right of reply. The House 
must understand that no one will be able to speak to this motion 
after he speaks. He will close the debate because I must put the 
question at no later than 6.34 p.m.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is our hope that the motion we will pass here today 
will prove to be a benchmark in terms of parliamentary 
accountability.
<P>
	Under the rubric that nobody in this Parliament does anything 
by themselves, I want to note a number of members who played 
a part in developing this matter to the present. Among them are 
colleagues of ours on the national security subcommittee: the 
member for Bellechasse, from the Bloc Quebecois; from the 
Reform Party, the hon. member for Surrey-White 
Rock-South Langley; on the Liberal side, the member for 
Scarborough West, the member for Windsor-St. Clair and the 
member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine.
<P>
	I also acknowledge the co-operation and participation of the 
Minister of National Defence and his parliamentary secretary, 
the member for Bonavista-Trinity-Conception. There is also 
the fact that the Prime Minister was not disinterested in this 
issue and I acknowledge his role.
<P>
	I acknowledge members of the last Parliament, the national 
security subcommittee and in particular its chair, Mr. Blaine 
Thacker of Lethbridge, and various other parties, journalists 
both print and electronic, and other soldiers on the issue. They 
have worked hard to bring us to the present. Hopefully they will 
continue to work in this area. I thank my colleagues in the House 
for their support today.
<P>
	(Motion as amended agreed to.)

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="MULTIPLESCLEROSIS">MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in my 
recent question to the Minister of Health, I indicated that many 
Canadians suffer from multiple sclerosis. In fact, 50,000 
Canadians have MS. However, through medical research a 
number of drugs have recently been developed which have 
proven to be effective in the treatment of multiple sclerosis.
<P>
	One of these drugs is betaseron. In the United States this drug 
has been used to treat certain forms of MS for well over one year. 
Here in Canada there are over 15,000 Canadians with MS who 
could benefit from betaseron.
<P>
	Unfortunately, access to betaseron in Canada has been 
impeded because the health protection branch of Health Canada 
has yet to conclude its review of the drug. Betaseron is currently 
only available from the federal government's emergency drug 
release program at a cost of $17,000 or more for a year's supply.
<P>
	In the province of Ontario, the provincial government 
recently announced that it will soon be expanding its drug 
funding program to help those who require expensive 
medication. However, while those who require betaseron would 
then qualify for assistance, the drug itself will not be eligible 
until the review has been completed.
<P>
	I realize the health protection branch has specific guidelines 
to follow when any new drug is submitted for its approval to be 
distributed in Canada. Moreover, I am not suggesting that the 
integrity of the review process be compromised in any way, 
shape or form.
<P>
	The reviews undertaken by the health protection branch of 
any new drug are vital to ensuring the safety of Canadians. 
Nonetheless, Canadians who suffer from MS are understandably 
anxious to obtain greater access to affordable betaseron. They 
are also frustrated by the slowness of the review, especially 
since the health protection branch has agreed to use the 
so-called fast track approach.
<P>
	Berlex Canada Inc., the company which applied for the 
betaseron review did so back in February 1994. Yet over a year 
later, the review is still ongoing.
<P>
<B>(1835 ) </B>
<P>
	It was my hope from the question I asked the Minister of 
Health that she could provide additional information on the 
progress of the review of this drug. Given the important role this 
review plays in bringing about greater access to affordable 
betaseron, I know the minister would agree that the sooner this 
review is completed the better it will be for those Canadians who 
suffer from MS.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in response to my hon. colleague, the timely 
approval of a new drug treatment is a concern we all share. In 
this context I wish to emphasize that the drug he talks about, 
betaseron, has not yet been approved for the Canadian market.
<P>
	The drugs director of Health Canada is currently reviewing 
this drug on a priority or fast track basis. The manufacturer did 
not submit betaseron for approval in Canada at the same time as 
it did in the United States where the drug has already been 
approved. However under special circumstances, the 
Department of Health authorizes the sale of drugs that are 
currently marketed in other countries but have not yet received a 
notice of compliance in Canada.
<P>
	When a medical emergency exists and standard therapy is 
ineffective in treating the condition, some drugs, including 
betaseron, can be made available through the Health Canada 
emergency drug release program.
<P>
	While safety is the primary concern for Health Canada, the 
Patented Medicine Prices Review Board is responsible for 
regulating the prices of patented drugs. The board's jurisdiction 
applies not only to patented drugs sold under a notice of 
compliance, but also to those drugs sold under the emergency 
drug release program.
<P>
	Betaseron is a patented medicine. Therefore, the price of this 
product is being reviewed by the board.
<P>
	In conclusion and in response to my hon. colleague, I wish to 
assure him that Health Canada's drug approval process is aimed 
at ensuring that safe and effective medicines are made available 
to all Canadians in the most efficient and quick manner possible. 
Every effort has been made to expedite the review of betaseron 
without jeopardizing the health and safety of Canadians 
suffering from multiple sclerosis.

	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
March 16, I asked the Deputy Prime Minister how she could 
justify abolishing the Canadian Advisory Council on the Status 
of Women. My amazement and that of many women's groups at 
the government's decision was caused by the fact that this 
agency is known for its excellent research in areas of concern to 
women.
<P>
	As you know, the CACSW also analyzed the impact of 
policies and legislation on the status of women. Furthermore, it 
had acquired an excellent reputation as an independent agency 
that, although it was largely dependent on public funding, 
managed to maintain an arm's length relationship to 
government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10822"> 10822 </A></B>
<P>
	In reply, the Deputy Prime Minister mentioned the following 
to justify her government's decision, and I quote: ``Women's 
councils across the country were telling us that they were in 
a better position to do political analyses than people appointed 
by order in council''. This reply was surprising on two counts. 
First, I will deal with the so-called preference expressed by 
women's groups for doing their own political analyses.
<P>
	I urge the Deputy Prime Minister to reveal the names of these 
groups to the House. My request is perfectly reasonable, since 
all the reactions we have heard so far would indicate that the 
opposite is true. Whether we are talking about the Fédération 
des femmes du Québec and its affiliates or the groupe 
relais-femmes of the Association des collaboratrices et 
partenaires d'affaires, whether we are talking about the biggest 
national women's organization in Canada, the National Action 
Committee on the Status of Women, better known as NAC, the 
AFEAS, the University of Ottawa and Carleton University, 
grouped under the aegis of the joint department of women's 
studies, and finally, about certain editorial writers, they all 
regret the decision made by the Secretary of State for the Status 
of Women and her government.
<P>
	So where are the groups that supported the government when 
it announced this decision? Women's groups and the official 
opposition would be very interested to know who these groups 
are.
<P>
	They also want to know where the funding needed to resume 
research will come from. The government may have claimed 
that it decided to merge three agencies in order to save one 
million dollars, but when we realize that the budgets of existing 
organizations will not be increased in any way, we have every 
right to ask where the money needed for research will come from 
and where it will go.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	In concluding, I must mention the other reason given by the 
Deputy Prime Minister in answer to my question. She said it was 
important to let research be done by people who were not 
appointed by order in council.
<P>
	We were absolutely flabbergasted. The question 
automatically comes to mind whether the present government 
intends to get rid of all organizations and councils whose board 
members are appointed by order in council.
<P>
	There will be a revolution. One also wonders how 
open-minded her department will be when research findings fail 
to reflect what this government wants in terms of progress on 
issues concerning the status of women.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
amalgation of the Advisory Council on the Status of Women and 
Status of Women Canada took place as the result of a program 
review undertaken by the government. Aimed at streamlining 
government  operations, eliminating overlap and rationalizing 
resources, the program review looked at the three principal 
government agencies concerned with women's equality: Status 
of Women Canada, the equal opportunities for women program 
of Human Resources Development Canada and the Advisory 
Council on the Status of Women.
<P>
	We considered that an amalgamation of the three would, for 
the government, provide the best opportunity to concentrate and 
reinforce its ability to promote women's equality. Furthermore, 
by creating a single window, this amalgamation would improve 
communications and interaction between government, women 
and their associations. The rapports enjoyed by the equal 
opportunities for women program at the local level with 
women's associations will permit a direct link between the 
people and the policy development process.
<P>
	Transfer of the communications and research functions of the 
advisory council to Status of Women Canada will reinforce 
these bilateral exchanges. It will also eliminate the expense of a 
number of order in council appointments.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="NATIONALDEFENCE">NATIONAL DEFENCE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
March 14, I asked the Minister of National Defence about the 
dwindling enrolment in the Saint-Jean Royal Military College. 
His reply, which surprised me, was extraordinary because of its 
contradictory nature.
<P>
	In fact, in the first part of his reply, the minister says that the 
state of the economy is causing enrolment to decline. A 
farfetched argument which does not jive with reality or with the 
history of Canada's three officer cadet colleges, because during 
an economic crisis the proportion of enrolment requests for 
officer colleges compared with the number of requests to 
become a soldier changes. As usual, the minister is trying to 
compare apples to oranges.
<P>
	In the second part of his reply, the minister really went too far 
by blaming the weak enrolment on the official opposition and 
the Government of Quebec.
<P>
	I think it is time to render unto Caesar what is Caesar's. I will 
explain. On February 22, 1994, the Minister of National 
Defence announced that the Saint-Jean Royal Military College 
and the Royal Roads of Victoria would be closed under the 
pretext of savings, although, of all three colleges of the kind, the 
Saint-Jean Royal Military College was the least expensive to 
run.
<P>
	The day after, on February 23, the minister shed crocodile 
tears over the closure of Royal Roads and the Saint-Jean Royal 
Military College and said that it was necessary to close them for 
the good management of national defence. If this really were the 
case, neither the Government of Quebec, which was Liberal 
then, nor the official opposition could have had any influence 
whatsoever on this decision. The decision to close the 
Saint-Jean Royal Military College was and still is entirely in the 
hands of the Minister of National Defence. He  should stop 
playing 
<P>

<B><A NAME="10823"> 10823 </A></B>
<P>
childish political games and assume full responsibility for the 
decision he and his government have made.
<P>
	The defence minister and the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs are really laying it on thick when they try to blame the 
Quebec government and the Bloc Quebecois. Many 
English-speaking officers have already pointed out that it was a 
bad decision. Those who make a bad decision and are not mature 
enough to accept responsibility for it blame others, as the 
minister is doing.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	Furthermore, the minister contradicts himself in his March 14 
responses. In his first answer, he says that recruitment is down 
because the economy is buoyant, adding that ``the normal group 
of people who would be attracted to the armed forces has found 
other options''. In his second answer, he says that ``because of 
the uncertainty surrounding the disposition of the site of the 
former college at St-Jean, the advertising-was delayed a 
number of weeks-[but] recruitment is picking up''.
<P>
	The buoyant economy given as one of the reasons for 
declining enrolment in his first answer does not appear in his 
second answer. This buoyant economy must have been very 
fragile since it only lasted two minutes. For example, the 
Minister of National Defence also says, at the end of his second 
answer, and I quote: ``Twenty seven per cent of members of the 
armed forces are francophone and fully 24 per cent of all senior 
officers are francophone''. A senior officer is not a corporal or a 
sergeant, but a colonel, a lieutenant-colonel, a 
brigadier-general, a major-general, a lieutenant-general or a 
general.
<P>
	Only 14.7 per cent of generals and 21 per cent of colonels are 
French-speaking. I wonder where the minister's figure of 24 per 
cent comes from, unless he is referring to non-commissioned 
officers. This shows once again that the minister says what he 
pleases, without bothering to check the facts.
<P>
	In conclusion, the minister is inviting me to visit the 
department and the Headquarters here in Ottawa, and see for 
myself that people work in French as well as in English. I ask the 
minister to stop making fun of French-speaking Canadians by 
uttering such nonsense. I did visit the department on several 
occasions and what he says is not true, nor is it true as regards 
the Kingston College, which is not bilingual and which will not 
become so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to stress that Canadian Forces have always recruited 
French-speaking personnel and that they continue to do so. Our 
latest statistics show that about 27 per cent of members of the 
Canadian Forces are French speaking compared to 15.8 per cent 
in 1966. This is a substantial improvement. Also, about 24 per 
cent of commissioned officers are French speaking.
<P>
	As the Minister of National Defence was saying in this House 
a few days ago, recruitment for the training program of regular 
armed forces officers is lower everywhere in Canada and not just 
in Quebec. In the case of Quebec, the uncertainty surrounding 
the closure of the Royal Military College in Saint-Jean, 
uncertainty created by the refusal of the Government of Quebec 
to accept the umbrella agreement of July 19, 1994, has certainly 
played a role in the fact that we did not meet our recruitment 
objectives.
<P>
	The new institution, which will be born when this agreement 
between the federal government and the Saint-Jean region is 
signed, will offer preparatory courses to about 100 officer 
cadets, French speaking and English speaking. In order to meet 
its objectives regarding the proportion of French speaking 
officers, the Department of National Defence has extended the 
recruitment period for the training program until the end of 
April. We believe that it is still possible to attract the required 
number of recruits and that we will meet our objectives.
<P>
	I would like to stress that the recruitment campaign is not over 
yet and that it is still too early to draw final conclusions. I would 
also like to say that future French-speaking officer cadets will 
receive a very high level of education, in the language of their 
choice, at the Canadian Military College in Kingston.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="LANDCLAIM">LAND CLAIM</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address an issue which was brought 
to my attention the morning of March 17. It was reported that the 
Six Nation Indian Band has recently filed a lawsuit against the 
province of Ontario and the federal government. The suit 
reportedly seeks compensation for lost land, money from land 
sales, revenue from mineral rights, money taken from trust 
accounts and compound interest on these amounts dating back to 
1784.
<P>
<B>(1850) </B>
<P>
	A chief councillor of the band estimated the total lawsuit 
claim at about $400 billion. Let us put this legal suit in 
perspective. $400 billion is about 80-some per cent of the total 
current federal debt. The Six Nation Band is also seeking an 
inquiry and demands detailed accounting for all transactions 
involving assets, funds and real estate since 1784 to present.
<P>
	During question period on Friday, March 17 I asked the 
government for clarification on this issue with the specific 
intent of discovering whether the federal government was going 
to finance the Six Nation reserve lawsuit.
<P>
	I was told on Friday that my question would be taken under 
advisement and a response would be coming from the 
appropriate minister. I have made inquiries at the office of the 
minister of Indian affairs and I have been assured that a response 
would be available yesterday or at the latest today.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="10824"> 10824 </A></B>
<P>
	To this moment, I have yet to receive a response. This is a 
very serious court challenge and I am astonished that the 
government, considering $400 billion estimate, was unable to 
respond to my question on Friday. I am shocked by the fact that 
I have yet to receive a response from the minister's department 
as I was promised. However I suppose this is typical of how 
the government and many provincial governments have been 
dealing with native issues. They prefer the response of simply 
no response.
<P>
	Questions are left unanswered. Public debate is quashed. 
Negotiations are held in private and the taxpayer is left to pick 
up the bill. The taxpayers of Canada are seeking accountability. 
They want to know what these land claims will cost. They want 
assurance that the programs of Indian affairs will be reformed 
and altered to make them more effective.
<P>
	They want to know how the government can proceed with a 
self-government and land claims settlement agenda without 
first giving a clear indication of how much these land claims 
will cost, how much land is involved and clearly defining the 
term inherent right to self-government.
<P>
	These questions have been asked in the House and are yet 
unanswered. It is time for this Liberal government to come out 
of hiding and reveal to the Canadian people its actual agenda in 
respect of native land claims and self-government. Canadians 
deserve no less.
<P>
	In conclusion, the Department of Indian Affairs has sacred 
cow status among Liberals. I point to the recent budget as 
evidence of this claim. I have no fear in taking up the dagger of 
accountability and leading this sacred cow to the altar of public 
scrutiny in order to determine exactly where these billions and 
billions of dollars in the Department of Indian Affairs go.
<P>
	On behalf of the Canadian taxpayer, I will continue to press 
for clear and precise answers with respect to the expenditure of 
public money concerning native issues. Finally, I will press this 
case in the House, in the media, in my riding and wherever there 
is a concerned Canadian about how federal tax dollars are spent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to respond to the hon. member for 
Prince George-Bulkley Valley on behalf of the Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development.
<P>
	The hon. member has inquired whether the department has 
advanced funds to the Six Nations for a legal action against the 
province of Ontario and the federal government. Our hon. 
colleague from Haldimand-Norfolk has also expressed a real 
interest in this issue.
<P>
	I would like to first of all answer the very specific question 
posed by the hon. member. No funds have been provided to the 
Six Nations by the federal government for this legal action. I 
would now like to provide some clarification.
<P>
	The Six Nations Band served Canada with a notice of 
intention to commence an action against Canada and Ontario in 
December 1994. No statement of claim had been formally filed 
against Canada as of March 20, 1995, yesterday.
<P>
	Based on the notice of intended action the litigation deals with 
alleged breaches of fiduciary duty on the part of Ontario and 
Canada. These alleged breaches are in relation to land 
transactions dating from the Haldimand land grant to the Six 
Nations in 1784, as the hon. member said, and extending to the 
present day.
<P>
	The matters now in litigation have been the subject of 
approximately 24 specific claims which the Six Nations have 
been pursuing with Canada. No dollar amounts for damages are 
cited in the notice of intended action and no information has 
been provided to substantiate the estimated $400 billion quoted 
by the hon. member.
<P>
	The Six Nations have apparently chosen to pursue litigation 
rather than negotiate the outstanding specific claims. Under the 
specific claims policy, claims cannot be pursued in court and 
considered under the claims policy at the same time. The board 
has been informed that all Six Nations claims had to be held in 
abeyance and that the files would be closed.
<P>
	Since 1982 Canada has funded the Six Nations Band under the 
native claims contribution program. The program provides 
research funding to bands to allow them to pursue claims under 
the specific claims policy. Until the filing of the notice of 
intended action in December 1994 there was no indication that 
the band did not intend to proceed under the specific claims 
policy to resolve its grievances.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38 the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have 
been adopted. Accordingly, the House stands adjourned until 
tomorrow at 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.56 p.m.)
