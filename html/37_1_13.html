great weekend for female athletes from Prince Edward Island. 
Lorie Kane winning on the LPGA tour is becoming a regular 
occurrence, including her most recent win last Saturday after 
setting a tournament record in Hawaii with an 11 under par. Lorie 
has become the best female golfer in the world today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, history was made last weekend when Summerside native

</I></B></P><P align=left>I should like to take this moment to congratulate skip Suzanne 
Gaudet, mate Stefanie Richard, second Robyn MacPhee, lead Kelly 
Higgins, and coach Paul Power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have brought credit to their community and their province 
with their performance and their grace under pressure.  I wish 
them all the luck as they represent Canada at the 2001 World

Utah, where all of Canada will be cheering them on to win the 
gold medal.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is something that will shock the Liberals:  she completed

was done entirely with her own money and donations from

</I></B></P><P align=left>In Suzanne's own words “The purpose of my year 2000 photo

Vancouver in the year 2000”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this she has succeeded.  Her more than 2,000 photographs and 
stories stand as a testament to individual initiative and 
creativity.  I am proud to be recognizing her today in this 
House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, everyone 
knows that today is Valentine's Day, but I rise today to reflect 
on another truly loved symbol of Canada and Canadians, our 
Canadian flag.  Tomorrow marks the 36th anniversary of the first 
day that the flag became our country's distinctly Canadian 
national symbol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much more than a piece of coloured cloth, it is the symbol of a 
nation that is recognized around the world.  It was 36 years ago 
tomorrow that the flag was raised over this building and became 
our official symbol for a great nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of years ago I promoted flag day with a number of our 
elementary schools to provide young Canadians with the 
opportunity to better understand the significance of our flag.  I 
am happy to say that this initial undertaking has taken root and 
is now an annual tradition for me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tomorrow I will celebrate this day with the staff and students 
of the Good Shepherd Catholic Elementary School and the Gordon B. 
Attersley Public School in my riding.  I hope all Canadians can 
and will take a few minutes tomorrow to reflect on our flag, 
which is the embodiment of our common heritage.

for giving me the opportunity to work on their behalf in years to 
come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will work with others to preserve and promote Markham's 
position as Canada's high tech capital which, roughly translated, 
means, look out Ottawa.  I will also work with others to 
alleviate problems relating to immigration and transportation 
gridlock. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than half of the people of Markham are new Canadians and 
the town enjoys a very rapid population growth.  As a result, we 
have many citizenship celebrations.  I will be going to one such 
celebration tomorrow, and I look forward to many more in years to 
come.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Georges Farrah 
(Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on February 5, the Minister of National Revenue and 
Secretary of State for the Economic Development Agency of Canada 
announced that our government will be investing in 11 projects in 
Gaspé and Îles-de-la-Madeleine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This injection of close to $2 million in the regional economy 
will result in overall investments of some $7 million. In 
addition, our government's action will make it possible to create 
and maintain some one hundred jobs in Gaspé and the Islands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These contributions are a concrete example of our government's 
commitment to the people of Gaspé and Îles-de—la-Madeleine. They 
are a clear illustration of our desire to provide the proper 
support for economic recovery in these regions.

</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK12"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the government's attempt to buy 
popularity with Canadians by issuing energy rebate cheques has 
been an abysmal failure.  All Canadians are directly affected by 
high energy costs, but only a handful are eligible for the newest 
Liberal slush fund.  It is totally irresponsible to issue rebate 
cheques to prisoners and the dead while hard pressed millions are 
left out in the cold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the priorities of the government?  While Canadians 
freeze, hepatitis C victims still await money promised them by 
the government; our brave merchant marines have waited decades 
for compensation and routinely turn to food banks to survive; and 
farm families are being driven from the land by a lack of fair 
government compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However there is one quick solution to high home heating costs: 
remove the GST from all home heating fuels and give all Canadians 
a break this winter.  Home heating, like food and clothing, is 
essential to all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the government to stop buying votes and start providing 
legitimate government services to desperate Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
cardiovascular diseases impose a devastating burden upon 
Canadians, accounting for 37% of all deaths annually and placing 
a significant hardship and a diminished quality of life on those 
who survive and live with these conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost of cardiovascular diseases due to direct health care 
expenditures, disability, work loss and premature death is 
estimated to be over $20 billion annually to the Canadian 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada and the Canadian 
Cardiovascular Society are calling for us to look at a concerted 
strategy to address such common debilitating conditions as heart 
disease and stroke.  This strategy would be a first step toward 
the creation of a common and integrated nationwide approach to 
the prevention and the tracking of these chronic conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I applaud the energy and the efforts of these fine organizations 
and urge all my colleagues in parliament to look at their 
documentation and support this very fine effort.

is the day we celebrate love, and last night I had a lovely 
dream. I dreamed of Cupid. In this strange dream, he wanted to 
give me chocolates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He could not afford to, however, overtaxed as he was with the 
GST and an insidious tax on employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then he wanted to express his love, but his ability to express 
himself was limited by a gag and by this arrogant bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He persisted, however, and wanted to shout his love out loud. 
Brave fellow, his heart full of hope, he succeeded in doing so. 
He managed to get it out, but there was no one in the unilingual 
capital who could understand him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Poor depressed Cupid, away he went.  It seems that he was then 
arrested for carrying a bow and arrows when he got stuck in a 
traffic jam on one of the bridges.  Now he could go to jail, 
though he is just a kid.  Fortunately, that is when I woke up.

me to gain the experience and political footing required to begin

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday Canada sent a team of scientists to Brazil 
to determine if there is any justification for banning Brazilian 
beef.  I have no doubt that this is not about beef but about the 
illegal subsidies which the Brazilian government has provided to 
its aircraft manufacturer, Embraer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada has been granted the right to impose 
countermeasures against Brazil but Canada refuses to act.  Yet it 
insists on hiding behind the veil of mad cow disease, forcing 
Mexico and the U.S. also to ban Brazilian beef, which they object 
to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government continues in this vein, it will permanently

Canadians want governments to be above suspicion but not above 
the law, and so as the Shawinigan file continues to grow we 
continue to demand accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will remember Mr. Claude Gauthier as the man who bought 
the piece of land from the Prime Minister back in 1996 and then 
donated $10,000 to his 1997 election campaign.  He was also the 
gentleman who got the $6 million government contract, even though 
he was not qualified, and another $1 million from the 
transitional jobs fund.  Now it turns out that Mr. Gauthier also 
lucked into $9 million worth of immigrant investor funds after 
the Prime Minister met with those investors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would the Prime Minister not be concerned about this 
conflict of interest? 
<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member is quite wrong in his assertions when he 
alleges a conflict of interest.  I repeat that the immigrant 
investor program in the province of Quebec is a Quebec provincial 
program and is managed by the province.  It makes its decisions 
on people who are entitled to offer immigrant investor funds. The 
rules of the flow of funds are according to the rules of the 
Quebec provincial government.  The Prime Minister has nothing to 
do with those matters and has had nothing to do with those 
matters.

that Claude Gauthier bought the land from the Prime Minister that 
helped boost the value of his shares in the neighbouring golf 
course.  He then donated $10,000 to the Prime Minister's election 
campaign.  During that same period of time, Mr. Gauthier received 
$7 million from federal government programs, nearly all of which 
the auditor general says he was not entitled to.

Speaker, I want to again point out that what the Leader of the 
Opposition says about the views of the ethics counsellor are 
totally inaccurate with respect to this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an interview the ethics counsellor made speculative comments 
about a hypothetical situation.  At the same time, he insisted 
that he had not changed his original decision from last November. 
He reiterated in January that the Prime Minister was operating 
within the rules and that he had not broken any conflict of 
interest rules.  The ethics counsellor has maintained this 
position and the Leader of the Opposition ought to admit that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Deputy Prime Minister deals with 
material that may be up to four years old.  It is the ethics 
counsellor who finds the Gauthier case questionable.  It is the 
auditor general who has brought questions about receiving these 
funds.  It is the ethics counsellor and the auditor general.  Why 
will they not deal with this basic question of conflict of 
interest? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very clear that as the items continue to pile up on this 
file the questions continue to pile up.  I would like to know if 
there is actually some other information that the Prime Minister 
is aware of that he does not want us to know about, and that is 
really the reason he will not allow the solicitor general to move 
ahead with an independent investigation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the short answer is, absolutely not.  The Prime Minister 
acted correctly and ethically.  That was the finding of the 
ethics counsellor, which he has reiterated over and over again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Opposition ought to tell us why he is raising 
these matters.  Is it because he does not want Canadians to know 
that he really believes we are doing a great job on the economy, 
a great job on health and a great job on the needs of children? 
Why does the Leader of the Opposition not tell us that we deserve 
a valentine instead of raising these misleading and false 
assertions?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.

Edmonton North has the floor and every member will want to hear 
her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  The Prime Minister benefited from that 
very sale of the land that was adjacent to the golf course which 
added value to the shares that he was trying to sell in the golf 
course itself.  The Deputy Prime Minister tries to fog that over, 
not to mention the $10,000 political benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure Mr. Gauthier is good to know but it is obvious that 
the Prime Minister is better to know.  Mr. Gauthier got $7 
million from federal programs and another $9 million from 
investor immigrant funds.  The benefit to him is obvious.  Why is 
it not obvious to the Prime Minister that he is afraid of this 
independent investigation? 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, there was already an investigation by the ethics 
counsellor who found that the Prime Minister had acted within the 
rules.  If anybody else wants to carry out an investigation, they 
have the independent authority to do that.  It is not a matter of 
direction one way or another by the Prime Minister or the 
solicitor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts are that the Prime Minister had no interest in the 
golf course at the time of the land purchase.  I have been 
advised that Mr. Gauthier competed for a CIDA contract and won it 
because he had the lowest bid.   Why does the Alliance Party 
refuse to admit this simple fact? 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we will not admit it because we know it is simply 
not true.  It is not true and there is no way that the Deputy 
Prime Minister can defend that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conflict of interest guidelines are to prevent the appearance of 
conflicts, not just to prevent them from actually happening.  He 
can talk all he likes around the bush about it but it simply will 
not add up.  The relationship between Claude Gauthier and the 
Prime Minister has a very bad appearance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If these dealings are as innocent as the Deputy Prime Minister 
claims daily, then why will the government not just call for an 
independent investigation and clear the air? 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Maria Minna (Minister for International Cooperation, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member keeps talking about the

and that company's bid was 30% below the bids by the other 
companies.  It was a straightforward bidding process.

Telefilm Canada's new feature film policy is aimed primarily at 
increasing the market share of Canadian films from 1% to 5%. This 
policy ignores the Quebec reality, since the share of producers

to which a Canadian solution is being applied, without regard to 
the industry in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the Minister of Canadian Heritage if she is aware

whereas Quebec films will have to produce $455,000 to meet the 
same criteria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the minister how she will explain to producers of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the situation

</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is continuing her consultations.  Telefilm is 
continuing its consultations with all film producers across

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, indeed, it 
appears that the head of Telefilm is open to the idea of giving 
consideration to Quebec's situation and proposing a program more 
suited to the context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore ask the minister if she intends to support the

question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  Recently Canada 
established diplomatic relations with North Korea.  The regime in 
Pyongyang is signalling its interest in modernizing its economy 
with the latest technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the fact that North Korea's missile and nuclear program 
has contributed to uncertainty in the region and that it has 
withdrawn from the International Atomic Energy Agency, how will 
Canada approach engagement with this regime in terms of trade, 
regional security issues. and the need to encourage and promote 
North Korea into rejoining the atomic energy agency?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, first let me say that I think all members of the House 
recognize that President Kim Dae-jung of South Korea won the 
Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts in opening up the Korean 
peninsula and building peace there, very deservedly so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has followed his encouragement in establishing diplomatic 
relations with the north.  That provides us with an increased 
opportunity to work with the North Koreans in advancing Canadian 
values, including democratic rights, human rights, economic 
development and trade issues.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andy Burton (Skeena, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development.  The Morricetown Band Council in my riding receives 
nominal roll funding from his department to pay for its students 
enrolled in School District No. 54. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That money has been transferred to the band from the department, 
and yet the band refused to pay its commitment of over 
three-quarters of a million dollars owed to the school board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has the minister or his officials not intervened in this 
case and forced the band council to meet its commitments instead 
of withholding federal money meant to pay schooling costs? 
<P><A NAME="LINK121"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Robert Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not know the 
particulars of the case, but I will tell the member that the 
policy of the Government of Canada, as it relates to Indian 
affairs and the agreement we have with the province of British 
Columbia, is that if a first nation does not pay its tuition 
agreement to a board the Government of Canada through the 
department of Indian affairs will intervene to see that money is 
paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point there may be some particulars of the case which 
would not enable us to resolve that issue at this point.  I will 
take that under advisement and get back to the hon. member. 
<P><A NAME="LINK122"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andy Burton (Skeena, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the minister should know.  We have tried to contact his 
department in Vancouver with no response or no resolution.  My 
concern is for the education of the 120 children of the 
Morricetown band affected by this and for the huge shortfall the 
school board is encountering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister cannot force the band council to use its federal 
funding earmarked for education to pay its schooling commitments, 
why give the band council responsibility for the money in the 
first place?  Where is the accountability? 
<P><A NAME="LINK123"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Robert Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, without knowing the details 
of the case I just want to make it very clear to the member and 
his party opposite that we well know, because we listened to this 
during the last campaign, they take the view automatically that 
somehow a first nation is wrong, no matter what occurs across the 
country.  Without looking at the details that party believes that 
first nation people cannot run their own affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes when those funds are held back by the first nation 
band council it is because the board itself is not meeting its 
commitment to those children.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 2001 Canada will be hosting the IVth Games of la 
Francophonie. They will be held in Ottawa, the capital and a 
unilingual English city. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is true. These games will be held in Hull and also in 
Ottawa, which is unilingual. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, according to Statistics Canada, 91% of the population of 
the city of Ottawa speak English only— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is from Statistics Canada. Furthermore, again according to

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> Order, please. Obviously, there is a disagreement 
concerning the facts in this case, but the hon. member raised a 
point of order. I wonder what part of the standing orders is at 
issue here. I still have not figured it out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau:</B> Mr. Speaker, what is at issue here is 
simply that the House was misled by members who attributed to me 
comments that I never made by targeting the statement that I made 
under Standing Order 31, which is found on page 598 of 
yesterday's <I>Hansard</I>, dated Tuesday, February 13, 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you will be able to see that what was said in the 
House was inaccurate and that my integrity and honesty have been 
impugned. I ask these two members of parliament to withdraw their 
comments and to apologize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member has made his point. 
Unfortunately, in the House there are often times when one member 
quotes another but notfully.  We had several examples during Oral 
Question Period today. Often, in questions and answers, different 
portions of the same letter or article are quoted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not consider it a point of order when a member makes a 
statement in the House concerning something that was said 
elsewhere or even here in the House.  There may be disagreement 
among the members concerning the interpretation of remarks but 
it is not up to the Speaker to rule that this is a point of order 
or to require members to rephrase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the two members who spoke on this topic wish to withdraw what 
they said, that is a decision for them to make, but this is not, 
in my view, a point of order. 
<P><A NAME="LINK143"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, while I bow 
to the wisdom of your ruling, I would just like to raise one 
point not mentioned by my colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Beauséjour—Petitcodiac attributed to my 
colleague something he never said, to the effect that the 
francophones in Ottawa were unworthy of hosting the Games of la 
Francophonie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, this is an extremely serious accusation which could 
mislead all those now listening, and which did not arise from 
anything my colleague said but solely from the desire of the 
member and of the government House leader to twist our words, to 
make us look bad to francophones in the rest of Canada, when it 
is absolutely false, unfair and wrong, and they must apologize.

moved for leave to introduce Bill C-266, an act to amend the

definition of marriage by invoking section 33 of the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, today being St. Valentine's Day, it is my

Degrees) Act in order to protect the legal definition of marriage 
by invoking section 33 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is consistent with a motion passed by the House on June 
8, 1999, confirming the definition of marriage as a union of a 
man and woman, although not consistent with official NDP policy, 
nor the publicly stated policy of the member for 
Burnaby—Douglas, nor in fact the leader of the New Democratic

leave to introduce Bill C-267, an act to prohibit the use of 
chemical pesticides for non-essential purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said: Mr. Speaker, the purpose of this bill, titled an act 
to prohibit the use of chemical pesticides for non-essential 
purposes, is to place a moratorium on the cosmetic use of 
chemical pesticides in the home and garden and on recreational 
facilities, until scientific evidence that shows such use is 
safe has been presented to parliament and concurred in by a 
parliamentary committee. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill aims to shift the dangerous burden of proof.  As things 
actually stand, the public good bears the burden of proof.  We 
abundantly spray the pesticides in our yards and playgrounds, 
which are chemicals designed to kill.  Yet, we have no evidence, 
scientific or medical, that accurately demonstrates their safety. 
Thus we spray these pesticides at the expense of the health of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would reverse this situation by requiring proof of 
pesticide safety, which would have to be submitted to parliament 
and approved in committee before allowing their use.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>YOUTH CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK181">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK182"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-7, an act in respect of 
criminal justice for young persons and to amend and repeal other 
acts, be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Mr. Speaker, on February 5, 2001, I introduced into 
the House the government's proposed youth criminal justice act. 
Those who have been following the issue will be well aware of the 
extensive groundwork that supports this initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's commitment to reforming the youth justice 
system is longstanding and firm.  We reiterated our intention 
during the last election campaign and again most recently in the 
Speech from the Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-7 has benefited from the extensive review accorded its 
previous incarnations, Bill C-68 and Bill C-3.  Consultations 
before the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs were 
exhaustive.  As Minister of Justice, I heard from the provinces 
and the territories.  I have met with and listened to individuals 
and groups who work in the youth justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-7 retains the overall direction and all key elements but 
includes amendments from the consultation process which will 
reduce complexity, provide greater clarity and improve 
flexibility for the provinces. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have examined all of the recommendations in great detail over 
the past months.  We compared certain recommendations relating to 
the provinces' capacity to administer the youth justice system 
better. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not accept the rhetoric from the benches opposite and 
elsewhere that this piece of legislation is too tough or that it 
is not tough enough.  Those who seek to reduce the discussion of 
youth justice to such a simplistic paradigm feed misconception. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want a system that prevents crime by addressing the 
circumstances underlying a young person's offending behaviour, 
that rehabilitates young people who commit offences and safely 
reintegrates them into the community, and ensures that a young 
person is subject to meaningful and appropriate consequences for 
his or her offending behaviour.  Canadians across the country 
know that this is the most effective way to achieve the long term 
protection of society.  Bill C-7 constructs a youth justice 
system which will do just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also abundantly clear that Canadians are committed to 
supporting children and youth.  They are firm in their belief 
that as a society we must do everything we can to help young 
people avoid crime in the first place and to get their lives back 
on track if they do run afoul of the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take this opportunity to outline the approach of the 
proposed youth criminal justice system and why it will be a 
marked improvement over the current system.  With 16 years of the 
Young Offenders Act under our belts, experience has demonstrated 
what measures are most effective and where the system needs to be 
improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me now address why we believe new youth justice legislation 
is necessary.  Some of the key weaknesses of the YOA are, first, 
the YOA does not reflect a coherent youth justice philosophy. Its 
principles are unclear and conflicting and do not effectively 
guide decision makers in the youth justice system. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1530"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT19"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT19"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1530
<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the YOA, the proposed youth criminal justice act provides 
guidance on the priority that should be given to key principles. 
For example, the new legislation makes clear that the nature of 
the system's response to a youth's offending behaviour should 
reflect the needs and individual circumstances of the youth. 
However, the needs or social welfare problems of a young person 
should not result in longer or more severe penalties than those 
which are fair and proportionate to the seriousness of the 
offence committed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other principles of the youth criminal justice act emphasize 
that the objectives of the youth system are to prevent crime, 
rehabilitate and reintegrate young persons into society, and 
ensure meaningful consequences for offences committed by young 
people.  Pursuing and achieving these objectives is the best way 
to protect society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The youth justice system must reflect the fact that young 
persons lack the maturity of adults.  This includes an emphasis 
on rehabilitation and reintegration and holding them accountable 
in a manner consistent with their reduced level of maturity. 
Interventions with young persons must be fair and proportionate, 
encourage the repair of harm done, and involve parents and others 
in the young person's rehabilitation and reintegration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we also know, the existing YOA has resulted in the highest 
youth incarceration rate in the western world, including our 
neighbours to the south, the United States.  Young persons in 
Canada often receive harsher custodial sentences than adults 
receive for the same type of offence.  Almost 80% of custodial 
sentences are for non-violent offences.  Many non-violent first 
offenders found guilty of less serious offences such as minor 
theft are sentenced to custody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed youth criminal justice act is intended to reduce 
the unacceptably high level of youth incarceration that has 
occurred under the Young Offenders Act.  The preamble to the new 
legislation states clearly that the youth justice system should 
reserve its most serious interventions for the most serious 
crimes and thereby reduce its over-reliance on incarceration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In contrast to the YOA, the new legislation provides that 
custody is to be reserved primarily for violent offenders and 
serious repeat offenders.  The new youth justice legislation 
recognizes that non-custodial sentences can often provide more 
meaningful consequences and be more effective in rehabilitating 
young persons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also believe that the Young Offenders Act has resulted in the 
overuse of the court for minor cases that can be better dealt 
with outside the court.  The effect is often court delay and an 
inability of the courts to focus on more serious cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Experience in Canada and other countries has shown that measures 
outside the court process can provide effective and timely 
responses to less serious youth crime.  Although the YOA permits 
the use of alternative measures, over 15 years of experience 
under the YOA indicates that it does not provide enough 
legislative direction regarding their use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed youth criminal justice act is intended to enable 
the courts to focus on serious youth crimes by increasing the use 
of effective and timely non-court responses to less serious 
offences.  These extra-judicial measures provide meaningful 
consequences such as requiring the young person to repair the 
harm to the victim.  They also enable early intervention with 
young people as well as the opportunity for the broader community 
to play an important role in developing community based responses 
to youth crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the provisions in the new youth justice legislation that 
encourage the use of extra-judicial measures in appropriate less 
serious cases include: a presumption that extra-judicial measures 
should be used with first time non-violent offenders and specific 
authority for police and prosecutors to use a range of 
extra-judicial measures, informal warnings, police cautions, 
crown cautions and referral to community programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the existing YOA has resulted in disparities and 
unfairness in youth sentencing.  Sentences under the YOA often do 
not reflect the seriousness of the offence.  There is often 
significant disparity between what similarly situated youth 
receive for similar offences. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1535"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT20"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT20"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1535

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, youth often receive more severe 
penalties than adults receive for the same type of offence.  Some 
young persons are sentenced on the basis of their needs or social 
welfare problems and receive longer or more severe penalties than 
that which would be fair and proportionate to the seriousness of 
the offence committed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To reverse the current unfairness the new law provides that the 
consequences imposed on a young person must not be greater than 
those which would be appropriate for an adult in similar 
circumstances.  The new sentencing provisions also emphasize that 
every sentence must focus on rehabilitating and reintegrating the 
young person into the community.  This requires that the needs of 
the young person be addressed within the timeframe stipulated by 
the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the existing Young Offenders Act fails to ensure effective 
reintegration of a young person after being released from 
custody.  A weakness of the existing legislation is that a young 
person can be released from custody with no required supervision 
and support to assist that young person in making the transition 
back to his or her community.  The new legislation includes 
provisions to assist the young person's reintegration into the 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new youth justice legislation requires that all periods of 
custody be followed by a period of supervision and support in the 
community.  At the time of sentencing the judge will state in 
open court the portion of time that is to be served in custody 
and the portion to be served in the community.  Breaching 
conditions of the community supervision could result in the young 
person being returned to custody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, the existing Young Offenders Act process for transfer 
to the adult system has resulted in unfairness, complexity and 
unacceptable delay.  The current process violates basic fairness 
by providing that a young person be transferred to an adult court 
before being found guilty of any offence.  It has also resulted 
in wide differences among provinces in the number of transfers of 
young persons to the adult system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in 1998-99 Manitoba led the country in transfers, 
transferring 29 youths to adult court.  Quebec was second, 
transferring 23 young persons to adult court, while Ontario 
transferred only six people to adult court in the same year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new youth justice legislation contains significant changes 
that address the unfairness of the current transfer process 
including the elimination of the transfer process.  Instead, the 
youth court has the authority to impose an adult sentence in 
certain circumstances.  The hearing on the appropriateness of an 
adult sentence will take place only after the youth has actually 
been found guilty.  The assurance is that should a young person 
receive an adult sentence, it is to be presumed that if the young 
person is under 18 he or she will serve the adult sentence in a 
youth facility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The existing Young Offenders Act also fails to make a clear 
distinction between serious violent offences and less serious 
offences.  This is a basic theme that underlies many of the other 
problems with the YOA such as the high rate of youth 
incarceration and the overuse of the court for less serious 
offences.  When a youth justice system fails to clearly 
differentiate between serious violent offences and less serious 
offences, it is not surprising that public confidence in the 
system is weakened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed youth justice legislation consistently makes this 
important distinction at key points throughout the legislation. 
It is reflected in the fundamental principles in the preamble and 
declaration of principles, the front end options, the sentencing 
principles, the rules on adult sentencing and the provisions 
regarding release from custody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the existing Young Offenders Act, a basic policy 
direction of the new legislation is that serious violent offences 
are to be treated seriously and less serious offences are to be 
dealt with through less intrusive yet still meaningful 
consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the existing Young Offenders Act fails to recognize the 
concerns and interests of victims in an adequate way.  In 
contrast to the existing legislation, the proposed youth justice 
legislation recognizes the concerns and interests of victims and 
clarifies the role of victims in the youth justice process. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1540"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following are key provisions in the legislation.  The 
principles of the act specifically provide that victims are to be 
treated with courtesy, compassion, and respect for their dignity 
and privacy.  They also should be given information about the 
proceedings and an opportunity to participate and be heard if 
they so choose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Victims have a right of access to youth court records and may be 
given access to other records.  The victim's role in community 
based approaches such as conferences is encouraged.  If a young 
person is dealt with by an extra-judicial sanction, the victim of 
the offence has a right to be informed of how the offence has 
been dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In developing new youth justice legislation it is important to 
recognize the limits of legislation and to have reasonable 
expectations about what legislation can accomplish.  That is why 
the new youth justice legislation is only one part of the 
government's much broader approach to youth crime and the renewal 
of Canada's youth justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increased federal funding, crime prevention efforts, effective 
programs, innovative approaches and research are all part of the 
broader strategy for the fair and effective renewal of Canada's 
youth justice system.  This legislation is the first step in the 
renewal of that system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Partnerships with other sectors such as education, child welfare 
and mental health, improvements to aboriginal communities, and 
appropriate implementation by provinces and territories will be 
equally important in achieving the goals of the youth justice 
legislation.  The government is committed to ensuring that 
Canadians are well served by their youth justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion I encourage all colleagues on both sides of the 
House to support Bill C-7 as an integral part of our initiative 
to ensure that all Canadians, especially young Canadians, have a 
fair, effective and just youth justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  It is seldom that we have ministers before the House 
making presentations such as the one we heard today.  I think it 
would be in order for us to seek unanimous consent to be able to 
ask questions of the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  It is certainly in order to ask.  Is there 
unanimous consent to permit a period of questions to the 
minister? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK183"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Vic Toews (Provencher, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate on Bill C-7, 
the bill that has been introduced by the Minister of Justice to 
replace the Young Offenders Act.  None other than the current 
Minister of Justice has characterized the Young Offenders Act as 
“easily the most unpopular piece of federal legislation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the government makes much of the fact that the violent 
youth crime rate appears to have dropped to some small degree 
over the last two years, the Canadian public has not been fooled. 
The violent youth crime rate is still over 300% greater than it 
was three decades ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, it is my experience that citizens, embittered and 
disillusioned with the failure of the Young Offenders Act to 
address their serious concerns in respect to crime, have in many 
cases simply stopped reporting crime.  Is it any surprise then 
that the figures may have shown a small drop in the crime rate 
over the last two years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to this type of measurement and statistical analysis, 
I am only surprised that the government has not been funding more 
studies on how to encourage citizens to stop reporting crimes. 
According to this type of Liberal thought process, the crime rate 
would be reduced to zero if they could only figure out how to 
stop people from reporting crime to police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the suggestion may seem ridiculous, it is a type of 
thought process the Liberals often employ.  During the recent 
election, for example, when the Prime Minister announced that the 
65 cent dollar was good for Canadian farmers because it created 
markets for their products, one farmer in my constituency told me 
that if that were the case maybe we should have a 10 cent dollar 
because it would make our economy six times as strong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another farmer said that it did not matter what the dollar was 
at if it cost $120 Canadian to get an acre of land ready and he 
could only get $60 Canadian when he sold the produce from that 
acre. Furthermore, the Prime Minister failed to consider that much of 
the machinery and other supplies that the farmers purchase come 
from the United States.  A 65 cent Canadian dollar does not help 
with those purchases.  Liberal economics are great if one could 
only figure out a way to ignore reality.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The same is true of Liberal criminal justice policy.  How could 
it be that the Young Offenders Act, the object of so much study 
and consultation prior to its implementation, turned into such a 
failure?  Committees across Canada considered how to replace the 
Juvenile Delinquents Act.  Experts in the social sciences, law 
enforcement officials, prosecutors and ordinary citizens turned 
out at these committee hearings to provide input into an act that 
was to replace the Juvenile Delinquents Act, an act that had been 
on the books since approximately 1908. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a prosecutor from Brandon, Manitoba responsible for 
prosecutions in the youth court in the western judicial district 
of Manitoba, I participated in those hearings about creating a 
new act.  I recall making a presentation before the committee in 
Winnipeg, chaired I seem to recall, by the now retired former 
Chief Judge Harold Gyles.  Although I had only recently graduated 
from law school, it was apparent to me that the Juvenile 
Delinquents Act, and indeed the proposed Young Offenders Act, was 
seriously flawed and that all we were doing was breeding 
successive generations of criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless serious steps were taken to break this cycle, the new act 
which would become the Young Offenders Act would be doomed to 
failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Young Offenders Act seemed to be on the right track but at 
its onset there were a number of problems already apparent. 
Perhaps the greatest of these had to do with the failure to make 
any provisions for the youth under the age of 12.  The Young 
Offenders Act prohibits any legal proceedings against youth under 
the age of 12. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The theory seemed sound: refer under 12 year old children to the 
child welfare system to be dealt with there.  The problem was 
that the child welfare system was not, and still is not, equipped 
to deal with children whose criminal conduct brought them to the 
attention of the authorities.  In fact, what happened was the 
child welfare authorities did not have the appropriate resources 
or legal authority to deal with these children, many of them 
violent and seriously disturbed.  This is especially true with 
those children that we have now come to know as children 
suffering from fetal alcohol syndrome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the bar against being able to proceed against children to 
bring them to youth court under the age of 12, these children who 
were 9, 10 and 11 years old slipped between the cracks of a child 
welfare system that was unable to deal with their serious 
problems and a Young Offenders Act that prohibited a court from 
offering them any help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not speak of these matters simply as a matter of hearsay. I 
was not only involved as a prosecutor in youth court during the 
late 1970s, but during the first half of the 1980s.  For five or 
six years some of my responsibilities on behalf of the attorney 
general of Manitoba involved acting on behalf of the director of 
child welfare in northern Manitoba, primarily in the Thompson 
area where I had the privilege of working with many fine child 
care workers and judges who did their best in very difficult 
circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One such judge was Judge Kimmelman who spent many years on 
circuit in the north, both as a youth court judge dealing with 
matters under the Young Offenders Act and as a family court judge 
dealing with matters under the Child Welfare Act.  People like 
Judge Kimmelman are to be commended.  However despite the very 
novel and inventive procedures and dispositions that they 
utilized, the legal tools and resources that they were provided 
with were simply not sufficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The failures of the Juvenile Delinquents Act were simply 
continued under the new Young Offenders Act.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Young Offenders Act children are falling between the 
cracks of the child welfare system and the young offender system. 
Children under the age of 12 fail to receive help, either through 
the courts or through the child welfare system.  For all the 
shortcomings of the old Juvenile Delinquents Act, it still 
provided for a measure of accountability for youth under the age 
of 12 so that they could be helped or dealt with by the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Young Offenders Act provides no such alternative with the 
result that by the time many seriously disturbed children reach 
the age of 12 anti-social and, indeed, criminal patterns and 
conduct have already been established.  The Young Offenders Act 
only succeeded in breeding a younger, more anti-social 
lawbreaker.  The time spent in youth court between ages 12 and 18 
was spent honing the skills that many children first put to use 
when they were under age 12.  By the time these youth reach 18 
and sometimes much earlier, the only alternative, regrettably, is 
a much harsher and punitive adult system.  By the misguided 
desire to help these children by shielding them from 
responsibility and accountability, we have only succeeded in 
ensuring a pattern of criminal behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not that the Young Offenders Act did not spout the 
appropriate rhetoric about rehabilitation, deterrence and 
denunciation, principles that all of us would agree are necessary 
for the success of any criminal justice system, it was simply 
that the act was substantially flawed from its inception. 
Furthermore, in dealing with the Young Offenders Act, and now 
dealing with this new bill, there is no practical commitment by 
the Liberal government to follow through with the implementation 
of the programs that are required in order to ensure that the 
rhetoric is carried out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Young Offenders Act first came in, the government of 
the day committed itself to a 50:50 cost sharing arrangement with 
the provinces.  The federal government soon abandoned its 
commitment to this partnership.  As a consequence, the federal 
Liberal government has become at best a 25% financial partner 
offloading the lion's share of the financial and social 
responsibility on to the provinces that now shoulder on average 
75% of the costs of running this program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a strange state of affairs.  One can understand, from a 
constitutional point of view, why the federal government has 
abandoned its financial commitment to medicare where it also used 
to be a 50% partner.  However, in the case of medicare it is 
clear that it at least has the excuse that medicare is a 
provincial constitutional responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of medicare, the federal government has simply 
involved itself in an area of provincial constitutional 
authority, and as my colleagues in the Bloc or others would say 
improperly so, by virtue of its spending power.  However, in the 
area of youth crime this is clearly a matter of federal 
constitutional authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces are involved in the programming and prosecutions 
under the Young Offenders Act, as they are in the prosecution of 
the criminal code, by virtue of their consent.  I believe they 
provide this consent as an example of co-operative federalism, 
recognizing that in many cases provinces and local administration 
of these programs is important to their success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that youth crime is a federal area of responsibility, it 
is curious that the federal Liberal government would announce 
that it is not prepared to contribute at least half of the 
funding for the operation of this program.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very recently the Minister of Justice said that the federal 
government would not match the provincial contribution on a 50:50 
basis because she said that the federal government could not 
afford the cost of the new programs she is implementing under her 
act.  Instead, she indicated that the federal government would 
simply throw in an additional $207 million over three years to 
help with the implementation of the new act.  Yet, even though 
she says that she does not have the money to carry out federal 
constitutional responsibilities, she expects the provinces to 
come up with the money for her plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Preliminary estimates from the province indicate that the 
initial implementation costs will exceed $100 million.  This does 
not include the ongoing additional costs that will be incurred by 
the provinces in administering the new act.  It is clear that the 
$207 million new dollars over three years that the federal 
Liberals have put on the table will barely cover the first three 
years of additional new costs and will do nothing to meet the 
ongoing costs to the provinces after these first three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this funding dries up after three years, the federal 
Liberal government will become much less than a 25% partner in 
this federal program, leaving the provinces to pick up the 
additional costs on an ongoing basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this financial context, and that is why I spent the time to 
develop this context, it is clear what the real reason is for the 
Liberal government to exercise jurisdiction in respect to 
children under the age of 12.  By refusing to extend even the 
rehabilitative powers of the youth court to children under the 
age of 12, the federal Liberals are attempting to dump 100% of 
the costs on to the provinces in respect to these children.  This 
has nothing to do with protecting children from the punitive 
powers of the court.  It is simply a cynical device to ensure 
that the federal government can escape any financial 
responsibility for children under the age of 12. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If in fact the government is truly concerned that children under 
the age of 12 not be incarcerated, it need simply deny the judges 
the power to impose custodial sentences to those under the age of 
12 while allowing the judges to retain the power to implement the 
rehabilitative measures available under the act to other 
children.  However, the government has chosen not to do so 
because it is simply looking for a way to escape its financial 
and constitutional responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the cynical attempt to escape financial responsibility, 
not only in respect to children under the age of 12 years but in 
respect to a fair division of the cost regarding children over 
the age of 12, I am surprised that the provinces have not simply 
advised the federal Liberal government that they refuse their 
consent to administer and prosecute this legislation and that 
they will no longer accept the delegation of this responsibility, 
financial or otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no constitutional obligation for any of the provinces 
to shoulder this responsibility.  If the minister takes issue 
with my opinion that in a federal state one level of government 
cannot ask another level of government to shoulder its financial 
responsibilities without that government's consent, I would 
invite her to speak to her lawyers and indeed refer the matter to 
the courts on a reference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am only surprised that no province has indicated its intention 
to take this matter to its court of appeal given the lack of 
financial commitment to the legislation and its programs by the 
Liberal government.  It demonstrates that while the federal 
Liberal government has given up on co-operative federalism and 
continues to implement its policies onto the provinces through 
government by ransom, it is to the credit of the provinces that 
they continue to make efforts to ensure that co-operative 
federalism remains alive, albeit on a life-support system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As indicated earlier, it is not that Bill C-7 does not pay 
appropriate lip service to the principles required by any modern 
justice system.  One simply needs to read the introductory 
preamble to the bill to see that it says all the right things. 
Indeed, as a judge recently stated “The bill attempts to be all 
things to all people”.  Unfortunately, the grandiose 
introduction is simply a cover for another effort that is doomed 
to failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In attempting to be all things to all people, the Liberals have 
produced a bill that is costly, complex and cumbersome.  It will 
serve only the interests of those who wish to profit from legal 
litigation involving the children of Canada.  Not only will the 
children suffer, but also the provinces will be required to 
increase legal aid budgets, another program where the federal 
Liberals are diligently seeking to avoid their fiscal 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although other members will no doubt wish to examine and comment 
on specific provisions of the bill, I also want to comment on 
some of these provisions, even briefly, in addition to the 
comments I have already made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first issue I wish to discuss in this context is the 
reluctance of the minister to provide for publication of names of 
young offenders who live in anonymity in the community.  While 
all of us agree that the principles of rehabilitation and 
deterrence do not always require the disclosure of a young 
offender's identity to the public, it is clear that the very 
restrictive disclosure provisions often serve the interests of 
youthful criminal predators living in our community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seniors, schoolteachers and administrators, parents of 
vulnerable children, and the vulnerable children themselves have 
a legitimate and compelling interest in knowing who the dangerous 
youthful predators are in their community.  Yet the provisions of 
the bill restrict to an unwarranted degree the ability to notify 
the public of this danger.  The balance in the legislation 
favours the rights of the dangerous criminal over the rights of 
victims and potential victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moving on to another point, in Manitoba, for example, we have an 
extensive system of alternative measures to deal with young 
offenders.  During my time as provincial justice minister I was 
proud to develop and expand many of these initiatives.  Provided 
that the type of offender who participated in these measures was 
carefully controlled and provided that the court always retained 
overall authority and jurisdiction, these measures could be 
extremely successful in providing appropriate support to young 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the most part these measures were implemented through the 
participation of police officers, probation officers and youth 
justice committees.  However, it was apparent after many years of 
experience that violent repeat offenders would not be appropriate 
candidates for any type of extrajudicial measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-7 ignores the profitable experience of provinces like 
Manitoba with extensive extrajudicial measures.  Instead, the 
bill ignores this experience by allowing access to alternative 
measures by violent offenders and minimizing the supervisory 
authority of the courts.  While alternative measures are often 
appropriate, they need to be administered in an appropriate 
context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be the court system that should direct if alternative 
measures are to be implemented.  In any event, the court should 
always be involved when considering such measures in the case of 
violent repeat offenders so that it can be satisfied that the 
public will be protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last provision I wish to specifically comment on is the 
provision that would provide for the early release of offenders 
from custodial institutions despite the fact that they may still 
present a danger to the public.  While it is commendable that 
youth in custody are rewarded for good behaviour, the Canadian 
Alliance Party has grave concerns over trying to emulate the 
failing adult federal parole system.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Early release must be contingent upon the demonstration of good 
behaviour and the satisfaction of the custodial authorities that 
the offender has been rehabilitated before there can be any 
consideration of early release. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a country and as a people, we have only a short period of 
time to work with these youths while they are under the 
jurisdiction of the act, and every effort must be made to 
rehabilitate where rehabilitation is still feasible.  Mandatory 
parole should not be an option where the youth is not 
rehabilitated and there is still time left on a court imposed 
sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, our party still has grave concerns about the 
bill.  Not only has there been a lack of consultation and, 
indeed, a deliberate exclusion of provincial attorneys general in 
respect of the development of the provisions of the bill, not 
only has there been a failure by the Liberal government to 
provide adequate funding for its legislation, there has also been 
a stubborn refusal to consider any suggestions for amending its 
provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few minutes ago, the Minister of Justice continued to defend 
the bill on the simplistic basis that some members say it is too 
tough while members of the Canadian Alliance think it is not 
tough enough.  Therefore she reasons that the bill must be just 
right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a story about the three bears tasting porridge.  The 
bill impacts on the safety and quality of life of millions of 
Canadians.  As such, it requires greater justification from the 
minister than the political equivalent of Goldilocks and the 
three bears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real question that needs to be answered is not whether the 
legislation is too soft or too tough.  The real question is 
whether the legislation will be effective in meeting key goals of 
rehabilitation, deterrence and denunciation of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the reasons that I have outlined, and for additional reasons 
that my colleagues in the Alliance will raise in their comments, 
this bill will not be effective in meeting these key and crucial 
goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, the failure to consult provincial authorities in 
a meaningful way and the failure of the federal Liberals to 
provide appropriate funding will be the key reasons for the 
failure of the bill.  Unless the concerns of the provinces are 
considered and the appropriate financial agreements are in place, 
the bill will quickly find its way to being characterized in the 
not so distant future, perhaps by the same Minister of Justice, 
as easily the most unpopular piece of federal legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While popularity is not always the hallmark of great 
legislation, the dangers that the bill presents will give rise to 
far greater concerns than whether it is popular or not.  I 
believe these concerns will impact adversely on the safety of our 
citizens and, indeed, on the rehabilitation of our youthful 
offenders.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that everyone in the House should see very 
clearly that there are two faces to Canada.  There are two 
visions completely opposed.  In a matter such as that of young 
offenders, it is obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I understand what the member of the Canadian Alliance had to 
say, the bill does not go far enough. There are shortcomings and 
things that do not work.  We should be far more severe with 
young people involved in crime.  We should even lower the age of 
responsibility below the age of 12.  We should make changes to 
try to get better control over these young people.  There is the 
whole issue of the victim.  It must be made more complex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the Bloc Quebecois and, quite honestly, for the vast 
majority of Quebecers—I know that these days the expression 
consensus is a bit overworked—if there is one subject of real 
consensus, it is the treatment of young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of political stripe in Quebec—this is even more true 
in the national assembly—Péquistes, members of the Action 
Démocratique or Liberals, the members of the national assembly 
unanimously passed a resolution calling on the minister to 
suspend consideration of Bill C-3, now C-7—and I will come back to 
this shortly—in order to visit the provinces, look at the issue 
and see what does not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, in short, the Young Offenders Act is properly 
applied with good results.  I will come back to this in a bit. 
After checking with the Quebec departments of justice and public 
security and other agencies in Quebec, the minister decided not 
to travel throughout the country to see what was going on in the 
provinces, and particularly in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some department officials met with the members of the coalition 
and the agencies that enforce the Young Offenders Act on a daily 
basis, but the minister did not go to Quebec to see what was 
going on over there and to find out why Quebec was getting such 
remarkable results. Why was there a consensus in Quebec? It was 
to tell the minister “We do not want the YOA to be amended or 
repealed because it is working for us. The problem, if there is 
one, is not with the legislation but rather with the way it is 
enforced in other provinces”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister did not come to Quebec but the officials she sent 
were there to do a sales job. They were not proposing a social 
vision, an educational approach or a rehabilitation program but 
rather a product. They were simply trying to sell a product. I 
will come back to that later on because there are limits to 
what one can say and what one can try to sell to Quebecers on 
such an important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course there are times in the House when we are tempted to 
play politics. We are in politics, not in religion. However, on 
this issue I have never tried to influence groups and get them 
to take part in our political games. They have always been free 
to do whatever they wanted to do and to say whatever they felt 
like saying. These agencies held press conferences and wrote to 
newspapers. 
I never tried to apply pressure as the Department of Justice is 
trying to do now and tried to do in September, October and 
November. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, people in the Department of Justice were not involved in 
the election campaign. They were out in the field and they even 
promised money to certain organizations. There is nothing they 
did not try to do to convince certain members of the coalition, 
certain groups that work with the Young Offenders Act on a daily 
basis, to support the minister's amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now I think the minister and the people in her department 
have failed. Time will tell. As for me, my opinion has not 
changed with regard to these bills, whether it is Bill C-68, 
Bill C-3 or Bill C-7.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When a bill is ill-conceived from the very beginning, one can 
try to improve it by whatever means but it will still remain an 
ill-conceived bill. Such is the case with Bill C-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill proposed by the minister is based on false premises. 
Alliance and Liberal members saw an opportunity to play politics 
at the expense of young people with delinquency problems that 
are sometimes serious. Using certain complicitous tabloids and 
certain ads, they managed to make a big fuss about certain 
crimes of a rather vicious nature, I agree, but nevertheless 
extremely rare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes without saying that the idea of a grandson hitting his 
grandmother to get a few dollars is unbearable. However beyond the 
specific and individual incidents covered by the media, the 
facts are actually very different. And this has to be said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Juvenile crime has been in constant decline for a number of 
years. According to the data compiled by the Department of 
Justice, last year in the year 2000, the juvenile crime rate 
was the lowest of the past 20 years. Just since 1997, youth 
crimes—and these figures are taken from reports published by the 
Department of Justice—involving homicides have dropped by 9%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not try to tell us, as the member for Provencher seems to be 
doing, that these figures have been fudged because the crimes 
were not reported. We are talking about confirmed homicides. 
Files were opened and police investigations were conducted. The 
figures show that since 1997 homicides committed by young 
offenders have dropped by 9%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has also been an 8% drop in robberies and a 1% drop in 
sexual assaults. Some might say that a 1% drop is not much, but 
at least the number of these crimes has been going down over the 
past four or five years. As for crimes in general, the drop is 
around 1.2%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is most striking when we look at these statistics is 
that since 1997 the juvenile crime rate in Quebec has dropped 
by 23%. I agree that this is not enough but it is a significant 
reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec—and I am using the data published by the Department of 
Justice—has the lowest crime rate in Canada. 
In Quebec, the recidivism rate is the lowest in Canada. The 
number of cases where a file is referred to the court and young 
criminals are remanded in custody is also the lowest in Canada. 
The former minister of justice and now Minister of Health even 
said once that Quebec was a model for the way it implements 
the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The then minister of justice even said that since Quebec was 
enforcing the Young Offenders Act properly, and the financial 
programs linked to the Young Offenders Act did not favour the 
approach taken by Quebec, Quebec was in fact being penalized. As 
a result of Quebec enforcing the act properly, the federal 
government now owes Quebec about $850 million in constant dollars 
of 1997.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal program linked to the act is built in such a way 
that it encourages erecting concrete walls, putting bars in 
windows and imprisoning young offenders, instead of 
rehabilitating them and ensuring their reintegration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec was simply implementing the policy statement in section 3 
of the Young Offenders Act, which put the emphasis on the needs 
of young people. It said that we had to focus on the 
rehabilitation and reintegration of young people in order to 
protect society in the long run. This is what we have been doing 
for years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec because we abide by and enforce the law correctly and 
efficiently, we are being penalized in terms of the distribution 
of funding for the enforcement of an act that was not passed by 
Quebec but by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To justify the Liberal government's approach, to justify the 
position adopted by the Liberal minister who is a member from 
western Canada, a member from Alberta, a province where the 
Canadian Alliance is known to be strong—bearing in mind that, 
based on its own statistics, her department recognized that there 
was no need to amend the Young Offenders Act because it was not 
the act, but its enforcement that was the problem—to justify 
those amendments, they went on a crusade a long time ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is misinformation. The original premises are wrong. The 
wrong data are knowingly being used. Department of Justice 
officials, among others, have suggested in press conferences 
that things are worse than they really are. There is an attempt 
to lead people away from a clear understanding of the act, which 
needs to be enforced. Some figures are even being fiddled with, 
and I will explain what I mean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very saddened to see that the Minister of Justice herself 
is using these figures when she knows very well that they have 
no value. Then there is the poll carried out by the Department of 
Justice. This poll was authorized by the Liberals and paid for 
with our taxes, and public servants did a sales job on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you might tell me that I do not have as much 
experience as you, as I have only been a member of parliament since 
1993, but I have always held federal public servants in high 
esteem. 
I have always greatly respected them for the non-partisan nature 
of their work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall, until seeing what is going on within the Department of 
Justice, I was generally very satisfied with the work being done 
by the public servants.  However, as far as justice is concerned, 
particularly in the area of young offenders, their work is no 
longer fair-minded, it is totally partisan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as Yolande Viau is concerned—I am taking the time to 
give her name, and have no qualms about doing so, since I have 
laid a very formal complaint with her superior, but what she was 
doing was supposedly normal—when she tells us about the poll, 
when she says that 58% of Quebecers agree with the federal 
approach, she is lying.  It is not honest to say that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the poll is examined in any sort of detail and with any sort 
of honesty and informed knowledge, one realizes that the 
department, and Ms. Viau in particular, cannot reach those 
conclusions.  Why?  Because according to the same poll only 10% 
of Quebecers can give at least three of the amendments to the 
Young Offenders Act.  There cannot, therefore, be more than 10% 
who approve of such a law.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Closer scrutiny of the poll reveals that 10% of Quebecers are 
opposed to the minister's bill.  Are these the same 10% who can 
list at least three components of the bill?  Are they opposed 
because the more they are familiar with it, the more they oppose 
it?  No doubt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This, however, is an indication of the unacceptable lack of 
rigour in a department like the Department of Justice, 
particularly in connection with an issue that affects young 
offenders, young people in trouble with the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope that Ms. Viau and the Minister of Justice will not 
use this sort of tactic again.  It is my opinion that Ms. Viau 
is playing politics in her interpretation of these figures, that 
she is selling her line, some sort of commodity, in this case, a 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, she said when she met the press “Go ask the 
Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la 
jeunesse du Québec about whether they are as good as all that in 
applying the law”.  Yes, because they had financial problems, 
but that is a whole other matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Ms. Viau had any intellectual honesty, she would have taken 
the brief submitted by the Commission des droits de la personne 
et des droits de la jeunesse, when its representatives testified 
before the committee, and she would have seen what the 
commission had to say on this with respect to the Young 
Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of Ms. Viau and the minister, I will quote from 
what the commission said in its brief to the committee: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By focusing the new legislation on the seriousness of the 
offence, the implication is, necessarily, that the present law 
does not significantly respond to juvenile delinquency, 
especially when the offence is of a greater objective gravity. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further on, it reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The imbalance created by new legislation based solely on the 
principles of public protection and the responsibility of the 
young offender compromises all the work done to date with young 
people in difficulty. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the true message of the commission. 
I am not distorting the facts. I am just quoting from a brief 
the Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la 
jeunesse has submitted to the Standing Committee on Justice and 
Human Rights, which examined the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I may briefly outline the background, this is not the first 
time the minister tries to impose her views through a bill such 
as this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-68 was introduced on March 11, 1999, as everybody will 
recall. Then we had Bill C-3, which was introduced and read for 
the first time on October 14, 2000. The purpose has always been 
the same, that is to make the Young Offenders Act tougher and 
to revoke a piece of legislation that is very effective in 
Quebec, for the sake of heeding just English speaking Canada's 
views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister then realized her bill was severely flawed and did 
not make sense. 
She tabled 172 amendments in the House. About 60 witnesses, half 
of them from Quebec, appeared before the committee dealing with 
the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Witnesses from Quebec submitted to the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Human Rights at least 15 briefs. Not a single 
witness from Quebec supported the justice minister's position. 
Not a single group mentioned that the minister was right to 
revoke and throw away an effective piece of legislation like the 
one on young offenders.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course we had witnesses from western Canada who came to tell 
us that we should lower the age even more and that we should 
even let children in diapers have criminal records. I 
exaggerate but not much considering what I heard during the 
committee hearings. This is not the solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate went on for several months. I tried by all kinds of 
means, including endless speeches, to convince the minister. 
Many editorials and articles were written on the subject in 
Quebec and in English Canada. If I had the time I would like to 
read them. 
Lawyers, practitioners, experts, professors, criminologists, 
psychologists and all kinds of people came to tell the minister 
that she had it all wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the last federal election the minister introduced a brand 
new bill, Bill C-7. It has a new number but it is not new at 
all since it is a carbon copy of old Bill C-3. The 172 
amendments moved by the government have simply been incorporated 
into the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A bill that has so many flaws cannot be corrected by way of 
amendments. What we need to do is scrap it and draft a brand new 
bill. While that is being done, the minister should travel 
around and consult the people who work with young offenders, 
with young people in trouble with the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister would see that she is going the wrong way. I will 
surely have an opportunity later on to give specific examples. 
Whenever she has the chance, the minister says “The hon. member 
from the Bloc Quebecois never gives any specific examples”. 
However, I gave her several examples. Over the course of 27 
hours of debates, in the speeches I made in committee, I gave 
several examples showing that the new bill would make it 
impossible to keep the approach taken in Quebec with young 
people in trouble with the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked questions in the House. Yes, we have time constraints 
and we cannot get into details but the examples I gave showed 
that with the changes put forward by the minister it would no 
longer be possible to take the educational and rehabilitative 
approach developed in Quebec over the last 20 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is wrong to claim that there is some flexibility. Too much in 
the bill is automatic to give provinces a minimum of 
flexibility. The minister does not seem to understand or, rather, 
she does not want to understand that. I think this is a better 
explanation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the  approach in Quebec? Are there any members in 
the House who are at least aware of what it is? One might say 
that it is based on rehabilitation and reintegration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In every case, the young person is given priority. Each case is 
considered individually. In each case, we look at what we should 
give the young person in question to rehabilitate him as quickly 
as possible. There is a reason for this, since in section 3 of 
the Young Offenders Act, the declaration of principle clearly 
states that young persons are not adults and that they must be 
treated accordingly. Indeed, young persons are human beings in 
training. They cannot be treated as if they were adults, even in 
very serious cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, there are hopeless cases. Yes, there are cases where a young 
offender is a bum and will remain a bum.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some murder cases, the young offender does not deserve the 
same treatment as the one used for rehabilitating young people. 
However the current Young Offenders Act does allow the provinces to 
decide to have a young person tried in adult court. This is not 
hypocritical, this is clear. We know where we are going. It is 
true that we apply this in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps we may contradict the minister's numbers, because 
according to the Department of Justice in Quebec City it is not 
true that 23 cases were referred last year. I am convinced that 
more cases are referred in Quebec than in Ontario but perhaps 
not 23. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are more cases referred in Quebec? Simply because there is a 
difference in treatment in Quebec. A young person who under the 
referral principle is tried in adult court and sentenced will 
not end up in the same place as a young person who is treated as 
such. However, in the western provinces, whether a young 
offender is dealt with under the law as a young person or as an 
adult in adult court, he will often end up in the same place 
and get the same treatment, that is no treatment at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec there is a difference. We invest in a young person 
who has a chance of being rehabilitated. In Quebec the repeat 
offender rate is the lowest in Canada because we enforce the 
law. We do what the law allows us to do. We apply the statement 
of principles that puts the emphasis on the young person's 
needs. 
This statement of principles was interpreted by the higher 
courts and it took about 15 years for the Supreme Court of 
Canada to hand down a clear ruling on what a young offender is 
entitled to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It took 15 years to assess what the real needs of young people 
are. Everything that has been accomplished so far is being 
thrown out today. The intent of the law is being completely 
changed. From now on the young offenders' needs, the underlying 
principle of the Young Offenders Act, will no longer be the 
guiding principle in interpreting the act, in guiding youth 
court judges in sentencing young offenders, it will be the 
seriousness of the offence, as we said at the beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This whole bill is focused on the seriousness of the offence. 
Even though there have been attempts to include all sorts of 
details and to use the word “need” in the bill, this in no way 
changes the fact that the courts will interpret it based on the 
principle of the seriousness of the offence. This runs counter 
to Quebec's approach, which is focused on the needs of the young 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, in this new act the minister wants to impose on 
Quebec, which is all about the seriousness of the offence, there 
is a whole series of automatic sentences preventing those who 
want to hand down the appropriate sentence to young offenders 
from doing so. The young offenders will even have the right, not 
currently available to them, to avoid rehabilitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many cases, if a young offender is given the choice between 
serving his time inside, as they say, or going to a rehab centre 
and working on his case, what will he choose? He will choose to 
serve his time. 
It is much easier to do two-thirds of an eight year prison 
sentence than to do eight months in a rehabilitation centre 
where one has to work with psychologists and other professionals 
who will ask questions and work hard to turn one into a 
responsible citizen who realizes what he has done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is much easier for a youth to do his time, read books and 
count the days left until his release than for him to try to 
find out what his problem is and why he acted the way he did.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that is exactly what the minister is handing to our youth 
on a silver platter and crown attorneys will no longer even 
have the opportunity to compel the young offender to go through 
all that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is unacceptable for several reasons. The 
youth justice system the minister is proposing looks 
increasingly like adult justice. This so-called youth criminal 
justice act, which will turn our youth into criminals, looks 
more and more like the criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the application of the criminal code were a big success with 
adults, I might think that the government is trying to achieve 
the same results with young offenders but it is the opposite. 
The application of the criminal code is, in many respects, a 
disaster but the government wants to impose it on young 
offenders. Some expressions were changed but these were cosmetic 
changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-7, young offenders no longer face penalties. 
Instead, they are liable to face them. Bill C-7 now imposes 
sentences. The legislation no longer reprimands a young 
offender, it corrects his behaviour. It includes extrajudicial 
measures instead of extrajudicial sanctions. This is all very 
nice, and while it is good to include terminology that is less 
aggressive, the meaning of the act remains the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister says that she understood Quebec's demands, but she 
did not understand anything, in my opinion. 
We did not want changes to the wording or synonyms. We simply 
wanted the minister not to touch the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned that under the bill it is impossible to review 
each case based on its own merits. Certain types of crime are 
stereotyped and compartmentalized: this sentence applies to that 
crime and that sentence applies this other crime. Where is the 
flexibility that would allow Quebec to have its own approach? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the experts and even lawyers agree that the bill will 
promote legal quibbling. Those who have been to the courthouse 
realize that there is no benefit in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an extremely complex bill that no one will understand. 
The bill took something out of the existing act, which was made 
for young people and also parents, since there are parents who 
take an active interest in what young people experiencing 
problems are doing. It is not just thugs who end up in court. It 
is not just young people without parents. 
A bill as complex as Bill C-7 will not be understood except by 
judges and lawyers who will have a field day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does not help the cause of justice for young people or 
the society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give other examples and I hope some public servants are 
listening if the minister is not. With this bill Quebec will have to change its 
approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke earlier about the whole philosophy underlying the bill 
and I want to come back to this briefly. The current Young 
Offenders Act talks about the needs of young persons. The basic 
principle of Bill C-7 is the seriousness of the offence committed 
by the young offender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far the precedents make the needs of the young offenders the 
first priority. The case law leans that way. It has established 
some models particular to Quebec on rehabilitation. The 
philosophy behind the bill is completely different. It deals with 
the seriousness of the offence and hands down harsher 
sentences. Like it or not, the case law would change at the same 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principle of uniformity of sentencing was in Bill C-3. We are 
no longer talking about uniformity of sentencing but rather 
about similar sentences in a given region. What does a region 
correspond to in criminal law? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1645"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is Quebec a region? Is Ontario a region? Are the maritimes a 
region? In any case, when lower courts interpret what the 
legislator meant with regard to the seriousness of the offence, 
it will go to the higher courts and on to the supreme court. 
When these cases come back before the lower courts, the case law 
will impact on Quebec if Bill C-7 is fully enforced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also said with regard to minor offences—because things are very 
compartmentalized in the bill—that at present when a young 
person is caught shoplifting or scribbling graffiti, the police 
open a file. 
That file is immediately referred to the crown attorney. He or 
she examines the reports contained in the file and may determine 
that the source of the problem is a street gang or perhaps the 
young person's parents. He or she takes appropriate action 
immediately to get that young person away from the situation 
causing the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill C-7, as introduced by the Minister of Justice, the 
crown attorney will never see the file and will certainly not be 
able to force that young person to enter a rehabilitation 
program. The reason for that is that the minister's bill 
provides for a whole series of successive measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the first offence is a minor offence, like shoplifting, the 
police will only give a warning. 
If the same young person travels to the neighbouring town and is 
caught shoplifting again the same day, he or she will be given 
another warning. Where will that be recorded? If at some point 
the offences become more serious, for example large graffiti 
involving some violence, a cautionary letter will be sent to the 
parents. The crown attorney will never find out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would prevent Quebec from doing the right thing at the 
right time. It is better to invest as soon as the first offence 
is committed, when it is not serious, than after three or four 
years of delinquency in a neighbourhood, a town or a region. If 
the minister's bill becomes law, the whole rehabilitative 
approach used in Quebec in cases involving minor offences would 
no longer be possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for cases involving major crimes, the minister's approach is 
just as harmful. If young offenders are treated as adults, they 
will also have the same rights as adults. With the minister's 
new bill, a young person receiving an adult sentence of eight 
years in prison would get out after serving two-thirds of that 
sentence, whether he or she is rehabilitated or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The approach used in Quebec is to send these young people to a 
rehabilitation centre. When they get out, they are 
rehabilitated. Statistics show that the recidivism rate is less 
than 1%. Is this what the minister wants? Is the minister 
telling us the approach used in Quebec would be maintained with 
her bill? No, we would no longer be able to do that. The approach 
used in Quebec would no longer be possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the delays the minister's new bill would 
entail. We now have appearances in court and preliminary 
inquiries, and trials by judge and jury. Lots of things are 
fictitious in the bill. We are told that the youth justice 
court would deal with serious crime, but if one reads the bill 
one realizes that it is not the judges of the youth justice 
court who would hear these cases but judges of the superior 
court acting as judges of the youth justice court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are lots of fictitious things which the minister does not 
seem to grasp. In the end, the youth court would be influenced. 
There would be an influence on case law. There would be an 
influence on the Quebec approach, which has been very effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude. We have in the House right now Liberal members 
from Quebec, the Ministers responsible for International trade, 
Treasury Board, Finance, National Revenue, and 
Intergovernmental Affairs. We also have the new member for Laval 
East and the members for Brome-Missisquoi, Ahuntsic, and 
Gatineau. I hope they will stand up for Quebec and for the 
Quebec consensus on this bill, and I hope that they will talk 
some sense into the minister.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this is my first opportunity to participate in this debate in my 
new capacity as justice critic for the New Democratic Party.  I 
listened intently to those who preceded me and I signal my 
intention to listen intently in committee and to try to learn as 
much as I can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though I might not always agree, I would like to learn as 
much as I can from my colleagues on the committee who are more 
experienced than I.  To that end I listened to the minister, to 
the member for Provencher, to the former minister of justice in 
my own province, and to my colleague from Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the third time the bill has been introduced in the 
House.  It was at one point known as Bill C-68, then as Bill C-3, 
and now as Bill C-7.  Noting that the bill has been before the 
House before, I would like to pay tribute to my predecessor as 
NDP justice critic, the former member for Sydney—Victoria, Mr. 
Peter Mancini.  Unfortunately he was not re-elected and therefore 
could not continue as our justice critic.  He had the opportunity 
to put forward our party's position and he put it forward well 
the last time he spoke to the bill in the second reading context 
on October 21, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that the bill has not gone ahead.  As with 
various other projects of the Liberal government, a combination 
of government delay, lack of will and an opposition resistance 
that has its own merits, has meant that the government has not 
been able to act.  We collectively have been unable to act to 
possibly improve the Young Offenders Act which we all know to be 
deficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have some 15 years of experience with the Young Offenders 
Act and it has not lived up to expectations.  I am one of the few 
people in the House who was here when it was debated and brought 
in as a replacement for the former juvenile delinquents act. 
There was great expectation at that time that the Young Offenders 
Act would be a great improvement on the older legislation which I 
think went back to the turn of the century, if I remember 
correctly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that the Young Offenders Act has not worked out the way 
many people thought it would and the fact that we now have before 
us a new bill should perhaps give us pause and make us all a bit 
humble when we realize that the act did not work. Youth crime, 
even though it may have gone down in some respects in the past 
few years, is certainly up overall when we consider what the 
statistics would have looked like when the Young Offenders Act

</I></B></P><P align=left>If acts of parliament alone were enough the problem would have 
been solved by now, but we still have problems.  The minister, by 
her own description, has tried to strike a balance between those 
who want her to be tougher and those who want her to seek more 
and better alternatives to incarceration, particularly with 
respect to young non-violent offenders in the first and hopefully 
last stages of their encounter with the criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the coming days and weeks as we debate it further in the 
House and as we get into committee, I think the debate will be on 
whether it is true that the minister has struck an appropriate 
balance or whether she is, as the criticism has been levelled at 
her, trying to be all things to all people without really coming 
up with an effective piece of legislation.  I will certainly be 
trying to make my own judgment in that respect in the context of 
our overall opposition to the bill, to which I will speak 
shortly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has said she has tried to make the bill more 
flexible, particularly in respect to the amendments that have 
been introduced since the last time it was before the House.  I 
understand there has been some attempt to try and satisfy some of 
the concerns raised by the Bloc Quebecois as to the ability of 
the youth criminal justice system in Quebec to continue to do 
what it is doing now, which by all accounts is a comparatively 
successful attempt to deal with youth crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people have said, and I have no reason to doubt them, that 
Quebec is one of the few provinces that has been able to do with 
the Young Offenders Act what was intended when it was first 
brought in.  Whether this is true or not, it is certainly the 
case if we look at rates of youth crime and the approach the 
province of Quebec is taking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give credit where credit is due, it is fair to say that 
Quebec is doing something right.  It may not be reproducible in 
an uncritical way in every province because Quebec, after all, is 
a distinct society.  It may be that things which are possible in 
Quebec are not as possible in other provinces, but certainly it 
would seem to me that we have much to learn from the approach 
taken in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the bill is not flexible enough at this point, if it can be 
demonstrated that it is so inflexible as to render impossible the 
ability of Quebec to keep doing the things it is doing right, 
then surely that is a criticism the minister should take 
seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the inadequacies identified in the current Young 
Offenders Act has been what my predecessor referred to when he 
was speaking in the House as an absence of discretion.  I will 
quote from Mr. Mancini who said on October 21, 1999: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know, and again I can give some evidence of my own, that in 
many cases what happened with the old Young Offenders Act is that 
there was an absence of discretion, that police officers, school 
teachers and people who routinely came in contact with young 
people ended up referring matters to the courts, even if they 
were the most simple matters where some cautioning or some 
exercise of discretion may well have dealt with the matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have seen in the courts young people coming in charged with 
damage to property because they got into an argument with a 
schoolmate over a school locker or where young people end up in 
court on trespassing charges because they walked across a 
neighbour's lawn.  There is no need to clog the courts up with 
these kinds of offences when we have serious matters that have to 
go before the courts. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that is a particularly insightful criticism of the Young 
Offenders Act. 
I think it points to the heart of the matter when it comes to 
finding the right spirit in dealing with young people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am reminded, as I often am with justice matters, of a person 
in my family, my grandfather, Alex Taylor, who was the chief of 
police in Transcona for many years, and before that a constable. 
Subsequent to being the chief of police, he became a justice of 
the peace.  Although he has been gone for 40 years, I still run 
into people on the doorstep who say “your grandfather gave me a 
boot in the rear end once when I needed it”, or “your 
grandfather took me home once when he could have taken me to 
jail” or “your grandfather put me in jail for the night when I 
needed a lesson”.  This was long before there was a charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these things demonstrate to me a certain amount of 
discretion, mercy and exercise of judgment when it comes to young 
people that sometimes can only be exercised by people who know 
the community, or who know the family or who know that young 
person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that context, I make the argument for more and better 
community policing.  Our young people should be policed by people 
who know them and who know their communities.  They should not be 
policed in the impersonal way that they are now so often policed 
in our larger cities where police do not work in the communities 
they live in or where they are transferred all over the place and 
nobody knows anybody anymore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that this absence of discretion is a key element 
of what is wrong with the Young Offenders Act.  However, there 
was another absence, and this is one that I like to also dwell 
on.  There was an absence not just of discretion, but of 
resources to deal with the process that was set up by the Young 
Offenders Act.  We see that same mistake repeated in the new 
youth criminal justice bill.  This is one of our fundamental 
concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been said by members who spoke earlier, the act is quite 
complex, cumbersome and lays new responsibilities down for the 
provinces.  It introduces new layers at the same time it does 
a good thing by introducing discretion.  It does not introduce 
the resources to make the exercise of that discretion happen in a 
way which would be both constructive and speedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing we all know, and I think all the literature agrees on, 
is that when it comes to young people, it is important that there 
be as short a time as possible between the action and the 
consequences.  What the minister has done is create a process by 
virtue of the increased complexity of the process and the lack of 
resources committed to making that complexity work, if that is 
possible.  By doing this, the minister may well have created a 
situation where the length of time between action and consequence 
has been stretched out even further.  It would seem that this is 
indeed one of the key criticisms that will be brought to bear on 
this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The complexity was alluded to by the Alliance critic but 
probably not as explicitly as I would have expressed it.  That 
might have to do with the fact that the Alliance critic is a 
lawyer.   He alluded to the fact that this was going to be a 
field day for the litigious.  I think what meant was that this 
could well be the biggest job creation program for lawyers that 
we have seen in a long time.  However, it is not the first job 
creation program for lawyers that I have seen go through this 
place.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example and as I understand it, the reverse onus provisions 
change the existing situation whereby the state now has to argue 
for youth between the ages of 14 and 17 to be brought before 
adult court.  Under this new law it will be the youths themselves 
who will have to say why they should not be advanced.  This is 
debatable in itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Leaving that aside for a moment, who is going to make these 
arguments on behalf of these 14 to 17 years olds?  Are they going 
to make the arguments themselves?  These arguments are going to 
have to be made either by the lawyers who their parents hire or, 
given the fact that a great percentage of the youths who get into 
such trouble do not have parents who can afford lawyers, it is 
going to mean a whole new dimension of legal aid and costs which 
have been put on the provinces without the added resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we see is a pattern of downloading costs onto the provinces 
which is quite unacceptable.  Unfortunately, it is part of 
pattern that we have seen not just in justice but in other areas, 
for instance medicare.  The federal government wants to set the 
rules, but it allows its participation financially in the 
administration of those rules to constantly erode.  At the moment 
the federal government is only participating to the tune of about 
25%.  That is high compared to health care which is 9% to 13%, 
depending on whose figures we believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other things that I could have spoken about, but time 
flies while having fun talking about the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things the bill does not do and I am glad that it 
does not do, and I want to put this on the record, is it does not 
deal with children under 12 in the context of the bill.  That is 
a position taken by the federal NDP, which we continue to 
support.  It does not mean there should not be a strategy for 
dealing with children under 12.  One of the things that the 
Manitoba NDP government is looking at very seriously is how to 
deal with young offenders 10 and 11 years old, both in the 
context of what they do themselves and also what they are led to 
do by others who are using their young age to their advantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was mentioned earlier that one of the virtues of the old 
piece of legislation, the Juvenile Delinquents Act, was that it 
dealt with children under the age of 12.  We need to find, 
subsequent to this bill, a way for the federal and provincial 
levels to co-operate in facing up to the fact that we have a 
problem, in more cases than we would care to admit perhaps, with 
children at that very young level.  We need co-ordinated 
federal-provincial strategy for dealing with that.  It should be, 
at least as I see it at the moment, outside the ambit of the way 
we deal with 12 to 18 year olds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say that we support the release of names in some 
circumstances, but we believe that in this respect there should 
still be a role for judges in exercising discretion as to when 
and in what circumstances names should be released.  The reason 
we have judges is to make these kinds of judgments.  It is 
consistent with our overall argument that there ought to be more 
discretion built into the system not just for judges but also for 
police officers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rest of my speech will address the fact that not only do we 
need to be, in an appropriate sense, tough on crime, we also need 
to be tough on the causes of crime.  Had I another 20 minutes, I 
would certainly go into all the social and economic measures 
which I think would help to support families and to create and 
reinforce the kind of values in our society that would go a long 
way in preventing young offenders from offending in the first 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I want to make sure people are in 
their usual seats, if they want to seek the floor.  Is the member 
for Wild Rose in his usual seat? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  That's what is says here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Well, he is then in his proper seat. 
I just cannot seem to keep track of all the real estate movement 
that goes on in this place from time to time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK186"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have made a lot of mistakes in my life, but I have 
always managed to sit where I am supposed to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the comments from the hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona.  It is too bad that he did not have more 
time to speak on the causes.  I am going to give him an 
opportunity to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know in his region in Winnipeg that a very serious problem is 
developing regarding gangs, particularly youth gangs.  There is 
one particular gang that comes to mind.  I think it is called The 
Deuce.  What I know about these gangs is a number of adults are 
actually exploiting these children to benefit their own processes 
of drug dealing, prostitution or whatever it may be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally, I am really sick of seeing pimps, who are pimping 
young girls even under 15 years of age, getting a slap on the 
wrist when they are picked up by the police and taken to court. I 
am also tired of drug dealers who are distributing to these young 
people and getting another slap on the wrist.  They are 
exploiting our youth to unbelievable proportions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member to comment on that particular 
aspect.  I know it is a serious problem in most of our major 
cities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to say that 
although the Chair may regard him that way, I have never regarded 
the hon. member for Wild Rose as a piece of real estate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I acknowledge the concern that the hon. member has raised.  It 
is a very real concern to the people of Winnipeg, and as he 
indicated, to people in other cities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Winnipeg we certainly have a problem with youth gangs. 
However, it is not just with youth gangs.  Sometimes it is a 
mistake to assume that all these gangs are people who would fall 
within the age group of the Young Offenders Act.  There are an 
awful lot of older adults involved in these gangs as well.  These 
adults use young people to their advantage, people who are old 
enough to be covered by the act and people who are younger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said earlier, that the Manitoba NDP government is concerned 
with trying to find ways to deal with that issue.  That is also 
why earlier in a previous parliament, I brought in a private 
member's bill dealing with anti-gang legislation.  It seems to me 
that this is one of the things that we have to address.  We of 
course know that our colleagues from Quebec are very concerned 
about that because of their own experience.   It would seem to me 
that one of the things the government should look at is bringing 
in anti-gang legislation of some kind that would give it a better 
handle and a better instrument with which to deal with these 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I would like to say a bit of what I think about the 
conditions that sometimes lead to crime.  We need to recognize 
the links between social conditions and crime, while at the same 
time creating a renewed sense of individual responsibility for 
one's actions.  A deficient upbringing of one kind or another may 
be an explanation but in the end it is no excuse for morally 
reprehensible actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that unemployment, inner city decay, drug addiction, 
child abuse, child poverty and an ever widening gap between the 
most and least prosperous in society create certain negative 
factors.  However, it is also true that some of the most 
frightening and senseless acts of violence are committed by 
people who are not socially or environmentally deprived.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A very real problem is that too many Canadians are growing up in 
a moral vacuum, where the very notion of right and wrong seems to 
be called into question.  This morally deprived environment, I 
believe, is partly the product of the violence and the 
shamelessness of modern TV programming and media advertising, but 
that is only part of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our entire culture has become one which emphasizes the bottom 
line and self-interest over everything, so it is not that some of 
these kids who offend do not have values.  They do.  They have 
picked up the vulgar, materialistic and individualistic morals of 
the marketplace that they are bombarded with and they are 
applying them to every aspect of their lives.  It is something we 
should all be concerned about. 
<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my question is for the member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona in regard to the statistics he is referring 
to.  In particular, I heard in his speech and also in other 
speeches that the province of Quebec has a very low rate of youth 
offences and youth crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know from my 30 years in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police 
that I filled out statistics in the very forms that we are 
talking about here.  I know that those statistics can be quite 
easily manipulated by the criteria and by the number of diversion 
programs where youths are pushed away from the statistics forms 
prior to them actually being recorded as having offended against 
the criminal code or some other issue.  I would like the member 
to comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, I think the relationship in regard to youth crime being so 
low in Quebec is not accurate, because Quebec has a massive 
problem with organized crime.  Organized crime is right down into 
the individual public schools and the junior highs and high 
schools in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have the statistics for this, but in my opinion youth 
crime is being grossly understated in the province of Quebec.  I 
have given the reasons why I say that:  because of the criteria 
that are given to the police to record the statistics and because 
of the fact that there is a massive organized crime problem in 
Quebec.  In my experience, organized criminals start out as youth 
and move into assisting those who are at the middle levels of 
organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, we have to be cautious in accepting that the 
programs and the diversion methods in the province of Quebec are 
those that should be applied to the whole country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the member to comment on the points I have raised if 
in fact that is what he is advocating 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was simply reporting 
what I understand to be a consensus in terms of the analysis of 
what has happened in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly would not quarrel with the member and his contention 
that Quebec has an organized crime problem.  Everyone 
acknowledges that, and so does the Bloc, but whether that in some 
way counters the other observation that is often made about 
Quebec, which is that in terms of its youth criminal justice 
system it has been doing something right, I do not necessarily 
see the connection.  If the member has a study on that to show 
me, I would be willing to look at it, but at this point I would 
certainly tend to stand by what I had to say. 
<P><A NAME="LINK188"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will begin by congratulating my colleague for 
Winnipeg—Transcona and fellow House leader on his first speech 
on a justice bill as a new member of the justice committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would certainly agree with your earlier assessment, Mr. 
Speaker.  He has never been accused of being short in either 
stature or loquaciousness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important piece of legislation that is before the 
House.  It is a bill that has reappeared in a very similar 
fashion to that form which it took in the last parliament.  This 
bill, I would suggest, is of such importance that I am hoping 
that both through the process that we are currently embarking on 
in the Chamber and in committee we will have ample opportunity to 
bring forward meaningful amendments.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All previous speakers have alluded as well to their party's 
position and their hope and desire that we will have an 
opportunity to improve upon this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say right at the outset that the philosophy behind 
this bill and the attempt to focus and to front-end load efforts 
at early intervention and at preventative measures for youth who 
are embarking upon a potential life in crime, who are heading 
down the road of involvement in the criminal justice system, is 
the correct approach.  To that end, the bill does try to steer 
the current justice system in that direction.  The failings, 
however, become very obvious when one starts to examine the text 
of the bill itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First there is the simple physical appearance of the bill.  It 
appears voluminous when compared to the existing legislation.  It 
is in fact almost double the size of the current Young Offenders 
Act.  The current Young Offenders Act has been much maligned and 
criticized in its 17 years.  It is now maturing and is almost an 
adult now, under the old definition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This particular bill in its current form is so complex, so 
convoluted and cumbersome that were it to be enacted in its 
current form, the delays, the interpretations, the legal jargon 
and the manipulations that would result would be astronomical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As committee members during the previous parliament, we heard 
numerous opinions on how the bill would work in its practical 
application.  We heard learned judges say they did not understand 
it.  Judges with years of experience in interpreting the current 
act read the legislation and said they could not understand how 
it would work in application.  That is frightening when the bill 
appears on the precipice of going into operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of other specific elements of the bill that I 
would like to address in my remarks, but I do also want to 
acknowledge the attempted changes put in place by the government 
and the Department of Justice.  They do speak specifically to one 
of the issues that was identified, most obviously by the Bloc 
Quebecois.  The changes speak to the issue of how justice is 
being administered currently in the province of Quebec. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased with the present situation in the area of 
justice in Quebec.  The situation in Quebec is clear.  Quebec is 
ahead of the other provinces as far as its approach to justice 
is concerned. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a model as to how the past system can be worked in a very 
positive fashion because of the emphasis the province of Quebec 
puts on this proactive and forward looking attempt at identifying 
youth at risk early in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, this is the failing of the bill, for the simple reason 
that unlike the way the current legislation is being administered 
in Quebec, this bill will create a false sense of security.  The 
bill, while raising expectations that the emphasis will be there, 
does not provide the support.  The bill does not put in place 
resources to allow this expectation to be fulfilled while 
downloading—the word used by my colleague from the NDP—the 
expectation that youth workers, police, judges, probation 
officers, all those involved in the administration at the front 
lines of justice, will be asked to intervene in a child's life at 
an early stage, which they are currently doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, they will not be given that backup.  They will not be 
provided with the resources, the time, the effort or the programs 
needed to administer the bill.  That is almost worse.  It is 
almost worse to raise expectations and then not provide the 
resources.  That is the major failing of the bill itself, coupled 
with the complexity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend and others in the Chamber have mentioned the 
discretion that is involved in the administration of this new 
legislation.  There is nothing wrong with having a healthy degree 
of discretion, but the bill itself in many instances takes away 
the discretion and creates a new level of process, a new level of 
sentencing, for example, wherein the concept of early release, 
statutory release, which is one of the major failings of the 
current adult system, is now being interjected into our youth 
court system.

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the previous parliament also looked at removing mandatory 
release from the current adult system, so it is ironic that the 
Department of Justice in its wisdom has come back and presented 
before the House a bill that puts in place a system that is 
highly questionable and arguably puts Canadians in danger.  The 
department is putting this into the youth system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also puts in place a very interesting and, I would suggest, 
flawed process of identifying violent versus non-violent 
offences.  There will be a sort of informal hearing to determine 
whether the case is going to be tried as a violent or non-violent 
offence.  I would suggest that again this is a misplaced use of 
discretion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also another interesting element of discretion, whereby 
police officers are going to be encouraged to use their 
discretion on the street in exercising justice, which they do 
every day.  They are going to be encouraged to on occasion 
administer a couple of boots in the rear end, as was referenced 
in a story by the member from Winnipeg—Transcona about his 
grandfather, I believe, to a young person who may be involved in 
what we will call a minor mischief offence such as vandalism, we 
will say.  I have a friend back in Nova Scotia, a defence lawyer 
from Antigonish named Hector MacIsaac, who calls this the Matt 
Dillon style of justice that police often administer, in their 
wisdom and with measured and tempered discretion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with this system is that, first, there is no 
tracking of the number of times a young person may be brought 
home, marched into a parent's living room and counselled by the 
officer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, there is also no ability for the officers to do this 
under the current restraints that they are experiencing.  We are 
now asking police officers to take the time to be youth workers, 
counsellors, in some cases surrogate parents, and to sit down and 
explain to the young person that this is unacceptable and 
potentially criminal behaviour.  It is not that a lot of police 
officers are not currently trying to do this, but again it raises 
the bar of expectations and yet there is no delivery under this 
act to provide the backup and the resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current system does not have any of these new, innovative 
and proactive provisions.  It is being funded at less than 50% in 
many provinces right now, much less than the 50% which was the 
original intent of the Young Offenders Act.  The original 
intention of parliament was that the federal government would 
pick up at least 50% of the administrative costs of youth 
justice.  That is not happening, and in some provinces funding is 
abysmally low. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consistency element of the act is also something that is 
extremely important.  I agree that there has been an attempt by 
the minister in this current act to accommodate provinces like 
Quebec that want to have discretion.  I know in that an ideal 
world the Bloc would like to be able to opt out completely, not 
only out of this bill but many other bills.  However, having that 
type of discretion, where the sentencing range could be 
extraordinary if this were to be permitted, is extremely 
troublesome, I suggest, particularly in the context of youth. 
Consistency is extremely important for youth in the 
administration of justice.  Consistency and a firm approach at 
times when they are needed are very important in sending that 
message to a young person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Deterrence and denunciation are two words that are constantly 
left out of the discussion around this bill, yet they appear 
daily in courts throughout the land.  Denouncing and deterring 
young people from repeating the behaviour, along with sending a 
message to like-minded youth, should very much be the intent of 
the bill.  It is not verboten in any way, shape or form to have a 
message of specific or general deterrence.  It is accepted 
practice.  It is accepted practice in the adult courts and in the 
language that is currently used in youth courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the other important contexts to keep in mind here is the 
delay that is involved in the administering of justice. 
Young people need to be held accountable in close proximity for 
the behaviour that is the subject of the criminal charges. 
Currently we see lengthy delays between the time of charge, 
arraignment and trial.  The new legislation will expand that 
delay exponentially.  It is accepted among practitioners, those 
on the frontlines, those who will be administering the bill, that 
this will create new loopholes.  It was referred to as a make 
work program for lawyers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a lot of friends in the legal community who are smiling 
with glee.  They are counting their billable hours in 
anticipation of the legislation coming into effect.  It will 
allow delays.  There is an old saying that delay is the deadliest 
form of denial.  It is particularly acute and exaggerated with a 
young person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consequences, if there are to be some after due process, 
must come in close proximity to the actions.  To make an 
impression in a young person's mind, it is particularly important 
that delay be avoided when possible.  That is not to say that 
cases should be rushed, but the streamlining and common sense 
approach in legislation like this is critical.  It is critical 
for public confidence and for those administrators, whether they 
be lawyers, most importantly judges, police or probation 
officers, that the bill be understandable and that the public be 
able to decipher the legislation.  That certainly is not achieved 
in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It reminds me in the broader context that perhaps we should have 
a separate committee in this place that would look at somehow 
making all legislation more understandable to those who would be 
most affected by it.  That again is a major failing of the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its complexity has been compared to the revenue act.  One person 
said it was tougher than Chinese arithmetic.  The bill has many 
cross-references and new sections.  There are all sorts of ways 
to manoeuvre through the bill which will create endless delays 
and in many ways thwart the course of justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics are often referred to in the debate about youth crime 
being up or youth crime being down.  The most important 
verification of what is happening on the street is to talk to the 
police, the court workers and those on the frontlines who are 
administering the law.  They will tell us that violent crime is 
up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Violent crime, particularly that committed by young women, is on 
the rise. The use of weapons in violent crimes is increasing. 
That is a disturbing trend that is not directly addressed by the 
legislation.  He concept of somehow defining violent versus 
non-violent versus serious violent offences blurs the entire 
issue, so much so that in one of the sections so-called simple 
assault is not deemed a violent offence.  That is perverse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics Canada also highlights another weakness in the 
system.  Based on August 2000 statistics, almost half of 
convicted youth in 1998-99 were merely placed on probation. 
Three-quarters of custodial sentences were for three months or 
less and 90% were for six months or less.  Two per cent of 
convicted offenders got more than a year.  Only .1% of youth 
crimes made it to adult court through the transfer provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This puts it in a different context because much of the debate 
will get blurred in the rhetoric of whether it is a tougher or 
weaker bill.  The statistics bear out that we are not currently 
throwing young people in jail at an alarming rate.  That is not 
the intention of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has to be injected in all of this an element of 
accountability and protection of the public. 
These are two fundamental cornerstones of any justice system, 
particularly youth justice. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1735"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The element of accountability has often been lost.  Currently 
the perception held by young people, and many who view the young 
offender system as not protecting them, is that it protects young 
people who are being brought into the system, as opposed to 
victims and those who have suffered at the hands of a young 
person who transgressed the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Repeat offences are a big problem when it comes to youth.  I 
have seen many instances where it takes five, six, or seven court 
appearances before a young person is given a custodial sentence. 
In fact, 48% of those convicted had at least one previous 
conviction.  There is very often a trend of escalating behaviour 
that leads to a life of crime.  It demonstrates the point that 
early intervention and perhaps an attempt at restorative justice 
or alternative measures should be pursued, highlighting the need 
for resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frontline victims groups and police officers are upset that the 
definition of common assault, as I have alluded to earlier, is 
not considered to be violent.  There is another element in terms 
of who is covered by the act.  There is a lot of distortion about 
the position of the Progressive Conservative Party and others who 
have taken a similar stance, that those under the age of 12 
should be included in such a way that they could benefit from the 
provisions aimed at extricating a young person from a life of 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly believe there is merit in having earlier 
intervention and the ability to avail a young person of programs 
aimed at drug dependency and at violent behaviour.  Young people 
are often victims and in homes where they have been subjected to 
terrible abuses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should we not have a transfer provision that takes children 
at the age of 10 or 11 and puts them into a system where they 
could avail themselves of those programs; not to hammer them, not 
to throw them in jail with other young people where we know they 
are often able to learn from older youth about more sophisticated 
crime, but to get them into programs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That discretion is there on the part of a judge.  It is not 
intended to take young people and put them in an adult court 
system.  We can currently take a youth and put him or her into an 
adult system.  Why should we not be able to take children who 
have involved themselves in serious behaviour and put them into 
the youth system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are recent examples.  An 11 year old boy in Edmonton 
walked into a bank in broad daylight and proceeded to rob it. 
Instances were reported of 12 and 13 year old girls in Calgary 
who beat an elderly woman in her own home.  The 12 and 13 year 
olds were charged with robbery.  Nothing could be done to the 11 
year old. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Children under 12 and older youths are expected to be dealt with 
through provincially administered programs which are supposed to 
be receiving funding from the government.  That funding level has 
not been met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The front end preventive measures are very much a positive 
element of the bill.  Other important changes could be made that 
will send the message of deterrence.  They should be included in 
the bill and in the language of the text.  The positive changes 
in this area of law and law enforcement are extremely important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are committed to working with all parties and all members of 
the committee to try to improve the youth court system; to try to 
build safer communities, which this entire process is supposed to 
be aimed at; and to try to give law enforcement agents, those who 
are to administer the law and the stakeholders the resources they 
need.  We will be submitting those amendments at the committee 
stage where we will be speaking to them there.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his fine 
delivery.  A common trend has developed across Canada which is 
generally called bullying by an older student or a bigger student 
on the playground or on the way from home.  Often this is 
assault, but when I follow through on such cases the particular 
individual is never charged with assault. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time the school, the staff and the principal are 
restricted in what they can and cannot do.  This phenomenon is 
growing. 
It is a national phenomenon that we need to stop.  I would like 
my learned friend to comment on that, because it does lead to 
more offences later on.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from 
Souris—Moose Mountain for the question.  The issue that he 
speaks to, assaults taking place on school grounds, is something 
that I have seen and is one that, sadly, I think we have all 
heard of.  What often happens is that a judge, as part of the 
sentence, will put in a probation order that the young person who 
has engaged in the bullying behaviour must attend school, where 
he has been, in many cases, inciting problems and engaging in 
assaults against other people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also concerned about the issue of swarming.  I would very 
much like to see a specific section in our current criminal code 
that addresses swarming.  This is extremely dangerous behaviour, 
where a gang mentality takes over.  Young people lose their 
anonymity and light into an unsuspecting victim and assault them 
in a serious way.  We have seen, in British Columbia, the sad 
case of Rena Virk.  There are other examples where young people 
engage in these extremely horrific assaults of swarming. Jonathan 
Wamback is another tragic example.  We would very much like to 
see the insertion of a specific code section that identifies this 
and has a specific, perhaps mandatory, minimum sentence that 
would be imposed for those who engage in swarming.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the member opposite is critical of the period of supervision 
following a custodial sentence.  Does he not feel that this is 
eminently more superior than the present system where, at the end 
of an individual's period of custody, the door is open and out he 
walks?  Does he not feel that a period of supervision will assist 
the aims of rehabilitation and reintegration, especially when 
that period is not statutory and is set by the sentencing judge? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the parliamentary 
secretary may have misinterpreted my position.  I completely 
agree that supervision after release is fine.  There is the 
ability of a judge to currently impose a period of incarceration 
and probation.  It has to be considered as part of the entire 
sentence that is being meted out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly the issue of being released cold into the community is 
part of this broader issue of statutory release.  However, that 
is one of the failings.  We are setting young people up if we 
inject this current system that exists in the adult system into 
the youth court system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do agree that the probationary period, the supervision that 
occurs, is perhaps equally important in order to see that there 
is no recidivism, no sliding back into the criminal behaviour. 
That is why the following conditions are so important:  must not 
associate; must refrain from the use of or possession of drugs 
and alcohol; must attend counselling; and must stay away from 
certain people, including the victim.  That is why those 
conditions are there.  They are part of the whole rehabilitative 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is absolutely consistent with the Conservative Party's 
policy on this.  We in no way, shape or form back away from the 
importance of rehabilitation and the importance of long term 
supervision for young people, if and when necessary.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have a question for my hon. colleague.  We talk about addressing 
the needs of young people, more of whom seem to be getting 
involved in crime, particularly violent crime.  Instead of 
addressing it through legislation, does he not think that one of 
the ways in which we could perhaps solve this problem, or at 
least partially solve the problem, is by addressing the 
educational, social and recreational needs of many of these 
people?  I believe governments generally have abandoned our young 
people when it comes to leisure and recreational needs.  I would 
like his comments on that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. friend and 
colleague from St. John's West.  He raises a terrific point. This 
is part of the broader debate about what can be done on the 
preventive side of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He would be very quick to agree that youth programs, whether 
they be music programs or sport and recreation programs that he 
has referenced, are absolutely the direction we should be headed 
in when it comes to the administration of youth justice.  This is 
where the emphasis should be.  This is where the money should be 
spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The programs, if administered properly, will pay huge dividends 
in the future.  The difficulty is that it is hard to gauge.  It 
is hard to display in a statistical fashion the preventive 
approach.  It is hard to say that if we spend the money now it 
will save <I>x</I> number of dollars in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very clear that when young people have something to do and 
something to occupy their time they are not hanging out on street 
corners.  They are not engaging in drug use.  They are not 
breaking into the homes of the elderly.  Those programs teach 
important values to young people.  They teach them self-respect 
and respect for their community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not agree more with my hon. friend that this is where we 
should focus much of the debate and much of our time, energy and 
resources, in the pursuit of a system for youth justice that 
works for the country.

will be sharing my time with my colleague from Vancouver Quadra. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to Bill C-7, the 
youth criminal justice act.  Before I begin, I would like to 
congratulate my colleagues in the Quebec caucus for the great 
work they did in suggesting amendments to Bill C-3. It must be 
pointed out that thanks to their efforts and the valuable input 
from stakeholders we are able to introduce a bill which offers a 
balance between the need to protect society and the needs of 
adolescents, who will be responsible for the society of tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have looked at Bill C-7 using the eye's of a lawyer, one who 
has had experience in Young Offenders Act cases, and I find that 
it respects the rights of young people more and leaves more 
leeway for the frontline workers, including the police and 
community organizations involved in crime prevention in the 
regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The preamble of the bill sets out society's responsibility to 
address the developmental challenges and the needs of young 
persons and to guide them to adulthood.  It also provides the 
need to prevent youth crime by addressing its underlying causes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was staggered to hear the Bloc Quebecois critic say that it 
was preferable to have an adolescent's record handled by the 
crown prosecutor. He said “Mr. Speaker, currently, when an 
adolescent commits a minor offence, the matter is referred to 
the crown prosecutor, who determines whether the young person 
needs help. If so, the Quebec system rehabilitates him 
immediately”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would a crown prosecutor be in a better position to decide 
the future of a young person than a neighbourhood police officer 
or a community agency long involved in the field?  Why the 
outcry when clause 6 proposes letting the police decide whether 
“to take no further action, warn the young person, administer a 
caution,—or, with the consent of the young person, refer the 
young person to a program or agency in the community that may 
assist the young person not to commit offences”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the problem with wanting the young person to be treated 
in his community instead of sending him to detention when he 
commits a minor offence? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the sceptics, I add that clause 7 of the bill gives the 
attorney general or any other minister the authority to 
establish a program authorizing the police to administer 
cautions to young persons instead of starting judicial 
proceedings.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Laval East, the Centre Défi-jeunesse in 
Saint-François is set in a middle income community where the 
social structure is 91% focused on the family. Young people aged 
13 to 18 represent 10% of the population and are especially hard 
hit since they have to deal with issues like welfare and single 
parent families or are trying to make it on their own on a low 
income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Centre Défi-jeunesse Saint-François was established in 1992, 
eight years ago already, to extend a helping hand to young people 
with emotional, social and relationship problems linked to their 
family, social or criminal situation or to their substance abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The organization can rely on well-known supporters like the 
Saint-François police department, the CLSC des Milles-Îles, the 
Fleur Soleil school and the merchants of the Promenades de 
Saint-François shopping centre located nearby. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The organization recently launched a project called Défi sans 
violence, spearheaded by community police officers and nurses 
from the CLSC. They were able to reach 400 young people. It is 
because our government believes in prevention that it has 
provided almost $32 million to crime prevention programs, 
including more than $4 million in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Centre Défi-jeunesse just received $50,000 for its project 
called Rassembler les deux mondes. It would be able to send a

workshops on violence and crime prevention in collaboration with 
organizations working in the field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Others projects will be coming soon. 
I spoke to the director, Mrs. Talbot, who told me that thanks to 
that experience, young people have learned to work with police 
officers and now the rapport between the two groups is nothing 
short of extraordinary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-7, it would no longer be possible to place in 
custody a first time young offender who commits a minor offence. 
Why should we absolutely incarcerate a young person who commits a 
minor offence? Do people realize what it means to have an open 
file in a youth court? Do they realize what it means for parents 
who have to parade before the court when there are other 
solutions? If this is what is currently going on in Quebec, let 
us debate the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know crown attorneys who work at the youth court. I would 
rather trust the police officer walking the beat in a 
neighbourhood because, in my opinion, he certainly has a better 
idea of what is going on than the crown attorney in his ivory 
tower at the courthouse, if only because the latter is often 
overburdened following all kinds of budget cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also think that we can better rehabilitate young offenders by 
putting them, as provided under clause 6, in the hands of 
stakeholders or experts in the community who know criminal gangs

a low crime rate.  It is too simplistic to claim that because 
Quebec's crime rate is very low, the system is working well in 
Quebec.  Some caution is in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is telling us that this reduction in violent crimes by young 
people in Quebec is not due to the work of our neighbourhood

area of youth crime prevention? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we must realize, and this is fundamental, is that the most

violent crimes, simple assault, the less serious kind, tops the 
list.

to the zero tolerance policy enforced by our police officers in 
Quebec, to the schools and to other stakeholders? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what the Bar said in its brief on Bill C-3.  It 
never said that crime was down because of the intervention of 
crown attorneys and the incarceration of young first time

still.  If members were to take a stroll through the youth

Quebec system worked like a charm but I have said that it worked 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> If there are administrative problems 
today in the youth centres, why is that?  It is because at the 
present time the government over there owes $850 million for the 
application of the Young Offenders Act, as the former minister of 
justice even admitted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let the hon. member not try to preach to the government of 
Quebec.  Let her look at what is going on within the Liberal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When she says she has practiced youth law, I would have some 
doubts about how effective she was judging by what she said 
here.  She has just said that the Commission des services 
juridiques du Québec lied when it said it was opposed to the 
minister's bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do the Conseil permanent de la jeunesse, the teaching 
federations, the school of criminology of the University of 
Montreal, legal community centres, defence lawyers, prosecutors, 
the Institut Pinel, the Association of Chiefs of Police, the 
Association des chefs de pompiers du Québec and many others I 
could name have to say?  They say that the minister and the hon. 
member are mistaken in saying that the Young Offenders Act is a 
good law. They say Bill C-7 should never see the light of day. 
That is what Quebec says.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec wants something very simple, and if the member really 
wants to defend Quebec, if she really wants to defend groups like 
Défi sans violence, if she really wants the bill passed quickly, 
she should put pressure on the minister to include the right for 
Quebec to opt out, no ifs, ands or buts, and the bill will be 
passed and in her hands in five minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carole-Marie Allard:</B> Mr. Speaker, does the hon. member for 
Berthier—Montcalm realize that the bill would generate 
significant additional moneys for Quebec since the amounts given 
to that province for the administration of justice would finally 
be adjusted, rising from 17% to 23%? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec would get $200 million out of the $951 million allocated 
to the youth justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not me but Quebec minister Baril who said that changes are 
necessary to put the youth justice network back on track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand why the opposition boasts about 
judicializing youth cases on the first offence and claims to be 
proud to do so. It is time someone stood up for young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know whether she 
is doing it on purpose but the member is getting her facts mixed 
up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has the highest rate of decriminalization for young 
offenders in all of Canada. Quebec has the lowest rate of 
incarceration in all of Canada. Quebec has the lowest crime rate 
in all of Canada. Quebec has the lowest recidivism rate in all of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is quite simple. Next time, before the member gives 
a speech, will she at least take the time not only to read the 
minister's bill and the ministerial briefing notes, but also 
briefs presented to the Standing Committee on Justice and Human 
Rights? She would realize that what she is saying is pure 
nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carole-Marie Allard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I can see my colleague 
is somewhat disturbed by my position. I think it is about time 
that it be known that when a crown prosecutor makes a decision 
regarding a young offender, he necessarily opens a file in youth 
court. What follows after that? It follows that the young 
offender must appear before the court, plead one way or another 
and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau:</B> No, this is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> No, this is not true.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stephen Owen (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to first address the constituents of Vancouver—Quadra 
who have entrusted with me the duty of coming to work with 
government on the important public policy issues to Canadians, as 
well as to work across party lines.  That will be the spirit of 
my remarks today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Vancouver—Quadra has unparalleled physical beauty, cultural 
diversity, prosperity, the greatest research university linking 
us to the new economy in Canada, as well as three major hospitals 
dealing with women's health, children's health and a teaching 
hospital.  Of course it never rains in Vancouver either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issues of youth justice, protection of the public and the 
best interests of children and youth are immensely important to 
Canadians.  Today, I would like to briefly address the principles 
behind Bill C-7, as well as the common cause that I see 
developing over the last 20 years toward dealing with this issue 
in a holistic and realistic way.  These issues did not start with 
this debate or this bill.  These issues have been going on for at 
least 25 years, since I have been practising law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Berger royal commission on children in the 1970s in 
British Columbia identified unified family courts, the important 
configuration of the youth justice system with the child welfare 
system and the use of community accountability panels.  We have 
been working across the country at different levels of success to 
try to apply these principles over time, but not with requisite 
success.  In my respectful submission, we are reaching toward 
that situation with this bill, the capacity actually to move 
forward on the key principles that I think people throughout the 
House agree on.

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principle of prevention is absolutely critical.  I would 
like to mention one aspect of prevention which is the root cause 
of youth crime.  If we look at the root cause of poverty, the 
despair that it causes, the levels of despair in impoverished and 
many native communities, we understand that that despair 
underlies the overrepresentation of native people in the criminal 
justice system.  The throne speech has directed its intention 
toward resolving that.  The most serious indicator of despair in 
an impoverished community is the youth suicide rate. The bill 
together with youth social services must come together to deal 
with youth suicide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accountability is absolutely critical.  However, it is critical 
that we target accountability so that we know where victim 
reconciliation or mediation, community accountability or 
community service can be most effective.  As the member said 
earlier, it can be a much rougher time for people to face their 
own community, or the victim, or their own family or do community 
service immediately and directly related to what they were 
involved with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Responsibility and accountability are also critically important. 
We have to distinguish punishment from the need to rehabilitate 
and reintegrate youth into our society.  No matter how serious 
the crime, and there are very serious youth criminals as all 
members know, people will get out.  We must not allow monsters 
back into our society.  We must stress serious rehabilitation and 
reintegration.  This bill addresses some of those issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me briefly address the issue of where there is a common 
cause.  I heard it addressed across the spectrum today.  We must 
address youth crime in terms of continuums along a number of 
dimensions.  There is a dimension of age.  There is a dimension 
of severity of crime.  There is a dimension of social and mental 
health needs of that offender.  There is a degree of common cause 
that I believe is developing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For youths under 12 years old, there are differences being 
expressed in the House but the objectives are the same.  It is to 
protect society as well as to ensure that the interests of the 
youth, their families and communities are looked after. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read the debates of last year on the former bill.  A member of 
the Canadian Alliance was debating the issue of youth under 12. I 
found some real reasoning in it and it was a good reason.  I have 
not heard that today.  It was bring young offenders perhaps into 
the purview of the courts so they can be protected from being 
victimized by elder criminals.  By doing that, it would keep them 
away from the criminal element.  That is a valid point of view. I 
do not think it is widely felt that children under 12 years old 
should be in the criminal justice system, but they must be dealt 
with through social services and child protection law.  I note 
that the province of Manitoba is developing comprehensive 
criteria to deal with the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Diversion of non-violent young offenders is absolutely critical. 
We have had over 20 years of experience in Canada with discretion 
being properly exercised in many areas, in pilot projects, by 
police officers involved in community policing and by 
prosecutors.  The hon. member for Provencher mentioned that he 
was prosecuting under the Juvenile Delinquents Act in the 
seventies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was public defending at that time and I remember thinking that 
being a public defender was where a person could get in and do 
some justice.  I quickly found out that the police and the 
prosecution in properly exercising their discretion had the 
greatest opportunity at an early stage, for non-violent and 
particularly young offenders, to do justice and make sure that 
there was accountability, that recidivism was stopped and that 
young offenders would get away from a history of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to go to court, this new bill provides judges 
with a range of tools which are important, including making sure 
there is an interdisciplinary approach, ensuring that parents are 
brought to proceedings and take financial responsibility, if 
necessary.

<A HREF="#LINKT50"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If someone is to be sentenced, the provisions for adult 
sentencing for the most serious crimes or repeat offenders is 
entirely appropriate.  It is well targeted at that specific need. 
If incarceration is necessary, let us have intensive 
rehabilitation services made available.  If someone is to be 
released then intensive supervision provisions are absolutely 
essential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although over the last 20 years we have heard rhetoric at levels 
that would suggest a great division among the parties on critical 
issues that are important to Canadians, I think there is a great 
deal of common cause.  These issues are absolutely critical to 
move forward with the bill, but the differences are more at the 
margins at this stage rather than in the fundamentals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard a particular issue of fundamental difference being 
expressed by the hon. member speaking for the Bloc and members of 
the Canadian Alliance with regard to lowering the age for 
presumptive adult sentencing. That option and flexibility are 
open to the province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would submit and respectfully say that we should get on with 
the bill.  There is enough common cause.  It is a critical issue 
and we should not waste more time.  The bill builds on the 
experience of the last 20 years.  It brings together a lot of 
very important and vital issues that have been raised on both 
sides of the House.  Let us get on with it.  The differences at 
the margins can properly be dealt with in implementation and not 
in delaying the passage of this important bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order.  Yesterday, shortly after 10 o'clock, I 
tabled a notice of motion for concurrence in a committee report. 
I see from the notice paper today that the notice of motion is 
not shown on the order paper.  The reason may relate to the fact 
that minutes before I tabled the notice I had also sought 
unanimous consent to have concurrence in the report and the Table 
may have confused the two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the Table does have the written notice of motion and I 
would ask that the order paper be corrected to show that the 
notice of motion was indeed introduced yesterday morning.  That 
would allow the 48 hour notice period to run as of yesterday in 
the event that 48 hour period becomes relevant. 
<P><A NAME="LINK198"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  What we have here is a matter of 
business going back to yesterday, Tuesday, February 13.  I 
believe I was in the chair at the time the hon. Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the House sought 
concurrence to this motion.  Concurrence was denied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Upon verification with our staff, we recognized that there had 
been an administrative error.  In fact, notice of motion was 
given yesterday and should have been on the notice paper today. I 
would conclude that the government will be eligible to call on 
that motion tomorrow should it so choose.  It is eligible for 
tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there are any questions, I will try to take them very 
quickly, but I hope I have made the matter as clear as we 
possibly can.  I would not want anyone to be surprised if the 
government should choose tomorrow to exercise that option.  It is 
eligible to it by way of an administrative error that we all 
regret.  Those things do happen but not very often.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The speaker from the Conservative Party talks about the 
complexity of the bill, the onerous wording, twice the wording of 
the present Young Offenders Act.  He talks about how that is 
totally unacceptable and says that it is an extremely difficult 
bill to grasp.  I think he is saying that even judges would have 
problems with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find this amazing.  When we start drafting bills and laws, we 
have lawyers writing the bills, lawyers prosecuting the law, 
lawyers defending the law, lawyers sitting on the bench deciding 
what to do with the law, and lawyers interpreting the law.  In 
this particular bill we are going to have lawyers who are going 
to have to intervene for young offenders under 14 to prove 
reverse onus.  We are going to have lawyer involvement to an 
unbelievable degree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a feeling that there is something wrong with this 
picture.  We have built a real legal industry under this kind of 
legislation, which does not make a lot of sense to normal people. 
Any normal person could not do this.   I suggest to the House 
that it probably took 17 lawyers from Ottawa to write this bill 
and it is going to take 15 Philadelphia lawyers to interpret the 
darn thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member not see something wrong with that picture? 
Lawyers, lawyers and lawyers, and we are trying to deal with 
youth crime and with what to do with our young people.  What the 
government has done with the bill is to build an excellent avenue 
by which lawyers will fill their pockets once again.  I do not 
see how it is going to make any difference to what is happening 
with youth crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stephen Owen:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the complexity of the bill 
is necessary in order to provide the flexibility to target 
individual young offenders with the types of crimes they commit 
and the types of problems they have and give the best recourse to 
the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Police officers I have dealt with in community policing and 
people on youth justice committees will not have any difficulty 
seeing the value of having the referrals and having the ability 
to act under this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was somewhat amused to hear that the legal aid lawyers in New 
Brunswick were smiling at the prospect of providing defences 
under this act.  The legal aid tariff in New Brunswick must be a 
lot higher than it is in British Columbia if this is causing 
anyone to smile. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the member for Vancouver Quadra for an interesting speech. 
If that was his maiden speech then I welcome him to the House and 
congratulate him.  His reputation certainly precedes him.  I am 
sure he will make a valuable contribution, especially in justice 
matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very pleased to hear him raise the issue of the 
overrepresentation of aboriginal people and aboriginal youth in 
the criminal justice system.  In the riding of Winnipeg Centre 
this is a big issue.  We have a great deal of what is called the 
youth gang problem.  For any number of socioeconomic reasons we 
have a lot more people involved in that than other areas do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member also mentioned aboriginal overrepresentation in 
the prisons.  I was just reading in a book last night that at 
certain points in the last 15 or 20 years, in two of the women's 
prisons other than Kingston the aboriginal population was at 
100%.  Those places were full of aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member mentioned the Berger report.  I am sure he has 
read the aboriginal justice inquiry from Manitoba.  Could he tell 
us if he is satisfied that this bill incorporates the 
recommendations or the better qualities of those two reports in 
tone or in content? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stephen Owen:</B>  Mr. Speaker, very briefly, dealing with 
the aboriginal justice report from Manitoba, I do not believe 
this does incorporate the recommendations in that report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in terms of the difference between having a separate 
justice system for aboriginal people or rather a general justice 
system that is flexible enough to incorporate both appropriate 
traditional methods, whether for healing or sentencing, I believe 
the bill is going in the direction of the spirit of drawing on 
traditional practices that will strengthen our criminal justice 
and youth justice systems in order to incorporate what is useful, 
appropriate and effective in dealing with aboriginal offenders.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this being my first opportunity to rise on debate in 
this parliament, I would like to congratulate the Speaker and his 
colleagues on their ascension to their positions.  For the first 
couple of weeks of this session, Mr. Speaker, I think you are 
probably going to have an interesting time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I extend my gratitude to the constituents of Surrey North for 
sending me back here for a second term and also to my wife, Dona, 
and my daughter, Jodi, for their support.  Especially on 
Valentine's Day, I would be remiss if I did not do that.  I also 
have to extend my gratitude to our 55-pound puppy, and I use that 
term advisedly, who I am sure will waste no time in reclaiming my 
half of the bed for the next three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all seriousness, it is unfortunate that I am once again 
speaking against the government's questionable youth justice 
proposals.  As members know, I have spoken in this place a few 
times on this issue.  I have sat through hours and hours of 
committee hearings and have been to many communities across this 
land.  I have encouraged the government to have an open mind on 
the need for significant changes to the Young Offenders Act. The 
minister is even on record as stating that the Young Offenders 
Act is “easily the most unpopular piece of federal 
legislation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that Canadians do not have the opportunity to 
actually look at what the government is proposing with its youth 
criminal justice reforms.  If they did, they would see that Bill 
C-7 is merely repackaging the Young Offenders Act, putting some 
political spin on it and selling it as a balanced and proper 
approach to misguided youth who manage to find themselves on the 
opposite side of our complicated laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the truth be told, the new youth criminal justice act, Bill 
C-7, has all the traits of becoming an even more unpopular piece 
of federal legislation.  Bill C-7 is virtually identical to the 
legislation the minister presented in the second session of the 
last parliament.  All she has done is insert approximately 150 
technical amendments to correct the mistakes, the typos and the 
errors in law of her previous version.  In spite of approximately 
150 substantive amendments from the opposition, there is 
absolutely no indication that the government even considered 
those proposals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, that does not surprise me.  For almost five years now, 
the government has been going through the motions of appearing to 
be interested in hearing suggestions for improvement to the youth 
justice process.  Other than a few relatively simple changes, the 
government has not indicated that it was even listening to all of 
those hundreds of requests for substantial change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For almost five years now, we have heard that the federal 
government has not been meeting its financial obligations toward 
funding of youth justice.  The government has announced that it 
is providing $206 million over the next three years, but that is 
merely to cover the initial costs of this new legislation.  There 
has been nothing to cover the shortfall that has been going on 
for years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the major problems with youth justice is the 
insufficiency of funding to cover training and rehabilitative 
costs.  If the young people who get into trouble are not given 
any direction and assistance to change, is it any wonder many 
revert to their criminal tendencies?  All we seem to do is 
investigate, prosecute, convict and punish these youths until 
they turn 18 and move on to similar activities as adults.  Only 
in that way do many of these youths disappear from the youth 
crime problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation is even more abysmal with those young persons aged 10 and 11. 
For years now, we have been seeing 10 year olds and 
11 year olds involved in criminal activity.  That was seldom, if 
ever, seen before.  We have also seen that child welfare agencies 
are frequently incapable of dealing with many of these cases.  I 
will not get into all of that because it is primarily a 
provincial and municipal matter, but child welfare was never ever 
set up to deal with criminal behaviour.  It was set up for the 
protection of children, not the protection of our communities 
from the children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, we have seen how the resources within child welfare 
have been stretched to the breaking point.  There is no luxury of 
expending additional resources to ensure that the occasional 
child who has found himself or herself on the wrong side of the 
law gets proper advice and guidance to get back onto the straight 
and narrow.  That is why the Canadian Alliance has been trying to 
influence the government into expanding the youth justice process 
to include 10 year olds and 11 year olds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judges have been dealing with young offenders for years.  They 
have seen their workloads increase because individual cases are 
not properly addressed in the initial instance.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not saying that judges have to lock up 10 and 11 year 
olds, but we are saying that judges need to become involved in 
the interests of the young offender and of the community to 
ensure the proper scheme is set up to bring the young person back 
on track.  We are saying we need to involve the judges to oversee 
the problem.  Child welfare authorities do good work in many 
instances but they were never set up to deal with criminal 
behaviour.  They do not have the experience or the resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss if I did not mention my private member's 
initiative that has once again been incorporated into the 
legislation.  One objective I had when I first came to this place 
was to bring forth legislation to have those who willfully fail 
to honour their court undertaking to properly supervise the 
release of a young person into their custody treated more 
seriously.  The minister has continued to realize the importance 
of the proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our justice system comes under supreme scrutiny when parents or 
others undertake to the court to supervise a young person who is 
considered to be a danger or a risk to the community, only to 
then permit that young person to go unsupervised.  Those who 
voluntarily agree to supervise and then wilfully fail to do so 
must be held accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will present a scenario to give listeners a chance to 
understand some of the concerns presented by the legislation. Let 
us take the case of a 14 year old youth who commits a sexual 
assault at knifepoint and whose victim is wounded or disfigured. 
The youth may face a presumptive offence under the legislation. 
As such, he may face an adult sentencing process as he has 
committed what appears to be one of the few offences listed as a 
presumptive, and he was 14 at the time of the crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However in the legislation there are few, if any, clear 
determinations.  We would first have to determine whether the 
province in which the crime occurred had used its power under 
section 61 of the legislation to change the age of application of 
the presumptive offence.  If it had been raised to 15 or 16, the 
young person would not necessarily receive adult sentencing.  In 
effect, he would have been lucky because he committed the crime 
in the right province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the attorney general can under section 65 advise the 
court that it is not seeking an adult sentence, even in a case 
such as this.  Furthermore the attorney general must provide 
notice to the court and to the young person before the 
commencement of trial that the adult sentence is being sought. 
Otherwise none would be considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the young person is found guilty of the offence, section 62 
states that an adult sentence shall be imposed if, and this is a 
mighty big if, the young person essentially agrees to accept the 
adult sentence or if the youth court justice is of the opinion 
that a youth sentence would not be adequate to hold the young 
person accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the court reviews that situation, either on its own or when 
the young person challenges the use of an adult sentence, the 
court must balance the proposed sentence with the contribution to 
the protection of society by having meaningful consequences with 
the interest of promotion of the young person's rehabilitation 
and reintegration into society, whatever that means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I read it, the court uses adult sentencing only as a last 
resort.  It must first of all be satisfied that a youth sentence 
is insufficient.  Then the youth court judge must balance the 
interests of the protection of society with the interests of the 
young person to be rehabilitated and reintegrated into the 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we can see with my example, the young attacker would receive 
an adult sentence only as a last resort.  The court must 
seriously consider whether incarceration will affect the young 
person's rehabilitation and reintegration.  Perhaps the court 
could decide that some form of intensive support and supervision 
program would suffice, with no incarceration.  This is just one 
of the youth sentences available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, we can use the example of the young person sexually 
assaulting with a knife.  Even though I have explained how 
difficult and improbable it may be for him to receive an adult 
sentence with incarceration, let us suppose that an adult 
sentence was imposed.  We must remember that in our example there 
was wounding and disfigurement of the victim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will he be identified when he returns to the community, or will 
the community be completely unaware of the danger of a repeat or 
of a more serious offence? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the young person received the adult sentence he may be 
identified pursuant to subsection 110(2)(a).  I ask the House to 
notice that I still say may.  Under subsection 75(3), the court 
may order a ban on publication of even this type of serious crime 
if the young person makes application for the ban and if the 
judge considers it important, taking into account the importance 
of rehabilitating the young person in the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us suppose we change the scenario to a less serious offence. 
Let us suppose the young offender does not actually use the 
knife; it has used it only as a threat.  The offender will not 
likely face an aggravated sexual assault charge.  There would be 
no presumptive offence.  We then enter a whole new ball game, a 
ball game in which the law is written even more favourably in the 
interests of the offender and not of the victim or of protection 
of communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately I do not have time to go through all the legal 
arguments, considerations and decisions by the attorney general. 
As has been said, the lawyers must be rubbing their hands with 
glee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope I have provided listeners with just some of the concerns 
over the problems and complexity of the legislation.  As I have 
stated, lawyers will be busy tying up the courts and the youth 
justice process as they debate the provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A more serious question is: How can we expect our youth and 
other citizens to know what the law entails when it is written 
with so many exceptions and so much legal mumbo-jumbo? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I stated at the start, when the legislation plays itself out 
Canadians will soon again become disenchanted and disappointed 
with the youth justice system.  Surely we have a duty and a 
responsibility to do much better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  When the House resumes debate on the 
matter the Canadian Alliance Party will have a 10 minute slot 
left, at which point the hon. member for Wild Rose will have the 
floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 6.30 p.m. this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 
10 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24.
