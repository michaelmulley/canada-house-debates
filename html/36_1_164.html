</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canada's ambassador to this prestigious world competition, 
this dynamic 21 year old has displayed the highest level of 
goodwill, sportsmanship and excellence.  Leanne carried out her 
duties with skill and compassion and should be very proud of her 
accomplishments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Her leadership qualities were clearly illustrated here in Ottawa 
when she attended the week long Forum for Young Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Leanne is an inspiration to people of all ages everywhere and 
has shown the world what is right with Canada's young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I join with all members of this House, Leanne's family and

be hosts to the world's finest Olympic winter athletes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Vancouver is already world renowned for its attention to culture

organizers who have contributed endless time and energy in making 
the bid successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Congratulations should also go to Calgary and Quebec City which 
both presented top notch bids. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbians look forward to the opportunity of showcasing 
Canada's most spectacular province to the members of the IOC, 
establishing that B.C. is certainly the gateway to the world.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
each year I co-sponsor an essay contest for students in my riding 
of Mississauga South.  This year's topic was “The famous 
Canadian I would like to meet”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The winning entry was submitted by Miss Jamie Hunter, a grade 7 
student at Homelands Public School.  The essay caught my 
attention because it was about an outstanding Canadian, Cassie 
Campbell, who has become a role model and an inspiration to 
Jamie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cassie loved hockey and despite significant hurdles she became a 
member of the Canadian National Women's Hockey team, representing 
Canada in national and world championships and at the Olympics. 
Cassie Campbell also obtained a university degree, did some 
modelling, coaches and runs hockey camps, authored a book and is 
a spokesperson for a program to prevent young women from smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jamie Hunter is in Ottawa today to meet the Prime Minister and I 
want to thank her for sharing her story about her famous Canadian 
role model. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I encounter motivated young people like Jamie I am reminded 
just how important it is for all Canadians who touch the lives of 
children to provide the leadership, support and guidance that our 
youth will need to become the leaders of tomorrow.

to recognize today farmers across Canada and all those in 
Brome—Missisquoi. They represent a vital link in the agri-food 
chain and contribute to a complex system involving suppliers, 
carriers, processors, grocers and restaurateurs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite our farmers' productivity, global circumstances beyond 
their control have them facing a financial crisis. 
Economic problems in Asia had a ripple effect worldwide, causing 
a decline in sales. Great crops are usually good news for 
farmers, but not this year. The loss of markets and inventory 
surpluses, combined with the effects of American and European 
subsidies, have caused a severe economic crisis in Canadian 
agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sit on the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food and 
we have been listening to farmers and to their suggestions as to 
how this crisis might be resolved. I am confident we can respond 
to them quickly and adequately.

$15 billion a year from families and individuals who make $30,000

the actuary correctly.  The actuary quoted a range and the other

premiums, nor in fact is it about income taxes.  It is about the 
Reform Party's agenda to gut the health care system, to cut the 
transfers to the provinces, to make sure that aboriginal 
Canadians do not have decent health care and do not have decent 
education. 
The Reform Party talks about the working poor.  When we brought 
in the child tax benefit to help the working poor, the Reform

Prime Minister stunned Canadians yesterday when he said that he 
does not see the link between the social union and the federal 
budget.  Canadians do see the link.  It is more children living 
in poverty, fewer unemployed receiving benefits, every single 
Canadian harmed by health cuts.  Why is the Prime Minister the

tearing apart our social union?

national child tax benefit of $1.7 billion.  Since we have been 
in government we have increased the amount of the child care 
deduction.  We have provided a family income supplement for 
roughly 350,000 low income parents on EI.  We have enhanced the 
community action program and the Canada prenatal nutrition 
program for children at risk.  I could carry on but I do not have

are 800,000 unemployed living without benefits.  This year alone 
37,000 more people have been forced to use food banks.  There are 
1.5 million children and their families living in poverty.

my question is for the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister's former Minister of Transport, Doug Young, 
signed an agreement to fund 100% of the cost of a highway in New 
Brunswick. The auditor general revealed yesterday that the same 
Doug Young has secretly altered the terms of the deal to allow a 
private company to charge tolls on that same highway.  Doug Young 
is the president of the same company that is going to charge the 
tolls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not take an ethics commissioner to know this is a

<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member takes great licence with the auditor 
general's report because he has come to conclusions that the 
auditor general did not come to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general came to some conclusions.  Quite frankly, 
Transport Canada disagrees with most of them and we told the 
auditor general and his staff that we disagree with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We disagree that the federal government failed to control 
highway funding.  We disagree that Transport Canada failed to 
provide accurate information.  We get our information from the 
provinces.  We work with the provinces.  We do not parallel the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the auditor general has a problem, he should talk to the 
provinces about the information they provide us with. 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, what the auditor general said exactly was that Transport 
Canada failed to exercise the controls entrenched in the 
agreement to ensure that federal positions are honoured.  It is 
the same thing we have been talking about for months and months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. minister if he will take action, stop 
boondoggling, stop the delays, stop stonewalling, use the tools 
as described by the auditor general, take action and stop this 
deal. 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the auditor general confuses minimum acceptable 
national standards for the national highway system with normal 
evaluations.

auditor general appears to confuse minimum acceptable standards 
and design standards. Those standards are developed in concert 
with the provinces which have the engineers and the experts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the auditor general seems to imply is that the federal 
government should set up a parallel department to mirror all of 
the work the provinces do.  We do not do that.  His analysis is

yesterday the finance minister announced that on January 1

to the CPP payroll taxes, a 15 cent hike per $100 from Canadian

taxed heavily enough.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, unfortunately, because of the inattention of previous 
governments, the Canada pension plan premiums, on agreement with 
the provinces, are going up.  But that is not where the 
difference lies. The difference is that the Reform Party does not 
believe in the Canada pension plan. It does not believe in 
sharing the risk.  It does not believe that Canadians of all

</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it was an excellent piece of news, that we had

insurance contributions, bringing them down to $2.55, and that 
we did so in keeping with the unanimous recommendation of the

were 15 cents lower.  What we are hearing instead is people 
saying they wish they could feed their families on these lousy

premiums does nothing for unemployed Canadians.

Mr. Speaker, despite the hon. member's selective quotes from the

Canadian contributions has meant that in 22 countries Canada is

order raised by the hon. government House leader on November 18,

act to incorporate and to establish an industry levy to provide 
for the Canadian anti-smoking youth foundation. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I would like to thank the hon. government House

case.

them. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-13 establishes the Canadian anti-smoking youth 
foundation, a non-profit corporation whose mandate is to reduce 
and to work toward the elimination of the use of tobacco products 
by young persons in Canada.  To this end, Bill S-13 proposes that 
a levy be imposed on tobacco manufacturers to provide the 
foundation with the necessary funds to carry out its mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A private member's bill originating in the other place, Bill 
S-13, was adopted there on June 10, 1998 and was given first 
reading in the House of Commons on November 18, 1998. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point of order raised by the hon. government House leader, 
simply put, is that the Bill S-13 proposes a taxation measure and 
that, as such, the bill ought to have been introduced in the 
House of Commons where it would have to have been preceded by a 
ways and means motion.  On that basis, he argues that the bill is 
improperly before the House and asks the Chair to rule that the 
House of Commons cannot proceed with its consideration. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I address the substance of this point of order, I want to 
respond to the contention made by the hon. member for St. Paul's. 
The hon. member argued that inquiring beyond the face of the bill 
and questioning the express provisions of it is to go well beyond 
the realm of procedure and into an area of law with which the 
Speaker is not to deal. 
The hon. member argued that the question of whether Bill S-13 
imposed a tax was a matter of law and legal interpretation and, 
as such, not normally within the jurisdiction of the Speaker.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The general proposition that the Speaker will not decide a 
question of law is set out in Beauchesne's 6th edition, citation 
168(5) at page 49, although the hon. member for St. Paul's did 
not invoke this citation.  The examples provided by Beauchesne 
involved questions that could only be considered as questions of 
law and which had no procedural dimension.  In both cases the 
issue was whether the legislative proposal before the House was 
within the legislative powers of the House as set out in the 
Constitution Act, 1867. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question that I must consider in relation to Bill S-13, that 
is whether or not the charge imposed by the bill is a tax, 
relates to the procedural rules and practices of this House as 
well as to the time honoured privilege of this House in respect 
of taxation measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More specifically, two questions are presented on this point of 
order and both are clearly within my jurisdiction as Speaker. 
First, is a ways and means motion required for Bill S-13? Second, 
should this bill have originated in the House and not the other 
place?  However, both these questions depend on the answer to be 
given to a third question, that is, does Bill S-13 impose a tax. 
If it does, a ways and means motion is required and the bill 
ought to have originated in this Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This third question is unavoidable if the procedural and 
privilege questions are to be addressed.  For this reason, though 
this tax question might be characterized as a question of law and 
in another context outside this Chamber might be raised and 
considered as a question of law, in this context it is considered 
only as an integral part of a question on procedure and 
parliamentary privilege.  Accordingly, it is proper that I 
address this question and let me do so now. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his presentation, the hon. government House leader argued 
that Bill S-13 should have originated in the House of Commons 
since it imposes a tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 53 of the Constitution Act, 1867, states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bills for appropriating any Part of the Public Revenue, or for 
imosing any Tax or Impost, shall originate in the House of 
Commons. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, as described in citation 980 found at page 265 of 
Beauchesne's, 6th edition, bills imposing a tax must be preceded by 
adoption of a ways and means motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To safeguard the financial privileges of the Commons, it is the duty 
of every member of this House to be vigilant and to ensure that 
every bill that comes before the House respects this criterion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Standing Order 80 is categorical on the subject and states in 
part: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All aids and supplies granted to the Sovereign by the Parliament 
of Canada are the sole gift of the House of Commons, and all 
bills for granting such aids and supplies ought to begin with the 
House— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, the House of Commons claims pre-eminence in financial 
matters—that is public expenditure and taxation—and all such 
legislation must originate in the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To determine if Bill S-13 is properly before the House, the 
Chair must ascertain whether or not it imposes a tax.  If it does 
impose a tax, the bill should have originated in the House of 
Commons and been preceded by a ways and means motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will appreciate that this matter involves issues of a 
complex and technical nature.  For this reason, the Chair has 
taken particular care to examine closely the relevant authorities 
on this issue.  I have consulted extensively the works of Erskine 
May and have found May to be a comprehensive and reliable source 
of information on financial procedures. 
I ask for the House's indulgence as I offer the following 
exposition of the problem at hand. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1515"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT16"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT16"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1515

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, financial procedure is primarily concerned with 
the authorization of public expenditure and taxation.  It has 
been argued that the charge proposed by Bill S-13 is not a tax 
because the funds collected would not form any part of the 
consolidated revenue fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the heading of “Matters requiring authorization by Ways 
and Means resolution”, May's, 22nd edition at page 777, 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although impositions are not generally charges on the people 
(that is to say, taxes) unless the proceeds are payable into the 
Consolidated Fund, the absence of a requirement for payment into 
the Consolidated Fund is not by itself conclusive indication that 
a charge upon the people has been avoided.  If, for example, 
money raised by statutory imposition is not to be channelled to 
the Consolidated Fund but is nonetheless to be used for the 
benefit of the public at large or for purposes which might 
otherwise have required to be financed from the Consolidated 
Fund, that imposition is likely to need authorization by a Ways 
and Means resolution. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, if a charge raises funds that are channelled to 
the consolidated revenue fund, that charge is a tax.  Even if a 
charge raises funds that are channelled elsewhere, the charge may 
still be a tax, however.  But a charge can only be considered a 
levy, and thus free to go forward without the usual constraints 
of financial procedure, if it is a charge made for an industry 
purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, the point of order, as I see it, hinges on the nature of 
the charge in Bill S-13 and its objects or purpose. 
Consequently, a closer examination of the bill is required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument has been made that Bill S-13 imposes a levy “for 
an industry purpose”.  In chapter 32, “Ways and Means and 
Finance Bills” of May's 22nd edition, we read, at page 779: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Levies upon employers in a particular industry for the purpose of 
forming a fund used to finance activities beneficial to the 
industry are not normally regarded as charges (that is to say, 
taxes). 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>May goes on to state: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Modern legislation, however, frequently makes provision for the 
imposition of other types of fees or payment which, although not 
taxes in a strict sense, have enough of the characteristics of 
taxation to require to be treated as “charges upon the people” 
and therefore to be authorized by a Ways and Means resolution 
moved by a Minister of the Crown.  This distinction between the 
types of payments which are or are not covered by the rules of 
financial procedure is not always straightforward in practice. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the central issue here is whether or not the 
levy imposed by Bill S-13 is a charge that is imposed primarily 
for a purpose beneficial to the tobacco industry.  If so, the 
charge would not be a tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here too May is helpful when he describes a case which presents 
some similarities with Bill S-13, namely, the U.K. Merchant 
Shipping Bill of 1973-74.  That bill obliged oil importers to 
contribute to an international fund for compensation for oil 
pollution damage.  In the 21st edition, at page 731, May states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This impost was so clearly not for the benefit of the industry 
concerned that it was held to be a tax in spite of the fact that 
its proceeds were not payable to the Consolidated Fund. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ultimately, therefore, it was decided that particular bill 
fell under the rules governing financial procedures and so had to 
be preceded by a ways and means resolution before being 
considered by the House of Commons in the United Kingdom. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In studying the case now before us, I have examined whether our 
House has ever dealt with the public bill providing for an 
industry levy.  In a session of the 35th Parliament, Bill C-32, 
an act to amend the Copyright Act called for the imposition of a 
levy on blank audio tapes. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1520"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT17"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT17"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1520

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The levy was of benefit to that industry since it permitted the 
audio duplication of copyright material for private use.  This 
would enhance the market for blank audio tapes.  The levy on the 
tapes was designated to raise funds by which owners of copyright 
material would be compensated for losses caused by private 
duplication of that material.  The link between the benefit to 
the industry and the levy being imposed seems clear in that case. 
The levy appears to satisfy the criterion that it was of benefit 
to the industry and so would not normally be regarded as a tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 was not required to adhere to the usual financial 
procedures and was not preceded by a ways and means motion. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Bill S-13, the Chair must determine the nature of 
the charge being imposed by the bill.  It has been argued that 
the charge is a levy for the benefit of the tobacco industry.  In 
support of that view we are referred to clause 3 of the bill 
which bears the heading “Purpose” and which states in 
subsection (1), in part: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(1)  The purpose of this Act is to enable and assist the Canadian 
tobacco industry to carry out its publicly-stated industry 
objective of reducing the use of tobacco products by young 
persons throughout Canada— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will set aside, without comment, the question of whether or 
not the industry has publicly stated as its objective the 
reduction of smoking in any segment of the population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me simply continue to quote from clause 3(1) which expands 
on the purpose of the bill to reduce the use of tobacco products 
by young Canadians as follows: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—given that 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) numerous debilitating and fatal diseases and other 
consequences injurious to health are associated with tobacco use; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) young persons throughout Canada use tobacco products and 
become addicted to tobacco and dependent on its use;— 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) young persons can only use tobacco products because the 
products are manufactured and sold;— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The text then goes on to read in subsection (2) of the same 
clause 3: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(2)  The Act complements the general legislative response to the 
national public health problem of substantial and pressing 
concern— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These statements seem to me to indicate that the purpose of the 
bill is a matter of public policy, namely, the health of young 
Canadians and not, as many members have argued, a matter of 
benefit to the tobacco industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are those who say that the two need not be mutually 
exclusive and that the benefit to the industry is such that the 
charge in question is not a tax, but a levy.  Proponents of this 
view point to paragraph (1)(c) of this same clause 3 which reads: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c)  the industry is incapable of addressing on its own the 
problem of tobacco use by young persons because, by its own 
admission, its members and agents lack credibility as advocates 
for a reduction in the use of tobacco products— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely the lack of credibility referred to here is a function of 
our common sense understanding of the self-interest of the 
tobacco industry, namely, that as a commercial enterprise its 
primary goal is to expand its markets and thereby to increase 
profits.  Young people would constitute the future growth 
potential for the industry's market.  How could it be to the 
benefit of the industry to reduce smoking among the very people 
who would constitute its growth market?  It is this implausible 
proposition that underlies the credibility problem to which the 
bill refers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proponents of the bill argue that the public relations benefit 
represented by the establishment of the foundation would be a 
benefit for the industry.  They cite the independence of the 
proposed foundation and its role in the national co-ordination of 
anti-smoking efforts. 
Is it not reasonable to suppose, if the industry had wanted to 
improve its public image in this matter, that of its own 
volition it could have created an arm's length body like the 
foundation?  Why is legislation like this required?

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us return to clause 3, this time to paragraph (1)(e) which 
reads: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(e) it is foreseeable that the industry's ability to manufacture 
and sell tobacco products will be further restricted if the rate 
of use of tobacco products by young persons is not reduced; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been argued that this section points again to a benefit 
to the industry since the foundation activities may pre-empt 
further restrictions on the industry.  This is to speculate on 
future government measures and to conclude that the establishment 
of the foundation will obviate the necessity for such measures. 
But is this simply not another way of saying that this charge in 
this bill is a benefit to the industry only because future 
measures might be less palatable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have carefully considered all of the arguments presented and 
have examined all of the cases which hon. members have brought to 
my attention, even though I have not discussed each one in detail 
in this ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am forced to conclude that the charge imposed by Bill S-13 is 
directed not toward any benefit to the tobacco industry but to a 
matter of public policy, that is, the health of young Canadians, 
a laudable purpose without doubt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill seeks to establish the Canadian anti-smoking youth 
foundation whose objective is to reduce and eventually eliminate 
the use of tobacco products by young persons in Canada.  It 
strains credulity to claim that this objective is a benefit to 
the tobacco industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However ingenious the framers of Bill S-13 have been in drafting 
and structuring the bill to resemble an industry purpose, one 
that perhaps would enhance the standing in our society of the 
tobacco industry, Bill S-13 has as its main object the reduction 
and elimination of smoking.  This is a matter of public health 
policy and it is by virtue of this public purpose that I have 
concluded that the charge Bill S-13 imposes on the industry is a 
tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House of Commons has the exclusive right and obligation to 
legislate financial measures.  Only the House of Commons, acting 
on the initiative of ministers of the crown, can impose taxes to 
generate the funds needed to support public policy programs.  I 
am obligated as your Speaker to ensure that these fundamental 
financial privileges are not compromised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simply put, any bill imposing a tax must originate in the House 
of Commons and must be preceded by a ways and means motion. 
Since Bill S-13 proposes a tax, did not originate in the House of 
Commons and thus was not preceded by a ways and means motion, I 
therefore find that it is not properly before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, first reading proceedings are null and void and 
this item is withdrawn from the order paper.

am pleased to present a petition signed by a number of Canadians, 
including from my own riding of Mississauga South. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners would like to bring to the attention of the 
House that human rights violations continue in many countries 
around the world, such as Indonesia.  They also point out that 
Canada continues to be respected for its defence of universal 
human rights. Therefore they call upon the government to continue 
its efforts to speak out against countries that tolerate human 
rights violations and to do whatever is possible to bring to 
justice those responsible for such abuses.

is my privilege to present in the House today a hefty stack of 
petitions.  These citizens of Canada are drawing the attention of 
the House to the fact that a majority of Canadians understand the 
concept of marriage as only the voluntary union of a single, that 
is unmarried, male and a single, that is unmarried, female and 
that it is the duty of parliament to ensure that marriage as it 
has been known and understood in Canada be preserved and 
protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These petitioners ask that parliament enact Bill C-225 so as to 
define in statute that a marriage can only be entered into 
between a single male and a single female.

build nuclear weapons, has rejected that option and in so doing 
recognizes the military futility of nuclear weapons. They pray 
that parliament support the goal of the abolition of nuclear 
weapons on Earth by Canada, advocating the immediate de-alerting 
of all nuclear devices, and that Canada join the nations of the 
New Agenda Coalition, and that Canada advocate within NATO that 
nuclear weapons have no militarily useful role.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, the Bloc Quebecois members are opposed to 
this bill which is, in our opinion, simply an aberration.  It 
ought not to exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has led the government across the way to want to create one 
agency after another?  Since when have politicians been afraid 
to act and preferred to have outside agencies make the 
decisions?  Judging by a number of past experiences, these 
agencies have not been a great success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are a few examples. The food and drug inspection agency, 
which I do not think is very efficient, and the wheat board as 
well. 
Nav Canada, which controls airports instead of the Department of 
Transport, makes dictatorial decisions, closes control towers 
without consulting those concerned, putting the flying public at 
risk.  Despite its promises to keep jobs, this agency has quite 
simply got rid of more than 30% of its employees in the past 18 
months alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take another example of a government-created agency, 
Aéroports de Montréal.  The purpose of ADM was to promote the 
Dorval and Mirabel airports,  what did it do instead?  Quite 
simply, it destroyed Mirabel by transferring all international 
flights to Dorval, by fiddling with reports by experts who 
stated that such a transfer was not the best thing, the status 
quo was. 
I am not the one who said reports had been fiddled with. This 
was the view expressed by Mr. Justice Viau in a decision 
slamming ADM for its handling of reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Revenue seems to be more interested in promoting 
Vancouver and Whistler for the 2010 Olympics than in doing his 
job, which is to consult people affected by the creation of this 
agency.  The minister is trying to convince us that he has 
consulted just about everyone and seems to be saying that 
everyone shares his view.  However, no provinces have signed any 
memorandums of understanding or wanted to have anything to do 
with the agency.  As things now stand, the minister is all 
alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister dares to say that the government has created a new 
tax collection vehicle.  Instead of paying experts, engineers, 
to design this new vehicle, which is really nothing more than a 
Liberal monster, the minister should have put all this money 
into promoting and restructuring his own Department of Revenue. 
The majority of Canadians are beginning to have more confidence 
in the existing Department of Revenue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister wants to create an additional structure that will 
cost millions of dollars and that will have friends of the 
government as its commissioners and members.  All this does is 
increase the number of officials in the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, Department of Revenue employee representatives claim 
that this new agency will means thousands of lay-offs, close to 
40,000 across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of spending money on this agency, the minister should 
hire some decent professionals and he should hire enough of them 
so that taxes can be collected properly. 
A program on the CBC in the spring revealed that, in Toronto, 
there is a shortage of between 500 and 1,500 tax collectors at 
the department of revenue.  This shortage of professionals cost 
between $500 million and $1 billion annually.  This is not 
acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Creating a customs and revenue agency is totally unacceptable. 
At the moment we are receiving a lot of complaints and letters 
in our ridings from customs agents fearing for their jobs and 
threatened with the loss of their job because of this new 
agency.  Everyone is on edge; everyone is afraid of this new 
monster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of revenue, instead of wasting his time promoting 
Vancouver and Whistler for the 2010 Olympic Games, should come 
back, do his job, really look at the problems and improve the 
revenue system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have no objection to a single window for collecting taxes, 
but it should be under the control of the individual provincial 
departments of revenue.  Quebec can handle collecting 
provincial, federal, municipal and school taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can my colleagues accept this national agency collecting 
city tickets?  It makes no sense.  Can we imagine this agency 
collecting municipal and school taxes?  It is simply ridiculous. 
But it is empowered to do so.  It is just crazy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really hope that the minister will withdraw Bill C-43, which is 
untenable and ridiculous. 
We hope the minister understands common sense and that all the 
members of this House understand it as well and ask the minister 
to redo his basic homework, really consult all Canadians in 
depth and not just simply say “I met a few people.  They agree”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise today to debate the motions in Group No. 1 
respecting Bill C-43. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1600"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is pretty well the only major government piece of 
legislation before us in this session which proposes to convert 
the Department of National Revenue into a quasi-independent 
agency governed by a board, appointed by cabinet and managed by a 
commissioner appointed by cabinet as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government suggests that this agency would be able to 
operate more efficiently and would be more flexible in its human 
resources policies, less bound by the strictures of the current 
Treasury Board and other statutory guidelines that have hampered 
its ability to recruit and retain highly skilled professionals in 
the tax auditing and information technology fields in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also suggests that this new agency would be so 
structured as to work with the provinces on a contractual basis 
to collect on their behalf provincial source taxes such as 
provincial corporate and sales taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that these are the first amendments before us, I would 
like to say at the outset that the Reform Party has consistently 
from the beginning of the debate on Bill C-43 made clear our 
support for the concept of more flexible management in the public 
service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that large sections of the bill are a positive step 
forward, that by liberating Revenue Canada from the sometimes 
absurdly bureaucratic regulations in Treasury Board and various 
statutes on human resources practices the government could be 
creating an agency which operates in a more businesslike and 
efficient fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think this model should not be limited to the tax collection 
apparatus of the government but rather should be replicated 
throughout the public service.  We do not oppose large sections 
of the bill dealing with that issue.  Nor do we necessarily 
oppose the creation of a board whose directors would be 
ostensibly nominated by the various provinces or the prospect of 
greater federal co-operation with the provinces in tax collection 
and administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we have expressed our very grave concern that the bill, 
absent of some very meaningful amendments, would create the 
possibility of less accountability in the administration and 
enforcement of Canada's tax laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said before, the power to tax is, next to or along 
side the criminal law power, the most awesome power which 
parliament wields.  It is the power to destroy economically.  It 
is an enormous power.  It is a power that must be exercised with 
utmost discretion in ensuring in every instance that the 
democratic representatives of Canadian taxpayers who sit in this 
Chamber are ultimately able to answer for the practices of our 
tax collection department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last thing Canadians want is an IRS style tax collection 
agency.  The last thing Canadians want is an agency which is a 
law unto itself, which allows its tax auditors, collectors and 
agents to enforce the law without regard for the milk of human 
kindness but with the most rapacious kind of attitude of 
squeezing money out of taxpayers to the best of their ability. 
That is not the kind of culture we want to see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Coercive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  “Coercive”, as my colleague says.  A 
coercive and intimidative culture is not what we want to see in 
the tax collection agency of parliament and of government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition has put forward a comprehensive proposal 
for a taxpayer bill of rights which would enumerate for the first 
time in federal law a number of rights to due process for 
taxpayers in the entire tax auditing and collection system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially our draft taxpayer bill of rights would include the 
declaration of taxpayers rights first promulgated by the then 
revenue minister, Mr. Beatty, in 1985.  It would give it teeth, 
legislative force, and would expand on it.  It would essentially 
ensure in legislation that taxpayers were presumed innocent until 
proven guilty in the tax process.  It would reverse the onus 
which is now on taxpayers who are too often determined to be 
guilty until proven innocent by the agents of Revenue Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, it would give taxpayers various avenues of appeal 
which are not now open to them.  Currently if taxpayers of 
ordinary means find, as they find in many cases, that they have 
been unduly targeted by heartless collection agents at Revenue 
Canada, they have only one real avenue of recourse and that is 
through the tax court.  The vast majority of people of modest 
means do not have the resources to use the appeal process through 
the courts.  They cannot hire tax lawyers and spend months and 
years and tens of thousands of dollars defending their basic 
rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We propose as part of our taxpayer bill of rights the adoption 
of an office for taxpayer protection that would essentially be an 
ombudsman to adjudicate legitimate disputes between taxpayers and 
the revenue agency.  It would essentially provide an avenue of 
appeal far less costly and far more accessible to taxpayers than 
what currently exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These two measures, a taxpayer bill of rights and the adoption 
of an office of taxpayer protection, would go a very long way 
toward protecting Canadian taxpayers in the new era of the Canada 
customs and revenue agency.  We can see no good reason, nor has 
the government offered a single good reason, why a taxpayer bill 
of rights ought not to be introduced and passed alongside the 
legislation before us today, Bill C-43. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why at the outset of our debate over the next couple of 
days on the amendments to Bill C-43 I would once again call upon 
my colleagues in government to consider our sincere, detailed and 
thoughtful proposal for a taxpayer bill of rights.  If the 
minister were to give us an inclination that he was willing to 
seriously consider the kind of recommendations we have made, we 
in turn as the official opposition would seriously consider 
supporting the bill because of some of the incremental 
administrative efficiencies that may be achieved by it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless and until the government gets the message that Canadians 
are not satisfied with the level of fairness and due process in 
the tax collection system and takes some concrete steps to 
further entrench and protect taxpayers rights, there is no way we 
could support a bill which has even a slight potential for 
spinning out of control into an IRS tax style agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party opposes put forward by 
my colleague the Bloc Quebecois in Group No. 1 because they are 
dilatory motions which seek to delete each clause of the bill. 
We do not think thee are constructive amendments.  We feel that 
many sections of the bill, including those which these motions 
seeks to delete, are worthwhile incremental improvements.  We 
will oppose the motions in Group No. 1 and oppose the bill unless 
amended to include a taxpayer bill of rights.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to say a few words about Bill C-43 before the 
House today at report stage and invite some of my friends and 
colleagues in the Liberal Party to express their points of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many members in the House have independent spirits.  I see my 
friend from Prince Edward Island across the way.  I am sure he 
would not mind making a speech about the bill and how complicated 
it will make the process.  I am sure he would explain to us why 
his province of Prince Edward Island, for example, has not signed 
on to it.  He is a good friend of his premier.  Why has he not 
been able to persuade the premier to sign on to the bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very important issue.  What is being established here is 
a brand new taxation agency.  It will take 40,000 people out of 
Revenue Canada, which is 20% of the people who work for the 
Government of Canada, and establish a brand new agency to collect 
taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the idea came from the member for Prince Edward Island, 
I am not sure, but it came from the thought that the government 
wanted to get rid of the GST.  It wanted to solve the problem of 
a promise by harmonizing the GST with the PST.  However, only 
three provinces agreed:  Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and 
Newfoundland.  The thought was to have a new tax agency 
collecting the new harmonized sales tax, federal income taxes, 
provincial income taxes, maybe even the school taxes, the 
municipal taxes, liquor taxes and all other taxes.  In other 
words it was to be a super agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party and I are concerned about that for a number of reasons. 
It is supposed to collect federal, provincial and municipal 
taxes.  Not a single province at this time has expressed any 
interest in this regard except New Brunswick in terms of 
collecting one of the small taxes in that province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder why the member from Prince Edward Island has not been 
able to persuade his favourite premier to decide on this agency. 
Perhaps he or his seatmate from Ontario could tell us about their 
premiers.  Why has the Ontario premier, Mike Harris, not signed 
on to this agency?   It is because Mike Harris is against the 
agency as is the Government of Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about Quebec?  Quebec, by its very definition, will not 
participate in this agency to collect taxes.  We know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  You don't buy a car before you see it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  I have been around here a long time. 
I heard the member across the way.  However, whenever I see a 
piece of legislation that affects both the provinces and the 
federal government there is a lot of discussion and agreement 
ahead of time about how it should be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Health Act is a very good example.  All kinds of 
negotiations take place between the provinces and the federal 
government when they agree on an agency and then the agency comes 
forth.  However, the government is putting the cart before the 
horse in this regard.  Not a single province has agreed but the 
government expects us to agree before agreement has been reached 
with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have an amendment which I hope members across the way would 
support.  It states that we should not proceed until at least 
half the provinces sign on.  That seems to be fair.  I am not 
saying half the provinces with two-thirds of the population or 
something like that; I am just saying half the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from Prince Edward Island is champing at the bit 
wanting to participate in the debate.  I will not take very long 
so that he can rise and say his piece on why he has not persuaded 
his premier and his province to sign on to this agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are all kinds of other concerns.  One is the shrinking of 
the size of government.  We hear talk about the united 
alternative.  The Reform and Conservative Parties want to form a 
very conservative alternative.   We have a very conservative 
government across the way.  We have now the smallest federal 
government we have had on a percentage basis since before the 
second world war.  The bill will once again shrink the size of 
the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see a Liberal Party that is more conservative than the 
Conservatives who were there a few years ago.  Yet the member 
from Prince Edward Island sits there, clenches his teeth in 
frustration and does not dare speak out. 
It seems very strange that some of these members who are 
reasonably progressive sit back and take this kind of 
quasi-privatization on this particular issue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing is the question of accountability.  Once again 
the government is going to establish an agency that will be arm's 
length from the government, arm's length from the Parliament of 
Canada.  The new agency will have a CEO and a board of directors. 
The CEO will report to the government through a minister.  That 
will be arm's length from this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I worry about the whole question of accountability.  In setting 
up this corporation that is going to collect taxes, what about 
accountability for the people of this country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are some of the issues we are hearing about when we talk 
about this bill across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also tremendous opposition from the workers themselves 
at National Revenue, as articulated by the Public Service 
Alliance of Canada, PSAC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look across at the member from Prince Edward Island, a former 
national union leader in this country and the former president of 
the National Farmers Union. His brothers and sisters in PSAC are 
saying “Don't go ahead with this bill.  It is a bad bill for 
workers.  It is a bad bill for the people who have to collect 
taxes”.  Yet this former union leader rests silent in his seat. 
He is afraid to get up and speak his mind.  That is very strange 
for a former national union leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be listening to the workers.  Those who will work in 
this agency and collect taxes know best whether it is going to be 
efficient and good for the people of the country, but they are 
being ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To top it off, the committee did not even travel to any of the 
border communities like Sarnia or Windsor to speak to the people 
who are on the front lines in terms of customs.  It did not 
travel to those communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  It met them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  It met a few of them.  It had a few 
hours of hearings, but very few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee did not travel to Vancouver or other parts of 
British Columbia.  It did not go down to the east coast or to the 
Windsor and St. Catharines border crossings to speak directly to 
the workers.  The government is afraid of what it would hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the member from Prince Edward Island must be hanging 
his head in shame when he hears some of these reports, coming not 
only from this side of the House but from members of his own 
party who, because of our parliamentary system, do not have the 
courage to stand and speak publicly in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general released his most report the other day. 
Yesterday it was before the public accounts committee, under the 
able chairmanship of my friend from St. Albert.  In this very 
voluminous report there is a section that deals with Revenue 
Canada.  It says many things about Revenue Canada and about its 
many problems.  It makes a comment about the agency.  It states 
that “the establishment of a new agency will not in itself 
resolve the problems outlined in this chapter with Revenue 
Canada”.  The auditor general is saying that the problems that 
exist today in Revenue Canada will not be solved by the creation 
of this new tax agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on and on.  There is problem after problem.  There is 
considerable opposition around the country.  There is opposition 
from the provinces, in view of the fact that they have not signed 
on to this particular agency.  There is opposition from the 
people who work for Revenue Canada and the Public Service 
Alliance of Canada.  Yet the government wants to proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need some serious parliamentary change so that government 
backbenchers can speak their mind, tell us what they think, tell 
us what their constituents think and tell us what the workers in 
this country think.  We need that kind of parliamentary change so 
the minister is not just jerking them around by the neck and 
telling them what to do.  That is the kind of change we need in 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very good example of a bill that should not pass, a 
bill which should be delayed for at least six months until the 
proper amendments are made, but the government backbenchers 
cannot speak their mind.  That is why we need parliamentary 
reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that were the case, the member from Prince Edward Island 
would not be afraid to stand in this House.  But he knows that if 
he does that he may not be a parliamentary secretary any longer, 
he may not be a cabinet minister, he may not be a chair of a 
committee and he may be able to take a certain trip. 
That is the kind of power the government whip has today.

with pleasure that I rise today to speak to the motions in Group 
No. 1 respecting Bill C-43. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issues are quite complex.  The government claims that there 
will be savings of $171 million to $285 million in compliance 
costs and also savings of $97 million to $162 million in 
administrative costs due to this new revenue agency.  That is 
assuming that all provinces opt in.  That is a very big 
assumption.  The government has not succeeded, for instance, in 
convincing provinces to sign on to the HST or the blended sales 
tax, with the exception of a few provinces in eastern Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Federation of Taxpayers believes that there will be 
no major savings from this new agency.  The federation is 
certainly well-versed both in terms of tax policy, tax 
enforcement and also in terms of pointing out inefficiencies in 
government.  I would suggest that is a very significant criticism 
of the government's plan to create this revenue agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be focusing, in a very holistic way, on the 
simplification of the tax code.  We should be working toward a 
fairer, flatter, less Pavlovian tax code.  We should be looking 
at simplifying both business taxes and personal taxes such that 
Canadians do not have to hire professional accountants and 
lawyers to deal with their own government.  Instead the 
government is focusing on the logistics of the administrative 
aspects of tax enforcement.  I believe that this is a misdirected 
effort at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This revenue agency, the way the government is going about it, 
is inconsistent with general trends of federal-provincial 
relations.  Provinces want greater autonomy.  Quebec, for 
instance, is not interested, and Ontario is indicating that it 
may want its own agency.  Ontario is looking to gain greater 
authority over its tax levers and over the enforcement side of 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It cannot simply be said that the provinces are going to sign 
onto this.  There has not been dramatic indication from the 
provinces.  I would argue that without that commitment in advance 
this simply should not go ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says that it will create this good agency and the 
provinces will at some point understand what a great agency it is 
and what a great service it can deliver and they will want to 
sign on.  I am very skeptical, as are members of my party, that 
that will occur.  The provinces certainly have not bought into 
the government's blended sales tax to the extent they were 
expected to.  Although, we have to commend the government on its 
flip-flop on the GST.  It certainly has come a long way in terms 
of its support of consumption taxes today as opposed to where it 
was in 1993.  But hypocrisy is only half a mortal sin and I guess 
we cannot pillory the government too far on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned about the appointment process of the board of 
directors which will be responsible for this agency.  I know that 
the government is saying there will be federal-provincial 
co-operation and that, in itself, will eliminate or reduce the 
potential for patronage.  That is the same assurance the 
government provided, for instance, with respect to the Canada 
pension plan investment board, and yet, of the 12 members of that 
board, six are prominent Liberals.  In fact, five were 
significant contributors and one was a former Liberal MP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the process is tainted.  The board that is 
responsible for the appointments has representatives from each 
province, but that board is chaired by a prominent Liberal, Mr. 
Phelps.  He gave a list of 20 names to the Minister of Finance, 
and the minister chose 12 people from the 20.  I suggest that it 
is no coincidence that 6 of the 12, 50% of the board responsible 
for the Canada pension plan investment process, are prominent 
Liberals.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite will say there is no patronage.  But it is 
interesting to note that only .2% of Canadians contribute to the 
federal Liberal Party, and yet 50% of the people on the Canada 
pension plan investment board are prominent Liberals.  So when 
they say there will be no patronage in the appointments to the 
board of this arm's length agency, I am very skeptical and for 
good reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Questions we have to ask are:  Why can the benefits being 
promoted by the government in Bill C-43 not be achieved within 
the framework of the department of Revenue Canada?  It was 
mentioned earlier that it is the largest government department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government indicates that human resources issues are part of 
the stumbling blocks, including the difficulty in attracting and 
keeping high quality people, as well as pay issues within the 
public service.  I would say that this would suggest a systemic 
problem within all of the public service that requires a holistic 
solution and not the stop-gap, knee-jerk, crisis management kind 
of approach that this government is taking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general speaks to the general government-wide 
dissatisfaction with human resources management in his report on 
matters of special interest.  The auditor general says that 
dissatisfaction with existing human resources management is also 
reflected in the interest among government officials in 
alternative service delivery mechanisms.  One of the driving 
factors has been that present staffing, classification and 
compensation systems are too unwieldy and inflexible.  The 
government needs to ensure that the rush to get outside the 
system does not divert attention from fixing the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the human resources issues need to be addressed 
throughout the public service.  This is a prime example of an 
opportunity for the government to address them, starting with the 
largest government department, Revenue Canada, which represents 
one-quarter of the public service, 40,000 to 46,000 employees, 
depending on the time of year.  We should start actively 
developing a meaningful, holistic, long term approach to the 
entire public service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public service has unprecedented low levels of morale.  We 
are dealing with a public service that is absolutely devastated 
by the fact that the government has yet to agree to the human 
rights tribunal ruling on pay equity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members speak in code, but sometimes when they are 
talking about the public service they refer to the unions as 
being part of the problem, although they may not say that 
directly.  However, union issues are dealt with in the private 
sector.  There are many proponents of the free market system 
which recognize that unions play a very important role in that 
free market system.  Without unions representing workers there 
would probably be a need for a large government department to 
look after those issues.  Ultimately, that would be far less 
effective and unwieldy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If companies like Chrysler Canada and General Motors can work 
with unions and achieve efficiency, productivity and advances, 
why cannot the Government of Canada?  Why can the Government of 
Canada not lead the way in terms of human resources development, 
as opposed to leading the way in ignoring issues within its own 
human resources?  Why is it seeking alternative service delivery 
instead of fixing the problems in its own departments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we created incentives within all of our public agencies and 
departments, incentives that recognize and reward excellence as 
opposed to encouraging mediocrity and punishing excellence, and 
if we introduced market incentives within the existing agencies, 
we could achieve economies without necessarily creating new 
agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the tragedies in recent years with the government's 
policies toward the public service and with politicians making 
gratuitous attacks on it is that we have a public service that is 
extraordinarily demoralized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are people who study public administration and learn many 
of the same types of skills required for a business 
administration degree, but they study public administration 
because they want to be a public servant.  They have a public 
ethic.  They want to work for the betterment of society and for 
the people.  We have to recognize that and ensure that we have a 
system which encourages excellence, both in terms of attracting 
the best and the brightest, and also keeping them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from the Reform Party referred to the potential of 
this agency becoming an IRS type of agency and I concur with that 
risk.

relative to the agency and the risks to workers and their job

These are significant issues.  I am not convinced that the 
government has made a good case for why we should support this 
agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government cannot address these human resources issues,

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
express my support for all the amendments that reduce the scope 
of Bill C-43, because the Bloc Quebecois is opposed to the 
establishment of the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the throne speech delivered in February 1996, the federal 
government announced the establishment of a national revenue 
collection agency. Just when we thought the government had 
completely abandoned the idea, the Minister of Revenue tabled 
Bill C-43, an act to establish the Canada Customs and Revenue 
Agency, just before the House adjourned for the summer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the minister came up with is not a mere collection agency, 
but a terrible bureaucratic monster, which threatens the 
confidentiality of personal information, the rights of revenue 
department employees, and the provincial powers relating to 
revenue collection. 
Even the business community is opposed to the establishment of 
this agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister admitted he wanted the House to pass Bill C-43 
before the Christmas recess. We wonder why he persists in going 
that route, considering that no one wants this national customs 
and revenue agency. The minister proposes to change the current 
structure of the Department of National Revenue by transforming 
Revenue Canada into an agency that is quasi-independent of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would have the job of collecting taxes, not only federal 
taxes, but taxes of all sorts, including sales and property 
taxes, provided of course that tax collection agreements are 
signed with the provinces and municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me list the reasons why we should oppose this bill. 
First, the customs and revenue agency is a threat to the privacy 
of Quebeckers and Canadians.  In the era of electronic 
communications, the risks of trafficking in personal information 
are inversely proportional to the concentration of information 
within private organizations.  If ever it is created, the agency 
in question will have access to an incredible quantity of 
personal and financial information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, this agency would be less accountable through the 
minister and less subject to scrutiny by parliament than Revenue 
Canada is at present.  As a result, the dissemination of this 
personal information about taxpayers would be completely beyond 
public control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the customs and revenue agency could also jeopardize the 
working conditions of Revenue Canada employees and even threaten 
their jobs. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1635"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT32"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT32"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1635
<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, 40,000 Revenue Canada employees would no longer be 
covered by the Public Service Employment Act.  In two years' 
time, the agency could thus lower employees' salaries, lay them 
off, or decide on their working conditions without having to 
consult them.  By passing this bill, the government is taking a 
heavy-handed approach to modernizing the public service, instead 
of trying to reach agreement with unions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the customs and revenue agency does not impress owners of 
small businesses.  The business community was supposed to be the 
main beneficiary.  However, reaction to the agency's 
announcement was restrained and ambivalent, to say the least. 
Such bodies as the Canadian Federation of Independent Business 
have expressed misgivings about the concentration of power 
within the agency.  According to a Public Policy Forum study 
commissioned by Revenue Canada, no fewer than 40% of businesses 
indicate no interest whatsoever in the agency.  More than 
two-thirds also believe that its creation would not mean any 
savings over the present structure, or that it would cost even 
more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, and this is a vital point, the Customs and Revenue 
Agency runs counter to the federal principle of provincial 
sovereignty in areas that fall under their jurisdiction.  Such 
an agency would, therefore, violate the division of powers 
between the federal and provincial governments  If the provinces 
have independent revenues, they must be the ones to collect 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even Pierre Elliott Trudeau, who cannot be accused of excessive 
support for independence, rose up more than 30 years ago to 
denounce the practice of the federal government's collecting 
more taxes than it needs in order to implement policies coming 
under its jurisdiction.  Trudeau saw such an act as illegal, 
even.  In 1957, he wrote that the federal government cannot 
legally have funds in its coffers which it claims, after the 
fact, are for provincial purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would happen if the federal government assigned to a 
central collection agency encompassing the whole of Canada and 
coming under federal authority the power to collect taxes of 
various kinds, instead of the provinces and the municipalities? 
In our opinion, it would then become impossible to halt the 
centralization of the Canadian federation. 
When the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs says that Canada 
is the most decentralized federation in the world, I think he is 
the only one to believe it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be blunt: if the federal government collects its own 
taxes to finance its responsibilities under section 91 of the 
Constitution Act, that is plausible. However, the fact that it 
wants to give responsibility for collecting provincial and 
municipal taxes to appointed officials, who are not directly 
accountable for their actions, is inconceivable and 
unimaginable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Minister of Finance announces his surplus of billions of 
dollars, he should respect the consensus reached by the 
provinces and give them back the money he cut in recent years. 
That would enable them to look after health, education and 
social services, which are also their responsibility under the 
constitutional agreement.  For that, however, we should not 
really count on our colleagues opposite.  The mission of the 
Liberal members is to defend the federal government and not the 
interests of Canadians and Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The example of the Canada customs and revenue agency should 
suffice to convince those who have not yet understood that for 
the past 50 years Canada has been headed inexorably toward 
centralization.  The federal government, and this Liberal 
government in particular, is trying to destroy all thoughts of 
autonomy—be they those of Quebec, provinces or regions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed customs and revenue agency will concentrate in the 
hands of a few super-bureaucrats the power to dig into the 
pockets of Canadian and Quebec taxpayers, at the expense of 
Revenue Canada employees, small businesses and provincial and 
municipal governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think that the federal government already collects too large 
a share of tax revenues and that it uses its spending power in 
an inconsiderate manner. We will not, on top of that, give the 
minister carte blanche to collect all taxes across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the Bloc Quebecois is opposed to Bill C-43, which 
proposes the establishment of such an agency, and this is why we 
support all the amendments that seek to reduce the scope of the 
bill.

<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, at the outset we oppose Bill C-43.  It is a pleasure to 
speak on the bill and on Group No. 1 motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are good things in the bill.  No doubt, as my colleagues 
have mentioned, there are good things about reducing duplication, 
about improving the efficiency within the tax system, with having 
one agency to collect taxes.  In my province of British Columbia 
we have a mess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a mess in the tax system, particularly on the provincial 
level, where it is so complex that it is costing businesses to 
pay and implement the provincial tax structures. They would 
prefer to have a flat system where everything was taxed, believe 
it or not in some cases, than have the system they have now that 
is costing them an extraordinary amount of money just to 
implement it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support those elements in Bill C-43 that will streamline the 
system.  However, if we are to a Canada customs and review agency 
that will be a super agency, the Canadian public must have the 
assurance the agency will be transparent and accountable to 
parliament and therefore to the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We insist therefore that a couple of significant provisions be 
made in the bill, provisions we feel are essential if the bill 
goes through.  One is to ensure we have a taxpayer bill of 
rights.  This taxpayer bill of rights is a check.  It is a 
balance.  It is an assurance to Canadians that they will be 
protected from an agency.  Canadian do not mind paying fair taxes 
but they do not want to be ripped off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the elements in the taxpayer bill of rights would 
include tax laws in plain language that are understandable to 
Canadians as opposed to the system now where even a person with a 
Ph.D. finds it very difficult to understand.  Taxpayers should be 
treated properly, fairly and with honesty and have an avenue to 
complain where the complaints are heard and not merely swept 
under the carpet.  They should be informed of overpayment in a 
timely fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the complaints I am sure we all get as members of 
parliament is that even though Canadians are asked to pay their 
taxes on time, and if not they are made to feel like a criminal, 
if somehow they overpay it can take a month of Sundays before 
that money is paid back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Penalties ought to be applied fairly to all individuals. The 
right to record any and all meetings with Revenue Canada should 
be there on the part of the taxpayer.  The taxpayer should have 
the right to appeal any Revenue Canada rulings and that CCRA 
should waive penalties and interest wherever possible where 
taxpayers have acted in good faith in their payment of taxes but 
for circumstances perhaps not in their control or due to an 
unfortunate oversight they happened to pay less than they should 
have.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are overtaxed.  Most Canadians do their best to pay. 
Sometimes they run afoul of the payment schedule.  We beg and we 
ask that taxpayers are not made to feel like criminals, that 
amendments can be made on compassionate grounds to make sure they 
will pay their taxes in a way that is fair to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want a fair tax system, not a tax system sitting there like a 
cudgel over the heads of taxpayers and is used to bash them over 
the head like a group of bovines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not what Canadians want.  They want a fair tax system. 
They do not mind paying their tax, but they do not want to be 
treated as slaves to a large system that can be created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for those reasons that we want to ensure a taxpayer bill 
of rights is put forward.  The other thing we want is an office 
for taxpayer protection.  This office of taxpayer protection is 
another element of adding transparency, another check and a 
balance and a protection for the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want this taxpayer protection office to report to parliament 
each year on the state of the CCRA.  A chief advocate can be used 
to present this to parliament and that chief advocate can present 
25 of the most serious problems in the system to the House so 
they can be acted on in a timely fashion rather than what usually 
happens where it is ignored or tossed under the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, this office can be used to assist taxpayers in resolving 
disputes with the CCRA and can act as an advocate for last resort 
for the taxpayer.  This would be a very constructive role 
by the government.  We hope the government listens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government instituted those two solutions then it 
government would have the support of the Reform Party in passing 
this bill.  We will not support this bill unless those checks and 
balances are there and unless the Canadian public is protected 
from the CCRA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk on the larger issue of tax cuts.  We have been 
accused of somehow favouring the rich.  We have been accused of 
instituting a plan that will destroy social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that were the case we would not support tax cuts.  The cold 
hard facts that have been seen across the country and around the 
world are that tax cuts improve the health and welfare of people 
and can generate more money for government to save social 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one of the reasons the Reform Party came here.  We saw 
the degradation of our social programs.  We saw the destruction 
of our health care, our education system and the social safety 
nets that are there, thankfully, to help those who through no 
fault of their own are unable to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been sadly 20 years of overspending by governments that 
has caused the mountain of debt and that has caused such a huge 
amount of interest payments that have eroded into the spending 
capabilities of government to support the social programs we have 
all come to be fortunate enough to have in our blessed country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the facts.  What do taxes do?  Let us look at the 
tax burden briefly for a second.  If we look at individuals, if 
we look at ourselves versus the United States, we can see that 
personal taxes have increased over the last three decades 136% in 
Canada personally compared to 31% in the United States of 
America. Those are the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the OECD Canada suffers the highest personal income tax 
burden of any major economy as a revenue proportion of GDP. Our 
ratio is nearly 18%.  In the U.S. it is 11% and 10% in Britain. 
Britain lowered its tax rates.  Ireland lowered its tax rates. It 
decreased the complexity of its tax structure, decreased the 
complexity of the rules and regulations that choked the private 
sector. As a result, its economy is booming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lessons can be learned. Let us take a look at the tax increases 
by the government.  The government likes to say it has decreased 
taxes.  Au contraire. They have actually increased although they 
have been nibbled away at the tax burden a little bit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax brackets and credits have not been indexed to inflation, 
therefore we have had bracket creep that has increased taxes 18%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CPP tax increase of 73% has actually increased the total tax 
burden on Canadians by over $1.3 billion in excess of what the 
government has actually decreased. 
I challenge any member from across the way to refute that 
argument.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of the benefits of tax cuts, if we look at the 10 
states in the United States with the lowest taxes they have had a 
20% higher amount of money and a growth rate in jobs far in 
excess of those 10 states with the highest tax rates.  The lowest 
tax rate states have had a much higher rate of income for their 
average citizens.  If we compare Ohio, Michigan and Ontario the 
job creation to the marginal tax rates in the United States is 
much lower than Ontario and as a result the job creation rates 
were much higher than what we found in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government wants to do something constructive and 
productive for Canadians it can restore full indexation to the 
inflation of federal tax credits and income brackets, eliminate 
the 3% and 5% federal surtaxes and reduce each of the three 
federal income tax rates by 2%.  The government should listen to 
that.  If it listens to that Canadians will be wealthier, 
healthier and have social programs and will be better off.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the New 
Democratic Party opposes this new tax agency.  We oppose it 
because it is not needed.  The auditor general says we do not 
need it. It is not wanted.  Businesses do not want it.  The 
provinces do not want it and territories do not want it.  It 
should be rejected right now because economically, politically 
and socially it offers no benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want a tax agency or a tax system that is more responsive, 
not less responsive.  As an MP many people come to my office for 
help on issues of taxation.  We need it to be responsive because 
it is important to be able to go to the minister and say this is 
what is happening, this is how these policies are being applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can give some examples.  In Yukon the northern travel 
deduction has been audited massively.  We are talking of 
thousands of audits of people of the north, and that is quite 
significant for a small population.  We have a local bank manager 
who was audited three years in a row because he claimed the 
northern travel deduction.  In Dawson City all the employees 
except for two at one place were audited. They used e-mail to 
file their tax forms and we can bet they will never do that 
again.  That also brings in the whole issue of privacy and using 
technology to file tax returns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The northern travel deduction barely gives enough to walk 
out of Yukon let alone travel out in any kind of comfortable 
style, but yet northerners have been audited relentlessly on 
this.  We want a responsive minister when it comes to taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an example, a 74 year old had to pay back about $6,000 or 
$7,000 because Revenue Canada had made a mistake six years 
earlier. It sent him a bill seven years later saying he owed 
approximately $8,000.  He made arrangements to pay back $200 a 
year, but it turned out that was not good enough and it would 
garnishee half his pension to get the money back.  It made me 
wonder if it was determined to get all the money out of this man 
before he passed on.  Revenue Canada's other solution was for him 
to get a bank loan to pay the debt.  It would continue to put 
intense focus on poor people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, the complaints that come to my office happen to 
be from first nations people.  There was an older couple who had 
brought up their grandchildren and claimed the family allowance 
and the child tax benefit through those years.  They were told 
they had to pay this money back because they could not prove they 
had brought up their children.  As MPs we are able to help in 
situations like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this tax agency comes into effect it will remove that kind of 
accountability.  It will put it at arm's length. That takes it 
further away from the House and further away from the people who 
need help to get through problems like that.  The agency will 
have a business mandate and we can only imagine an agency 
contracting out collections.

are harassed and who feel they make a huge contribution to the 
well-being of our country through their paycheques and through 
their volunteer work in bringing up their families.  An agency 
should not be open to making a profit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reason we should not have this agency is it would be 
reviewed only after five years.  Any new agency should be closely 
monitored, especially in its set-up.  I would say at least every 
six months rather than waiting five years to review such a 
massive change in how we look after our tax collection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It brings into question how fairly we will treat the employees 
who are transferred over to the tax agency.  The union does not 
support that kind of transfer of authority.  It is a stressful 
trying job for the workers who have to collect the taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this chance to compliment the people who look after the 
northern region.  First nations people will now be paying taxes. 
They have been very proactive.  They have come to the north. They 
have had public meetings, information sessions and have gone 
through the whole process with the folks who will have to file 
income tax for the first time in their lives.  That is the kind 
of dedication and service we want from public servants.  They 
were there making sure it happened for those people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This kind of bill is abdicating political responsibility.  I 
know the IMF has suggested that some countries set up an agency 
to collect taxes, but those are for the poorest, most unstable 
countries in the world.  Canada does not fit that description. 
We should not be abdicating our responsibility as a government to 
be accountable to the people we collect money from.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA CUSTOMS AND REVENUE AGENCY ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK209">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill C-43, an act to establish 
the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency and to amend and repeal 
other acts as a consequence, as reported (with amendment) 
from the committee; and of the motions Group No. 1. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise in the House today to participate in the report stage 
debate on Bill C-43 establishing the Canada Customs and Revenue 
Agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First off, let me tell you that I am against the establishment 
of this new federal agency, primarily because of the attitude 
and actions of this government; this is an arrogant, 
centralizing government, which ignores provincial jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois cannot support a bill that only seeks 
to centralize the collection of taxes in Canada, downsize the 
Department of National Revenue and, more importantly, create an 
agency that will be in direct conflict with Quebec's ministry of 
revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this bill, the Liberal government is showing that it is 
having more and more difficulty fulfilling its administrative 
responsibilities. It is once again about to abdicate its 
responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new agency could make it possible for the minister of 
revenue to avoid doing his duty, which is to protect the 
taxpayer against the abuse of power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the Liberal mania for creating independent 
agencies is to then use any pretext for blaming them for 
everything that goes wrong, while refusing to get involved by 
saying that the independent nature of the agency must be 
respected and the government cannot get involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can already hear the words of the revenue minister when he has 
to answer a question about this new agency “As members know, 
this agency is an independent entity.  I will carry out the 
necessary checks and, as soon as we have the information, we 
will make it known here in the House”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, while the investigation is going on, they will 
be looking for a solution that will get them out of the 
embarrassing situation.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us now have a look at what lies behind Bill C-43. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It mandates the federal government to set up the right 
conditions for one more anti-labour move.  The result of this 
bill would be that 20% of Revenue Canada employees would be 
taken out from under the protection of the Public Service 
Employment Act, and this would allow the new agency full rein to 
raise or lower salaries, to hire or lay off employees.  This 
government is prepared to do anything to satisfy its excessive 
need of centralization and its publicity seeking efforts to get 
the maple leaf onto everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the Liberals, simplification and duplication are synonymous, 
and harmonization to them means interference in areas of 
provincial jurisdiction.  Quebec is opposed to the creation of 
this agency.  Ontario is also on its guard against this new 
threat of centralization, and is even giving thought to setting 
up its own agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the minister of revenue tell us why he is in such a rush to 
create this new agency, when Quebec does not want it any more 
than the majority of other provinces?  Where does his support 
for this bill come from? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in favour of the principle of a single collector, and in 
Quebec this should be the Quebec Minister of Revenue, who would 
collect all federal and provincial taxes.  Judging by the 
outcome of the joint collection of the Quebec sales tax and the 
GST in Quebec at the moment, this is an effective formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada customs and revenue agency is another federal 
creation, the inspiration of senior federal revenue officials in 
Ottawa, who want to create a sort of monster, a sort of octopus 
reaching out its tentacles beyond the provinces to the municipal 
and local levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They intend to administer everything, from provincial sales 
taxes to gas and alcohol taxes.  Are we going to take the risk 
and let this arrogant, voracious and centralizing Liberal 
government enact this bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is this agency accountable to?  Will the members of this 
House be able to obtain explanations on its management, its 
results and its errors.  Currently, the department of revenue is 
accountable to the House of Commons. 
The government cannot avoid embarrassing questions about family 
trusts and the small privileges the Minister of Finance enjoys 
with his little boats, for example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are afraid that this new agency will face less parliamentary 
scrutiny than is currently the case for the Department of 
National Revenue.  Members can imagine an embarrassing question 
on the agency's activities; the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime 
Minister and the minister of revenue have already written their 
answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From what we see in the debate on Bill C-54, some answers are 
needed here about the incredible quantity of personal and 
private information that will end up in the hands of the federal 
government. 
In the current debate on Bill C-54, the electronic commerce bill, 
which once again collides with Quebec legislation on access to 
information, we can see already how the federal government would 
use this information to achieve its goal of centralization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new bill is doomed to failure.  The Canada customs and 
revenue agency, an agency that wants to collect everything and 
that should convince the provinces to join it, lacked both 
agreements and signatures when Bill C-43 was introduced.  Even in 
committee, when we asked the minister of revenue “Where is your 
support, Mr. Minister”, he had none. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who will foot the bill for this agency?  Its users, but at what 
price?  Initially, the federal agency will try to show that it 
is generating savings, but it will soon raise its user fees to 
satisfy the voracious Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And, speaking of how voracious this government is when it comes 
to finances, yesterday, the Minister of Finance and his 
sidekick, the Minister of Human Resources Development, had the 
nerve to announce a paltry 15 cent cut in premiums in response 
to the Bloc Quebecois' many calls that something be done about 
the present EI system.

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no change in the system per se, which continues to be a 
wonderful method of collecting funds for the election fund of 
the Liberal Party of Canada, or plumping up the future campaign 
fund of the Minister of Finance, who has serious designs on the 
leadership of his own party.  And where do the surpluses go? 
Into the Minister of Finance's pocket.  What is this government 
doing to correct regional rates based on the number of hours 
worked?  Nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the most disadvantaged members of our society, 
this government turns a deaf ear.  It is the embodiment of 
arrogance and heartlessness, taking its cue from the behaviour 
of the Liberal Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the Y2K bug is concerned, will all the changes that 
Revenue Canada employees will have to face make it any easier 
for them to prepare for this transition in informatics, on which 
much energy already had to be expended? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is Revenue Canada at in preparing for the year 2000? 
Statements made by the Auditor General of Canada show he is 
expecting the worst because the government is not taking this 
potential bug very seriously. One can only imagine the 
administrative and data processing chaos in which the transition 
from Revenue Canada to a future customs and revenue agency would 
take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would like to summarize the reasons why I am 
reiterating my opposition to Bill C-43: the centralizing 
obsession of the Liberal government; the danger this agency 
represents for the revenue department in Quebec; the inordinate 
amount of power this agency would have; the anti-union attitude 
of the government in this bill as it affects Revenue employees; 
the intrusion on the privacy of our fellow citizens; the 
performance of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency in its 
current handling of the scrapie crisis with Quebec sheep, where 
there is such an administrative muddle that the minister and the 
agency cannot even figure out where they are at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am saying no to the Liberals, I am saying no to the Minister 
of National Revenue and, once again, on behalf of the Bloc 
Quebecois, I am calling for the immediate withdrawal of this 
bill.

<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I 
look through Bill C-43, there are a few things that concern me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noticed in clauses 22, 25 and 26, the deal with the 
appointment of the chair and the commissioner of the agency, that 
they are going to be appointed at the pleasure of the government. 
We are dealing here with tax collection, something that is very 
serious and something that perhaps could be construed to be akin 
to a quasi-judicial agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the powers that are going to be conferred on the 
commissioner and because of his or her role as an independent 
civil servant to collect taxes on behalf of the government, his 
or her independence must be assured.  Yet we find that he or she 
is not being appointed on good behaviour but is being appointed 
at the pleasure of the government.  Therefore, if he or she does 
not squeeze enough taxes out of Canadians, the government can say 
“You are out of here.  We are going to get somebody else to do 
the job because we feel that you are not collecting enough”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The appointment is at pleasure. I ask the government to come 
forward and tell us why it does not make this appointment on good 
behaviour.  It seems to me that would be much more important.  If 
it were on the basis of good behaviour, then it would at least 
provide some credibility that this agency was not going to be 
interfered with by the government, but perhaps it will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning to clause 38, it reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Commissioner must keep the Minister informed of any matter 
that could affect public policy or that could materially affect 
public finances, and any other matter that the Minister considers 
necessary. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw members' attention to “affect public finances”.  I 
refer back to an issue that was raised by the auditor general two 
or three years ago. It was called the family trust fiasco where 
one ruling by the Department of National Revenue under a very 
questionable situation cost the taxpayer $2 billion. To me, that 
would certainly fall under materially affecting the public 
finances. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the public accounts committee had hearings on that fiasco, 
the deputy minister assured us under oath that there was 
absolutely no political involvement in the granting of that tax 
break on that particular family trust.  It was one particular 
issue, one particular taxpayer who got a $2 billion tax break 
under the most questionable of circumstances one day before 
Christmas.  It was the best Christmas present he ever had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole concept is that there be no political involvement in 
granting tax breaks to Canadians and that the act be applied 
fairly, appropriately and properly to every Canadian.  Now we 
find the commissioner is obligated to get the political masters 
involved.  He must keep the minister informed on matters that 
could materially affect the public finances.  Under this clause 
the politicians in this House who give direction to the 
commissioner now have the authority to direct to the commissioner 
whether or not they will grant these types of tax breaks. 
Political shenanigans are starting to go on in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at clause 33.  This is where it gets kind of 
convoluted and we have to wonder why the government is creating 
this agency.  While the agency is supposed to be at arm's length, 
everything else is being treated as if the agency were a civil 
service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A board of 15 people is being created.  It seems to be patronage 
heaven because the members will have nothing whatsoever to do 
regarding taxation and collection.  The only thing they have to 
do is run the agency. Clause 33 states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Board may advise the Minister on matters that relate to the 
general administration and enforcement of the program 
legislation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next clause specifically states that the board cannot tell 
the commissioner how to handle the enforcement of program 
legislation.  The commissioner will be acting on his own, the 
board is prohibited from telling him how to do his job of 
enforcement of taxes, yet the board is obligated to talk to the 
minister on behalf of the commissioner.  It seems this is a kind 
of make work project for the board to get it involved somehow 
without giving it any teeth to act at arm's length from the 
government.  We see in clause 38 that the government wants to 
keep that to itself. That is why I have a problem with the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to concur with the government on clause 92(5) regarding 
severance pay.  Because the employees are being moved en masse 
from the Department of National Revenue to the agency and as far 
as they are concerned there will be absolutely no interruption in 
employment, they will not be granted severance pay under their 
collective agreement.  Granting severance pay would amount to 
several hundred million dollars.  I am glad to see it is being 
deferred until the employees retire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raised this issue with Nav Canada, which was a privatization a 
little more at arm's length than this agency.  There were people 
who worked for the Department of Transport one day and who on the 
following day went to the same job with the same desk, the same 
telephone, the same boss, the same everything except that the 
letterhead had changed to Nav Canada. They picked up $200 million 
in severance pay.  I was absolutely shocked that those employees 
were given $200 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At committee I said to Mr. Daryl Bean, the president of the 
union, that it was preposterous for the taxpayer to be expected 
to shell out $200 million for a letterhead change.  He answered 
that that was the agreement.  And not only that, if people's 
employment were not severed until their retirement day, when they 
retired they would get their severance pay.

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the private sector there is nobody who can afford to pay 
severance pay to every employee who sticks around until 
retirement age.  Yet we as the Government of Canada have deemed 
it in their sense, not common sense, to grant that benefit to 
employees.  The taxpayers are on the hook for hundreds of 
millions of dollars, $200 million for NavCan alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately, and I will give the government credit on this 
issue, it has deferred the payment of severance pay until these 
people retire rather than paying a bonus to them the day the 
letterhead changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency is smoke and mirrors.  The government wants to move 
it off arm's length because it did not like the fiasco of the GST 
and did not want to repeat it and be able to blame somebody else. 
It is not our fault, it's their fault that they are squeezing 
taxes out of everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think there are some serious flaws in this bill, serious flaws 
in the whole philosophy of having an agency at arm's length 
collecting taxes on behalf of the government.  The government has 
to be responsible to the taxpayers.  There is a very close link 
between the taxes paid by the people who are governed and the 
taxes collected by those who want to govern.  That link is 
broken, as we see definitely on the reserves of the country where 
the people who lead, manage and govern their native reserves have 
no link with those they derive their revenue from.  The people on 
reserves are untaxed.  There is no linkage between those people 
who want to govern the reserve, collecting taxes from those they 
are to govern and if we break that link here with ourselves, it 
is very serious indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be quite happy to see the government withdraw this piece 
of legislation and move on to something a lot more important.

this government realize that the duplication of jurisdictions 
between the federal and provincial governments costs a great 
deal to the various levels of government. 
With Bill C-43, which will create the Canada customs and revenue 
agency, the federal government is once again interfering, 
without consulting the provinces, in an area it has no business 
getting involved in. Clearly, this is further proof of the Prime 
Minister's insatiable desire to centralize everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But before going further, I would like members to take time to

</I></B></P><P align=left>As per usual, since this government has made a habit of avoiding 
responsibility, of not facing the music and of avoiding any 
exchange of ideas, on June 4, one week before the House 
adjourned for the long summer recess, the revenue minister 
sneaked in Bill C-43, an act to establish the Canada Customs and 
Revenue Agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The establishment of this tax collection monster is a project 
that goes back to the throne speech of February 1996, in which 
the government announced its intention to set up a national 
revenue recovery agency. But already at that time, the Bloc 
Quebecois had opposed the establishment of such an agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More specifically, the agency will convert the Department of 
National Revenue into a semi-independent government body, with 
responsibility for negotiating with provinces and municipalities 
wishing to have it collect all taxes in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Minister of National Revenue, the ministerial 
responsibilities and parliamentary controls will remain 
essentially the same. This means that the Public Service Staff 
Relations act, the Access to Information Act, the Privacy Act 
and the Official Languages Act will continue to apply.  In 
addition, the minister says he will retain full responsibility 
for the administration of tax, customs and trade legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, very little will change. 
So why create this agency?  Why go to all this trouble, if 
nothing will be any different? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the President of the Treasury Board, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Creation of the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency is an 
essential component of the government's commitment to modernize 
the federal public service. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not get it.  Modernize by doing nothing.  This stunt by the 
federal government is strangely evocative of the federal system 
in which we live.  A huge bureaucracy, an ideology rooted in the 
past, with no vision: such is the federal system in which we 
live.  The Canada customs and revenue agency is more of the 
same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the federal government, modernizing a bureaucracy boils down 
to privatizing public services.  It means jeopardizing the jobs 
of 40,000 employees, or 20% of the entire federal public 
service, to whom framework legislation such as the Public 
Service Employment Act will no longer apply.  Two years from 
now, this anti-union attitude will give the agency free rein to 
raise or lower employees' salaries, to hire or fire 
unilaterally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Henceforth, these employees will be at the mercy of the agency's 
board of management.  While we are on the topic, the board's 15 
directors will be appointed for three years on the 
recommendation of the provinces, and will occupy their positions 
on a part time basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chair, the commissioner and the deputy commissioner will be 
appointed by the Governor in Council for a renewable term of 
five years. 
Great jobs, these, for the party's political buddies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is how the government treats its employees, to say nothing 
of its recent treatment of the thousands of women in the Public 
Service with its reluctance to give them pay equity.  If I were 
in the shoes of the 40,000 Revenue employees, I would be very 
much afraid.  With this government, a person never knows what 
low blow can suddenly be delivered.  Each day brings its 
surprises and its trip-ups, courtesy of an immoral and heartless 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could also speak of the employment insurance fund, or of the 
unemployed who have paid into it and cannot even get their own 
money back from a government that is literally ripping them off. 
I could go on and on about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was absolutely astonished, when I read this bill, by the lack 
of accountability there will be for the agency executive.  This 
agency is a classic example of empire-building by senior 
mandarins ensconced in their ivory towers in Ottawa.   This is a 
classic example of bureaucratic empire-building.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role and responsibilities of the commissioner of the CCRA 
would make him a kind of czar of taxation, a super bureaucrat 
invested with massive powers but more or less without any need 
to report to anyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By removing the CCRA from the daily monitoring of his office, 
the minister is putting himself at risk of having his 
bureaucrats put one over on him.  The CCRA would, moreover, more 
or less have carte blanche over such matters as contracting out 
property management, equipment management, and information and 
technology management.  With only limited outside monitoring, 
there would be a greater risk of patronage and abuse of 
authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is inconceivable and unacceptable. 
Clauses 47 to 49 are explicit about the agency's lack of 
accountability.  The agency submits an annual business plan to 
the minister for recommendation to the Treasury Board for 
approval.  The plan would set out the objectives of the agency 
and its strategies to achieve them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister must cause a summary of the plan to be tabled in 
both Houses within 15 days of his approval.  Parliament has no 
opportunity to question the agency's decisions once they have 
government approval.  Where is accountability?  Where is the 
transparency in this process? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the minister of revenue, private enterprise and the 
business community will be the first to benefit from the agency, 
but that is far from confirmed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organizations like the Canadian Federation of Independent 
Business reacted rather coolly to the massive and centralized 
power in the tentacles of the super agency.  No less than 40% of 
the businesses that took part in a Public Policy Forum study 
commissioned by Revenue Canada indicated a lack of interest in 
the agency.  More than two thirds of them felt that, after the 
new agency is established, the cost of dealing with the 
department as currently structured would increase or remain the 
same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And what is the government opposite doing about the provinces' 
ability to determine their own budgetary policy?  Quebec will 
not give in to this centralizing government.  The Bloc Quebecois 
and its members are reasonable and responsible.  They will 
certainly not vote in favour of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal Liberals' centralizing view of the affairs of state 
is totally unacceptable. 
We are in favour of a single tax collection body, but it should 
be Quebec's Department of Revenue, which is already collecting 
the GST.  This department is fully accountable to Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, and for many others that I unfortunately 
cannot go into, because it would mean sleeping here tonight, the 
Bloc Quebecois will be voting against this bill.  What we are 
calling for is the withdrawal, pure and simple, of the bill and 
the repeal of all its clauses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is such a pity to see that, once again, closure is being 
invoked on a bill as important and as controversial as Bill C-43. 
Several of my Bloc Quebecois colleagues, as well as colleagues 
from other parties, wish to speak to the bill.  It is very sad 
to see that this government, which is introducing bills in the 
House, does not even have the decency to defend them.

<A NAME="LINK218">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie—Lincoln, Lib.)</B> moved: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this 
House, the Government should designate July 2 and 3, 1998, coming 
between Canada Day and Independence Day (U.S.), as “Canada-United 
States Days of Peace and Friendship” in recognition of the close 
and peaceful relations that exist between the two countries, the 
warm personal links that prevail between neighbouring communities 
along the length of the common border and the commitments to 
freedom, democracy and human rights shared by the two nations. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, at this point I would like to ask for 
unanimous consent to make one amendment to the motion and that is 
to delete the year 1998.  With the way our Private Members' 
Business works the motion is a bit redundant. It makes a lot more 
sense that the two dates, July 2 and July 3, would continue in 
perpetuity in accordance with the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent for the member to move the amendment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today 
on Motion No. 263 to say the fact that the Canada-U.S. 
relationship is dynamic and thriving does not do justice to its 
complexity, scope and depth.  Our trade with the United States is 
booming but our partnership is not based only on economics and 
geography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In dealing with important issues posed by a changing world, 
Canada and the United States have extensive shared interests that 
often complement each other's roles.  The relationship is 
thriving because it is carefully nurtured.  A further step in 
this nurturing is the motion we are speaking to this evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1987 a private American citizen named David Boyer felt 
strongly that there should be an official recognition of the 
friendship between Canada and the United States.  Mr. Boyer 
diligently contacted both Canadian and American elected officials 
urging them to take the necessary steps toward such a 
declaration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United States a joint resolution of the Senate and the 
House of Representatives was passed proclaiming that July 2 and 3 
would thereafter be known as days of peace and friendship between 
Canada and the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian government introduced a similar motion on March 25, 
1987, resolving that July 2 and 3, 1987, be designated as days of 
peace and friendship.  The 1987 motion was introduced by then 
Deputy Prime Minister Don Mazankowski and seconded by the now 
Deputy Prime Minister and member for Windsor West.  The 1987 
motion was also seconded by the current member from Qu'Appelle. 
The motion was debated on March 25, 1987, agreed to by the House 
of Commons, and subsequently agreed to by the Senate on April 2, 
1987. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My predecessor from Erie, Mr. Girve Fretz, spoke in support of 
the motion as the town of Fort Erie was preparing to celebrate 
the 175th anniversary of the War of 1812 with a four day 
friendship festival. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the War of 1812 Americans attacked and burned government 
buildings in York, the then capital of Upper Canada which is now 
known as Toronto. In 1814 Washington, D.C., was torched in 
retaliation.  Similarly Old Fort Erie in my riding was burned by 
U.S. soldiers.  Now Old Fort Erie is one of the venues of the 
celebration of our two nations in the friendship festival. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore celebrating the end of the War of 1812 is significant 
because when both Canada and the United States lowered their 
weapons the peaceful result was the evolution of the longest, 
oldest undefended border in modern history.  That border is not 
something that divides; it is something we build on.  From rivals 
in 1812 Canada and the United States have become fast friends, 
best trading partners and staunch allies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From those modest beginnings of a celebration in 1987 I am 
pleased to inform the House that last July marked the 11th year 
of the Fort Erie Friendship Festival, one of the major summer 
attractions in the Niagara Peninsula where over 100,000 visitors 
enjoy the cultures of our two countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The friendship festival organizers do a superb job of planning 
the event which runs from July 1, Canada Day, to July 4, 
Independence Day. 
It attracts participants from southern Ontario and western New 
York.  It boasts the biggest Canada Day celebrations in the 
peninsula and is a major attraction for the July 4 festivities in 
LaSalle Park, Buffalo.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that recently this annual event was 
opened by the former Canadian ambassador to Iran, Mr. Ken Taylor, 
who, at considerable personal risk to him and his staff during 
the occupation of the U.S. embassy by the forces of the Ayatolla 
Khomeni, hid members of the U.S. staff from threatening mobs and 
subsequently spirited them out of the country to safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to celebrate its 10th anniversary in 1997, the 
friendship festival approached me about reintroducing a motion to 
redesignate the days of peace and friendship.  Unfortunately 
Motion No. 327 died on the order paper when the spring election 
was called in April 1997.  When the 36th Parliament returned I 
immediately resubmitted the motion, and here I stand today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Due to the delay in being drawn for Private Members' Business 
the date of the motion still reads 1998.  I suggest that the 
designation of any year should be eliminated and an amendment 
moved accordingly.  The most obvious reason is that the 1998 
celebrations have come and gone.  Also, by doing so, our 
commitment to this partnership is clear and without time 
limitation.  It will endure and continue in perpetuity parallel 
with the positive and beneficial relationship between our two 
nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that people from the Fort Erie community have 
spearheaded the motion is not surprising.  What better symbol to 
emphasize the peace and friendship that existed between the 
United States and Canada than the Peace Bridge spanning the 
Niagara River and linking Fort Erie with Buffalo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After 70 years since it was first opened by the Prince of Wales, 
the Peace Bridge is now the second busiest land border crossing 
between Canada and the United States.  Next spring the sod will 
be turned marking the start of construction of the Peace Bridge 
twin span, a true testament to the trade and close ties with our 
neighbours to the south. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last month, on November 20, the largest duty free facility in 
North America was opened at the Peace Bridge in Fort Erie, 
another example in bricks and mortar of the enormous number of 
travellers who cross our borders each day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fort Erie is not alone in its efforts to celebrate friendship 
between Americans and Canadians.  For example, just to name a 
few, the communities of Windsor and Detroit, Sault Ste. Marie, 
Ontario and Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan also have yearly events 
that strive to bring us closer and to celebrate all that we share 
together.  I am certain they would appreciate this effort to 
celebrate and mark our special relationship.  This continues 
across the entire country from the maritimes through Quebec to 
the prairie provinces and British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February 1995, U.S. President Bill Clinton stood in the House 
and stated that we needed to strengthen that relationship because 
it was our job to spread the benefits of democracy, freedom, 
prosperity and peace beyond our shores.  We do this as emissaries 
of the free world and as examples for the entire globe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Political meetings between our respective countries regularly 
take place not only between our leaders but at the elected 
representative level as well.  It was with our vital national 
interests and our close relationship in mind that the 39th annual 
meeting of the Canada-United States Interparliamentary Group took 
place this year in Nantucket, resulting in one of our most 
productive meetings.  Organized in three workshops—trade and 
economics, political and global, and transborder issues—each 
group discussed in detail from both Canadian and American 
perspectives over 38 separate issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, in the trade and economics workshop topics ranged 
from culture to lumber and from potatoes, sugar, grain and dairy 
to electricity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The transborder workshop considered issues of congestion 
encountered at a number of border points across our two 
countries, stultifying the free exchange of goods and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were candid in depth discussions in the political and 
global workshop where our views differed and where we held common 
views on the international field ranging from trans-Atlantic 
trade to Bosnia, Cuba and China, to the economic fallout in Asia, 
and to the consequences of nuclear tests in the Asian 
subcontinent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the plenary all issues were reviewed by all delegates.  The 
plenary decided unanimously to start a much more active process 
to exchange views of bilateral concern in a more detailed way 
between the annual meetings as all delegates believed a number of 
these issues required more regular, timely and friendly 
exchanges.  The plenary further decided that there would be a 
bilateral meeting on the west coast to exchange views on the 
contentious issues of lumber and fish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that a meeting will be arranged between our 
parliamentarians and members of our respective governments to 
facilitate a common North American front on drug trafficking. 
Another bilateral meeting is to be arranged between 
parliamentarians and officials to consider our common interest in 
a trans-Atlantic trade approach and, it is hoped, a common 
trans-Atlantic action plan.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We share a common history and a common culture.  We are two 
nations blessed with great histories and resources and we have 
great responsibilities.  We were built, after all, by men and 
women who fled the old world for the new.  We are nations of 
pioneers, people who were armed with the confidence they needed 
to strike out on their own and had the talents to shape their 
dreams in a new and different land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Culture and tradition distinguish us from one another in many 
ways, but we share core values, which is more important; a 
devotion to hard work; an ardent belief in democracy; and a 
commitment to giving each and every citizen the tools to achieve 
an understanding of giving back the greater global community a 
share of the advantages we enjoy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These common values have nourished a partnership that has become 
a model for new democracies around the world.  They can look at 
us and see just how much stronger the bonds between nations can 
be when their governments answer the desires of citizens for 
freedom, democracy and enterprise, and when they work together to 
build each other up instead of working overtime to tear each 
other down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the differences have been the true test of our 
relationship.  While we have many similarities, we are different. 
We disagree on the issue of culture.  While Canadians believe 
that culture is part of our national identity, the Americans view 
culture as an important commercial export.  Canadians believe 
that with bilateral trade and constructive engagement democratic 
values can be better implemented in states like Cuba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our unique geography and small population impart a unique 
relationship, one Canadian with another.  Our bilingual society 
reaches populations from coast to coast to coast through public 
radio and television.  Our education, health and justice systems 
differ substantially as do our political systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the experience of these two great nations has taught us 
unity through diversity can thrive, not a new concept for 
Canadians.  By celebrating our friendship and ties we can all 
come to appreciate and understand those differences.  Our 
diplomacy in dealing with these differences, as I have said 
before and will say again, is a model for other countries 
struggling with their relations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our economy is another area.  Our economic ties remain one of 
the strongest aspects of our relationship with the United States. 
I would like to sketch out the extraordinary breadth and depth of 
the U.S.-Canada economic relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Trade between Canada and the United States has more than doubled 
since the signing of the Canada-U.S. free trade agreement barely 
10 years ago.   A mind-boggling total of $1 billion in trade 
crosses our border each and every day.  Ninety-five per cent or 
our trade is trouble free; it is the other five per cent of the 
trade that grabs all the headlines, be it bilateral disputes over 
spuds and suds or, more recently, hogs and logs.  The value of 
this trade to both countries is enormous.  Exports to the United 
States account for one-fourth of our gross domestic product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>U.S. merchandise exports to Canada exceed every other trading 
relationship, including trade with the European Community.  Just 
the two way trade that crosses the Ambassador Bridge between 
Michigan and Ontario equals all U.S. exports to Japan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much of this trade is in the auto sector.  General Motors 
Detroit Cadillac plant, for example, receives seats on a just in 
time basis from a plant in Windsor, Ontario, as well as other 
parts from plants in Canada and Mexico.  Motors produced in 
Tonowanda, New York, just outside Buffalo, are installed the next 
day in motor vehicles bodies in Oshawa, Ontario.  Overall autos 
and auto parts account for about one-third of our bilateral 
trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Energy is an excellent example of an economic sector that was 
deeply affected by domestic regulations and policies which once 
complicated our relationship but is now an area of close 
co-operation and enormous mutual benefit.  I do not have to tell 
the House how well Canada does in exporting oil and natural gas 
to the United States.  Canada is the second largest oil supplier, 
not far behind Venezuela, to the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The future is even brighter.  Private economists say the U.S. 
and Canada have only scratched the surface on the potential of 
jobs and higher incomes that economic integration through trade 
and investment can bring to both Canadians and American. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since virtually all tariffs on trade between the United States 
and Canada have been eliminated as of the beginning of this year, 
much of our current focus in on facilitating lawful trade through 
removing non-tariff barriers, including more efficient customs 
and immigration processing of cargo and people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been a central theme of the U.S.-Canada shared border 
accord announced by the Prime Minister and President Clinton in 
1995. The accord incorporates a series of practical projects that 
mix bilateral co-operation and pragmatism with intelligent 
transportation technology to speed goods and people across the 
border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me add that Canada is deeply concerned about the potential 
of the exit control requirements under section 110 of the 1996 
immigration reform to create massive bottlenecks on our land 
border crossing to the United States.  Although section 110 was 
to come into effect on October 1, the immigration and 
naturalization service of the U.S. indicated that it will not 
change its inspection procedures at this time.  Canada will 
continue to work with congressional counterparts to ensure that 
the implementation of section 110 will be delayed perhaps 
indefinitely and hopefully forever.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude on friendship engagement.  Canada and the United 
States have shown the best there is in partnerships between 
nations.  As a monument commemorating the St. Lawrence Seaway 
Authority at St. Lambert declares, we are “two nations whose 
frontiers are the frontiers of friendship, whose ways are the 
ways for freedom, whose works are the works of peace”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every day we see the enormous benefits this partnership brings 
to us in jobs, in prosperity.  There is also the creative energy 
that our interchanges bring.  The strength and character of that 
co-operation is annually demonstrated by the spirit and goodwill 
which prevails in our border communities, like Fort Erie, Ontario 
and Buffalo, New York. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada and the United States are more than neighbours.  Sharing 
a common past, many interests and objectives, we have become 
friends, allies and economic partners.  Our relationship is a 
model for the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today more than ever, let us reaffirm and renew our great 
tradition.  We must maintain our partnership.  We must make it 
stronger. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to say only a few words about this private 
member's motion and to indicate my support for the motion which 
is to declare July 2 and 3 as Canada-United States days of peace 
and friendship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the mover has said, this matter was presented to the House 
about 11 years ago, in 1987 by the former deputy prime minister, 
I believe it was Don Mazankowski from Alberta.  It was seconded 
by the now deputy prime minister who was then the House leader 
for the official opposition, and myself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to indicate my support for this motion which will promote 
greater peace, understanding and friendship between the two 
greatest trading partners in North America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have forever shared a very large and long boundary with the 
United States. Obviously it is our most important trading 
partner.  I think it is very important to foster a better 
understanding with the Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From time to time we obviously have many trade irritants, 
differences and disputes.  We are currently having one in my 
province with some American farmers in North Dakota when we try 
to ship grain and some farm products to the United States.  There 
is the possibility of another protest developing there today and 
tomorrow from what I understand from the newscasts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that we do have disputes is just another argument why 
we need to set aside a day or two as a time to celebrate and 
recognize the understanding and friendship between our two 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I need not go on any longer than that.  The mover has given us a 
very good outline as to why this is a very good idea, a good 
private member's motion and the reasons we should be supporting 
it.  I certainly concur with what he has said and offer him my 
support and hopefully the support of most people in our party. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage—Lisgar, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would also like to commend the hon. member for 
Erie—Lincoln for bringing forward this motion.  It is a very 
appropriate motion for today, especially as the world gets 
smaller and we do more things together instead of trying to 
create division. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have lived beside the American people for 35 years.  My 
property was only a couple of miles from the border so we lived 
as a community more or less.  We had a curling rink with 
Americans.  We had a skating rink.  The figure skating club was 
in Smoke Lake.  The Americans provided us with a little grocery 
store and a little bar.  If we got too unhappy we could share 
facilities.  It was quite an interesting experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Manitoba has one of two international peace gardens.  If members 
ever have a chance to visit the peace garden located just south 
of Boissevain, in the peace tower is a unique little chapel. The 
piano was put in such a place that when a person plays the 
morning hymn during the service, one hand is in the U.S. and the 
other one is in Canada.  It is a service that really binds the 
two nations.  It is a real experience to observe that and see how 
close we as human beings really are.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a funny incident I want to bring forward today. I went 
on a tour of the Pembina watershed.  The largest part of it is in 
the U.S.  On the bus coming back were American and Canadian 
politicians.  We came to the little town of Mowbray, Manitoba 
which is on the U.S. border.  We talked about entrepreneurs and 
how they looked at different types of businesses in those days. 
One of the elder gentlemen said “You know Jake, if you were out 
here thrashing in Mowbray with your team of horses, you could 
drive down this road, reach into the United States and pick up a 
glass of beer after a long day.  It was the first drive through 
bar that was ever built”.  It was there for a number of years 
and never ran into political interference.  It operated very 
well.  We have lost some of these things because of quicker 
communications and transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk a few minutes about the people across the border 
from where I live.  As human beings we all have more or less 
similar needs.  We want to do what is best for our families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Snowflake and Wales areas, most people had relatives on 
either side.  The intermarriage between Canadians and Americans 
was unreal during the early part of the century.  There were no 
borders and love crossed whether they wanted to regulate it or 
not.  Their girls seemed to be just a little prettier than ours 
and vice versa.  There was always that type of rivalry building. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Watch it now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:</B>  Well, I am part American too.  I do 
go down south once in a while to get that tan to make me look 
like a farmer.  We do not get too much of a tan in this House. We 
also change the dialect somewhat.  We get that southern drawl. 
Those are the positive things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My roots being in the Soviet Union, in the 1980s I could see how 
big the disaster was over there and what their needs were.  I was 
astounded at the people who had tried to put up a huge defence 
against the Russians.  The American farmers were the first to 
collect a whole bunch of durum wheat and ship it across to the 
Soviet Union by plane.  It got there and was used to make bread. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The American people have a heart just like we Canadians.  That 
is what we have to emphasize in this motion.  It is not just an 
issue about wanting a couple of days set aside to recognize that 
our border is unprotected.  I am sure that the hon. member will 
agree with me that with these two days we want to recognize that 
we are human beings on the same planet.  The less distractions, 
the less friction, the less feuding that goes on between our two 
nations, the better off society will be and the better off the 
whole world will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the member for bringing this motion forward again. 
When we see each other's weaknesses and help to overcome them, 
only then will we gain the strength as two peaceful nations.  We 
have never had a war of any substance that we could call 
detrimental to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Not since 1812. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:</B>  That is one that we kind of ignore 
as a sparring match. Probably if we had done it in a different 
fashion we would not have a border, but we do not know. That is 
for history to debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage Reform members to support this motion.  This motion 
is worthwhile.  It can only bring us peace and harmony.  It is a 
motion that will benefit either side of the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can show to the world that even with the friction we have in 
our trade issues, whether we like the wheat board or we do not 
like the wheat board, whether we like supply management or we do 
not like supply management, those things can be ironed out and we 
can work for the benefit of all. We can work to the benefit of 
all.  It does not say that I have to have my way and they have to 
have their way and we will separate and go in different 
directions.  We have to go in one direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage the government to build a relationship with the 
American government, to go to the next GATT negotiations or the 
World Trade Organization and work as a team.  Together we are a 
lot further ahead.  We have a lot more strength.  We have a lot 
more to gain than we will lose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude with an invitation for members to come to Manitoba to 
see the international peace garden.  It would be worth their 
while, just for the feeling they would get when sitting in that 
peace tower.  The feeling of co-operation, friendship and kinship 
that we have as North Americans will explode around hon. members 
and they will go away with a very positive feeling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thank you for the opportunity to speak to this motion.  I wish 
members of the House well and I hope everybody can support it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it gives me 
great pleasure to rise before the House to debate the hon. member 
for Erie—Lincoln's private member's motion calling upon 
government to designate July 2 and 3 as Canada-United States days 
of peace and friendship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to congratulate the member for focusing the 
attention of the House on the very cordial relationship we have 
enjoyed for well over a century with our number one trading 
partners to the south. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that we not take the good relationship we 
have with our American neighbours for granted. We hear too often 
of cases where Canadians try to bad mouth our American 
neighbours.  The Americans have been very important to us as 
trading partners, but also as allies, friends, and for many of 
us, relatives who reside in the states. We should not take it for 
granted.  We should work hard to keep those relationships on a 
very favourable ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even before Canada and the U.S. became independent countries, 
commercial trading was very much a way of life between both 
colonies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I represent the constituency of West Nova which incidentally 
encompasses Annapolis Royal, home of the first permanent European 
settlement in North America. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a history of trade between the United States and 
Canada since the beginning of the 17th century, with the arrival 
of Samuel de Champlain and his fellow explorers in North America 
in 1604.  Our new immigrants quickly took advantage of the 
fertile farming land and an ocean full of fish to begin trading 
with the new immigrants to the south. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even when France and England were at war with each other during 
the 17th and 18th centuries, trade between the French colony of 
Acadia and the English colonies in the New England states 
continued to trade among themselves despite directives from both 
colonial powers to end this practice. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the 20th century, many Canadians have moved to the 
United States in search of work.  Like many of my fellow 
citizens, I have relatives in the United States, particularly in 
the New England area. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cross-border relations between the two countries have improved 
significantly in recent years.  Despite rigorous objections from 
the then official opposition, the Liberal Party, the former 
Progressive Conservative government concentrated on strengthening 
Canada's ability to reach new markets by entering into a free 
trade agreement with the United States.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the fact that some trading disputes have evolved in 
recent years, mechanisms for dispute resolutions are in place and 
have adequately dealt with these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to see the Liberal government endorsing our 
free trade initiatives, particularly after it had promised to rid 
itself of the free trade agreement once it took power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not surprised by the about-face the government has taken. 
This government has broken its promise on a number of very 
important issues, not including its promise to cancel the free 
trade agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I am certain everyone remembers, this government broke its 
promise to cancel the GST.  Instead it introduced the dreaded HST 
that is causing much hardship for residents in the maritime 
region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has also broken its promise to abide by any 
Canadian human rights tribunal decision on pay equity, choosing 
instead to deny mostly low income female workers money they 
worked hard for and rightfully deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the first commercial trading products between Canada and 
the U.S. was agricultural products.  Yet this government appears 
to have forgotten the important role agriculture plays in our 
everyday lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government continues to say it is committed to 
helping strengthen Canada's farming community yet it has 
effectively reduced its funding of our farm safety net programs 
by some 30% since 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like most of the country, West Nova hog producers are 
experiencing anywhere from 60% to 70% decreases in their prices. 
Rather than help sustain our farming industry the government has 
turned its back on our farmers.  The government still has not 
recognized the serious effects the past two years of drought has 
caused our Nova Scotia farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps our agricultural sector is not as large as others but it 
deserves consideration by the government. I intend to let the 
government know our farming community has been financially viable 
in the past and it will be again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government had also promised to implement effective 
conservation measures for our fishing industry immediately upon 
taking office because it said if stocks were not conserved now, 
there would be no fishing industry left on which we could build 
sustainable development. Conservation was ignored in the lobster 
fishery as illegal lobster fishing was allowed to operate off 
West Nova shores almost completely unabated by the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the 1998-99 fishing season less than a week old, fishers 
have told me that some of their catches for opening day were 
reduced considerably.  Let us pray this trend does not continue 
throughout the fishing season. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me apologize if I appear to have transgressed from the topic 
at hand.  However, I think all members recognize the importance 
this fishery and our farming industry have had on the lives of my 
constituents of West Nova. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the hon. member for Erie—Lincoln definitely has good 
intentions with the introduction of this bill.  Please correct me 
if I am mistaken, but I believe Windsor, Ontario presently 
participates in a very enjoyable joint celebration with its U.S. 
neighbours precisely in recognition of this close working 
relationship we have with our American neighbours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because I recognize the benefits of maintaining and enhancing 
this close relationship with our American cousins, I believe we 
should explore the possibility of perhaps doing some kind of 
joint celebration with our U.S. counterparts.  Perhaps we could 
generate greater recognition of the important ties that bind our 
two countries together by having both countries agree to 
recognize a specific day or to participate in a special event. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the hon. member has stumbled upon a good idea to help 
foster even greater co-operation between two countries. However, 
I would prefer we do something in conjunction with our American 
neighbours. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs I thank the hon. member for 
Erie—Lincoln for bringing this motion to the House and for 
reminding us of the deep historical ties that bind Canadians and 
Americans together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than anything else, the unique and enduring relationship 
between our two peoples rests fundamentally on the broad set of 
values we share in common, a belief in democratic open societies, 
respect for the rule of law, tolerance and an abiding faith in 
the rights and responsibilities of each individual citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Together these values shape our societies and the way we look at 
the rest of the world.  They are the underlying reason our shared 
border is one of the most open in the world with more than 200 
million crossings each year.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thirty-seven years ago in this Chamber, then President of the 
United States John F. Kennedy described the relationship between 
Canada and United States this way: “Geography has made us 
neighbours.  History has made us friends. Economics has made us 
partners.  And necessity has made us allies”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>President Kennedy's words ring as true today as they did many 
years ago.  Among all the countries in the world Canada and the 
United States are each other's most important partners.  The 
partnership covers the full range of bilateral and global issues, 
from trade and investment, defence and international security to 
the furthering of the human rights agenda.  But the real measure 
of our relationship can be found in the everyday linkages between 
our peoples.  For example, millions of Canadians have family 
members and friends who are Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians continue to occupy key roles in American society, be 
it in business, popular entertainment, sports, academia or 
science and technology.  Americans visit Canada more than any 
other foreign country yet it is a mark of the closeness of a 
relationship that most do not consider Canada a foreign country 
at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our native peoples share cross-border cultural and historical 
bonds that are thousands of years old.  This continuing flow of 
people and ideas back and forth between our two countries has 
been an enduring strength in our relationship and one that has 
served to cement the bonds between our societies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our bilateral trade relationship within the framework of the FTA 
and NAFTA has grown to create an unrivalled sphere of prosperity 
for our citizens.  Every day approximately $1.4 billion in goods 
and services crosses the border creating jobs and raising living 
standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian exports to the U.S. support over two million jobs for 
our citizens.  This makes expanding our access to the United 
States markets a key international trade objective.  The joint 
management of our shared border is another example of how our 
close and productive partnership benefits both our citizens. 
However, we believe we can do even more to expedite clearance 
procedures, avoid the imposition of unnecessary bureaucratic red 
tape and ensure the creation of a seamless border for the 21st 
century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cross-border co-operation also extends to law enforcement where 
Canadian and American police forces work together to fight crimes 
such as telemarketing fraud and illegal child abductions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The close ties between our two countries are nowhere more 
evident than in border communities such as those represented by 
the hon. member.  Every day people flow across the border in 
these communities forging friendships, new opportunities and 
working together to create a better life on both sides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recent example of how communities on both sides of the 
border helped each other during the devastating ice storm last 
winter is a good example of the kind of friendship that Canadians 
and American share.  Who can forget the images of exhausted 
American hydro crews working alongside their Canadian 
counterparts in the struggle to restore power to cities, towns 
and villages in Quebec and eastern Ontario, or the thousands of 
tonnes of supplies and equipment that streamed from south of the 
border.  When the crisis struck our American friends were there 
to help us out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reason for continuing strength and resilience of our 
relationship is the respect we have for each other as unique 
societies, each with its own distinct identity, forms of 
governance, traditions and political and social cultures.  It is 
fair to say respect is an indispensable condition of any 
friendship, be it between individuals or between countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Internationally Canada works closely with our American friends 
on a wide variety of global issues, from security to trade, 
through a variety of partnerships.  In the security field our 
military co-operation has a long and noble history.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians and Americans fought together on the battlefields 
during three wars in this century.  We helped create NATO which 
even now is working to ensure peace in Bosnia and Kosovo.  We 
co-operate in NORAD to share the burden of the defence of North 
America.  The changes to the international system since the end 
of the cold war present us with new global challenges and threats 
that NATO and NORAD are evolving to meet. The United States and 
Canada are working together to ensure these two organizations 
adapt to the changing world so they can continue to play a role 
in contributing to international peace and security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's motion provides us with an important reminder 
of the incredible number of ways Canadians and Americans 
co-operate together in almost every facet of life every day.  The 
ties that bind us are strong and run deep.  They will continue to 
be based on the organic linkages between our civil societies.  As 
we consider the motion we must reflect on the fact that our 
relationship with the United States is all encompassing and a 
daily reality for many Canadians.  It does not do that 
relationship justice for the government to single out two days to 
commemorate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Informal ease of interaction and the essential simplicity of 
friendships among individuals, communities and regions across the 
border is a phenomenon whose continued vitality exists apart from 
the world of government, politics or economics.  In an 
environment where such a healthy and vibrant co-operation can and 
does develop of its own accord, need we take the step of a formal 
declaration? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every day we celebrate the Canada-U.S. relationship through the 
actions of our people.  Every day a citizen of ours travels 
across the undefended and peaceful border which is a symbol of 
close ties.  Every day our students seek to expand their horizons 
and allow for unlimited options by examining the fine 
institutions on both sides of the border.  Every day our 
businesses strive to expand as they enjoy unprecedented access to 
the wealthiest market in the world.  These are just a few 
indications of the uniqueness of our close bilateral ties. Do 
these need a formal declaration to bring them to the attention of 
our citizens? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also consider the possible financial implications of 
individuals, organizations and border communities seeking funds 
from government to celebrate these commemorative days. These are 
just some of the questions that merit additional consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I proceed further with this motion it would be helpful to 
have some idea of possible reciprocal initiatives by our American 
friends.  The hon. member may want to raise this issue within the 
context of the Canada-U.S. interparliamentary association.  I 
thank the hon. member for providing us with this opportunity to 
remind ourselves of how lucky we are to have this special 
relationship with the United States.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
glad to participate in this debate to recognize our friends to 
the south who share in many ways a common heritage of being 
countries populated by immigrants from around the world.  Many of 
the people who live in both countries, I included, grew up in a 
foreign land and decided the future would be brighter in North 
America.  They crossed the ocean from wherever they came from to 
participate in one of these two wonderful countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have enjoyed my sojourn during the 30-odd years I have lived 
in North America.  This country has been very good to me.  I have 
friends and relatives south of the border who enjoy living in the 
United States.  It is wonderful that through our common heritage 
we are able to share so much and that we have been friends for 
such a long time.  We take great pride in having the longest 
undefended border in the world.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of parliament representing the people of Alberta, we 
are especially proud of our relationship with the United States 
because so much of our oil and gas industry involves 
communication with people in the United States.  We have a large 
agricultural industry which again depends heavily on markets in 
the United States.  We have tourism that draws heavily from the 
United States.  Of course, we have the Banff and Jasper national 
parks which draw millions of people every year.  Many of these 
people come from the United States.  They come here to enjoy what 
we have to offer and many Canadians go to the United States to 
enjoy what they have to offer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion of the member for Erie—Lincoln is quite appropriate, 
that we join Canada Day on July 1 with Independence Day on July 
4, with the two days in between recognizing the peace and 
friendship that exists between our two countries.  There are 
international parks, such as the one at the border crossing just 
south of Vancouver going into Washington State, the International 
Peace Park, as well as other symbols of the friendship between 
the two countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to commend the member for Erie—Lincoln for introducing 
this motion and I hope it passes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to say a few 
words on this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to first commend the member for Erie—Lincoln for 
bringing this motion forward.  We take many things for granted 
when we continually cross the border between our two great 
countries.  His motion would have the government designate July 2 
and 3, the two days between Canada Day and Independence Day, as 
Canada-United States days of peace and friendship in recognition 
of the close and peaceful relations that exist between the two 
countries and the warm personal links that prevail between 
neighbouring communities along the length of the common border 
and the commitments of freedom, democracy and human rights shared 
by these two great nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am reminded of the work that the member for Erie—Lincoln 
does.  He is responsible for a riding that stretches from the 
border of Fort Erie, through Port Colborne, Lincoln, West Lincoln 
and many other small communities.  However, he serves not only 
the border.  He also serves two lakes and those two lakes also 
serve both countries.  His riding holds the biggest border 
crossing of all the Niagara area crossings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The announcement of the twinning of the bridges in his area is a 
good indication of the capacity that crosses that border every 
day.  On the U.S. side, highway 219 is being considered for 
expansion because of the number of trucks and the amount of 
traffic, as well as the routes that it will have to the eastern 
seaboard of the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the member for Erie—Lincoln, the member from Niagara 
Falls and myself met with the Niagara regional council to talk 
about the mid-peninsula border.  That is to make sure that 
traffic can flow from Toronto and Hamilton to the Peace Bridge 
area of our great neighbour to the south. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have worked on both sides of the border.  For 30 years I 
worked for a major automotive company, sometimes known as General 
Motors.  I had the opportunity to work in many plant cities in 
the U.S. in conjunction with the plant cities in Canada.  It was 
the co-operation of those plant cities on an ongoing basis that 
made the automotive business very competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am reminded that the auto pact which was struck many years ago 
by a member of this government was an indication of the 
co-operation and work that goes on between our two countries.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with this in mind that I wanted the opportunity to speak 
of the good work that the member for Erie—Lincoln does and the 
fact that he works with the Canada-U.S. parliamentary group on an 
ongoing basis to solve problems before they even get into the 
legislature or house of either country.  That is the way we have 
been able to work for many years.  We sit down, talk about the 
problem, talk about the alternatives and then get on with making 
a resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want members to understand that I give strong support to the 
motion brought forward by the member for Erie—Lincoln.  By 
dedicating these two days, it would give all of us, on both sides 
of the border, a chance to sit back, relax and really appreciate 
the fact that we have two great countries, a very lengthy border, 
and the fact that we have freedom, democracy, human rights and 
many other things that are taken for granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the member for Erie—Lincoln for bringing this 
motion forward to the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank my

put an amendment to the motion to delete the year 1998.  This 
motion was actually introduced back in 1997, in the last 
parliament, and the year does not make an awful lot of sense at 
this time.  Accordingly, I would request unanimous consent to 
delete the year 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Does the hon. member have unanimous

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, Canada and the United 
States are broad lands:  broad in mind, broad in spirit and broad 
in physical expanse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend, the Parliamentary Secretary for the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, quoted a U.S. president and I would like to 
follow that initiative by quoting another president.  Over 50 
years ago a U.S. president stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada and the United States have reached the point where we no 
longer think of each other as “foreign” countries.  We think of 
each other as friends, as peaceful and co-operative neighbours on 
a spacious and fruitful continent... 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The example of accord provided by our two countries did not come 
about merely through the happy circumstances of geography.  It is 
compounded of one part proximity and nine parts good will and 
common sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The record proves that in peaceful commerce the combined efforts 
of our countries can produce outstanding results.  Our trade with 
each other is far greater than of any other two nations on earth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We seek a peaceful world, a prosperous world, a free world, a 
world of good neighbours, living on terms of equality and mutual 
respect, as Canada and the United States have lived for 
generations. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was said over 50 years ago by the late President Truman as 
he addressed parliament in this very House.  What was true then 
is true today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend, the Parliament Secretary for the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, also quoted the late John Kennedy, another 
U.S. president.  I would like to reiterate that quote as well 
because it is very succinct: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Geography has made us neighbours.  History has made us friends. 
Economics has made us partners.  And necessity has made us 
allies. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, he went on to say the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those whom nature hath so joined together, let no man put 
asunder. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He then went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not seek the unanimity that comes to those who water down 
all issues to the lowest common denominator, or to those who 
conceal their differences behind fixed smiles, or to those who 
measure unity by standards of popularity and affection instead of 
trust and respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are allies.  This is a partnership, not an empire.  We are 
bound to have differences and disappointments, and we are equally 
bound to bring them out into the open, to settle them when they 
can be settled, and to respect each other's views when they 
cannot be settled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But our alliance is born not of fear but of hope.  It is an 
alliance which advances what we are for, as well as opposing what 
we are against. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was true then, when said by John Kennedy in this very House 
on May 17, 1961, is true now. 
This is really an apple pie motion.  Canadian apples and American 
apples make for a very great dessert.  It is non-partisan.  It is 
equally applicable to Quebec as it is to New York state, as 
equally applicable to British Columbia as it is to Washington 
state.

have been moved.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>THE ENVIRONMENT 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, you 
may recall that on November 5 the Minister of the Environment 
told the House that the protocol, the agreement for the reduction 
and elimination of mercury and other heavy metals, as signed in 
Aarhus, Denmark earlier this year will be ratified by Canada by 
the end of the year.  The minister on that occasion also 
announced that in Canada, mercury emissions have been reduced by 
64% in the last decade or so.  The agreement in Aarhus, Denmark 
requires however only a 50% reduction based on 1990 levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike iron and calcium, mercury serves no function in humans. 
It is a heavy metal and a persistent, highly toxic substance to 
be found in the food chain.  It must be noted that while mercury 
occurs in nature as an element that can be found in water, air 
and land, human activities increase the presence of mercury in 
the environment to the point that human and ecosystem health are 
at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, in six provinces and the territories, health 
advisories have been issued warning of the dangers of consuming 
mercury contaminated fish. In addition, it has been found that 
some wildlife species with high mercury levels in their blood 
have reproductive problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent study by Environment Canada found that loons have 
problems with nesting and raising their young because of high 
mercury levels in their blood.  The study also found that mercury 
levels in loons increase from west to east, presumably because of 
industrial activities concentrated in eastern North America. 
Evidently, industrial activities throughout North America 
increase mercury levels in the environment and in wildlife. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Arctic, recent samples of ringed seal and beluga whale 
show higher concentrations and higher rates of accumulation of 
mercury than the samples taken in the 1970s and 1980s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One major source of mercury is from the burning of coal for 
power generation.  Ontario Hydro, following the decommissioning 
of nuclear reactors intends to meet short term power needs by 
using coal-fired power plants.  By burning more coal, more 
mercury is released in the air. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Ontario between 2.7 tonnes and 3.4 tonnes of mercury are 
released to the atmosphere each year because of human activities. 
Up to 2.5 tonnes are released into the Great Lakes waters 
annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that the national pollutant release 
inventory is of limited help in revealing how much mercury each 
company or operation releases because it reports only when the 
process, manufacture or other use involves 10 tonnes of mercury 
or more. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1830"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT54"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Evidently while we must applaud the protocol, a reduction of 50% 
or even 64% is far from adequate.  As in the case of Denmark 
where mercury is banned or about to be banned, we must protect 
the public with a complete ban of mercury emissions resulting 
from human activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore ask the minister whether it is the intent of the 
government either to ban mercury emissions or to introduce 
regulations that will prevent mercury pollution entirely. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the 
Environment, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is an important issue 
for the health of Canadians.  The protocol we signed last June 
will be ratified by Canada before the end of this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While 16 countries need to ratify the heavy metals protocol 
before the obligations come into effect, this government is not 
standing idly by waiting for the support of other nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While Canada can or has met most of its obligations, one of the 
most significant gains from the United Nations heavy metals 
protocol is that we have commitments from UN ECE countries to 
reduce their emissions of mercury and other atmospheric 
pollutants which we know are transported by air currents from 
various countries to Canada's Arctic and eastern regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has already developed extremely effective programs and 
initiatives that have greatly reduced the atmospheric loading of 
mercury in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The controls on mercury emissions imposed under CEPA and the 
Fisheries Act have convinced the mercury cell chlor-alkali 
industry in Canada to alter its technology to a non-mercury based 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there were 16 such facilities in Canada, only 1 remains 
and it consistently meets the strict emission control 
requirements of both acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In concert with Environment Canada's accelerated reduction on 
elimination of toxics program, the mining sector has shown 
considerable progress in reducing mercury emissions.  New 
technologies developed by Canadian companies have reduced 18 
tonnes of mercury emissions to the atmosphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Environment Canada officials have calculate that our most recent 
data show our emissions have been reduced by 64% and similar 
reductions are reportable for lead and cadmium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada will not rest there.  Our goal is to report further 
substantial national reductions by the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a fully participating member of the North American agreement 
on environmental co-operation, Canada is leading the development 
of a North American regional action plan for mercury, scheduled 
for submission to ministers by June 1999.  Canadian, American and 
Mexican citizens will have an opportunity to provide input to 
this important initiative before the plan is adopted by the three 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other mercury reduction programs important to Canada include the 
New England governors-eastern Canadian premiers mercury reduction 
plan and the ongoing work to further develop a mercury reduction 
program under the Great Lakes binational toxics—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, are 
the Sea King and Labrador helicopters safe?  Was the tragic crash 
on October 2 avoidable?  Are any enlisted personnel or civilians 
currently at risk because of the state of the Sea King and 
Labrador helicopters? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the questions the Liberal government owes it 
to Canadians to answer completely and publicly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 2, 1998 a Labrador helicopter crashed near Marsoui in 
Gaspé, Quebec killing all six of its crew.  Apparently this 
helicopter burst into flames and broke into three pieces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992 another helicopter crashed near Bella Coola, B.C., 
killing Corporal Phil Young from my home province of Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 28, 1994 Major Wally Sweetman and co-pilot Major Bob 
Henderson were killed when the fuel line of a Sea King helicopter 
failed. In May 1995 another Labrador crashed at Margaretsville, 
Nova Scotia. In all, 12 Sea King helicopters have crashed, 
killing seven Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both the Sea King and the Labrador helicopters were first put 
into service over a third of a century ago, in 1963. At the 
beginning of the year these helicopters went into service, John 
Diefenbaker was prime minister, 19 current members of parliament 
had yet to be born, Medgar Evers was still alive and Martin 
Luther King had yet to give his famous speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The newly ordered Cormorant search and rescue helicopters will 
not be delivered and put into service until the next millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, the Liberal government, largely due to its own 
decisions, may now be in the position of deciding between the 
health and safety of military personnel and the search and rescue 
need of civilians at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government assured Canadians there would be no cost 
to cancelling Mulroney's helicopter deal.  That no cost turned 
into $484 million of Canadian taxpayer money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 the government issued a defence white paper with its 
strategy for the military.  Instead of moving ahead and issuing 
tenders immediately for a new helicopter, it waited three years 
until 1997. To top it off, the government then ordered basically 
the same helicopter it had just wasted nearly half a billion 
dollars of taxpayer money to cancel. 
Here are a few questions the government owes it to Canadians to 
answer.  Why did the government cancel the original contract when 
there was a demonstrated need for new helicopters?  Why, after 
assuming office, did it wait a further four years to order the 
new helicopters?  Why, having derided the Mulroney government's 
original choice, did it opt for the same craft?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has said that crews would not be disciplined for 
refusing to fly the Labradors.  By making this offer it seems to 
me as if the government may be trying to protect itself in the 
case of a future crash.  Clearly there must be concern about the 
safety of the craft to make that pronouncement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Former Labrador pilot Lieutenant Colonel Dennis Hopping stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very difficult as a member of an air crew team to say “No, 
I won't launch an operational mission to save someone's life”. 
What a terrible position to put a professional pilot in. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Major Marvin Haagsma, retired, stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have personally experienced engine failure rates that are 500 
times higher than those accepted as `normal' by the current 
generation of helicopters.  It is time for people to hear the 
truth:  The Sea King and Labrador fleets are extremely dangerous 
and ought to be grounded. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to finish with two final questions for the 
government to answer.  Why is the government secure enough about 
the safety of these helicopters to put them in active service 
with so many indications to the contrary?  What other options 
have been pursued such as short term leases? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, our highest priority is 
the safety of our crews and our aircraft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chief of Air defence Staff has assured the Minister of 
National Defence that the Labradors can fly in complete safety. 
The fact that problems have been detected and immediate remedial 
action taken speaks to the stringency of our maintenance and 
inspection program.  The Canadian forces have high airworthiness 
standards, not only for the Labradors, but for all the rest of 
its equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Labrador crash in early October, it is not hard to 
understand why Labrador flight and maintenance crews are taking 
additional precautions to ensure that these aircraft are safe. 
They are merely showing a great deal of caution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member is aware, an investigation is currently under 
way to determine the circumstances of this crash, and it would 
be ill-advised to speculate at this time about the cause.   It is 
important to allow the investigation to proceed in order to find 
out what caused the crash and what steps should be taken to 
prevent a recurrence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be kept in mind that the armed forces have other 
aircraft besides the Labrador helicopters, among them the 
Hercules and the Buffalo, whose primary purpose is search and 
rescue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In January 1998, the government announced hat it would buy 15 
Cormorant helicopters to replace the Labradors.  The first of 
them will be in service by 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supply strategy for replacing the old Sea Kings is under 
study.  Leasing is one of the options we are considering as a 
supply strategy.  As the Minister of National Defence said, he 
hopes to make an announcement within the year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We still intend to provide Canadian forces with the equipment 
they need to carry out their missions at home and abroad.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>POVERTY 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
poverty is an issue that concerns all Canadians.  A phenomenon 
that is called the growing gap, the inequality between the 
country's rich and poor, continues to be pronounced. Although 
programs already exist to combat the growing gap, the effects 
continue to be felt by many. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As more Canadians fall below the poverty line we must ask 
ourselves what we might be able to do to counter this process. 
The government needs to look at this issue and make changes to 
rectify the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, a social report released this fall indicated 
that a growing gap does exist between the rich and the poor. It 
seems that the wealthy are getting wealthier and the poor are 
getting poorer. Many factors contribute to this phenomenon and 
they must be examined and countered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, top executives in Canada consistently receive 
enormous raises while the average worker faces a wage freeze or a 
layoff or other effects of all too common cutbacks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The already rich owners, managers, chairs and CEOs of the 
country continue to get richer.  The average worker meanwhile is 
not getting large increases and in some cases is actually getting 
poorer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While in the 1950s and 1960s the average family income more than 
doubled, this is certainly not the case today. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1840"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT56"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average CEO in Canada now makes $862,000 a year, which jumps 
to $1.5 million if we include stock options.  This amount has 
increased at a rate of approximately 13% over the last few years. 
They continue to make more money and to gain power and prestige. 
Meanwhile in the same amount of years the wage of the average 
Canadian worker has risen no more than 2%, which is less than the 
rate of inflation.  Furthermore, many Canadians are laid off and 
must settle for lower paying jobs or depend on government 
support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1971 the average income for the richest 10% of families, 
being $107,000, was 21 times that of the poorest 10%.  The gap 
was already present but to a smaller extent.  By 1996 Canada's 
richest families were earning on average 314 times the amount of 
Canada's poorest.  These figures are self-explanatory.  The gap 
has widened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This growing gap between the nation's poorest and richest plays 
a big role in the lives of most Canadians whether it be for the 
better or for the worst.  Poverty is a problem in Canada.  It is 
our duty as parliamentarians to implement legislation to try to 
correct this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a country like Canada poverty is simply unacceptable.  Canada 
is a rich country both in natural and human resources.  We are 
proud to be one of the world's richest and most developed 
countries and therefore cannot let the issue of poverty change 
this status.  We have always prided ourselves in being a strong 
country economically, which is one reason why we will not accept 
that this gap continues to grow.  Something needs to be done.  It 
is important that as parliamentarians we try to rectify the 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human 
Resources Development to outline exactly what we as a government 
should do to correct this situation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, our 
government has introduced a number of measures specifically to 
help lift people out of poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last July we began to put $850 million per year into the 
national child benefit.  An additional $850 million will be 
added.  By the year 2000 the total will be $1.7 billion per year 
going into the hands of low income families with children.  This 
money is on top of the $5.1 billion we currently provide families 
with children that need financial assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The long term solution to poverty lies in helping Canadians find 
jobs.  Our Canadian opportunities strategy gives Canadians 
greater access to the knowledge and skills they need for the 
better jobs of the new economy.  This strategy includes the $2.5 
billion investment in millennium scholarships which will give 
100,000 low and middle income students per year access to 
scholarships averaging $3,000.  Up to 25,000 other students in 
financial need with children will benefit from the new Canada 
study grants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our youth employment strategy is there to help young people.  We 
know that about 86% of participants are either employed or have 
returned to school six to twelve months after completing their 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employment insurance system is a vital part of our safety 
net. It gives workers the temporary support they need and the 
tools they need to get back to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over 31,000 jobs have been created through the transitional jobs 
fund; $2.7 billion has been put into active employment measures 
to help people get back to work; and the family supplement also 
helped 350,000 low income families with children.  A new 
federal-provincial program will provide $190 million to help 
disabled persons to gain better access to the workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These efforts demonstrate clearly that we are committed to do as 
much as we possibly can to reduce poverty and create equality of 
opportunity for Canadians.
