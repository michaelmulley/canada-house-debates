	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36, I wish to present a petition which 
has been circulating all across Canada. It has been signed by a 
number of Canadians from Deloraine, Manitoba.
<P>
	The petitioners draw to the attention of the House that managing 
the family home and caring for preschool children is an honourable 
profession which has not been recognized for its value to our 
society. They also state that the Income Tax Act discriminates 
against families that make the choice to provide care in the home 
for preschool children, the disabled, the chronically ill or the aged.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to pursue 
initiatives to eliminate tax discrimination against families that 
decide to provide care in the home  for preschool children, the 
disabled, the chronically ill or the aged.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="NATIONALHOUSINGACT">NATIONAL HOUSING ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from November 6 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-108, an act to amend the National Housing Act, 
be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak to Bill C-108 at 
second reading, a bill to amend the National Housing Act.
<P>
	I can speak from firsthand experience of the federal 
government's concern in social housing matters. I am pleased to 
represent the riding of Etobicoke-Lakeshore where the 
government is funding projects such as Kilcooley gardens co-op 
and William Kinnett co-op housing, housing residents who are 
single parents and persons with disabilities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16284"> 16284 </A></B>
<P>
	I am proud to be part of a government that supports non-profit 
housing which promotes the security of tenure and a sense of 
community among its members. I can also speak to the benefits 
of Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation's mortgage loan 
statistics.
<P>
	In my riding of Etobicoke-Lakeshore from 1992 to October 
1995 a total of 1,567 homebuyers took advantage of CMHC's 
mortgage loan insurance. Of these, 708 were first time homebuyers 
who were able to gain access to their home under the CMHC's first 
home loan insurance, the 5 per cent down program as we call it.
<P>
	I am pleased to speak in support of the bill because I understand 
the crucial importance of it to ensure that CMHC can continue its 
mortgage loan insurance activity.
<P>
	I am bewildered why certain members of the House are not able 
to support the bill. I can only assume it is because they do not fully 
understand the provisions of the bill and cannot appreciate the 
important role mortgage loan insurance will play in helping 
Canadians to gain access to decent affordable housing.
<P>
	Many of my colleagues have already spoken to this issue. 
However, it is obvious the message has not gotten through. Allow 
me to spell it out one more time more clearly for the benefit of 
those having difficulty understanding why the bill is important to 
Canadians.
<P>
	NHA mortgage loan insurance makes home ownership 
accessible to millions of Canadians regardless of where they live. 
This access is under similar terms and conditions with the smallest 
feasible down payment and at the lowest cost to borrowers. CMHC 
is able to provide this insurance at no cost to the government.
<P>
	Bill C-108 is required in order for CMHC to continue to 
underwrite home mortgage loan insurance within the legislative 
limit. Let me be very clear on this point. If CMHC cannot continue 
its mortgage loan insurance activity, thousands of Canadians will 
not have access to home ownership. It is as simple and as serious as 
that.
<P>
<B>(1010 )</B>
<P>
	NHA mortgage loan insurance works like this. Most lenders 
cannot make a mortgage for more than 75 per cent of the value of a 
property without mortgage loan insurance. This means those not 
able to save a down payment of 25 per cent would be locked out of 
home ownership without mortgage loan insurance. NHA mortgage 
loan insurance provides approved lenders with insurance against 
borrower default or residential mortgage loans.
<P>
	NHA mortgage loan insurance allows Canadians to take out a 
mortgage with an NHA approved lender with a down payment of 
only 10 per cent of the property value or 5 per cent for first time 
homebuyers.
<P>
	NHA mortgage loan insurance requires the payment of 
application fees and insurance premiums. It is not just handed out 
for free by the government. These premiums  are charged as a 
percentage of the loan based on the amount of the loan and its ratio 
to the value of the property. Premiums are set so as to ensure the 
fund always contains enough to cover any claims.
<P>
	Since mortgage loan insurance protects lenders against default 
losses, they are able to charge the borrower the lowest possible rate 
of interest, which means mortgage loan insurance plays a critical 
role in reducing the cost of home ownership for Canadians. It also 
plays a critical role in ensuring relative equal access to mortgage 
financing in all parts of the country. This access is made possible 
through the cross-subsidization of higher risk business against 
lower risk business. In this way the mortgage insurance fund is 
self-financing. In other words, it does not cost the government 
anything to provide mortgage loan insurance to lenders so 
Canadians can have access to decent affordable housing.
<P>
	We recognized a few years ago that even a 10 per cent down 
payment was difficult for some people to manage which is why the 
government introduced the first home loan insurance initiative in 
1992 and reduced the minimum required down payment to 5 per 
cent for first time homebuyers. The initiative was introduced for a 
two-year period but was extended for an additional five years until 
1999.
<P>
	As many members will know, this 5 per cent down initiative has 
been a tremendous success in helping to increase home ownership 
in Canada. By further reducing the minimum required down 
payment, home ownership has moved from a dream to a reality for 
the many Canadians who can afford monthly mortgage payments 
but who are having trouble saving for a down payment.
<P>
	Certain members might not be aware there are Canadians who 
cannot afford a down payment of 25 per cent of the price of a home, 
even the most modest home. Are there members in the House who 
would refuse these Canadians a chance to become homeowners? I 
must assume my colleagues are not so out of touch with the 
economic realities facing many Canadians that they are not aware 
of the difficulties some people have in raising enough money for a 
convenient 25 per cent down payment. This is a reality for many 
people. That does not mean we should exclude them from access to 
decent housing. The government supports families and individuals 
who aspire to be homeowners.
<P>
	We know many Canadians have a strong desire to become 
homeowners and we understand the tremendous importance of 
helping them to do just that. We know how important a home is to 
people not only in terms of an investment but for the impact on 
their quality of life.
<P>
<B>(1015 )</B>
<P>
	When people are well housed, they are better able to participate 
in their communities. They enjoy a greater sense of control over 
their lives. It is no surprise that Canadians are willing to make great 
sacrifices to achieve  home ownership. Saving for a down payment 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16285"> 16285 </A></B>
<P>
is a major undertaking, yet Canadians do it willingly because they 
want to fulfil their dream of owning a home, a place of their own.
<P>
	Perhaps it has been a long time since some members of the 
House had to worry about such mundane matters as saving money 
to buy a home. Let me tell them that a down payment even on a 
starter home represents a substantial amount of money for many 
Canadians. It is not easy to save for a down payment these days.
<P>
	Does that mean we should just close the door on those people, 
tell them and their children that they cannot own a home? What 
kind of a country would we have if we did that? Certainly not a 
country I would want to live in I can assure you.
<P>
	Home ownership is part of the Canadian dream, a dream which 
this government believes should be shared with all Canadians, not 
just a privileged few. We believe that all Canadians deserve the 
chance to become homeowners. We believe that the federal 
government should continue to play a role in helping them to do so. 
And we believe that NHA mortgage loan insurance is the best way 
for us to fulfil that important role at no cost to the government.
<P>
	Millions of Canadians depend on NHA mortgage loan insurance. 
In fact, members of the House will be pleased to learn that more 
than 3.5 million Canadian households have been helped to 
purchase a home since the government initiated NHA mortgage 
loan insurance in 1946. That figure represents nearly one-third of 
Canada's housing stock. In 1994 alone, CMHC provided mortgage 
insurance for 40 per cent of all residential mortgages in Canada. 
That represents over 300,000 housing units.
<P>
	In the riding of Calgary Southwest for example, from 1992 to 
October of this year, 5,600 households accessed home ownership 
through NHA insurance. Two thousand, two hundred and fifty of 
these households were first time buyers taking advantage of the 
lower down payment to become homeowners.
<P>
	This year alone, more than 1,000 homeowner units were insured 
in Calgary Southwest under the NHA with over half, 538, being 
first time homebuyers. Obviously CMHC mortgage loan insurance 
is a huge success, a very popular vehicle for Canadians to gain 
access to home ownership.
<P>
	Today we are presenting a bill to ensure that Canadians can 
continue to have access to home ownership, a bill that will ensure 
the continued operation of NHA mortgage loan insurance, a bill 
which is good news for all Canadians, a bill which this government 
would like to see passed.
<P>
	Those members who oppose this bill should keep in mind the 
disservice they are doing to Canadians. Are Reform members 
aware that 63 per cent of the adult population living in rental 
accommodations plan on  buying a home? Are they aware that 40 
per cent of all residential mortgages finalized in 1994 were NHA 
insured?
<P>
	Does that party know that 230,000 first time homebuyers would 
not have been able to purchase a home if not for the first home loan 
insurance initiative made possible by NHA mortgage loan 
insurance? Do they know that new construction to the end of 
October 1994 totals more than 24,000 units, including single 
detached homes, apartments, row houses and manufactured 
homes? Do they not realize the tremendous economic 
opportunities, especially the significant employment generation, 
resulting from all this activity, opportunities that would have been 
lost if not for NHA insurance?
<P>
	As I have stated, the mortgage loan insurance has enjoyed 
overwhelming popularity over the years precisely because it is so 
crucial to helping Canadians enjoy the benefits of home ownership.
<P>
<B>(1020 )</B>
<P>
	Opposing this bill means opposing the expectations of 
Canadians to become homeowners. Some might argue that the 
government should get out of the business of mortgage loan 
insurance and leave it to private industry. A little bit of thought on 
that subject would turn up some reasons why it is not a good idea to 
leave this important area to the private sector alone.
<P>
	First, without CMHC providing mortgage insurance, Canadians 
would be at the mercy of a private sector monopoly. Higher prices 
and fewer choices would be the result. Housing would then be less 
affordable, especially for the first time homebuyers.
<P>
	Second, we know from past practices of private insurers that 
homeowners in all parts of the country would not have access to 
mortgage insurance. What would happen to the many Canadians 
living in communities which the private sector would refuse to 
serve?
<P>
	Historically we know that private insurers have underserved 
rural areas. If NHA mortgage loan insurance were not available in 
rural communities, many rural Canadians would have to leave 
those areas in order to access home ownership because there would 
be areas which the private insurer would not want to serve, make no 
mistake about it. What would happen to the people living there? 
Quite simply, they would have very limited access to home 
ownership.
<P>
	As long as CMHC is around to provide equal access to mortgage 
loan insurance, we do not have to travel that ugly road. With 
CMHC in the industry, Canadians have continued access to low 
cost financing. Canadians living in areas of the country that the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16286"> 16286 </A></B>
<P>
private insurers will not or cannot serve are able to obtain housing 
financing at relatively equal terms and conditions.
<P>
	It should be obvious to members that competition is the best way 
to keep prices at the lowest possible level to encourage innovation 
in the mortgage industry to meet the changing needs of Canadian 
housing finance consumers.
<P>
	Millions of Canadians have benefited from NHA mortgage loan 
insurance in the past. Thousands continue to benefit each year. 
Members of the opposition should clearly understand and support 
this bill. I have to wonder why they are having such difficulty with 
this very simple issue.
<P>
	The federal government has a constitutional responsibility for 
banking and finance. CMHC mortgage insurance and guarantee are 
a demonstration that the federal government is fulfilling this 
responsibility. Without CMHC there would be a federal policy 
vacuum in the system of housing finance. The result would be 
unequal access to home loans across the country. Furthermore, 
marginal borrowers could pay more for low down payment 
mortgages or have no access to financing altogether.
<P>
	What is the motivation of those who question the crucial 
importance of NHA mortgage insurance? Surely it cannot be to 
save the federal government money. CMHC operates its mortgage 
insurance fund at no cost to the government. CMHC insurance is 
provided at no cost to the Canadian taxpayer. I repeat this. CMHC 
is required to achieve self-sufficiency strictly from the premiums 
and fees that it charges. CMHC is not part of the problem. In fact, it 
is part of the solution.
<P>
	Members might be interested to learn that CMHC has returned to 
the Government of Canada over $1 billion since its incorporation in 
1946. In addition, in 1992, $55 million was contributed to the 
government from the mortgage insurance fund.
<P>
	We in Canada are fortunate to be one of the best housed nations 
in the world. There can be no doubt that NHA mortgage loan 
insurance has had a significant role to play in bringing us to that 
enviable state. If we are to maintain that high standard, CMHC 
must be able to continue providing NHA mortgage loan insurance 
so that Canadians will have relatively equal access to low cost 
mortgage financing today and in the future.
<P>
	Yes, we are fortunate to have such a high standard of housing in 
the country. Over the years, with the leadership of CMHC in the 
housing sector, Canada has developed a broad range of housing 
expertise in the public and private sectors as well as in the 
academic community. We are willing to share that expertise with 
countries all over the world. Representatives from a variety of 
countries come to Canada to learn about our operations because 
they believe that we have not one of the best, but the best system of 
public mortgage loan insurance in the world and they want to learn 
about it.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	I want to conclude by saying that CMHC involvement in the 
international arena is not limited to helping other countries develop 
mortgage insurance, it also shares and explores possibilities in 
many other areas. I ask all members to support Bill C-108, which 
will make it possible for all Canadians to have their greatest dream 
fulfilled: owning a home.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
confirm what I think I understood, so I would like to ask the 
following question. I believe this loan insurance is self-financing 
and self-sustaining and does not cost the government anything. I 
want to make sure that I have understood that correctly.
<P>
	The other point which I would like the parliamentary secretary to 
mention once again is this. How will this help Canadians in terms 
of housing? I believe that needs to be repeated because I do not 
think it is sufficiently clear in the minds of people.
<P>
	I would ask my colleague to clarify those two points.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Augustine:</B> Mr. Speaker, those two questions cover the crux 
of Bill C-108.
<P>
	It is important for everyone to understand that there is no cost to 
the government. Actually, a benefit is derived from that 
involvement.
<P>
	It is also important to note that the United Nations has acclaimed 
Canada as the best country in the world in which to live. We must 
ensure that quality of life. What goes into that quality of life? 
Accessible, affordable, decent housing and home ownership. 
Therefore it is important for us to continue to have the necessary 
mortgages, loans and availability of funds. With the minimum 
down payment, individuals will have the opportunity to access 
housing and all of the things that come with having a roof over 
one's head and providing for one's family.
<P>
	It is important that we as a government continue the financing 
and support the National Housing Act and the CMHC to ensure that 
we provide loans to families to access housing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question concerns the insurance program. I understand that there 
are two programs: one is offered by CMHC and one is offered by a 
private organization.
<P>
	The hon. member is adamant in telling us that there is no cost to 
the government. I am trying to understand why the government is 
involved.
<P>
	I was talking the other day about the Small Business Loans Act, 
which again is money being channelled through bureaucrats at no 
cost to the government. I am trying to understand what benefits are 
being offered through this program if they are also being offered 
through the private sector.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16287"> 16287 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1030 )</B>
<P>
	If there is no cost to the government, why is the government 
involved in cycling the money through bureaucrats by charging 
people who buy houses to compensate the lenders who have 
mortgages that go into default? Why is the government even in the 
business? The private sector can do it just as well, just as 
efficiently, and under the rules there is no cost to the government. 
Why is the government even involved if there is no cost to the 
government and the private sector can do it better?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Augustine:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thought I addressed in my 
statement as part of this debate why I think the private sector 
cannot do it better and also the constitutional responsibility for 
banking and finance, which responsibility rests with the federal 
government.
<P>
	CMHC mortgage insurance and guarantee are a demonstration 
that we are fulfilling that responsibility. To leave it up to the private 
sector, we would have a patchwork. As I said earlier in my 
statement, there would be regions and areas of this country where 
the private sector would find it not viable to do business.
<P>
	When we are looking at our country from coast to coast to coast, 
it is important for us to recognize that if we are looking for equality 
and access for all Canadians, no matter where they live, rural, 
urban, et cetera, we should provide the avenues and the support so 
that we do not leave this solely to the private sector, whose bottom 
line is always dollars.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Beaches-Woodbine, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have no doubt of the importance of the federal role in housing. It is 
not that long ago that modest income Canadians were able to buy a 
modest first home, but that is no longer the case. Finding a large 
chunk of money to put down is no longer possible.
<P>
	I know there are still members on the opposite benches who have 
problems with this. I would like to know if the hon. member could 
give us the national benefits for the federal government investing 
in this area. It is important to look at not just regions or certain 
areas where there is accessibility to housing, but at the national 
interest as well, in terms of ensuring that modest income Canadians 
are able to buy modest homes for the first time in their lives, which 
gives them a sense of some form of stability. Would the hon. 
member do that for us?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Augustine:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will focus on one aspect, and that 
is the provision for assistance given to social housing.
<P>
	The federal government continues to provide $2 billion annually 
in social housing assistance to support the more than 661,000 
existing units across this country. Over a million low income 
Canadians whose housing needs cannot be met through the private 
sector market benefit from this assistance. This housing assists 
some of the most disadvantaged members of our society, including 
seniors on fixed incomes, aboriginal people,  persons with 
disabilities, families led by single parents, social assistance 
recipients, and the working poor. It is important to note that this 
support, which is also part of the debate here today, cannot solely 
be left to the private sector. CMHC activities contribute to that 
stable supply of affordable housing, which increases the economic 
benefits for all Canadians and provides our quality of life.
<P>
	CMHC's research demonstration and information transfer 
activities improve housing and living conditions and make the 
housing market more efficient and competitive. New technology, 
housing technology, building science, and promoting good living 
environments all provide us with safe, healthy, and sustainable 
development. These are all part of the work of CMHC and the 
research that is being done in that area.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	When we talk about support that is given to the whole issue of 
the CMHC mortgage insurance fund and the support it needs, it is 
important to note not only the quality of life but also the science 
and technology aspect, which provides employment for Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
gives me a great deal of pleasure to speak to Bill C-108, an act to 
amend the National Housing Act. This is a very brief bill, just four 
lines long, but the impact is significant.
<P>
	I listened to my colleague's debate, and her argument is basically 
that CMHC is going to turn off the tap. That is not true. This bill is 
about raising CMHC's loan limit from its present $100 billion to 
$150 billion. We are not talking about limiting what is already 
there. The pot is huge, $100 billion. That is $100,000 million that 
CMHC has to deal with presently. This bill would raise it by 
another $50 billion.
<P>
	We object to that because of the state of the country. This 
country is now $564 billion in debt. We cannot continue to carry on 
programs that are going to cost the government money. I object to 
my colleague's statement that this does not cost the country. It does 
indeed cost the country.
<P>
	If we are going to address our debt, the first thing we must do 
when we are in a hole is stop digging. Right now this bill continues 
to dig the hole. We cannot increase our debt any more. The country 
is broke. Let me repeat that: we are broke. This bill is going to add 
more liability to the country. It does not stop anything. It does not 
stop the $100 billion that is already in the pot. It is an increase.
<P>
	I would like to comment on the experiences of New Zealand. We 
were briefed on this bill by CMHC and I asked what is CMHC's 
ongoing liability, because it is into mortgages 5, 10, 15 and 20 
years ahead. It does not know. Current accounting practices say 
that you only have to be five years ahead. That is the window. I find 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16288"> 16288 </A></B>
<P>
it  incredible that a corporation dealing with this amount of money 
does not know its total liability.
<P>
	New Zealand put in legislation which states that every year the 
government has to publish all liabilities of the government and all 
crown corporations. It was a real eye opener, because a number of 
areas like CMHC had to disclose exactly what their liability was. 
Right now CMHC is not doing that.
<P>
	Another concern we have is that the government is sending 
mixed messages. It wants to decentralize. The Prime Minister has 
said that. We had a referendum in Quebec the other day that was 
about decentralization. Yet the bill goes in exactly the opposite 
direction. It enshrines more power into the federal government at a 
time when the federal government should be passing its powers 
down to the provinces.
<P>
	Canadians want a smaller federal government. We are 
overgoverned, overregulated. Business is telling us to get out of 
their faces and let business do what business does best, run their 
business. The best thing the government can do is get its house in 
order. This bill goes in exactly the opposite direction.
<P>
	I offer to my colleagues across the way a 20-point plan to 
decentralize the federal government. In fact Preston Manning 
spoke at the Canadian Club last week and got a standing ovation 
from the business people who recognized that a number of points of 
duplication between the federal and provincial governments have 
to end. Environment, natural resources, culture, and housing 
should all be done at the provincial level.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	Private enterprise is already into the mortgage business. CMHC 
is already into it to the tune of $100 billion. There is no need to 
increase it by another $50 billion. One hundred billion dollars is 
just fine, thank you very much. Let private enterprise do what it 
does best and deal with this issue.
<P>
	My colleague was saying that this does not cost the government 
any money. Let me remind you about the downturn in the early 
eighties. We can all recall that people in the housing market in 
Toronto, Vancouver, and Winnipeg were walking into their banks, 
dropping the keys on the desk and saying: ``Take it''. Because of 
the downturn in the market, their mortgage was worth more than 
their house. If that happens, ladies and gentlemen, guess who is 
going to carry the can? The Canadian government.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> With the greatest respect to 
ladies and gentlemen, I would remind members to address the 
Chair. Clearly I am of one gender and not the other. I think it is far 
safer for our debates to go through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilmour:</B> Mr. Speaker, my apologies. I shall certainly go 
through the Chair.
<P>
	People will remember the number of people who walked away 
from their mortgages back in the eighties. The government, 
CMHC, had to pick up the tab. That is what will happen in this case 
if there is a market downturn.
<P>
	To say that there is no cost to the government is completely 
wrong. There may not be today, but with the volatile interest rates 
and with the Quebec situation the money markets are very unstable. 
There is an excellent potential that this could end up hurting 
Canada, hurting the government, and costing us money.
<P>
	Another point in the bill that concerns me is paragraph (b), 
which refers to ``any additional amounts authorized by Parliament 
for the purposes of this section under an appropriation act or any 
other act of Parliament''. This concerns me, because I am not sure 
whether additional funds would come back to this House or 
whether in fact we are talking order in council. That concerns me 
greatly. If it comes back to this House, that is fine. If it goes to 
cabinet, that is not fine. Then we are not sure what is going on 
behind closed doors.
<P>
	I would like to conclude by saying that I do not believe this 
government is listening. We are broke. CMHC is already in to the 
tune of $100 billion. We object to putting Canadians further in 
debt. That is the reason Reform will oppose this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réginald Bélair (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have been listening with great interest to members of the Reform 
Party digressing on this bill. To date all of them have led Canadians 
who are listening to us to believe that this extra $50 billion in 
liability insurance would be added to the deficit and the national 
debt that exists already. This is absolutely false.
<P>
	My question for the hon. member for Comox-Alberni is: In 
terms of numbers, how much is it going to cost the Government of 
Canada with this new mortgage insurance fund?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilmour:</B> Mr. Speaker, the amount will depend on exactly 
how bad the downturn in the market is. When people walked away 
from their mortgages in the early eighties, the difference between 
the value of the house and the mortgage is what CMHC had to pick 
up.
<P>
	I cannot give a number. It is going to depend entirely on how 
much interest rates go up and how many people walk away from 
their mortgages. It could be a very large number, in the billions of 
dollars.
<P>
<B>(1045 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
previous statement was made by a member of the House. When we 
questioned the idea of turning this kind of enterprise over to the 
private sector, the reply was that it was not viable in some areas for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16289"> 16289 </A></B>
<P>
the private sector to  do it. That means if it is not viable then it must 
cost. Why would the private sector not do it if it does not cost?
<P>
	Does the hon. member agree that if the private sector is saying in 
some areas it is not viable there is a cost that is recognized by that 
sector?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilmour:</B> Mr. Speaker, of course there is a cost. CMHC has 
nearly 3,000 employees. They are not counting the cost of running 
the operation. A private insurance company does not have that cost. 
The cost to the Canadian people is clearly there.
<P>
	I have difficulty with a member's comments earlier when she 
said there really was not any cost to the government. She said they 
were going into areas that were not viable. They cannot have both. 
It is either viable and we are making a profit, or if CMHC is going 
in there and it is not viable somebody is losing money. Guess who? 
It is the Canadian people.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Beaches-Woodbine, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member across has made a great to-do about what it costs 
the government but he has not told us what that is. Perhaps we 
should put some facts on the table.
<P>
	Concerning the CMHC's mortgage insurance fund, the 
premiums charged by the corporation in addition to the value of the 
property assist in covering the liability. That is why the fund has 
been more than self-sustaining. It has thus far returned $55 million 
to the government. The fact of the matter is that it is 
self-sustaining. It has not cost us.
<P>
	We should have figures on the table when accusatory statements 
are made.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilmour:</B> Mr. Speaker, I guess any accountant can make 
figures talk and I can certainly talk to members opposite.
<P>
	CMHC has been self-sustaining in the past few years. It was 
losing buckets of money until it got its house in order. If there is a 
downturn in interest rates it will cost us more buckets of money. 
Clearly they are talking out of both sides of their faces.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, is the hon. 
member aware that approximately one-third of the housing stock in 
the country has been built with the assistance of National Housing 
Act insured financing? In other words, without this kind of 
financing, one-third of the houses with all the benefits and all the 
spinoff effects they had for the economy would not have been built.
<P>
	Is the member for Comox-Alberni aware that 3,944 of his 
constituents have purchased homes using funds insured by CMHC 
since 1992? Is he aware that 917 of his constituents have purchased 
homes taking advantage of CMHC's first home loan insurance 
program since 1992?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilmour:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member is absolutely correct. 
However the bill increases the numbers. We are saying the $100 
billion already in the pot created the  numbers the member just 
stated. They are absolutely correct.
<P>
	We are opposed to increasing that amount by another $50 billion. 
We are not opposed to having the $100 billion or CMHC doing 
business as it is presently doing. We are opposed to increasing the 
liability limit.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, coming from downtown Toronto I 
have to stand to defend the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation vigorously. It represents in the greater Toronto area 
not just support for those in the home building industry. It also 
sends a signal of confidence to all other sectors of the economy, 
from the carpet makers to the makers of stoves, refrigerators and 
the various accoutrements that go into putting a home or an 
apartment together. Quite frankly those spinoffs have an effect on 
every region of the country.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	When we calculate the contribution of Canada Mortgage and 
Housing we must not forget its contribution to all spinoffs in the 
economy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilmour:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
comment. It is agreed that CMHC is a benefit to the economy, 
absolutely. We do not dispute that. The difficulty we have is upping 
the ante.
<P>
	We recognize where CMHC has been and will continue to be. To 
this point in time it is fine. The country is broke. Right now we 
cannot see increasing the ante by $50 billion. We think it 
inappropriate at this point in time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as my 
colleagues know, the purpose of the bill is to increase the ceiling 
for mortgage loan insurance under the National Housing Act. This 
will enable Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation to continue 
underwriting home mortgage loan insurance within the legislative 
limit.
<P>
	The bill is an administrative bill. Bill C-108 will increase the 
existing limit on outstanding loan insurance from the current $100 
billion to $150 billion. The bill also includes a provision to increase 
the ceiling further through appropriation in the future.
<P>
	Members of the House should know that CMHC loan insurance 
is self-financing and self-sustaining and does not cost the 
government anything. Moreover, it has great benefits for the 
country.
<P>
	The mortgage insurance fund is regularly evaluated according to 
rigorous insurance principles. It is fully adequate to cover all 
insured losses as well as all overhead.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16290"> 16290 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The amendments in this bill deal with administrative matters, 
but they must be adopted to allow the CMHC to continue to provide 
mortgage insurance. Allow me to explain briefly how important 
this bill is for Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The desire to own a home remains strong among Canadians. Yet 
many people who can afford the monthly mortgage payments are 
still unable to access home ownership because they are finding it 
difficult to save for a down payment for conventional loans.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Because the CMHC assumes the risks if borrowers fail to meet 
their obligations, approved mortgage lenders can loan money to 
more Canadians. By reducing the down payment required to buy a 
house, the loan insurance program allows more middle income 
households to have access to home ownership. This is an essential 
element of the system to ensure that all Canadians, wherever they 
live, can have the same access to the mortgage loans they need to 
buy adequate and affordable housing.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let me give an idea of the extent to which Canadians depend on 
mortgage loan insurance to fulfil their dream of owning a home. 
My colleagues may be interested to learn that this means 
approximately 40 per cent of the residential mortgage stock in 
Canada involved financing by CMHC mortgage insurance last 
year.
<P>
	Without mortgage loan insurance Canadians who do not have a 
25 per cent down payment would generally never have access to 
home ownership.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The CMHC mortgage loan insurance has already proven flexible 
enough to allow for innovative housing financing. This is an 
essential feature given the constant evolution of borrowers' needs 
and of the markets meeting these needs.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	In 1987, the program was modified to insure junior mortgage 
loans, an innovation especially helpful to those needing additional 
funds for renovations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the following year the chattel loan insurance program was 
introduced as a five-year experiment to cover loans made on 
mobile homes and to help people who choose this kind of 
affordable home ownership. The coverage for mobile homes has 
now been made a regular part of the mortgage insurance program 
as per the announcement made by the minister responsible for the 
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation at the beginning of this 
year.
<P>
	In 1992 the mortgage insurance program was expanded to 
accommodate a reduced down payment for first time homebuyers, 
making home ownership even more accessible to moderate income 
households. This program, called the first home loan insurance 
program, has provided Canadians with their entry point to home 
ownership. Again I reiterate to my hon. colleagues that the success 
of the initiative has been achieved without cost to the government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We want to ensure that the CMHC can continue to provide this 
assistance to the housing market. This is the intent of the bill before 
us today. The CMHC is constantly reviewing and making regular 
changes to the mortgage loan program in order to make it more 
effective and convenient for both approved lenders and home 
buyers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	By exploring new housing finance options for Canadians, we are 
looking to promote greater choices, lower the cost, increase 
accessibility of housing finance and assist borrowers to meet their 
financing needs within their own resources.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The CMHC will continue to encourage innovation and creativity 
in residential financing through the mortgage insurance fund, in 
order to improve access to home ownership for all Canadians.
<P>
	The private housing market is now in a position to meet the 
needs of the vast majority of Canadian households. There is no 
question that the CMHC mortgage loan insurance played a crucial 
role in this achievement. The CMHC mortgage loan insurance 
program had a record year in 1994 in terms of volume. Several 
unexpected factors led to a significant increase in activity last year. 
Mortgage interest rates fell to their lowest level in 30 years, a level 
that was much lower than expected. The low inflation rate kept 
house prices stable and affordable. In addition, the rapid, consistent 
success of incentive policies, including the loan insurance program 
for home buyers and the home buyers' plan, helped generate a 
record level of insurance activity last year.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	When the Mortgage Insurance Company of Canada stopped 
underwriting new mortgage insurance business in April 1993, 
CMHC had to assume 100 per cent of residential mortgage 
insurance activity. Furthermore a greater proportion of all 
mortgages has been insured by CMHC in recent years. In 1994, 
CMHC insured 40 per cent of all residential mortgages initiated, up 
from 22 per cent in 1991.
<P>
	Because there is some lag time between insuring loans and 
receiving the reports from approved lenders, it was  only in 1995 
that the figures for 1994 were all compiled. At that time it was 
realized that the $100 billion maximum aggregate loan insurance 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16291"> 16291 </A></B>
<P>
currently stipulated in the NHA had been exceeded. For this reason, 
provisions of the bill are effective starting in 1994.
<P>
<B>(1100 )</B>
<P>
	I hope members will see fit to give swift passage to Bill C-108 so 
that CMHC can continue to promote access to home ownership 
through mortgage loan insurance.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Through its mortgage loan insurance program, CMHC continues 
to make housing more accessible for Canadians. The Corporation is 
also working to improve housing affordability. Through CMHC, 
the federal government is committed to a stable supply of 
affordable and accessible housing that increases economic 
opportunities for all Canadians.
<P>
	CMHC's market housing programs promote affordable housing 
and equal access to financing through financial instruments such as 
mortgage loan insurance.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Moreover, CMHC provides mortgage insurance to all 
Canadians, regardless of where they live, at the smallest feasible 
down payment and the lowest cost.
<P>
	To improve access to an affordable form of housing, CMHC also 
provides mortgage insurance for manufactured houses and mobile 
homes. In January of this year the hon. David Dingwall announced 
an expanded chattel loan insurance program, CLIP, that includes a 
resale of manufactured housing units.
<P>
	CMHC is also contributing to making housing more affordable 
through better housing regulations. The affordability and choice 
today program funded by CMHC encourages regulatory innovation 
in municipalities across Canada. The ACT program encourages the 
housing industry and municipalities to work in partnership to 
improve housing affordability and choice.
<P>
	More than 80 ACT projects are developing a wide range of 
practical approaches to streamlining approval processes, 
developing new forms of affordable housing, facilitating in-fill and 
conversion and adopting alternative development and building 
standards.
<P>
	As I have said, Bill C-108 is an administrative bill. As my 
colleagues know, the bill is important in ensuring CMHC can 
continue to offer mortgage loan insurance to Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to take a few minutes to talk about a complementary 
initiative, first home loan insurance, introduced by CMHC in 
February 1992, to make home ownership even more accessible.
<P>
	Earlier this year, the hon. David Dingwall announced that the 
maximum eligible house prices-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> When referring to another 
member in the Chamber we basically have two options, either by 
riding or by portfolio. I know sometimes there can be omissions 
but the same name has come up more than once already. Therefore 
I simply remind the hon. member for Halifax West.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Regan:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for that reminder. I 
apologize for the error.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Earlier this year, the Minister of Public Works announced that 
the maximum eligible house prices for first home loan insurance 
were increased in 30 communities across the country. This 
initiative allows more first time homebuyers to purchase a home 
with a down payment of as little as five per cent. Anyone who buys 
or builds a home in Canada as their principal residence is eligible 
for the lower down payment, as long as they have not owned a 
home at any time during the last five years.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	First home loan insurance was initially in effect for a two-year 
period but was extended for an additional five years until 1999. The 
5 per cent down initiative has been a major success in helping to 
increase home ownership in Canada. That speaks for itself as to the 
importance of the bill.
<P>
<B>(1105 )</B>
<P>
	The statistics also speak for themselves. Since November 1993 
over 210,000 Canadian households have taken advantage of the 
lower down payment to become the proud owners of either a new 
or existing home. In April 1994 a survey of Canadians who bought 
a home with less than 10 per cent down showed that 72 per cent of 
them would not have been able to purchase their home when they 
did without the reduced down payment. That says a lot.
<P>
	The first home loan insurance initiative is constantly being 
monitored to ensure it continues to meet the needs of Canadians. 
CMHC is committed to helping Canadians who desire to own a 
home and who have the proven financial management capability to 
do so. First home loan insurance is an excellent example of 
CMHC's ability to adapt its mortgage loan insurance activity to 
ensure Canadians can enjoy the benefits of home ownership.
<P>
	As I have stated, Bill C-108 is an administrative bill to facilitate 
the continuation of mortgage loan insurance under the National 
Housing Act. CMHC's mortgage loan insurance, which provides 
relatively equal access to Canadians throughout the country, is 
important to achieving that goal. This is one of the major factors  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16292"> 16292 </A></B>
<P>
which distinguishes CMHC's operation from private mortgage loan 
insurance operations.
<P>
	Without CMHC's commitment to providing mortgage loan 
insurance in the small communities of the country, places that 
private insurers have not traditionally wanted to serve, many 
Canadians might not be able to buy a home.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Our government knows just how much Canadians value home 
ownership. It represents a major portion of the wealth accumulated 
by households. For some, it is a source of retirement income. It is 
also an important component of quality of life. We believe that 
every Canadian should have access to home ownership. CMHC 
mortgage loan insurance can turn the dream of owning a home into 
a reality. It is therefore critical that CMHC be able to continue to 
provide mortgage loan insurance to Canadians now and in the 
future.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That is why I support Bill C-108 and why I hope my colleagues 
will see fit to give swift passage to this administrative bill so that 
CMHC can continue to help Canadians realize their dreams of 
owning a home.
<P>
	The concept of home speaks to our basic human needs. Home is 
a place where people feel secure. Owning a home gives people a 
stake in their communities and a sense of belonging. Home 
ownership is a concept the people of Canada support. It is therefore 
essential that CMHC be able to continue to provide mortgage loan 
insurance to Canadians today and in the future.
<P>
	The corporation's mortgage loan insurance has traditionally 
demonstrated the flexibility to respond to varying needs and must 
be maintained as a public policy instrument capable of evolving to 
meet the future housing needs of Canadians.
<P>
	With an eye on these future needs, CMHC is currently working 
to develop a variety of new housing finance instruments made 
possible by innovative uses of mortgage loan insurance. In 
developing new products CMHC is looking to challenge the 
creativity of the financial community to ensure the largest possible 
number of borrowers can find a product in their marketplace to 
meet their precise needs. A variety of choices will encourage 
lenders to compete on the basis of services and product 
differentiation.
<P>
	The financial environment in which CMHC's mortgage loan 
insurance business operates has undergone significant change in 
recent years. The introduction of one stop financial services, the 
increased use of technological systems to support business 
operations, and the need to manage expenditures and facilitate 
better risk management are all factors which have had an impact on 
the way CMHC runs its mortgage insurance operations.
<P>
	CMHC is now focusing on introducing new processing 
mechanisms which will utilize the capabilities of electronic 
communications between CMHC and approved lender clients. 
These enhancements will allow the corporation to better serve the 
needs of Canadian housing consumers. In light of all these good 
arguments, I urge passage of the bill.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member said if the bill is turned down, CMHC will not be able to 
continue to operate. That is simply not true.
<P>
	CMHC will still have the hundred billion dollars it has had for 
years to operate. This bill is about increasing that limit. It is not 
about whether CMHC operates or not. I believe there is an attempt 
by members on the other side to make it appear that if this bill fails, 
all mortgages across Canada will collapse. That is not true.
<P>
	In the event of a collapse in the market, as in the early eighties, 
and if CMHC will not cost Canadians any money, in the event of a 
downturn, who picks up the tab on these defaulted mortgages?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Regan:</B> Mr. Speaker, the first question is what will it mean 
to Canadians if the mortgage insurance fund is capped at $100 
billion. That is the point. We have a delay in the time between when 
mortgages are approved by local lenders and when we get the full 
figures for a year. We need to have it retroactive to 1994 to cover 
the fact that in that year there were more than $100 million worth 
of loans insured. That would be a huge problem for CMHC.
<P>
	The other important point is what it would mean to Canadians if 
it were capped at that level. CMHC's ability to assist Canadians to 
access home ownership would be curtailed dramatically. It would 
mean that the 3,944 Canadians in the riding of the member for 
Comox-Alberni would be the last to achieve home ownership 
through these means. It also would mean that rural Canadians 
would be faced with even more obstacles when planning to 
purchase a home.
<P>
	We can look at all the negatives and talk about the collapse of the 
economy. We would be in all kinds of problems if we had a huge 
collapse of the economy in any event. We have to look at the 
important role CMHC plays in building our country, in building 
home ownership, in building our housing stock and in helping the 
economy. If we can expand the amount of home ownership 
insurance CMHC can provide, we can expand the amount of 
housing activity.
<P>
	I do not know about the member's riding but in my riding and in 
my region of Atlantic Canada, and I think across most of Canada, 
there is a need for increased activity in the housing sector. There 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16293"> 16293 </A></B>
<P>
are real problems in that sector. People need to have a shot in the 
arm. This will help not only that whole sector, which will boost the  
economy, but it will help people who want to own their own homes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister indicated that not 
only would this legislation not cost the government any money, 
that is, increasing the ceiling on the mortgage insurance, but that 
there is a return to the government. That is important.
<P>
	The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister also indicated 
that this kind of initiative permits the enhancement to the quality of 
life for Canadians because it ensures that additional housing is 
available, thereby creating jobs. We all know that appropriate 
lodging is a basic fundamental plank in the quality of life for not 
only Canadians but people throughout the world.
<P>
	I find that rather interesting and it is important that we look at 
that very carefully and embrace that kind of concept, an initiative 
which will ensure that the quality of life for Canadians is enhanced 
through pieces of legislation such as this one.
<P>
<B>(1115 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Regan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I certainly agree with the hon. 
parliamentary secretary that this program permits us to enhance the 
quality of life of Canadians.
<P>
	If we want to recognize what the quality of life means in terms of 
housing all we have to do is leave our country and go to many other 
countries in the world. In June I had the opportunity to visit Haiti as 
an election observer with the OAS. I certainly got a real 
appreciation of how fortunate we are to have the kind of housing 
we have and what it really means to quality of life when I saw the 
kind of housing that exists in Haiti.
<P>
	Haiti is the poorest country in this hemisphere. It is not by any 
means the only country in the world with a lower standard of 
housing than we have. In fact, the vast majority of the world's 
inhabitants do not have the quality of life and quality of housing 
that we enjoy. Some do not even come close.
<P>
	It is very important to recognize that this measure of expanding 
the loan insurance of CMHC is critical to the quality of life of 
Canadians. It is important for the housing industry in terms of job 
creation.
<P>
	When I was in Haiti I saw houses that had dirt floors. Imagine 
the problems with disease and insects. There were houses that did 
not have facilities which we consider proper in Canada such as 
indoor plumbing. We are very fortunate to the ability to expand a 
program like CMHC which will add benefits to Canadians and to 
an important resource such as our housing stock.
<P>
	When I visited Haiti I was struck by the many problems of 
extended families living in a house which would be the size of a 
small room in a normal Canadian house and how that affected their 
quality of life. It was  really a shock. We often hear about people 
facing cultural shock when they visit foreign countries. Well, I 
certainly experienced it. When I came back to Canada it made me 
much more aware of how fortunate we are to live in this great 
country and to have the opportunity to live in good quality homes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am amazed at how the member can avoid the question 
we are asking. The member went through all this rhetoric, made all 
these comparisons between Canada and Haiti as if the Liberals 
somehow can take credit for the standard of living that we enjoy.
<P>
	We have posed a question, which I will pose again to the 
member. Who is left with the tab? Who is going to be on the hook 
for $150 billion if the economy turns down? If we go into hard 
times, who is going to be responsible for the billions of dollars in 
defaulted payments if this goes on?
<P>
	The member has avoided that question. He has to answer the 
question before the debate can conclude.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Regan:</B> Mr. Speaker, it concerns me that members opposite 
have so little confidence in the economy of Canada. However, they 
should be aware that the mortgage fund insurance is actuarially 
sound. It returns money each year to the government which helps 
provide for any problems which may occur in the process. There 
are funds provided each year for non-repayment of loans.
<P>
	If the situation arose where Canadians defaulted on $150 billion 
in mortgages, imagine what would happen to the banks across the 
country. It is somewhat like saying, why should we have banks 
because they may fail if people do not repay their loans. How can 
we trust putting our money in the banks because if people do not 
repay their mortgages, they will all fail? That is true also. We have 
to operate on certain assumptions that we will have good growth 
and an economy that works.
<P>
	I am sure the hon. member will listen to my answer. We cannot 
assume the whole economy of the country is going to collapse 
tomorrow. We have to operate on cautious and reasonable 
assumptions. We have to take precautions. We are taking 
precautions with this bill. It is actuarially sound. It provides funds 
for failures and it is in good shape.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	More important, it is interesting to me that the members opposite 
want to look at all the possible problems while ignoring the 
benefits of this very important program.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am really pleased to have the 
opportunity to speak in support of Bill C-108, an act to amend the 
National Housing Act. I am pleased for two reasons, one because it 
is timely.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16294"> 16294 </A></B>
<P>
	Yesterday in my riding, I went to a conference of the BCNPHA 
which is a group of diverse peoples. They are people who are 
disabled, who have low incomes, who have moderate incomes. 
They have come together to talk about ways in which they could 
afford housing in Vancouver which is a city in which housing has 
gone off the map. Some of these people can never hope of owning 
a home. Because of this legislation there is hope for those people.
<P>
	The second reason is that as a physician, I know that housing is a 
key component of the social structure that enables Canadians to 
have a positive health status, not only for the physical reason that 
housing is important to the health status of people but also because 
of the psychological and sociological reasons. It enables people to 
have hope, to have a stake in the future and to be able to say that 
they are contributing to the economy.
<P>
	As everyone has said before, this is an administrative bill, the 
purpose of which is to increase the ceiling on CMHC mortgage 
loan insurance from the current $100 billion to $150 billion.
<P>
	Members of the House should know that CMHC loan insurance 
is self-financing and self-sustaining. I speak those words slowly 
and to stress them so that they can actually be heard. It does not 
cost the government anything.
<P>
	Not only is it a sound and healthy fund, but CMHC's mortgage 
loan insurance has played and continues to play a role in helping 
Canadians to access home ownership. Home ownership, members 
have heard said here this morning, is a cherished dream held not 
only by Canadians but by all peoples. There are good reasons for 
this.
<P>
	Home equity is a major portion of the wealth that is accumulated 
by households as well as being a source of retirement savings. The 
concept of home speaks to our basic human needs. Home speaks to 
security. Home speaks to health. Owning a home gives people a 
stake in the community and a sense of belonging. Home ownership 
is a concept the people of Canada support. It is therefore critical 
that CMHC be able to continue to provide mortgage loan insurance 
to Canadians today and in the future.
<P>
	It sounds as if there is a certain amount of repetition in some of 
these speeches. The repetition is so that the message can be put 
clearly both to the people of Canada and maybe to some of the 
members of the third party across the way. Since November 1993, 
210,000 low income Canadians who did not have the down 
payment were able to own their own homes because of this 
program.
<P>
	One of the most important aspects of CMHC's mortgage loan 
insurance is that it provides relatively equal access to mortgage 
financing at the lowest possible cost for all Canadians. This is what 
we heard from those  210,000 people who since November 1993, 
regardless of where in Canada they live, bought homes. It speaks to 
the national context of this bill.
<P>
	Surpluses that are generated from lower risk businesses are used 
to fund shortfalls on the higher risk businesses. That is a basic 
economic equation that I am sure most people who know business, 
who have taken risk on business and who have had businesses in 
the past, and I am sure many members of the third party across the 
floor know that, that lower risk businesses are used to fund 
shortfalls of higher risk businesses.
<P>
	That is a principle of any insurance program. Without access to 
CMHC's mortgage loan insurance, Canadians in some parts of the 
country would have to provide the conventional 25 per cent of the 
value of a house as the down payment that the private sector 
charges. Needless to say, many Canadians would find it difficult to 
purchase a home if this were the case.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	CMHC's mortgage insurance is therefore critical to helping 
Canadians access home ownership. It has long been recognized that 
the housing needs of Canadians have been financed and supported 
by CMHC over the years, not only for one group of people, but for 
various income sectors and for diverse groups of people.
<P>
	The corporation's mortgage loan insurance has traditionally 
demonstrated the flexibility to respond to varying needs. In other 
words, there is a performance level we can mark here. I would like 
to take this opportunity to inform the House about one such 
example that has helped hundreds of Canadians realize an 
affordable home ownership dream and that is the manufactured 
housing or mobile home industry. It has contributed greatly to 
giving Canadians access to good quality affordable housing, not to 
mention the fact that it helps jump start the economy in terms of the 
manufacture of mobile homes.
<P>
	CMHC has been working in partnership with the manufactured 
housing industry for many years because of its importance to the 
housing sector and to the economy of Canada as a whole.
<P>
	Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation introduced its 
chattel loan insurance program which some members have 
mentioned. Known as CLIP, it was a five-year experiment that 
began in 1988. The two objectives of the CLIP program were first, 
to improve access to alternative forms of affordable housing 
without involving government expenditure and second, to help 
place manufactured homes in a more competitive position with 
conventionally built homes.
<P>
	CMHC completed an evaluation of the CLIP program last year. 
This is another component when we talk about whether something 
is working or whether we are taking a risk. We not only look at 
performance but we also go back and evaluate the performance in a 
quantitative way.  The evaluation confirmed that the program is an 
important instrument in increasing access to good quality 
affordable housing without involving government expenditure.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16295"> 16295 </A></B>
<P>
	The evaluation also confirmed that CLIP has a positive impact 
on the manufactured housing industry. There is another issue. Jobs 
are being created not only in the manufactured housing industry but 
in mobile home park development, so economic development 
results as well.
<P>
	Following the results of the evaluation, the minister responsible 
for CMHC was pleased to announce an expansion of the CLIP 
program. As a result, it now includes both new and resale mobile 
manufactured homes.
<P>
	CLIP is an affordable alternative for many of the approximately 
335,000 moderate income rental households that could not 
previously afford to purchase a mobile home. CMHC and the 
manufactured housing industry have enjoyed a productive 
partnership for many years. They have been working together to 
help Canadians gain access to good quality affordable housing and 
to enhance the viability of the whole industry.
<P>
	The enhancements to the CLIP program are leading to greater 
access to mobile homes and an affordable option for Canadians. I 
want to stress again, and it may sound repetitive, but this not only 
gives moderate income and low income Canadians access to 
homes, but it jump starts the economy. It continues the economy 
and jobs, the flow of capital. All of that goes on, which is what 
makes this country move ahead.
<P>
	This is only one example of how NHA mortgage insurance has 
met a specific need. It explains why NHA mortgage insurance must 
be maintained as a public policy instrument that is capable of being 
flexible and evolving. We have seen how the CLIP program has 
evolved to meet the future needs of Canadians.
<P>
	With an eye on these future needs, CMHC is currently working 
to develop a variety of new housing finance instruments made 
possible by innovative uses of mortgage loan insurance. I want to 
talk about that flexibility, creativity and innovation, where CMHC 
not only sets up policy but it sets a policy after it has talked to the 
consumer, after it has talked and worked with the private sector to 
bring about innovative ways of creating housing.
<P>
	In developing new products, CMHC is looking to challenge the 
creativity of the financial community and to ensure that the largest 
possible number of borrowers can find a product in the marketplace 
to meet their precise needs. That is flexibility and that is 
innovation. A variety of choices will encourage lenders to compete 
on the basis of service and product differentiation.
<P>
	The financial environment in which CMHC's mortgage loan 
insurance business operates has undergone significant changes in 
recent years. For instance, the  introduction of one stop financial 
services, the need to manage expenditures and the need for better 
risk management are all factors which have an impact on the way in 
which CMHC runs its mortgage insurance operations. It also 
speaks of the ability to be accountable. Change and making sure 
factors like managing and assessing risk are important components 
in any business venture.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	CMHC has responded to the changing environment by 
continually reviewing its processes for delivering mortgage 
insurance and introducing efficiencies. Ensuring CMHC's loan 
insurance is viable is extremely important.
<P>
	CMHC is now focusing on the use of electronic communications 
between itself and approved lender clients. These enhancements 
will allow the corporation to serve the needs of Canadian housing 
consumers even more effectively. Mortgage loan insurance has 
played a significant public policy role in the past and with CMHC 
stewardship, it will continue to evolve to meet the changing needs 
of Canadians and the financial community.
<P>
	I underline at this time for members of the House that not only is 
the CMHC mortgage loan insurance a self-financing operation that 
involves no federal subsidies, CMHC has also returned to the 
Government of Canada over $1 billion since its incorporation. In 
addition, in the year 1992, CMHC returned $55 million to the 
Canadian taxpayer directly from the mortgage insurance fund. 
CMHC does not only provide access for various and diverse groups 
of housing. It also provides jobs, stimulates the economy and puts 
money into the treasury.
<P>
	I will address some of the questions that surfaced with my hon. 
colleagues in debate last Friday respecting CMHC, namely 
questions concerning the federal government's role in public 
housing. I remind hon. members that notwithstanding severe 
financial constraints, the government is continuing its expenditures 
to help society's most vulnerable citizens.
<P>
	The federal government is very much concerned with the shelter 
needs of low income Canadians. The federal government is making 
considerable ongoing social housing expenditures of about $2 
billion a year to support more than 661,000 needy households, 
notwithstanding the need for considerable fiscal restraint and the 
need for deficit reduction.
<P>
	The commitment of resources by the federal government is 
indicative of the government's concern for the plight of society's 
most vulnerable members: seniors on fixed income, aboriginal 
people, persons with disabilities, single parent families, social 
assistance recipients and the working poor. These people also need  
to have some investment in Canada, some piece of equity, some 
dignity.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16296"> 16296 </A></B>
<P>
	The 1995 federal budget struck a balance of the dual objectives 
of reducing the size of the federal deficit, thereby contributing to 
economic growth, and at the same time making social housing 
programs more fiscally sustainable over the long term.
<P>
	In its first budget in 1994 the government announced that it 
would reinstate RRAP, the residential rehabilitation assistance 
program, for two years. The program assists in the upgrading of 
substandard housing. We are taking existing housing stock which is 
recyclable and using a $100 million commitment which also fulfils 
a red book promise. We are taking housing stock and putting 
money into fixing it and making it reusable.
<P>
	The government has also provided for new rental and rooming 
house components of RRAP, $16 million for 1994-95 to repair 
approximately 2,500 rental and rooming house units. These 
programs are being delivered in 1995. I must say that in my riding 
there are rooming houses for some of the very poor that I would not 
want a dog or a rat to live in, although many rats already live there.
<P>
	New commitments under the on reserve housing programs have 
continued. As well the federal action on family violence has been 
extended to March 31, 1996. Some $4 million is being provided to 
help address the shelter needs of women and children who are 
victims of family violence. This again is what we talk about when 
we talk about health and justice. Women and children who are the 
victims of family violence and various forms of abuse need a safe 
place to live.
<P>
	Therefore CMHC is not only engaged in access to housing, jobs 
and the economy. It is also responding to a social need.
<P>
<B>(1135 )</B>
<P>
	We will continue to work with all levels of government, the 
private sector and community groups in a co-operative partnership. 
Partnership is one of the things the government said it would 
embark on, and we are doing it.
<P>
	One way we are accomplishing it is through the CMHC's 
Canadian Centre for Public-Private Partnerships in Housing. The 
partnership centre was established in 1991. Its objective is to 
bridge the public and private sectors to facilitate the production of 
cost effective and accessible housing for low to moderate income 
households, including those with special needs.
<P>
	We say that government cannot do everything for everyone so 
we are asking how the government can work with and help the 
private sector to move along and do the things we want done. Also 
there are essential ventures into new areas through such means as 
innovative financing and tenure arrangements. Much of the 
centre's  activities are accomplished at the grassroots level with a 
view to encouraging a wide variety of people active in their 
community to become involved in newly created housing 
partnerships.
<P>
	The partnership centre identifies opportunities and brings 
together potential partners to develop and implement the 
partnerships. It acts as a source of advice by offering an advisory 
service to potential partners to identify the key legal, financial and 
regulatory issues that need to be considered in structuring a 
private-public deal. Since its inception the centre has ventured into 
innovative tenure arrangements such as occupancy rights, life 
leases, equity co-ops and home ownership equity partnership 
programs. At the end of June this year, the centre had facilitated the 
realization of 79 projects totalling in excess of 4,200 housing units.
<P>
	I will take a minute to outline a few innovative projects that have 
been made possible by the new public-private partnership. In my 
riding of Vancouver the Kitsilano Equity Housing Co-operative 
offers affordable housing for families. Equity co-operatives are 
ongoing housing co-ops financed partly from the investment of its 
own members. Traditionally aimed at seniors it is now branching 
out to help many other Canadians.
<P>
	The project demonstrates that it is possible to provide families 
with affordable housing options in a market where starter homes 
are very expensive. This type of project is being made possible 
thanks to this partnership. Clearly the partnership centre is 
working. It was an experiment and we have seen that it is working 
very well.
<P>
	Some may ask, especially members of the third party, why the 
government is involved with mortgage insurance when the private 
industry is offering the same product. The straightforward answer 
is choice. CMHC gives Canadians a choice of mortgage loan 
insurance. Without CMHC, Canadians would only be served by a 
private sector monopoly that can do what it wants with rates and 
down payments. The risks of the monopoly are higher prices and 
fewer choices, making housing less affordable particularly for first 
time buyers. The federal government has a constitutional 
responsibility for banking and for finance. CMHC's mortgage 
insurance guarantees and demonstrates that the federal government 
is fulfilling its role.
<P>
	I have heard members talk about the risk involved. When 
looking at the risk in any business we look at marketplace needs. 
Some 74 per cent of Canadians have said they would like to use the 
program. We then look at past performances and we see that $1 
billion was given back since its inception and $55 million last year. 
This tells us that it is a good business risk.
<P>
	I am pleased with CMHC's efforts in my community. I have 
spoken of the Kitsilano project. There are some senior Kitsilano 
projects. There are projects for single senior women who live 
alone. There are projects in British Columbia that are helping 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16297"> 16297 </A></B>
<P>
Canadians to be able to get a foothold and become contributing 
members of society.
<P>
	In 1994, CMHC's loan insurance helped to house over 300,000 
Canadian families at no cost to the federal government. This is 
because mortgage insurance is self-financing. Most lenders cannot 
provide a mortgage above 75 per cent. The program helps people to 
own homes. The approved lender is able to charge the borrower the 
lowest possible rate of interest. With these insurance provisions 
Canadians will have access to home ownership, to major 
renovations and to rental units.
<P>
<B>(1140 )</B>
<P>
	It not only does that. It creates an opportunity. In the red book we 
talked about creating opportunity. This is creating opportunity for 
Canadians. It levels the playing field. It gives them a piece of the 
Canadian dream. It gives them an economic stake in the country 
and an opportunity to become contributing citizens. It is not just a 
simple act; it is a broad, social and economic move.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
interesting that the government brings a bill before the House to 
increase loan liability not by $50,000 or $50 million but by $50 
billion. Yet it gets insulted and attacks the opposition party for 
questioning what is in the bill.
<P>
	The government is suggesting that Reformers do not like 
affordable housing. That is a shallow argument. Our job is to ask 
why the government is increasing the liability by $50 billion. The 
government had better get used to it, because we will continue to 
ask these kinds of questions. It is about time somebody did. The 
government has been in place for two years and has overspent by 
$80 billion. It is about time somebody asked questions.
<P>
	Every speaker talked about the minister of public works as 
though he came up with an innovative bill to help the country. Part 
of that was a PR exercise for a minister who has been in trouble for 
the last two years. Now that a cabinet shuffle is on the way, they are 
trying to make him look good. That is what this is about.
<P>
	The previous speaker said that it would not cost the government 
anything. In the recession of 1980 when the Liberal government 
was in power, were any liabilities charged against the loss on 
defaulted loans? How much contingent liability is recorded on the 
books of the country for the current $100 billion and the next $150 
billion when the $50 billion is added?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Fry:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to answer that question. 
The very asking of the question, which seems to be the one 
repetitive question the Reform Party asks in spite of the answers 
being given, tells me that members of the third party are really not 
in touch with the people of Canada. They do not understand a 
single thing about the needs of the people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Answer the question.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Fry:</B> If the hon. member will allow me to do so, I will. I 
would like to answer the question.
<P>
	Reform members are not in touch with the people of Canada. 
Seventy-four per cent of Canadians say that the program is 
important because it assists them in buying homes. We are not 
talking about an elite group which thinks that only people with a lot 
of money should be able to own houses.
<P>
	To return to the issue, I mentioned in my speech, and I will 
repeat it, that any insurance program and any insurance company 
base whatever they do on an actuarial risk basis. This has been 
shown on a routine, standard, normal actuarial risk basis to be 
sound. This is not only because of the need in the community for it, 
but over the years since its inception the program has returned $1 
billion to the coffers of the treasury. Just last year alone it returned 
$55 million to the coffers.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	I do not know if I have to speak loudly or clearly or what I have 
to do to get those facts on the table. Maybe repetition is the only 
way to go.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have another question for the member.
<P>
	Insurance exists in the private sector. Insurance is there 
whenever there is the need to protect against some sort of hazard. 
One of the hazards is that occasionally mortgages will be defaulted.
<P>
	It is the belief of Liberal governments that in fact the private 
sector will provide inadequate coverage for such risks, so the 
government has to step in. If in fact the insurance that is being 
provided is profitable then there is no need for the government to 
step in, because the private sector would do it.
<P>
	It is not reasonable at the same time to say it will not cost 
anything, that it is only something we are facilitating in the 
economy and it does not cost anything. If it does not cost anything, 
why is the government doing it? Everyone knows that whenever 
such activities get privatized efficiency goes up and consumers are 
more satisfied. So why is the government in there? It is because it 
is subsidizing an activity.
<P>
	The question then becomes: Why subsidize housing? Why not 
subsidize food, cars? Why not subsidize clothing? There are all 
kinds of things that are essential for human life. We are running out 
of finances in this country. We are going bankrupt.
<P>
	What do we do as we are going bankrupt? We take over a 
function the private sector could provide, but of course it is not 
doing it adequately. It is not giving enough subsidy. So here we are 
creating a program that gives more subsidy to an activity that some 
believe is no more worthy and no less worthy than any other of the 
kinds of things we consume in Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16298"> 16298 </A></B>
<P>
	Is there a prima facie case for the fact that this activity of the 
organization that is having its liabilities raised by $50 billion is 
one that requires a subsidy in the form of contingent liability? 
Could the member please explain to us, since she has studied the 
subject, how big the contingent liability is that Canadians see 
when they look at the annual budget?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Fry:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thought I answered that question before. 
Perhaps I will have to try a different way of getting my message 
across.
<P>
	I want to quickly say that in the riding of the member who asked 
me the first question, 5,580 constituents have in fact purchased 
homes using CMHC funds. Since 1992, 1,663 constituents have 
purchased houses. In the riding of the member who asked me the 
last question, since 1992 some 1,525 constituents have purchased 
homes. Since 1992, 254 have purchased homes by taking 
advantage of the first home loan insurance program. We have here 
a party that professes to represent its constituents. I hope the party 
is representing its constituents here.
<P>
	I want to deal with the issue of default on mortgages. The 
premiums and the fees are actually what allow CMHC in this 
program to continue to subsidize to get this program to work on a 
basis where it brings money back into the system. There is a low 
risk component to this insurance program. The low risk 
component, as is always done in insurance programs, subsidizes 
the high risks so that they balance out. That is the basis on which 
most insurance programs work.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélair:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I see that the hon. 
member has already asked a question of the parliamentary 
secretary and this is not allowable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> So what?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélair:</B> There are rules. Just in case you do not know it, 
there are rules here.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> So your person should ask the 
question? This is the opposition asking the question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> We do not need any more of your guff.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> While this other discussion 
is taking place, the clock is running.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Training 
and Youth), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak in the 
House today in support of Bill C-108, an act to amend the National 
Housing Act.
<P>
	As my colleagues well know, CMHC has an important role to 
play in helping Canadians gain access to ownership. While 
listening to the debate and the questions, I am wondering what is at 
issue here, whether we are discussing the essence of contingent 
liability, as  opposite members referred to it, or whether it is the 
issue of whether they agree with giving access to housing to 
moderate income Canadians. Is that the real issue? Is it the issue of 
subsidization they are interested in weasel wording about, or is it 
that they want to carry on with their right wing agenda and do not 
want to give anything to middle income and poor Canadians? Is 
that the real debate? That is the question we should ask members.
<P>
	In terms of subsidies, a clothing subsidy was mentioned. Well, 
they have a clothing subsidy, a subsidy for the suits for their leader. 
That is interesting.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Your pension would make house payments too.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Blondin-Andrew:</B> I earned it, thank you. I forfeited one 
pension and I am not ashamed to accept my pension.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Another shallow argument.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Blondin-Andrew:</B> What is really shallow here is the debate 
coming from the other side.
<P>
	I want to focus on the issue of CMHC's mortgage loan insurance 
and its mandate to provide equal access to Canadians throughout 
the country. It is important to achieve that goal.
<P>
	As an aside, there is a shortage of housing across the country. 
Some 11,000 units are needed. In my riding I believe 3,400 units 
are needed. There is overcrowding, health problems, young people 
in overcrowded situations where it makes learning and living 
difficult. The safety and security of the person is at risk here. That 
escapes the rhetoric coming from the opposite side.
<P>
	I should also say that there is absolutely nothing wrong with 
having Canadians gain access to housing. That is a real source of 
empowerment. It is a way to give integrity to the family, to the 
individual, and a way for people to build a life in this country, to 
build security and stability. Homeowners across the country 
throughout many decades have said that the main source of 
empowerment is to own a home and build from that home for their 
children.
<P>
	The party opposite says it is family oriented. What is more 
family oriented than owning a home? Reform members talk about 
the value. They call it a shallow argument that home ownership is 
related to family values. Let us think on that one. The weasel 
wording of that one sad opposition member is very shallow and 
indeed is misdirected. People are very well aware of that.
<P>
	CMHC has the unique role of ensuring equal access for 
Canadians throughout the country. It is a major factor that 
distinguishes CMHC's operation from private mortgage loan 
insurance operations.
<P>
	CMHC'S commitment is to provide mortgage loan insurance in 
the small communities of the country, the places private insurers do 
not traditionally want to serve,  such as my riding. In many parts of 
my riding, which is very isolated, and in rural parts of the country 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16299"> 16299 </A></B>
<P>
we do not have access to the banking system. We are right off the 
financial institutional grid.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	Those people are not eligible to get mortgages. Even if they had 
a high income, a moderate income, or double income, they are not 
eligible to get into home ownership in terms of the financial 
institutions. They are not served in that way. That is a fact. In 
places private insurers have not traditionally wanted to serve or 
have not been able to serve, many Canadians might not be able to 
buy a home.
<P>
	Let me illustrate how important CMHC mortgage loan insurance 
is to Canadians in small communities. Take CMHC's loan 
insurance activity in the municipality of Brooks, Alberta, with a 
population of 10,000. In 1994, 137 households were able to access 
home ownership thanks to CMHC's mortgage loan insurance. Take 
for instance the importance to the Northwest Territories, where I 
come from, in terms of home ownership. I guess it is very difficult, 
but looking at the statistics in the Northwest Territories, 660 loans 
were let out and were insured to $110 million. These are for people 
who want to own their homes.
<P>
	Under the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation assistance 
program, in August 1995 CMHC accepted as equity grants 
provided under the NWT's down payment assistance program. This 
helped families who could afford the ongoing operating and 
maintenance cost of home ownership and purchasing their own 
homes. Since its introduction, 24 families have purchased their 
own homes. It is very significant for our population of 72,000 
people to have loans that were given to that many people so they 
would be able to move into their own homes.
<P>
	In fact there is one other special need you could look at: the 
underwriting on federal lands reserved for Indians. This is an issue 
that should really get the opposite members hot under the collar. 
Anything for Indians would be almost not spoken of or forbidden.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Oh, come off it. Give your head a shake.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Blondin-Andrew:</B> In October 1995, CMHC provided 
mortgage loan insurance-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. There is no doubt that 
any debate can raise some very strong views and strong emotions, 
but in the best tradition of this 35th Parliament I would remind 
members to direct all their interventions through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Blondin-Andrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, through you to my 
colleagues in the House, there is an underwriting on federal lands 
reserved for Indians. In October 1995 for instance, CMHC 
provided mortgage loan insurance to an operating company of the 
Yellowknife Dene band so it could access bank financing to build a 
10-unit apartment  building on federal land reserved for Indians. 
The apartments will be occupied by low income families and the 
operating costs of the project will be subsidized by the NWT 
Housing Corporation. That is a fact.
<P>
	Many of those communities do not have access to those financial 
institutions. They are looking at innovative ways of getting housing 
for those people. There are 34 housing units that are needed in the 
north.
<P>
	The south does not have the inclement weather and the harsh 
climate we have, nor the heating costs we have. Maybe they do in 
some of the northern parts of the provinces. Really, look at the 
opportunities these people have carved out for themselves to 
empower their people, to enable their people to become 
independent and self-sustaining. One of the first ways they look at 
is home ownership, by building that infrastructure and making it 
possible for people to own their own homes.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	This year, as of September 30, going back to the community of 
Brooks, Alberta, 153 households became proud homeowners 
thanks again to the mortgage insurance funds. Make no mistake, if 
CMHC were not in the mortgage loan insurance business 290 
families in Brooks, Alberta might not have been able to buy their 
homes. These 290 households represent 83 per cent of the total 
number of households, 349, that bought homes in Brooks, Alberta 
during that period.
<P>
	The government knows how much Canadians value home 
ownership. Home ownership has always been valued at the 
community level. The first thing the settlers of this country did was 
build a home. Many were eventually able to get assistance from the 
banks and their communities to do joint projects to build homes. 
That is the way it was done and there was nothing wrong with that. 
Home ownership is much valued as the Canadian way. It is a source 
of retirement income for some. It is the one thing they may hang 
their hat on and feel security from. It is also an important 
component of quality of life.
<P>
	We believe every Canadian should have access to home 
ownership. CMHC's mortgage loan insurance can turn the dream 
of owning a home into a reality. It is therefore critical that CMHC 
be able to continue to provide mortgage loan insurance to 
Canadians now and in the future. That is why I support Bill C-108. 
I hope my colleagues will see fit to give swift passage to the bill so 
that CMHC can continue to help Canadians realize their dream of 
owning a home.
<P>
	There is an abundance of ideas out there, but many challenges 
befall Canadians who are isolated or in remote areas or who are not 
in the high income brackets and who face many fiscal challenges. 
Those people need help from various levels of government and 
organizations.
<P>
	There are so many things that happen but when it comes right 
down to it we can talk in technical terms and  be very abstract. We 
can talk about the whole fisc and all that but when it boils right 
down to it we are talking about the quality of life for people. The 
real meaningful essence of this is that people have access to homes, 
that they are able to own their own home and build a life for their 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16300"> 16300 </A></B>
<P>
children and themselves; real security and in practical terms, 
stability.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Chuck is next.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Members can flip a coin if they want but 
right now it is the member for Fraser Valley West.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is interesting 
that with the previous speaker I asked how much of a contingent 
liability is recorded on the books and how much the government 
lost by loan guarantees in the eighties recession. The answer, which 
was passed down to the member from the lobby, was that there 
were people in my riding who took advantage of a CMHC approved 
loan. That is the answer to those two questions.
<P>
	I presume therefore the member is suggesting that because 
people in my riding took advantage of a CMHC approved loan I 
should be in favour of increasing the loan liability from $100 
billion to $150 billion. There is more logic. It boggles the mind 
where some of these shallow arguments are coming from.
<P>
	When this legislation was brought in one person in opposition 
spoke to it. Since then it has been all Liberal members speaking to 
their own bill. The reason is there is no legislative agenda from 
over there whatsoever. For a country that has overspent in the last 
two years by $80 billion, for a country $566 billion in debt, for a 
country where crime is very serious, one would think there would 
be a legislative agenda. But no, what we have are Liberal MPs 
talking to the bill and nobody on the other side making speeches to 
it. I think it is a disgrace.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	My question to the member is the same as to the previous 
speaker. Surely she can get an answer from the lobby on this. How 
much of a contingent liability is recorded on the books of the 
government?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Blondin-Andrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, to the hon. member, and I 
am a little doubtful about the hon. part-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. secretary of state will withdraw 
that statement immediately.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Blondin-Andrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, I withdraw it.
<P>
	The hon. member fundamentally asks whether the MIF is in 
trouble. Is this an additional $50 billion liability to the federal 
government? The mortgage insurance premiums charged by 
CMHC are sufficient to meet the risk being assumed at no cost to 
the government.
<P>
	The viability of CMHC's mortgage insurance fund is assessed 
annually by an independent actuary. An actuarial evaluation of the 
fund as of September 30, 1994 has confirmed its long term 
solvency.
<P>
	The member is creating a worst case scenario that is not justified 
by the facts. Government members have explained again and again 
that CMHC charges premiums that cover the risk. The fund is 
sound and has helped thousands of Canadians.
<P>
	The real liability is the sense of uncaring, the sense of indelicacy 
on the part of this member, not caring that people of moderate 
incomes have access to home ownership. That is the real liability. 
If past governments had taken that attitude, nobody would own a 
home today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> You do not know what you are 
talking about.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Blondin-Andrew:</B> You think you know what you are talking 
about, you idiot.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, we have a real problem here.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> On a point of order, the hon. member for 
Fraser Valley West. The Speaker seems to have walked in on an 
interesting discussion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can appreciate 
debate in the House. Whether they like it or not, it is going to 
happen. However, this is the second time now and I would like the 
member to retract the word idiot.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Blondin-Andrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member himself has 
hurled many abuses across the floor. We have sustained them. We 
have taken them but I can be honourable enough to retract the word 
idiot as I referred to the member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the hon. member's speech. I did catch what she talked 
about, the importance of home ownership in Canada, which many 
of us believe in. It is important for many reasons, whether for 
enhancing the family, sense of ownership, pride and so on.
<P>
	She mentioned the necessity for CMHC to be involved 
specifically in lending money to build homes on native reserves. I 
agree with the member it is very important for people to own their 
own land. I would like to see the right to own property entrenched 
in the Constitution, something we do not have constitutionally now.
<P>
<B>(1210 )</B>
<P>
	I wonder if the member thinks it would be useful to allow natives 
on reserves to actually own the land. Then they could mortgage it 
and put houses on the land, just as everyone else does in Canada. It 
is a bit of a problem. The federal government is the only lender 
which will guarantee those mortgages because the natives do not 
own the land they live on in fee simple.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16301"> 16301 </A></B>
<P>
	She talked about the pride of home ownership. I wonder if it 
would not be a move in the right direction to allow natives to own 
the reserves in fee simple so they could then take out mortgages 
like any other Canadian and have the pride of ownership she spoke 
about earlier.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Blondin-Andrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague brought 
up a very interesting point. It is a very complicated question. The 
issue to which he referred would involve changing the Indian Act 
and making a number of constitutional amendments. It is 
complicated.
<P>
	It is not in my mandate to make such a pronouncement. 
However, if we attempt to ensure that aboriginal people can gain 
access to home ownership, the issue we are debating today, we 
know the hon. member would support us. If it involves any kind of 
work dealing with aboriginal rights, dealing with self-government, 
dealing with the empowerment of aboriginal people, of course the 
hon. member would support the government. We would appreciate 
that. Essentially that is what it would take to answer the very 
complicated question he asked.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would simply like to relay for the information of the House that one 
aspect of the CMHC loans has not been mentioned: CMHC 
guarantees do not always kick in. There is an example in my riding 
of a condominium which failed to keep up its premises. As a result 
the directors of that condominium corporation were liable. There 
are inherent risks not necessarily covered by the insurance.
<P>
	I compliment the secretary of state for bringing the essence of 
the debate down to the importance of home ownership. I ask her 
again to remind the House of the importance of the home to 
Canadian life.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Blondin-Andrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, it bears repeating that we 
must look at the question in the light of how it affects the majority 
of Canadians but also those with specific and unique needs, 
including aboriginal people, who often live in remote and isolated 
regions, the disabled and single parents. That is a very important 
issue.
<P>
	I cannot express enough that the real empowerment of the family 
or the individual is home ownership. It provides a great deal of 
stability economically, emotionally and in terms of a safe 
environment. The safety and security of the person is dealt with in 
the sense of providing a home. It gives an opportunity for the 
future.
<P>
	I have some additional information on the aboriginal housing 
policy the hon. member asked about. This has addressed the 
failures, experience and inefficiencies of previous programs and 
has led to self-sufficiency. Is there any new aboriginal policy? The 
government through CMHC is providing $307.8 million in this 
fiscal year to support social housing both off and on reserve.
<P>
	Every bit of achievement in giving home ownership to 
individuals in remote regions or to aboriginal people who live on 
reserves or off reserves is a major struggle. Each time we achieve 
something it is not done without hard work and compromise. It is 
very difficult, and every time you make progress it is a major 
achievement.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Unfortunately, the time has expired. 
There are two more members who wish to ask questions. Is there 
unanimous consent to extend the question period?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I hear members saying no.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Debate.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for 
Broadview-Greenwood.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We will resume debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak 
on the National Housing Act.
<P>
	This bill will enable Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation 
to continue underwriting home mortgage loan insurance within the 
legislative limit. I put the stress on the words ``loan insurance'' 
because when I listen to my friends from the Reform Party it 
sounds as if they feel that Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation is essentially giving loans. This is loan insurance. As a 
result, that responsibility of the government to come in and cover 
when someone defaults is minimal.
<P>
	I want to go back to 1987 when I was first nominated to be the 
Liberal candidate in my riding of Broadview-Greenwood. I said 
to my supporters in a room in the Slovenian Hall on Pape Avenue 
that one of the things I was going to try to work on was bringing 
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation out of mothballs. We 
had just come through three and a half years when the Brian 
Mulroney Conservative government had effectively parked the 
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. In some instances, 
they not only parked the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation, put it in mothballs, but they also devolved a lot of 
responsibility for housing to the provinces.
<P>
	I am one of those members in this House who believe the 
national government has a major role to play in the economy. I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16302"> 16302 </A></B>
<P>
never did share in the dismantling of the national government that 
Brian Mulroney and his colleagues engineered over 10 years. Even 
to this day, I  have debates and differences with some of my own 
colleagues as we sell off, dismantle, and in some instances literally 
give away Government of Canada assets, Government of Canada 
instruments. I sincerely believe that by giving these instruments 
away or dismantling them we will lose our capacity to run this very 
large country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> It is against 
the will of the people in the regions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills:</B> No, it is not. It is not against the will of the people. 
The people believe in a strong national government. They do not 
believe in this decentralizing system that is evolving right now. 
They do not believe in it. I am going to be very candid. I am not 
walking away from what got me elected. If it means I will even 
have, from time to time, some differences over here, so be it.
<P>
	Today the Government of Canada, through the minister 
responsible for Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation, is 
returning to traditional Liberal values. It gives me a great deal of 
satisfaction to stand in the House today and pay tribute to this 
minister. They are few and far between these days who will go back 
to traditional Liberal values and say they are going to bring Canada 
Mortgage and Housing Corporation out of mothballs and make sure 
it has the proper envelope to go out there and make sure the 
housing sector is given all the support it needs to get back on its 
feet.
<P>
<B>(1220 )</B>
<P>
	The member for Capilano-Howe Sound, the senior economist 
and finance critic for the Reform Party, asks at whose expense. For 
two years I have been listening to members of the Reform Party. 
The thought process is cut, cut, cut, dismantle, give away. They 
have actually to their credit done so well in communicating that 
message that in fact we in the government have listened to the 
Reform Party too much.
<P>
	We support eliminating waste and eliminating duplication, but 
we must also have growth in this country. The Reform Party cannot 
differentiate between those instruments of government that can 
accelerate and support growth and those areas where we support as 
well the elimination of waste and duplication.
<P>
	The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation is an instrument 
of the Government of Canada supported by the people of Canada 
that will help growth. That growth will generate jobs. It will 
generate an expansion of our economy.
<P>
	When we talk about housing, we should not just focus on the 
craftsmen, craftswomen, and all of the trades related to the housing 
sector. We should also reflect on what other industries benefit from 
a strong, healthy, vibrant housing industry: landscapers, carpet 
manufacturers, stove and refrigerator manufacturers, people who 
make drapes. The list is endless. That is something the Reform 
Party is missing.
<P>
	I am not trying to be partisan. I come from downtown Toronto. 
In my community if the housing industry is flat, if we have no 
growth in the housing industry, the ripple effect is almost 
catastrophic. It affects the entire confidence of the community.
<P>
	The economist from Capilano-Howe Sound knows full well 
that when developing a sound economic equation you cannot 
ignore the confidence factor. The confidence factor is the biggest 
factor in that equation. If in a community like Toronto there is a 
housing industry that is absolutely flat, it affects all other sectors of 
the economy.
<P>
	When members of the Reform Party came to this House they 
said they were not going to be here just to oppose for the sake of 
opposing. When a good idea came along that would not cost the 
treasury a lot of money they were going to support it.
<P>
	There have been a couple of ideas that have come forward from 
the Reform Party that I have supported. In fact the government has 
become so right of centre in its actions that I think the Reform 
Party should back off a little. If we get so far to the right that we cut 
all of these instruments that can generate growth, we are all going 
to be in trouble.
<P>
	Going back to this housing bill, it is so important that we do not 
just think of housing itself. These are not loans. We must think of 
all the spinoffs.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	It is important for Canadians to realize that this home loan 
insurance is not a loan; it is an insurance on the loan. This 
insurance package is something most of the supporters of the 
Reform Party want. Most Canadians would agree that it tends to be 
larger businesses, like the financial institutions, which are so 
focused on deficit and debt, more so than I would be, that are 
actually encouraging us to get behind the Canada Mortgage and 
Housing Corporation loan insurance system. I know this for a fact.
<P>
	There are big developers in my riding. The leaders of these 
organizations do not vote for me, although now and again I get a 
little contribution. I know a lot of their employees vote for me. 
Does the member for Capilano-Howe Sound know what these big 
developers say? The big developers say that when they go to their 
banks they are told that in order for them to get their development 
loan for their projects they need to produce a certificate of 
insurance from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. In 
other words, the major banks are saying to bring in that insurance 
guarantee and they will get behind the great job creation project.
<P>
	By the way, I know of a lot of projects in Toronto. To the credit 
of the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, under the 
direction of the minister from Cape Breton, one of the few 
traditional Liberals left in the House, the insurance guarantee is 
critical for the  homebuilding industry to get on its feet. But he is 
not just saying to accept any project. Many good projects in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16303"> 16303 </A></B>
<P>
greater Toronto area have been turned down because the element of 
risk was just a little too high.
<P>
	I say to the member for Capilano-Howe Sound that Canada 
Mortgage and Housing Corporation has really become a much 
more efficient, more streamlined, more risk averse crown 
corporation. When we see that kind of behaviour in that crown 
corporation, it should give members of the Reform Party some 
confidence so that when the minister responsible says let us 
increase this envelope from $100 billion to $150 billion where the 
downside is negligible, in fairness the Reform Party should get 
behind us.
<P>
	I want to make sure that some of the fundamentals of my 
argument are put on the table and the member agrees with them. 
First, I know the economist from Capilano-Howe Sound, the 
finance critic, would agree that a vibrant homebuilding sector is 
really a vital component in any economic equation. Second, he 
would agree with the spinoffs related to the housing sector. Third, 
he would also agree this is not a loan per se, it is a loan insurance 
plan.
<P>
	He would also agree that this should be a national instrument, 
that this is an instrument we should not devolve to the provinces, an 
instrument the national government should continue to operate. We 
should not chop it into little pieces like a lot of other things we have 
done around here lately.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	The last point I want to make concerns traditional values that all 
members in the House share, the values of caring and sharing, 
looking out for each other and family values. The member for 
Capilano-Howe Sound knows what a home, a roof over one's 
head and pride of ownership do in terms of strengthening the moral 
fabric of the country.
<P>
	The Reform Party has been successful in the last two years in 
generating cuts, dismantling and offloading. Now that a good bill 
comes before the House that will accelerate growth in a most 
important sector of the economy, the housing sector, I appeal to the 
member for Capilano-Howe Sound to be fair and get behind it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to have been named so often in the 
member's address. I will summarize what I as an economist 
consider the argument against the bill to be.
<P>
	One view we have heard again and again in today's speeches is 
that CMHC is self-supporting, that it does not really cost anything. 
Economists are asking why the government is in the business if this 
is so. Are members opposite suggesting that the free market will 
not work, that the free market does not produce services more 
efficiently than the public sector? The evidence is strongly against 
that because throughout the world,  governments are privatizing 
and taking these kinds of activities out of the market.
<P>
	Strangely enough, other members are bragging about the fact 
that the CMHC system is providing subsidies to others so that they 
can have houses that otherwise they would not have. How is this 
possible? If the organization is breaking even, where does it get its 
resources with which to pay the subsidies? It is conceivable that 
some activities undertaken by CMHC are creating a surplus. Thus a 
surplus is being forced or squeezed out of some unsuspecting 
Canadians participating in CMHC. It is taken by the system to 
subsidize others.
<P>
	As a conservative I would suggest that is not the way we should 
run our society. If there are reasons for subsidizing some types of 
housing such as that for natives, I believe we could reach 
agreement on it. Let us make it obvious. Let us make it transparent. 
Let us not have it hidden in the operation of some huge bureaucracy 
or in some obscure book.
<P>
	Another point made by the hon. member was that the housing 
industry would collapse unless the insurance was there. Whenever 
we have a subsidy program the economy and the industry adjust to 
take advantage of it. If we take away the subsidy there is a 
reduction in output. If subsidies are offered to banks or to anyone 
they will take them. That is not an argument in favour of saying 
that we need it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> It is not a subsidy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> The hon. member says it is not a subsidy. It is 
breaking even, but where does the organization get the resources to 
do what it is claiming? It is making it possible for some people to 
have houses who otherwise would not have them. By definition that 
is a subsidy. Where is the money coming from?
<P>
	To say that unless we subsidize and encourage the housing 
industry the economy will not boom is what we call vulgar 
Keynesianism. Vulgar Keynesianism means that unless we run a 
deficit and subsidize a certain activity, the economy left on its own 
will never produce a full employment equilibrium. That idea was 
current and fashionable in the 1960s. Today it is totally defunct. 
Most members opposite seem to have gone to university and have 
studied it in the 1960s, in the dark ages of Keynesian economics.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	We know today that if we subsidize some industries by raising-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> This is a speech; this is 
debate. Where is the question?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> This is debate.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16304"> 16304 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> It is called questions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is debate. This is not question 
period. We are debating the bill and I am giving an opposite view. I 
want to conclude with one last point.
<P>
	If the government takes money that it does not have and gives it 
to an industry to expand, the industry will employ people and there 
will be an increase in output. However we have found people as a 
whole look at the increase in the debt. They begin to realize that 
their future tax obligations will go up to service the debt. They are 
worried about their children and grandchildren. This is why we find 
the spending of those who have to pay the bills in the future is 
down. That reduces demand, output and employment the same 
amount by which deficit spending increased on the other side.
<P>
	That is a very well accepted proposition in economics.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will try to 
be brief and to the point on the member's questions.
<P>
	First, the member asked why the government was in this 
business. If the government were not in the business at this moment 
in time there would be a virtual monopoly. Is the member from the 
Reform Party promoting monopolies? I do not think so.
<P>
	Second, he called it a subsidy. It is not a subsidy. The whole 
premise of the member's argument was based on the word subsidy. 
It is loan insurance. It is not the Government of Canada making 
direct loans. In the judgment of the officials it is a collaborative 
effort by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, the banks 
and the private sector.
<P>
	The third item has to do with why we are all in this room. This 
room is not a bus going down the street so that we can look out the 
window and see people crying out for our help, whether they be 
young people, middle aged people or older people. This room is not 
a bus that drives by and says that it only has time for those who can 
look after themselves.
<P>
	In essence we are in this room so that when we look out the 
window of a bus driving down the street, stop the bus, get out and 
help people in need. There are many people who do not have 
financial resources either to own a home or have shelter over their 
heads without this lever or this instrument of national government. 
I am getting sick and tired of being in the House of Commons with 
the Reform Party encouraging the bus to go down the street and 
disregard the people who are crying out for help.
<P>
	The bill before the House looks after disadvantaged people and 
the Reform Party should get behind it.

	The House resumed from November 6 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-95, an act to establish the Department of Health 
and to amend and repeal certain acts, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
take the opportunity to speak to Bill C-95 and to discuss the health 
care system.
<P>
	There are several issues to be talked about. The most important 
is that the bill is only a name change. It transfers responsibilities 
and we accept that. However overriding the bill is what we will do 
with health care.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Scrap it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> The hon. member says scrap 
it. We do not agree with that.
<P>
	We need the highest quality of health care for all Canadians 
while not increasing the pressures of finances on the public. If we 
look at where many people come from today, the health care 
system in communities is an ever increasing cost. The 
disappointing part is the federal government has not increased its 
costs. It has 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16305"> 16305 </A></B>
<P>
actually decreased its expenditures toward the health care system 
over the years, thereby putting pressure on the provinces to come 
up with more and more money.
<P>
	I have had occasion in the province of British Columbia to work 
in one of the municipal organizations. I know full well what rising 
costs are due to in part. Labour negotiations, for instance, over the 
years have produced increases that are extraordinarily high. 
Communities had difficulty trying to pay as the costs of labour 
increased. We know the cost of equipment in hospitals is high and 
necessarily so, because it has to be state of the art.
<P>
	On top of all this we have a government saying that we must 
have universal health care which it relates to medicare. I will talk 
about the differences in a moment. The government wants it to be 
universal but is not prepared to pay 50 per cent or a higher 
percentage than it is today. It has been ever decreasing.
<P>
	Many people are not happy with the health care system. They 
have to wait in line for operations, and services are ever decreasing. 
There are bed shortages, not enough nurses at times and so on.
<P>
<B>(1245 )</B>
<P>
	I have been attending the Royal Columbian Hospital in 
Vancouver where my niece has been in neurosurgery for the last 
nine weeks. She was in a very serious car accident. I must say that I 
have been totally impressed with the health care system in that 
regard.
<P>
	I am sure many people have gone through hospitals, have spoken 
to doctors and have been completely impressed. However, the fact 
remains that the services are decreasing. I see it when I visit the 
hospital. There are not as many nurses as we would like to see on 
staff and so on. The demands and the expectations which people 
have for health care today are perhaps more than what the 
provinces can afford. Therein lies a good part of the battle.
<P>
	Some myths have been promoted across the country. I believe 
they are more political myths than reality. We hear from the other 
side that Canada's health care system is the best in the world and 
that any changes would be detrimental. I do not subscribe to that 
thesis. The fact is that the health care system in Canada is very 
good. I cannot from my experience determine whether it is the best 
in the world, but I am sure it is very high up there.
<P>
	The Liberals are saying that any changes would be detrimental. I 
disagree with that. In this day and age what is truly required, 
because of the costs and the limitations on the resources, is a core 
set of services that would be provided throughout Canada on a cost 
shared basis. It could be called a core medical service. Over and 
above that, we have to allow the provinces to innovate and provide 
other services. That only stands to reason unless the federal 
government is prepared to provide more funding into its shared 
responsibility.
<P>
	The government cannot have it both ways. It cannot say: ``The 
rules are going to go our way, but we are not going to give you 
enough money to operate''. It is unrealistic to think that way.
<P>
	If you are looking for changes in health care, we have offered a 
program for change with a core medical service. Organizations 
such as the Canadian College of Health Service Executives are 
coming to the conclusion that there has to be some kind of core 
service. Trying to provide all things to all people within a very 
limited finite budget will not work.
<P>
	Some myths about health care are attached to this party. They are 
political myths. I can understand when we are campaigning or 
when we are debating in the House that statements are made to 
promote one side or the other. Some of the myths are that the 
Reform Party will dismantle medicare; that it wants a U.S. style of 
medical system; the Reform Party is in favour of a cash register 
medical system; it favours private insurance; it is in cahoots with 
insurance companies; it is a proponent of a two-tier health care 
system.
<P>
	The fact is that the Reform Party is a lot more realistic than the 
government. Unless the government is prepared to look at the 
funding it provides to the provinces, I do not see how the provinces 
can expect to live by the standards which have been set by the 
federal government. It is not realistic.
<P>
	The biggest burden of cost is on the provinces. The government 
cannot stand by and promote such things as block funding without 
eventually finding out what the problems are. I have had a lot of 
experience with block funding. It is just another way of saying: 
``You have the same amount of money. You can spend it on 
whatever you like. If you want more money for health care you can 
spend the bulk of it but that will take away from welfare transfer 
payments or post-secondary education''. It is still the same amount 
of money. The government has not really resolved anything other 
than to change the name and provide the money which has been 
decreasing over the years.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	We have to define medicare today. I do not believe medicare and 
health care are necessarily synonymous. Medicare to me is a 
comprehensive set of core national health standards, publicly 
funded, portable across Canada and universally accessible to all. 
Canadians regardless of ability to pay should be able to use and 
access the health care system.
<P>
	If we get to defining the problem we will be better off. However, 
if the Liberal government merely says: ``The rules are this and we 
are only going to give you a finite set of dollars to live within'', the 
provinces are not going to take that any more. That is what the 
debate is on constantly in this House.
<P>
	We have to remove-

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> You have one minute left.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> So soon? I cannot even get 
into the report from the Canadian College of Health Care 
Executives but if possible in a minute I would like to read some of 
the conclusions which illustrate where its members are coming 
from today.
<P>
	One of their concerns is with the political concerns of this 
country. The report says: ``With the increased importance of health 
care to the public, main issues have become campaign issues for 
many elections. There is concern that pledges to balance budgets 
will result in reduction in the quality of health care provided''.
<P>
	They are really saying that politics are limiting this, and that 
politics are part of the problem in the health care system. I agree. 
The Liberal government has to open up on the issue of health care 
and get away from the idea that we have a traditional system, there 
is no other way to do it and that it is finite.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak in support of Bill C-95 because I believe in the 
importance of a federal department of health. I am among those 
Canadians who value their health care system as one of those things 
that tie us together as a nation.
<P>
	This system for which you and I share responsibility is central to 
our identity as Canadians. More than any other program of 
government it reflects our belief that we are mutually responsible 
for each other's well-being. We exist as a nation and will continue 
to exist as a nation precisely because we do care for one another.
<P>
	However, if we are to preserve what we value we must be aware 
of the changing times. The budget signalled a new era of fiscal 
responsibility and smaller government. We cannot escape the 
financial facts of life which mean we will have to abandon some 
old ways of thinking and some old expectations of government.
<P>
	I hardly need to emphasize how far we have come together. We 
know that Canadian health care is second to none in the world. 
Everyone in Canada has reasonable access to health care. We 
establish our priorities for treatment based on medical necessity 
and not on how much money we have. No Canadian need fear now 
or in the future that a catastrophic illness will result in financial 
disaster.
<P>
	As we approach the 21st century there is a new fiscal reality. The 
government has recognized it and is acting responsibly to deal with 
it. We are committed to protecting social programs. Indeed, the 
government's budget was about taking the fiscal steps necessary to 
do so.
<P>
	Our national health care system is rooted in our common 
Canadian values of equity, fairness, compassion and respect for the 
fundamental dignity of all. The goal  of the new Department of 
Health is to preserve medicare and put our fiscal house in order.
<P>
	Many of the values that make up Canada's social fabric are 
reflected in the five principles of the Canada Health Act. They 
reflect the Canadian concern for justice and equity in our health 
care system and they are not going to disappear. Canadians will not 
allow that to happen. The Canada Health Act and its five principles 
of universality, accessibility, portability, comprehensiveness and 
public administration will be maintained. The principles of the 
Canada Health Act are not just words. Their meaning has stood the 
test of time. In their totality they assure both the provision of 
quality health services to all and the containment of costs.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	As Canadians, we believe all must have access to services. 
People cannot be de-insured because they might be too costly for 
the system to cover. They cannot be turned away at a hospital door 
because they have not paid their quarterly tax bill or their 
provincial premium. If we need health care, we will be treated the 
same as anyone else. That is what Canadians mean by equity. This 
recognizes our dignity as human beings and thus demonstrates that 
we are a fair and compassionate people.
<P>
	Of course, new realities require new thinking about how we will 
do things. That thinking must be pragmatic and stand the test of 
both fairness and fiscal reality.
<P>
	This fiscal year the federal government is transferring $15.5 
billion to the provinces and territories for health services. The total 
federal health, post-secondary education and social contributions 
for 1995-96 will be about $29.7 billion under the established 
programs financing and the Canada assistance plan.
<P>
	With the introduction of the Canada health and social transfer in 
1996-97, total transfers will be $26.9 billion. The transfer 
reduction for 1996-97 represents, and I stress, less than 3 per cent 
of the estimated provincial-territorial expenditures for health, 
post-secondary education and social programs. It is also less than 2 
per cent of provincial government revenues.
<P>
	What is important to highlight is that the federal cash 
contributions under the Canada health and social transfer will not 
disappear. In fact, when you take into account the economies that 
provincial governments are putting in place, the federal proportion 
of funding in most provinces will remain steady or even increase. 
Make no mistake about it, the federal government is in medicare to 
stay. There will be stable, ongoing cash in the system to ensure that 
it is sustained.
<P>
	Sustaining the health system does not mean spending more; it 
means spending better. Research demonstrates that there is no 
direct relationship between increased health spending and 
improved health outcomes. It is not the amount of money we 
dedicate to our health care  system that will ensure a healthy 
population. Rather, it is the way we spend it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16307"> 16307 </A></B>
<P>
	We can do more with less, without in any way jeopardizing 
universal access to quality health care on uniform terms and 
conditions for all residents of Canada. In fact, we are doing more 
with less, as comparisons with the United States continue to 
demonstrate.
<P>
	Traditionally, the split between public and private spending has 
been about 75-25. Currently, the private share is rising and is now 
over 28 per cent. This is a trend that must be examined as we look 
at ways to keep health care affordable to all residents.
<P>
	We are doing this for several reasons. One of the most important 
is that the threat facility fees pose to the public system's ability to 
continue to deliver the efficient results that we have come to 
expect. By billing both the patients and the taxpayers private 
clinics does not take pressure off the system. They take resources 
away from the system. Facility fees fracture a system whose 
greatest strength is cohesion.
<P>
	Look at the issue from the point of view of efficiencies and 
economies. Encouraging the growth of private clinics with partial 
public funding takes all of the strengths and efficiencies of our 
health system and turns them on their head. It reduces economies 
of scale. It undermines our bargaining power.
<P>
	Like the U.S. system, a movement toward publicly funded 
private clinics could shift more of the Canadian economy's 
resources to health care at the expense of other areas that could 
provide greater benefit to the health of Canadians. It could very 
well end up costing more while providing less. It would be hard to 
think of a better example of counterproductivity. Moreover, it 
threatens to create an under supply of services to the majority of 
Canadians and an over supply to the wealthier minority. It would be 
difficult to think of a better definition of inefficiency.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	Medicare is based on fundamental principles, but they are not 
abstract principles. They are pragmatic. They were designed to 
make it possible to provide every Canadian with the level of health 
care he or she truly needs. We must do so at a cost we can genuinely 
afford.
<P>
	I will comment briefly on the Reform Party position on Canada's 
health care system. It is advocating a two tier system of core 
services in which Canadians have to pay and in which the rich can 
jump the lines and get ahead. This demonstrates a lack of vision. It 
demonstrates a sincere lack of understanding of the fundamental 
principles of the Canadian health care system.
<P>
	We will not transfer our Canadian system into a U.S. style 
system. Canadians know full well the quality of health care in the 
United States and it certainly is not the kind of health care system 
Canadians want.
<P>
	Canadians look on their health care system with pride. We have 
an overwhelming degree of satisfaction with what we have created. 
They expect governments to work hard to adapt to changing times 
and to priorities. They understand the need for cost effectiveness in 
what we do. They expect governments to work as a team to meet 
goals they set years ago, goals such as access and universal 
coverage. They are still valuable and still appropriate.
<P>
	The new federal Department of Health is ready to take up this 
challenge. I am proud to add my support to the bill. I indicate most 
emphatically that the Reform Party is seeking to undermine the 
fundamental principles of the Canada Health Act, which Canadians 
have come to rely on and which they deserve.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, at a time when we are considering the act to establish the 
Department of Health, the first question we could ask is: Why have 
a federal Department of Health? British North America Act says in 
section 92.7 and section 16 that health and social services are a 
provincial jurisdiction. So why did the federal government get 
involved in the health care sector?
<P>
	To refresh our memory, I may recall that during the Second 
World War, the federal government obtained the right to collect 
income tax on a temporary basis, as they said at the time, to pay the 
country's war debts. However, by the end of the war, since people 
were now used to it and considering spending powers under the 
Canadian constitution, the federal government felt it would be 
useful to to continue to be involved in this area.
<P>
	This led to the creation of several white elephants, to take action 
in areas for which the federal government had no responsibility. 
Today, the Department of Health is an interesting case in point. 
Quebecers and Canadians should know that for 1996-97, the annual 
cost of the federal Department of Health will be more than one 
billion dollars, which includes $347 million in salaries for staff and 
$703 million for goods and services, this in addition to 
administering $7.4 billion in transfer payments to the provinces.
<P>
	We can see the insidious effect of what happened at the end of 
the Second World War, when the federal government, having 
obtained the right to collect taxes, returned this money to the 
provinces in the form of transfer payments. On the other hand, if 
every province had kept the right to look after health care, it would 
have been able to raise taxes so that citizens would know exactly 
what amount is spent on the health care sector and whether it is 
well spent. Unfortunately, that is not the model we developed in 
Canada. Today, we have a rather extraordinary situation where the 
federal government, while reducing its contribution to health care 
from year to year, nevertheless maintains national standards and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16308"> 16308 </A></B>
<P>
thus puts the provinces, with their  responsibility for the day to day 
administration of health care, in an impossible situation.
<P>
	The federal government says emphatically: no extra billing, but 
at the same time it denies the provinces the funding they need, and 
there is no reduction in the tax points the federal government 
collects.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	The provincial governments are unanimously opposed to this 
state of affairs and are trying to do something about it. The federal 
government wants to create a Department of Health that would be a 
continuation of previous departments, but at the same time the 
government assumes the right to intervene in a number of sectors, 
and that is why we think this does not augur well for the future of 
Canada. In the months and years to come, important budgetary 
decisions will have to be made.
<P>
	I repeat that if we have two bureaucracies looking after health 
care in Canada-and in fact there are not two, there are more, as 
many as ten or eleven, because each province can have its own 
department of health-there will be unnecessary spending, 
unavoidably. When they say: ``The government has no more 
money, where could it cut spending, how will we determine our 
social options for the future?'', the first place to look is where we 
have duplication.
<P>
	Are there not areas in this sector that should not be the 
responsibility of the federal government? Should the federal 
government not withdraw and give the provinces the right to take 
care of a sector that is theirs under the constitution?
<P>
	I would like to give a few examples of this encroachment. For 
instance, for the strategy for the integration of persons with 
disabilities, funding will be $46 million over five years, $46 
million to be spent on the integration of persons with disabilities. If 
we consider the situation in Quebec, the province already has its 
Office des personnes handicapées which does the job, and here we 
see two governments involved in the same sector. Of course the 
whole $46 million will not be wasted. There is money that goes 
directly to people, to the client. But say this amount includes $5 
million for administration costs. If only one intervener was 
involved, we could save that much and relieve some of the pressure 
on the federal budget, while services could be maintained quite 
adequately.
<P>
	Another sector is family violence. A program was set up that 
would cost $136 million over four years. Again, this is a valid 
activity and government action is desirable, but the fact that two 
governments are involved undermines the effectiveness of these 
programs.
<P>
	Say that in this case 10 per cent goes to administration costs, we 
could save $13 million. In the end, the same taxpayer pays the 
taxes. Whether he is paying municipally, provincially or federally, 
he always pays his  taxes. So it is not surprising that those 
advocating decentralization so areas of jurisdiction may be 
recognized are critical of this sort of legislation by which the 
central government wants to impose its decisions on the provinces 
in areas where it has no responsibility, in areas where the provinces 
have constitutional responsibility.
<P>
	Let us continue down the list of programs duplicating the action 
of the provincial governments. The new horizons program for 
seniors is another example of duplicate administration and 
duplicate bureaucracy. Members should see the forms the senior 
citizens clubs have to fill in to obtain these receipts. Often the 
administration costs for these programs equal what is paid out to 
senior citizens' clubs. This sort of thing is unacceptable, and 
people are rebelling. They want elected officials to clarify the 
situations.
<P>
	Other examples include the seniors secretariat, the fight against 
smoking, the anti drug campaign, the national AIDS strategy, the 
children's bureau and, the best example of all, the national health 
forum.
<P>
	Imagine. The federal government gave a team of experts a 
mandate to look at health management in Canada assessing the 
relevance of maintaining existing programs and of making change, 
but without the provinces taking part in the forum on health. This, 
for me, is the height of federal interventionism. From within an 
area of federal jurisdiction, a decision is made to interfere in an 
area of provincial jurisdiction, the provinces do not participate in 
the forum on health and no one has the patience or wants to do the 
negotiating necessary to have them there.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	This means that, in the end, when the Prime Minister receives 
the report from the committee responsible for the forum on health, 
as its chair, he will be also be handed a total rejection by all the 
provinces of the report's conclusions.
<P>
	We cannot ask people we have not included in the process to 
accept the conclusions reached. First of all, a determination should 
have been made of who ought to take part in the forum-was 
participation by the federal government really appropriate. Then, 
steps should have been taken to ensure that the provinces had a 
strong and appropriate voice that would have allowed them to 
address actual situations, because all the institutional networks are 
provincial.
<P>
	These include hospitals, community health centres, shelters. 
Practical decisions are needed: reforms in individual provinces, the 
need to strike a balance between active treatment beds and 
extended care beds. At the moment, the provincial governments are 
bearing all the weight of the difficult decisions in this area, while 
the federal government, washing its hands of it, is reducing the 
funds it gives to this sector annually.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16309"> 16309 </A></B>
<P>
	I will conclude on this point. When, in upcoming months it is 
looking for a place to save some money, one of the first could 
be the federal government bureaucracy enshrined in the 
Department of Health. How much can it save of the $347 million 
used to pay the salaries of officials working in the same area of 
activity as the provinces?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jean Payne (St. John's West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak in support of Bill C-95 not only because it provides 
a framework for Health Canada, not only because Canadians are 
renowned worldwide because of their health care system, but 
because today more than ever we need the support of a vigorous 
health care system.
<P>
	There are those who condemn the cost of uniform health care to 
all Canadians. These individuals fear that a changing economy and 
a fast moving society will make it more difficult to maintain the 
current system.
<P>
	As technology improves and surgical breakthroughs evolve, 
expenses increase. Transplants and bypasses are becoming more 
common and the therapy and equipment associated with these 
operations are more costly.
<P>
	We are moving from an industrial age to an information era. 
Associated with this transformation are economic and social 
disruptions which bring greater demands to the system.
<P>
	Our current system though stressed is simply reflecting the 
pressures associated with change. We already have a system that 
has provided a foundation stable enough to support change and we 
now maintain that system as the cornerstone of our society.
<P>
	In my riding of St. John's West unemployment rates are some of 
the highest in the country. Every rise in the unemployment rate 
brings a greater increase in stress related diseases.
<P>
	Our country represents a nation united. This could be seen in the 
strong support that Quebecers received, including support from 
those in my riding.
<P>
	As our nation experiences change, we see fluctuations of high 
and low points in the economy of each province. What we need is 
stability. We need stable variables to rely on. One variable must be 
our health care system. This system must serve to maintain 
stability and unity within and between the provinces, a symbol of 
what it means to be Canadian.
<P>
	Increases in stress related diseases produce associated afflictions 
such as increase in spousal abuse, alcoholism, drug addiction, high 
blood pressure and cardiac problems. The stress of not having the 
stability of a uniform health care system to rely on will certainly 
generate increases in stress and stress related diseases.
<P>
	Members opposite have from time to time criticized the 
Department of Health because they say it spends too much money. 
I say it is money well spent, and not more than its responsibilities 
require.
<P>
	The Department of Health is the department of defence against 
disease, the common enemy of all Canadians. Health allows no 
fiscal restraint. It is the challenge of the Department of Health to 
maintain an infrastructure that guarantees quality health care to 
Canadians in good times and in bad regardless of their economic 
position.
<P>
	The health system I see is one that does not represent a net cost 
to the country, but a benefit. It is not an expense but an investment. 
Every element of economic and social life in Canada gains from 
medicare. Canadian patients are freed from the extra burden of 
health spending when the trauma of illness weighs heavily. 
Physicians are assured of payment for their services, while 
retaining professional freedom. Hospitals have more financial 
security and can better serve Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	Most important and least obvious is the fact that Canadian 
medicare provides many economic benefits to the country as a 
whole. To take one example, more than $7 out of every $10 that is 
spent on health care in Canada is paid out of a provincially 
administered insurance plan. This single payer system in each 
province has built in efficiencies that allow considerable control 
over total expenditures. This efficiency is what holds per capita 
health costs in Canada well below comparable costs in the United 
States. Because of this control over spending, personal resources 
are freed for other priorities, such as education, housing, and 
nutrition, all of which enhance the well-being of Canadians.
<P>
	There are aspects of medicare that provide Canadian business 
with competitive advantages in the global market. Some 
international firms have established plants here because the cost of 
providing employee benefits in Canada is significantly lower than 
in the United States. Medicare enhances labour force mobility, and 
access to quality health care helps to ensure a healthy and 
productive workforce.
<P>
	In St. John's West the labour force mobility is currently essential 
to long term sustenance, and the maintenance of our health care 
system is vital to ensuring the people of Newfoundland have a 
fighting chance in terms of labour mobility. Healthy business 
means economic growth, which in turn results in jobs, less 
unemployment, a healthier population, less stress related disease 
due to undue stress in the workplace, fewer demands on the health 
care system, and lower health care costs.
<P>
	Health must be everyone's top priority. We must commit a large 
percentage of resources to maintaining health. It is our right and 
responsibility to do so. At the  same time, we must be vigilant and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16310"> 16310 </A></B>
<P>
innovative to ensure that what we are spending is done with 
economy in mind.
<P>
	Among the areas the Department of Health is investing in is 
health intelligence. This initiative, which will include participation 
in a new global network designed to detect emerging diseases, is 
endorsed by provincial governments. The provinces know that 
national leadership in this area is essential if we are to make the 
most cost effective choices among all available health technologies 
and options.
<P>
	Inevitably, there will be an increase in movement toward 
international standards or international processes. This department 
on Canada's behalf is very much in the forefront of this trend and 
will lead, not follow, other countries in establishing health 
standards.
<P>
	The minister has spoken about maintaining traditional values 
and at the same time getting value for money. In St. John's West 
and throughout Canada tradition is what has made our country so 
unique. Health Canada promises to work closely with the provinces 
and territories in order to avoid duplication of programs and 
services, contrary to the comments made previously by my 
colleague in the Bloc.
<P>
	All in all, I have confidence that the department that will be 
brought formally into being by this bill has its priorities straight. It 
will serve Canadians. It will guard our health and our health care 
system. It will do this with regard for efficiency and for getting at 
least $1.10 of value for every $1 it spends. Above all, it will 
continue to provide assurance that our national life and economy 
will stay vital at the domestic level and competitive abroad based 
on a healthy and vigorous Canadian population.
<P>
	I have no hesitation in supporting the passage of this bill to 
create the new Department of Health. I urge my colleagues across 
the floor to do the same.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to try to get a point clarified.
<P>
	I do not know why we are debating the creation of a Department 
of Health. Do we not have a Department of Health? Do we not have 
a Minister of Health? Is this the kind of legislation we should be 
debating in this House, talking about things that already exist? Did 
not Kim Campbell set it up two years ago and it has already been 
operating? Is this the best this government can offer? I cannot 
believe we are taking up two hours voting for the creation of a 
Department of Health that already exists.
<P>
<B>(1320 )</B>
<P>
	Why does this government not get on with governing the country 
and providing the provinces with some leadership? Government 
members know very well that all the provinces are angry that we 
almost lost one province and this country almost broke up. Why do 
they not do something about the promises they made during  the 
referendum campaign and get on with some serious legislation that 
would help this country?
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, do you really think that debating this bill and 
creating the Department of Health will now make the province of 
Quebec want to vote to stay in Canada, that it is going to convince 
the yes voters to vote no because this is exactly what they were 
looking for from the Government of Canada? The Prime Minister 
is now off on another trip. I do not understand what this 
government is all about.
<P>
	Where does the member for Mississauga South get off attacking 
the Reform Party on its health care position in an aside from his 
scripted speech that was written by the department, as if our health 
care position is out to destroy health care in Canada. Either the 
member does not understand our platform or the issue, which is 
more likely the case, or he has nothing better to do.
<P>
	Our party has put forth some concrete suggestions to reform 
health care in this country. I find it ironic that this government 
prides itself in introducing the health care act, that it is proud of the 
health care act to the degree it keeps preaching about some of the 
fundamentals, that it will protect health care for Canadians in terms 
of accessibility, portability, affordability, and equal access to all, 
unlike the Reform Party which favours a two tier system and would 
kill health care. What is the government afraid of in terms of the 
Reform Party?
<P>
	We also want to preserve all of the items in the Canada Health 
Act. However, the one element the government conveniently 
forgets and the one principle the Liberal government conveniently 
leaves out of this equation is that in the Canada Health Act it 
promised to pay for 50 per cent of the services, 50 per cent of the 
cost of the program. It has now reduced it to 27 per cent.
<P>
	This wonderful new Minister of Finance who cannot balance a 
budget and this new wonderful Minister of Human Resources 
Development are now going to further reduce what they give to the 
provinces for health care; they are going to further reduce what 
they give the provinces for education. They are saying to the 
provinces: ``You must stick by these principles; you have to retain 
this level of services and we are going to give you less money to do 
it''.
<P>
	If by chance the provincial governments decide to be creative 
enough to come up with a method of delivering the same level of 
service with less money, of reducing the line ups at no cost to the 
federal government, they cannot do it because that is the American 
style. The government says: ``Listen to us. We know best because 
we are the federal government''.
<P>
	This is a stubborn headed type of attitude that is tearing this 
country apart at the seams. It makes me mad to come here as an 
Albertan and see those people sit on that side of the House and not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16311"> 16311 </A></B>
<P>
listen to concrete  suggestions, to always put them down and say we 
are destroying everything. We are here to offer constructive 
alternatives.
<P>
	When it comes to health care, we want and need to recognize that 
the level of support and the level of funding for the various social 
programs we have are of such a high level that we can no longer 
afford to sustain spending at these levels. Therefore we must all 
look at ways and means of reducing the costs while delivering an 
effective service, ways and means of getting people in and through 
the system who really need attention rather than preventing them 
from moving forward.
<P>
	Let me talk about the principle this government will not talk 
about. It is out of money; it is broke. Yet it still talks about all the 
wonderful things it can do for the people of Canada. Mr. Speaker, I 
know we are not supposed to use certain words, so I will try to get 
the word right. That is a gross misrepresentation and a lack of 
intellectual honesty in terms of the Canadian public. Here we have 
people who are supposed to be responsible, who are supposed to be 
giving Canadians what they need, yet they play politics rather than 
play with the facts and the reality of the situation.
<P>
<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	Why not have a good debate and a discussion about issues like 
topping up a health care system that badly needs topping up with a 
system of an insurance policy in place in provinces if a person 
wants to do that to have access and pay for certain operations? If 
somebody's life is saved, what is really wrong with that? Why not? 
Do the rich not deserve as much as the poor?
<P>
	I do not understand the debate the Liberals always use. Anything 
that we suggest always favours the rich and is against the poor. We 
are talking about lives. Anybody in this country who needs 
attention should get that attention. We are trying to suggest ways 
and means by which they can get it quicker, so they can get at the 
point of service in a way that saves them, that reduces the line ups 
and the pressures, a complete overhaul of the system itself, the 
inefficiencies in hospitals, the inefficiencies of visiting doctors and 
how they go through their check-ups.
<P>
	If this government really wants to do its job and do it well, why 
does it not just stop collecting money for health care, impose the 
rules and regulations by which the services must be delivered in all 
the provinces, and get back to doing what a government should do? 
Why does it not get into the area of regulations on behalf of all 
Canadians coast to coast so that it is standard, portable, accessible, 
all these things, but leave the collection of the funds and cancel this 
stupid Department of Health and leave the raising of the moneys 
for the services to the provinces? This government takes $2 out of 
every $5 it collects for health care and blows it on a bureaucracy 
that is ill-prepared to deliver the services in all the regions of 
Canada.
<P>
	Let us stop this mismanagement of government programs. The 
federal government has to get out of certain areas. These guys and
<P>
gals are too proud to recognize that the federal government is 
intruding into a lot of people's lives. It is intruding in such a way 
that its members are imposing their perceived-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> What are you going to 
do with the weaker provinces?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> It is obvious that I have the government listening to 
me, but those members really do not want to listen, they just want 
to interject. That is all right, I am used to that.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Such a nerve. All they do is 
babble.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> I am used to that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Say what you believe.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nault:</B> Come on. We know you do not believe any of that 
nonsense. That is Reform rhetoric.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> I know what sexual harassment is, but I have never 
really felt verbal harassment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> We will help.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> I have my troops here now. One for one. You guys go 
at it and I will just talk to the Speaker.
<P>
	Seriously, we have a major problem in health care. We have a 
solution called medicare plus. We have a solution that will allow 
people to have access to the health care they need at the lowest 
possible cost and the maximum level of service possible. Unlike 
this government, which just keeps harping about giving them less 
and they should do with less, we have something to offer.
<P>
	If the member for Mississauga South really wants to understand 
before the next time he gets up and points a finger at the Reform 
Party and says they want to do this, they want to do that, let me tell 
him two things.
<P>
	One, the Reform Party has a plan. He would be well advised to 
read it, because members in his constituency are going to get a 
copy of it. He had better be able to answer why it is not good and 
why it will not work for the people who are sick in his riding and 
are in line ups and are dying, rather than taking cheap political 
shots in this House.
<P>
	Two, let me tell him another thing. The time of putting people 
down the way he does, as he has done for two years, every time I 
speak about remuneration, salaries, or any time I talk about health 
care-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I take 
exception to the indictment that I am putting people down. I am 
here to speak on behalf of the Canadian health care system.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16312"> 16312 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member's point is perhaps a point, 
but it is certainly not a point of order; it is a point of debate. The 
hon. member for Calgary Centre will not have that time come out 
of his time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sure you have shared this, because 
with your background as a lawyer you must have met a lot of 
people in your lifetime who really like to dish it out. They really 
like to put the knife into people. They just love it. However, when 
the opportunity comes for them to have to listen for a while, boy, 
they have a thin shell. They cannot take it. These people were in 
opposition for so long that they still have that tender shell around 
them. When they were on this side they said outlandish things. 
They made promises. To get elected they even promised to quit if 
the GST was not replaced. It still has not been replaced.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	We are debating the organization of the Department of Health as 
if we do not have one. Canada does not have a Department of 
Health, ladies and gentlemen. We have to do something about it. 
We have to pass a bill fast to create a Department of Health. We 
have to do it quickly because it will bring in efficiencies, it will be 
effective and it will deliver services. That is important. Give me a 
break. We have a Department of Health and Canadians know it.
<P>
	We have a system which is rupturing. It is breaking apart. What 
we have to do is find a way to help those people who need help in a 
way which is quick, effective and efficient. That will not be done 
by reducing the funds and saying to the provinces: ``You guys 
handle it''. The way to do it is to say to the provinces: ``We know 
we are in a dilemma. We cannot give you as much money as we 
have been. We have to give you less. Are there ways you can still 
deliver the services? We will be flexible''. The Prime Minister 
promised flexible federalism and the only things he is flexible 
about are his travel arrangements.
<P>
	We have to let the provinces come up with suggestions and work 
with them. Will we still have the same health minister if there is a 
new Department of Health?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> I doubt it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> My point is the provinces should be listened to and 
that is not happening. All the Reform Party is trying to do is make 
recommendations on ways and means by which we can deliver a 
service at a lower cost which is still effective and which still 
respects the principles of the health act. That is what the Reform 
Party is about, not what the hon. member for Mississauga South 
preaches every time he stands up.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Dauphin-Swan River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak on Bill C-95. Today I wish to 
address the leadership role and responsibility which the federal 
Department of Health has had in  shaping the development and the 
evolution of Canada's health system.
<P>
	Our national health system, popularly called medicare, is made 
up of 12 interlocking health care insurance plans administered by 
the provinces and territories. The provinces and territories are 
responsible for the administration, organization and delivery of 
health care services, including human and financial resource 
allocation, financing and regulating health professionals.
<P>
	The system is referred to as a national health care system or 
program in that all provincial and territorial insurance plans are 
linked through adherence to the national principles of the Canada 
Health Act, which comes under the authority of the federal 
Minister of Health.
<P>
	The federal health legislation sets out the basic principles and 
conditions for the payment of federal financial contributions to the 
operation of the provincial plans. This year the federal government 
will contribute over $15.5 billion to the provinces and territories in 
support of their health programs and services through established 
programs financing.
<P>
	The federal Department of Health is also responsible for the 
promotion and protection of public health, for example through our 
public health intelligence and awareness initiatives and drug 
approval regulation activities, providing health services directly to 
registered Indians.
<P>
	Canada has an excellent health system and the federal 
Department of Health has been a key player in its evolution. It was 
under the leadership of the Minister of Health, the Hon. Paul 
Martin Sr., that the federal government introduced and passed 
legislation to implement the first component of our national health 
system.
<P>
	The passage of the Hospital Insurance and Diagnostic Act in 
1957 encouraged the development of hospital insurance programs 
in all provinces and territories through the offer to cost share 
hospital and diagnostic services. This legislation allowed the 
government to share in the cost of provincial hospital insurance 
plans that met minimum eligibility and coverage standards. By 
1961 after all 10 provinces and 2 territories introduced public 
hospital insurance plans, Canadians no longer had to worry about 
facing crippling hospital bills if a member of their family became 
ill.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	The Department of Health followed with respect to medical 
insurance in the 1960s and with the introduction of public 
insurance for physician services in 1962. The federal government 
offered a cost shared program to the provinces and territories in 
1966 to encourage the development of a national medicare 
insurance program.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16313"> 16313 </A></B>
<P>
	The federal medicare act was implemented in 1968 and by 1972 
all Canadians enjoyed public medical care insurance in addition 
to hospital insurance. Leadership was shown again by the 
Department of Health in 1984 when medicare was reaffirmed by 
Parliament with the passage of the Canada Health Act.
<P>
	The Minister of Health of the day, the Hon. Monique Begin, 
detected an erosion of the principles that support medicare. 
Canadians were telling her their access to necessary health care 
was being impeded by user fees and she took action to restore 
medicare.
<P>
	The Canada Health Act with special provisions to discourage 
provinces from allowing extra billing by doctors and user charges 
by hospitals was successful in eliminating user fee medicare. The 
act provided for an automatic dollar for dollar penalty deducted 
from the transfer payment. For every dollar a province allowed to 
be charged in the form of extra billing or hospital user charges, one 
dollar was deducted from that province's transfer payment for 
health. Within three years all provinces that had allowed extra 
billing and user charges eliminated them. Canadians across the 
country were once again enjoying unfettered access to necessary 
health care services.
<P>
	The Canada Health Act is a great symbol for Canadians. It 
symbolizes the values of our society: equity, compassion and 
caring. It is also more than a symbol. It embodies the principles 
which underlie the Canadian medicare system and provides the 
mechanism for preserving medicare.
<P>
	The first national principle is universality. Every eligible 
provincial resident must be entitled to coverage by the provincial 
health insurance plan. Coverage is linked only to residency in the 
province and not to jobs and not to the payment of premiums.
<P>
	The second principle is comprehensiveness. The provincial 
plans must provide coverage for all medically necessary hospital 
and medical services.
<P>
	The third is accessibility. Insured services must be reasonably 
accessible and without financial barriers. This means in part there 
can be no point of service charges for medically necessary services, 
no extra billing by doctors and no user charges in hospitals. 
Patients do not receive medical or hospital bills for insured 
services. The province pays the bills directly on their behalf.
<P>
	The fourth principle is portability. This is vital to a national 
system. It means that when Canadians travel or move they continue 
to be covered by provincial plans.
<P>
	The final principle is public administration. The health insurance 
plan must be operated on a non-profit basis and must be 
accountable to the provincial government.
<P>
	It is adherence to these national principles that gives the 
provincial systems a set of common features. This commonality is 
what makes our health care system a  national system. The 
Department of Health monitors provincial and territorial 
compliance with the principles of the Canada Health Act and 
informs the Minister of Health of any problems. Where there is 
non-compliance the act provides the minister with the authority to 
direct deductions from transfer payments. These deductions are the 
mechanism by which the Minister of Health enforces the Canada 
Health Act and protects medicare.
<P>
	The government is committed to a national health insurance 
system, to medicare. That is why the Minister of Health has taken 
action against semi-private clinics that charge user fees in the form 
of facility fees. Barriers to access must be discouraged.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	The government has also shown its commitment to medicare by 
making sure the new Canada health and social transfer supports 
medicare. In order to qualify for full cash contributions under the 
CHST, provinces and territories must comply with the Canada 
Health Act.
<P>
	The Department of Health has played a key role in the 
development, protection and preservation of medicare. Bill C-95 
will ensure the Department of Health continues this valuable role.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as luck 
would have it, this morning I read in the 
Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean daily that, last evening, the health 
action committee of the chamber of commerce of La Baie and the 
Lower Saguenay asked elected officials to oppose any cut affecting 
the health sector in my region, so as to preserve what took so long 
to obtain.
<P>
	Incidentally, a document clearly shows, and this has been 
confirmed, that cuts of over $131 million have already been made 
in my region, concerning that sector. Most of these cuts were, of 
course, made because of overlapping federal and provincial 
activities in that sector. It goes without saying that, when the 
federal government makes cuts affecting transfer payments for the 
health sector, there is an impact in Quebec.
<P>
	In this bill, the federal government, claiming to be a good 
government, gives itself the right to act directly or indirectly in the 
health sector. It could use its spending power to that end. Indeed, a 
quick look at a few clauses of the bill will tell you that the federal 
government wants to get involved in that sector.
<P>
	Contrary to what one might think, the health department has an 
enormous budget. According to the 1995-96 Estimates, Health 
Canada's operating budget is $1.05 billion, that is $347 million for 
personnel alone and $703 million for goods and services, whereas 
transfer payments amount to $7.4 billion. These figures 
immediately tell the story about the costs of overlapping activities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16314"> 16314 </A></B>
<P>
	We must ask ourselves what the federal government does with 
that $1.05 billion. Under the pretext of developing a strategy, the 
federal government, to put it bluntly, is once again interfering in 
a field of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Let me give you a few examples, starting with the new horizons 
program. This program used to help our seniors in several ways, for 
example by allowing them to buy entertainment and recreation 
equipment and participate in group activities. This program was, at 
least in my riding, well received by golden age clubs and by 
associations for the defence of retirees' rights. It gave some clubs 
and associations the tools to help our seniors, for whom these 
organizations are often the only resource available. In addition, 
these tools and activities helped participants stay in good physical 
and mental health.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	After over a year of consultations, of shelving the various 
demands with respect to the new horizons program, our seniors are 
being offered a totally new program that is focused on health. The 
federal government is cutting a service in an area of pressing need 
and jumping head-first into another area where Quebec was 
present, where Quebec was already well equipped to deal with the 
situation. This can only be described as a case of wasteful overlap.
<P>
	New horizons is but one example among many others. I could 
also mention programs such as the federal initiative on family 
violence, the national strategy to reduce tobacco use, and the 
pregnancy and child development program, which are still in effect 
in Quebec. Why multiply services? All these contributions show 
that the federal government has no qualms about going ahead with 
its own health and welfare initiatives.
<P>
	They go ahead with these initiatives without considering the fact 
that, in the past few years, Quebec has focused on areas such as 
prevention and fitness. Quebec has also shown leadership in 
occupational health and safety matters.
<P>
	The federal government is only interested in visibility and is 
ready to pay the price. One of its latest initiatives is the national 
forum on health. Again, to achieve visibility, it showed its will to 
intervene in this area without the consent of provincial authorities. 
All provinces without exception openly criticized the federal 
government's attitude in this regard, since it relegated them to a 
position of secondary importance in matters of health.
<P>
	Quebec recently spent several months reviewing the measures 
required to make its system more effective and less costly while 
keeping medically necessary services free for everyone.
<P>
	Quebec did not wait for Ottawa to renew its health care system. 
It took concrete action in this regard. For several months, wide 
public consultations have been held  throughout Quebec so that 
Quebecers can give their opinions and express their needs. I had the 
opportunity to attend these proceedings in my riding last weekend. 
Again, this is a consultation process; this is how we must proceed, 
instead of creating parallel structures that are a shameful waste of 
public funds.
<P>
	Through Bill C-95, the federal government is quietly trying to 
convince us that this harmless looking bill is the bill of the century. 
Quebecers, however, are not fooled; we clearly see what the federal 
government is trying to hide from us.
<P>
	I fully agree with my colleague from Drummond that this House 
should refuse to proceed with Bill C-95 and send the government 
back to the drawing board.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	The time has come for Ottawa to withdraw completely from this 
area and give Quebec the tax points corresponding to its current 
transfer payments in all fairness.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak today 
on Bill C-95, under which the new Department of Health will be 
established.
<P>
	I listened carefully to the member for Calgary Centre. It was 
very clear he had not read the bill. He did not know what he was 
talking about. He was looking at the old bill instead of the new one. 
This is why a new bill was brought in, to save taxpayers' money 
and to have a health system to which all Canadians have access.
<P>
	The Reform Party boasts about its great plan. The United States 
has that great plan, the two tier system that Reform advocates. 
What is happening in the United States system right now? 
According to figures released yesterday, 40 million Americans are 
not covered by any kind of health insurance and 29 million are 
underinsured. Sixty-nine million people do not have proper health 
care coverage. That is what Reform Party members want to give 
Canadians. Canadians do not want that system. They can shove it 
and they know where. Enough is enough.
<P>
	Reform members want to give everything to the provinces so 
they can throw more money at it. We do not think throwing more 
money at the problem is the answer. It is using the money we have 
more efficiently for the modern technology that has come into our 
hospitals and our clinics.
<P>
	When I lived in Saskatchewan I had an operation. Because of 
complications I was a whole month in hospital. Now an appendix 
can be removed and the patient is sent home. How many people 
have triple bypasses? Before they were told to lie in bed and not to 
move for weeks on end. Now they get them up walking the next day 
and they soon send them home. Look at the savings. If we send a 
patient home, we have to send  proper care to the home with them. 
<P>

<B><A NAME="16315"> 16315 </A></B>
<P>
However it is a heck of a lot cheaper than having the patient lie in a 
hospital bed for weeks on end.
<P>
	Canada spends 9.4 per cent of its GDP on health care, far less 
than the U.S., yet every Canadian is covered well by health care. 
Japan spends only 6 per cent of GDP on health care. How can that 
country do it so cheaply? I think it is good management. It is done 
efficiently but Japan also harnesses the modern technology that has 
crept into the health system.
<P>
	We do not need any lessons from the Reform Party. Polls show 
that Canadians are very pleased with our health system. The polls 
also show that the Reform Party is going down and this is why it is 
going down.
<P>
	Yesterday I intervened on the bill briefly when the Bloc 
Quebecois complained that the federal government has no 
jurisdiction in the area of health care. I hope to assure the Bloc 
Quebecois that the government fully appreciates that provinces are 
responsible for all aspects of health care delivery, generally defined 
as hospital and medical services. However, the opinion poll 
indicates that Canadians recognize there remains a need for a 
federal presence in health, just as we have a federal presence in 
other jurisdictions. If changes are made to the Criminal Code, the 
provinces then implement the legislation and the laws that we 
change.
<P>
	This morning the foreign affairs standing committee met and the 
CCC was before us. That is the Canadian corporation which does 
trade with countries. These countries want a federal government 
presence in a deal, otherwise we would not get a deal for a lot of 
these things. So let us not throw the federal government out 
completely.
<P>
	I was very interested in the media conference the former Prime 
Minister of Canada, Pierre Elliott Trudeau had yesterday. He 
cautioned not to decentralize all of the powers because that is when 
this country will fall apart. He advocated a strong central 
government. Here is someone from Quebec who is giving us advice 
that we should heed.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	Public opinion, the media, the members of this House have one 
thing in common: They have a legitimate concern about the future 
health system and the need for continued access to high quality 
services. By defending the Canada Health Act from attack by those 
who advocate user fees and private clinics, as the Reform does, the 
Department of Health protects this country's publicly funded 
universal medicare system.
<P>
	Health care is only one of many factors contributing to health. 
There are also those factors that make and keep people healthy, 
known as the determinants of health. These include the social and 
physical environment, human biology, genetic endowment, 
economic status and individual behaviour.
<P>
	In a recent discussion paper entitled ``Strategies for Population 
Health: Investing in the Health of Canadians'' federal, provincial 
and territorial health ministers provided a framework for action on 
the major determinants of health. It offers a solid basis for setting 
priorities to continue to improve the health of Canadians.
<P>
	The paper recommends three strategic directions. First, it 
recommends strengthening public and government understanding 
of the determinants of health by demonstrating the links between 
social status, economic development, income distribution, 
education and health. Second, it recommends building 
understanding and support among government partners in sectors 
outside of health. Third, it suggests priority initiatives which will 
have a significant impact on population health.
<P>
	I urge all members to put their party politics aside. When we 
have something good, something Canadian, something that will 
keep this country together, something that will provide health care 
service to every Canadian, rich or poor, regardless of where he or 
she lives, let us all get behind it and pass it today.
<P>

	<B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last December 
the government amended the Canadian Environmental Assessment 
Act and recognized the value of participant funding in the 
environmental assessment process. MPs from all sides of the 
House supported this effort to give the public greater access to 
government decision making.
<P>
	Higher levels of public access and consultation allow the 
environmental assessment process to be more representative of the 
Canadian people. As the Minister of the Environment said during 
debate on the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, it is one 
thing to say that people have a say, it is another to give them the 
tools to exercise their right.
<P>
	I agree wholeheartedly with the minister and believe that my Bill 
C-339 will extend this level of access and participation in the 
decision making process without increasing government 
expenditures.
<P>
	I would ask all members of the House to support Bill C-339 
when it comes to the House for a vote in the near future.

Mr. Speaker, today is the 526th birthday of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, the 
first Guru of the Sikh religion.
<P>
	Guru Nanak evolved a completely new faith. He presented to the 
people his vision of an ideal faith of spiritual deliverance, human 
equality and justice.
<P>
	The basic ethical beliefs that Sikhism holds dearly are 
democracy, non-violence, peace, religious identity, family life, 
hard work, advancement and human rights. Sikhism teaches 
truthful living with emphasis on selfless service, tolerance, 
compassion, love, contentment, humility, equality, humbleness and 
well-being for all.

	In a ceremony on the Rainbow Bridge I accepted a plaque on 
behalf of the Minister of National Revenue and his staff at Canada 
Customs by the Independent Order of Foresters child print 
program. The non-profit organization accounts for over one million 
members in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom. Its 
involvement comprises a great number of projects geared to help 
families.
<P>
	I congratulate publicly the IOF and the revenue department for 
their devotion to the protection of children. As parents, as 
community leaders and as concerned citizens, we understand that 
nothing causes more pain and anguish than a missing child.
<P>
	The minister of revenue has committed his department to the 
cause, but when it comes to missing children, one is too many.

my leader, the member for Sherbrooke, and Progressive 
Conservative Party colleagues I wish to pay tribute to Yitzhak 
Rabin, the late Prime Minister of Israel.
<P>
	Mr. Rabin's life mirrored the history of his country. He fought 
for its creation, its survival and its peace. It has been said that only 
soldiers can make peace for they know all too well the price of war.
<P>
	Mr. Rabin recognized the only guarantee of Israel's survival was 
to make peace with those who had once vowed to destroy it. For the 
next generation of Israelis and all generations after them he wanted 
to ensure a future free of bloodshed. He made peace with the 
enemies of Israel, he said to save lives. Now that he has given his 
life for that worthiest of causes, let us honour him by embracing 
and supporting his courageous work.
<P>
	My colleagues and I extend our condolences to Mr. Rabin's 
family and the people of Israel. The world has lost a great leader 
and one of its noblest spirits.

	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (York North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
last night I attended a memorial service in Toronto to honour the 
life of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. It was an emotional 
evening. Over 6,000 members of our community joined together to 
recognize the gifts Mr. Rabin had bestowed upon the people of 
Israel and upon all of us through his endless pursuit of peace.
<P>
	Mr. Rabin dedicated his life to his country. As a soldier he fought 
for Israel's survival. As a prime minister he fought for peace.
<P>
	Saturday, November 3, perhaps marked the pinnacle ofMr. Rabin's quest when he spoke and sung of peace in front of 
more than 100,000 people in Tel Aviv. How tragic for this to be the 
end. How tragic for him not to be able to see the results of his life's 
work. How tragic for the murderer to have been in the crowd, to 
have heard Rabin's words of peace and not to have heeded them.

	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as we approach

courageous sacrifice of our war veterans, we should be focusing on 
the way that our troops from coast to coast fought for democracy 
and freedom in a united Canada.
<P>
<B>(1405 )</B>
<P>
	Unfortunately on October 26 the Bloc member for Charlesbourg 
issued a press release calling for Quebec members of the military 
to desert their post and join a new Quebec army the day after a yes 
vote. This has infuriated many veterans as well as other Canadians, 
including many constituents in my riding of Red Deer.
<P>
	The action is so reprehensible that the government must take 
immediate corrective action. Inciting mutiny in the Canadian 
forces cannot be tolerated and the government's response to this 
outrage should make it perfectly clear.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, just ten 
days after our Canadian neighbours rallied in Montreal on the eve 
of the Quebec referendum, the true face of English Canada is 
already emerging. The National Citizens Coalition is launching an 
ad campaign to express its deep-seated opposition to the concept of 
distinct society status for Quebec.
<P>
	After the provincial premiers backed off last week, the NCC's 
40,000 members are now clearly opposed to what they consider as 
unfair preferential treatment for Quebec. This is a bitter 
disappointment for Quebecers, who were deeply touched by 
English Canada's show of affection at Canada Place, three days 
before the referendum. Where have all our friends gone?

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
veterans of the merchant navy who served during wartime provided 
a vital function in situations where the death rate was as high or 
higher than in the armed services and where like other veterans 
they were captured and imprisoned as prisoners of war. Yet for 
many decades they were treated as second class veterans deprived 
of many benefits.
<P>
	Even with the belated passage of the Merchant Navy Veterans 
Act in 1992, merchant navy veterans were not granted fully equal 
status with other veterans. The act contains definitions of service in 
the merchant navy that are more restrictive than for veterans in the 
other services and therefore denies benefits to some veterans who 
are clearly entitled to them.
<P>
	As we approach November 11, the NDP calls on the government 
to treat veterans of the merchant navy in exactly the same way as it 
treats other veterans by including them in the War Veterans 
Allowances Act.

Speaker, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was cut down by an 
assassin's bullets minutes after making a speech at a huge peace 
rally. Mr. Rabin's assassination is first and foremost an attempt to 
derail the peace process in the Middle East. His murderer thought 
that, by killing the messenger, he would quash all the efforts made 
in the past several years to find a peaceful solution to the problems 
in this troubled area.
<P>
	However, the demise of this great man will not succeed in 
crushing the hope for peace that inspires the people of Israel. There 
is no doubt that peace will come to the Middle East, and no crime, 
however repugnant, will prevent this. At this time of great sorrow, 
Israelis can count on the support and sympathy of Canadians. We, 
too, are resolutely committed to peace.

Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister has declared the week of

traditionally, since the end of the first world war, Canadians from 
all over the country gather at their local war memorial on the 
morning of November 11 to pay tribute, in various ceremonies, to 
their fellow Canadians who died in combat.
<P>
	This year, as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the end of the 
second world war, Canadians have planned special commemorative 
activities for the entire week leading up to Remembrance Day. We 
will be paying tribute to the veterans of both world wars, the 
Korean War and UN peacekeeping operations. These veterans 
served their country with courage and distinction. We are proud of 
them and pleased that the government designated a week in their 
honour.

intents and purposes, still has not done anything about 
unemployment. A series of nice documents on employment and 
growth were released, but Canadians are still waiting for the 
concrete actions and results expected from a government.
<P>
	Unable to make the necessary budget decisions, the Liberal 
government's only job creation initiative was to force the 
unemployed to join the welfare rolls, thus triggering an increase in 
provincial deficits.
<P>
	We all know the consequences of that lack of vision. Hardly any 
new jobs were created in the past year, and economic growth has 
suddenly come to a halt this year, with no reaction from the Bank of 
Canada and the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	This government must fulfil the promises it made to Canadians 
two years ago. Its laissez faire attitude can definitely not be 
considered an effective job creation policy.

<P>
	Veterans Week will increase awareness among Canadians of the 
contribution of those who served during wartime and in 
peacekeeping activities throughout the world.
<P>
	One of the activities designated for Veterans Week was the

Newfoundland on November 5. The run was arranged to create a 
link between the 50th anniversary of the end of the second world

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Quebecers 
are beginning to get used to playing cat and mouse with the federal 
government. I will explain. Initially, the Prime Minister told 
everyone very clearly that there was no question of discussing the 
constitution, even during the Quebec referendum. Then he changed 
his mind and talked of possible administrative changes in order to 
decentralize Canadian confederation. Then he spoke of legislative 
changes for doing so, and, most recently, he has said nothing more 
about it at all.
<P>
	The government is not responding any more. We did, however, 
learn today at about 12.30 p.m. that a ministerial committee on 
national unity had been set up with a mandate to consider possible 
changes to confederation.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs or 
for the Deputy Prime Minister, whoever wants to respond. What is 
the mandate of this committee, exactly? Is it preparing to propose 
constitutional changes or just administrative ones, or both?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the committee in question is a group of ministers in the 
federal cabinet, who are going to look at all options for 
change-both administratively and constitutionally.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, will the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs be heading the new 
committee that follows in a long series of committees, including 
the Charest, Beaudoin, Dobbie, Castonguay, Edwards and other 
committees? Can the minister tell us whether this is not a simply a 
strategy on the part of the government to play for time, because it is 
unable to reach a consensus with its other partners in Canada? Is 
this not simply a snow job?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when we set up the program review committee last year, 
the opposition thought it was not going to produce results either. 
The result was the best budget in 50 years, which changed the 
structure of the federal budget and enabled us to recover our fiscal 
responsibility.
<P>
	Why should we not hope for as much from a committee that is 
vital to the survival of the federation?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, given the 
government's unenviable record in constitutional matters, the 
many changes in its position toward Quebecers in the past month 
and a half and its inability to reach a consensus with its partners in 
order to meet Quebec's demands, should the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, rather than bust his suspenders over 
some vague committee that has yet to produce any results, not 
reassure people and explain the exact mandate and the reporting 
procedures of the committee?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council

words. How could a committee only mentioned today have

creating nearly 500,000 new jobs. This is what Canadians wanted, 
and we have maintained industrial harmony, while improving our 
budget. These are perfectly respectable results. I would have 
preferred the official opposition to have done a much better job 
of defending the rights of Quebecers-something we have done.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, recently, 
very recently, we heard about the real problem that all Canadians 
are facing and that-we can say it-more than 49 per cent of 
Quebecers have identified as one of their major problems and one 
that they wanted to resolve through sovereignty. I am talking about 
employment. According to the Canadian Labour Congress, the 
government has abandoned the job creation strategy that got it 
elected, in favour of right wing policies that will contribute to 
making the middle class grow poorer and poorer and create 
disparities across Canada.
<P>
	Will the government recognize that, apart from its infrastructure 
program, whose benefits are now coming to an end, no concrete 
steps have been taken for more than two years with regard to job 
creation?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I respectfully submit to the 
hon. member that she should look at the facts. That may be an 
unusual experience for her but it would be very helpful under the 
circumstances.
<P>
	The reality is that last week a Statistics Canada report indicated 
that since the election of the government in the fall of 1993 over 
half a billion full time permanent jobs have been created.
<P>
	That is not something to be ignored. It shows there is a growing 
strength in the economy. In Quebec a substantial reduction in the 
unemployment rate has taken place by almost 2 percentage points.
<P>
	Rather than relying on the somewhat dubious claims of the 
Canadian Labour Congress, the member should look at the hard 
reality of facts as presented by Statistics Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the truth 
of the matter is that the minister does not take into account 
population growth when he boasts about such things. The Quebec 
government, on the other hand, has every reason to be proud of its 
performance because, despite this government's failure to act, it 
has managed, through Minister Paillé's plan, to promote job 
creation.
<P>
	How can this government boast about its performance, when we 
have 20,000 more people on welfare in Quebec this year, when the 
unemployment rate is 11.2 per cent, and when the number of 
people who are out of work exceeds 400,000? How can this 
government be proud of its performance, when it has nothing to 
offer and when everyone can see-as more than 49 per cent of 
Quebecers did on October 30-that deep changes are urgently 
needed?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, surely the hon. member 
recognizes that one of the major difficulties with helping to create 
jobs has been the uncertainty that has come about as a result of 
efforts to separate Canada. It is very difficult to attract investments, 
to provide for new job development when employers are not sure 
what the economic circumstances will be.
<P>
	In spite of the real problems created by that uncertainty which 
the hon. member and her colleagues have caused over the past year, 
in the past three months 33,000 new jobs have been created in the 
province of Quebec.
<P>
	In the hon. member's riding alone the unemployment rate has 
dropped from 12.8 per cent when we came into office to 8.6 per 
cent. The hon. member should take pride in this.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there are competing visions in the country of where 
Canada should be headed after the Quebec referendum.
<P>
	One side represented by the government wants to go back to 
elements of the failed Meech Lake and Charlottetown accords. The 
other side represented by Reform and some provincial 
governments wants to move forward to decentralize certain key 
social functions of the federal government while strengthening the 
economic union at the same time.
<P>
	Now a special committee of cabinet has been set up to design a 
post-referendum strategy. My question to the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs is: What is the national unity committee 
of cabinet doing to ensure this alternative federalist vision is being 
considered, and what minister in the cabinet represents that 
position?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on the second question, the  solidarity of cabinet prevents 
me from answering. The leader of the third party should know that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16321"> 16321 </A></B>
<P>
	On the first question, we have been able to put together a 
package of measures that so far has united the country because we 
have tried to create jobs, we have tried to increase economic 
growth and we have tried to increase investment.
<P>
	In terms of decentralization, we must recognize that 
decentralization is not a panacea to all the ills of the federation. 
Decentralization is justified only when it means that services are 
given by the levels of government best equipped to give them.
<P>
	In terms of decentralization we want to serve Canadians, and 
Canadians once again are not served by applying an ideology of 
decentralization. They are served by levels of government that 
decide on the powers that each level should exercise according to 
how efficiently it can deliver services to Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, despite the polls and the lessons of Meech and 
Charlottetown the government is still favouring a distinct society 
clause and constitutional veto for Quebec. Both of these concepts 
are the products of a top down, legalistic approach to national unity 
which has not worked for 30 years.
<P>
	Recognizing distinctiveness in Canada is not the problem; it is 
how to do it. The alternative bottom up approach would be to give 
each province the practical tools to protect and nurture its own 
distinctiveness, and real control over resources, social services, 
language and culture.
<P>
	Is the national unity committee of cabinet giving serious 
consideration to this alternative approach to achieve provincial 
distinctiveness? If so, who is the spokesperson on that committee 
for that alternative approach?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, all the ministers in cabinet, including those on the cabinet 
committee, want Canada to continue as the country with the best 
quality of life in the world. Therefore none of them will be the 
advocate of one side or another. All together we will try to create a 
consensus on the package of measures that will solve the present 
constitutional problems.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the biggest mistake the federal politicians made with 
respect to Charlottetown and Meech was that they tried to draft 
unity proposals themselves behind closed doors, by ministerial 
committees and by ministerial conferences. The Canadian people 
were shut out of the building process.
<P>
	If we have learned anything from this referendum campaign it is 
that the federal government does not have a monopoly on brains or 
on patriotism. The Canadian people saved the referendum 
campaign and their voices should be heard in this post-referendum 
strategy.
<P>
	Instead of following the traditional closed door approach to 
developing unity proposals, what is the government doing to bring 
the Canadian people into the development of its post referendum 
strategy?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I said, that group of ministers will get together and look 
at all the ways, all the possibilities for change in the federation.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday, the Governor of the Bank of Canada candidly 
said that the lack of economic growth during the first six months of 
1995 was largely due to the fact that interest rates rose too sharply 
last winter, a situation created by the governor himself.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, could you please ask hon. members 
to keep quiet?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Put your question, please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Will the Minister of Finance recognize that the 
Bank of Canada misjudged the situation of the Canadian economy 
and should have started lowering interest rates much sooner than it 
did, so as to help create, not eliminate, jobs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the Governor of the 
Bank of Canada said there were several reasons explaining high 
real interest rates, and he mentioned two of them. One is the need 
to put our fiscal house in order. In that regard, he said that the 
federal government and the provinces, except for one, had already 
started that process.
<P>
	Second, the governor clearly mentioned the political uncertainty 
for which the BQ and the PQ are responsible.
<P>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="16322"> 16322 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister was careful not to mention that the  governor 
gave, as the primary and most important factor, the situation of the 
Canadian debt, which is the responsibility of the finance minister.
<P>
	Earlier, I listened to the minister when he was discussing what he 
had accomplished so far. Do you know what the Liberals have 
accomplished in the last two years? They have managed to 
maintain the number of unemployed and to increase the number of 
welfare recipients. This is what they have actually managed to do.
<P>
	Considering that, throughout the referendum campaign, the 
Minister of Finance kept repeating that he had a real influence on 
Canadian monetary policy, are we to understand that he wilfully let 
interest rates go up, so as to eliminate thousands of jobs for 
Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
</B><B>Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I think that 
Quebecers made a decision that will result in lower interest rates. 
Indeed, the day after the referendum, interest rates fell by 147 basis 
points, which is almost a record.

	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Reform Party has a new Canadian agenda for change which would 
give more powers to the provinces for social programs. Incredibly, 
the Minister for Human Resources Development has threatened to 
cut transfer payments to British Columbia for its changes to 
welfare.
<P>
	After having already cut transfer payments, why is the minister 
breaking the Liberal promise for change given at Verdun by the 
Prime Minister by threatening British Columbia?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is not so incredible that a 
minister of the crown upholds the laws of Canada. The laws of 
Canada under the Canada assistance plan state very clearly that 
individual provinces should not cut transfer payments for those 
from out of province. That protects a basic right enshrined in the 
Constitution, the right of mobility. All Canadians should be treated 
equally. Even though they may be poor Canadians, they should still 
get equal treatment.
<P>
	I would like to clarify one important point for the hon. member. I 
have not been threatening British Columbia. I have said very 
clearly that there are many opportunities for us to try to resolve 
these problems. Some very serious conditions should be addressed. 
The provinces have set up a forum called the Council of Social 
Ministers. They are supposed to be meeting to arrive at a common 
approach to these issues.
<P>
	It would be unfortunate for one province to take unilateral action 
when all the provinces have tried to come together to find a 
co-operative approach. I am quite prepared to meet with them and 
deal with it.
<P>
	It would be much more important for the hon. member to be 
directing her concerns to the ministers of the B.C. government who 
seem to be thwarting or short circuiting a very effective and 
co-operative federal-provincial process.
<P>
<B>(1435 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
welfare reforms in B.C. are not illegal. In fact, if the minister was 
familiar with the charter he would know that section 6(4) clearly 
demonstrates that B.C.'s changes are legal.
<P>
	Canadians are demanding fundamental change to government. 
The provinces are demanding more freedom. The minister is 
jeopardizing national unity by threatening the provinces, especially 
when his legal facts are wrong.
<P>
	The minister is meddling in provincial jurisdiction where he has 
no legal right. Why will the minister not admit that his empty 
grandstanding is nothing more than another federal government 
power grab?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is a time in the history of 
the country when all regions should be building bridges, not walls 
and barriers.
<P>
	The hon. member, as a federal member of Parliament, is 
endorsing actions which are clearly contrary to the law under the 
Canada assistance plan. All of a sudden the hon. member seems to 
have acquired great powers of legal judgment.
<P>
	I would simply refer the hon. member to the Finlay case in the 
federal court, which clearly substantiates the responsibility of the 
federal government to uphold the basic conditions under the 
Canada assistance plan. I would recommend that before the hon. 
member starts to lecture people on the law that she should first read 
the law.

to do about it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to suggest to the hon. member that if he has 
evidence in this regard and if he is serious with his allegation, he 
should go outside, make that accusation, stand for it, explain it, and 
give all the details.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would suggest the hon. 
minister request a briefing from his colleague, the Minister of 
National Revenue.
<P>
	Foreign service officers have been nailed for declaring 200 to 
300 bottles of wine when customs officers have found from 600 to 
800 bottles, whole wine cellars. Unfortunately, there is no little 
form for customs officers to fill out to let DFAIT know what its 
employees have been up to. Other than having their shipments  
confiscated, these civil servants are not penalized in any way.
<P>
	I ask the minister: Is a diplomatic passport a membership card to 
an elite in order to put themselves above the laws of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the foreign service officer returning from overseas is 
treated just like any other Canadian when it comes to customs 
examination of their possessions. Any infractions that are found 
will be prosecuted or treated as appropriate, just as other Canadians 
are treated.
<P>
	If the hon. member has any evidence of any particular individual 
or indeed any organization that is evading the law, I would 
appreciate that information. Until such time, to come into this 
House and insult a group of dedicated public servants who work for 
Canada overseas in our trade and diplomatic missions appears to 
me to be totally irresponsible and quite uncalled for.

	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	The health minister of British Columbia is quoted as saying that 
until the hon. minister accepts his constitutional responsibility for 
protecting salmon there cannot be a workable responsible public 
consultation process on the cancellation of the Kemano project.
<P>
	Is the minister aware of what the province has done concerning 
the cancellation of Kemano? How is the minister fulfilling his 
constitutional obligations?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for giving notice of this question, 
important as it is to the people of British Columbia.
<P>
	The suggestion of the minister of health in British Columbia to 
the Government of Canada that it is holding up or is stopping a 
public consultation process is absolutely false. It is an absolute red 
herring.
<P>
	The people of British Columbia should know that the 
Government of British Columbia and Alcan have engaged in secret 
negotiations. They have prepared a secret report on the outcome of 
these negotiations. They have refused to give that report to the 
Government of Canada or to any other interested stakeholder.
<P>
	I would say to the Government of British Columbia that 
managing the salmon resource is not a bingo game, it is not a game 
of chance. It has to be done properly and it should be done openly.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Quebec accounts for 25 per cent of the total population of Canada 
and is home to 29 per cent of those living in inadequate housing in 
Canada. Yet, in the past five years, it has been allocated only 19 per 
cent of the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation's budget.
<P>
	My question is for the minister of public works. How can the 
minister justify the fact that less money is available to the poor in 
Quebec than in the other provinces and what new way does he have 
to meet the glaring need for social housing in Quebec?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
raises an important question, but I think the record ought to be 
cleared.
<P>
	The Government of Quebec chose not to participate in various 
housing programs over a period of a number of years. For the 
benefit of the House, it should be noted that the first public housing 
program was available across the country from 1950 to 1985. 
Quebec chose not to participate. The second public housing 
program was available from 1964 to 1985. Quebec chose not to 
participate until 1968. Despite four lost years, the province still 
secured almost 25 per cent of the national units. The first rent 
supplement program was available from 1971 to 1985. Quebec 
chose not to participate until 1978.
<P>
<B>(1455)</B>
<P>
	The facts are very clear. The Government of Quebec chose not to 
participate in these national programs. As a result, the figures to 
which the hon. member refers are somewhat bogus in view of those 
facts.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister's remarks are very hypocritical because, in the last federal 
budget, there was a $300 million cut in social housing. This 
department and its minister are heartless. Quebec has lost $950 
million over the past five years, yet they have nothing to offer, 
nothing new to offer in terms of social housing, except for-

for these misunderstandings with respect to social housing in 
Quebec.
<P>
	In light of the minister's comments and of repeated cuts in social 
housing, are we to understand that the federal government is 
officially withdrawing from this area and planning to shift to the 
provinces and municipalities the responsibility for meeting ever 
increasing social housing needs?

<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada

question. It seems that the facts have struck a rather sensitive nerve 
in the hon. member.
<P>
	The House should also be aware that since we have come to 
office, this terrible minister of housing and the Minister of Finance, 
it should be clearly stated: $4 million was provided for the Creeson 
initiative in Montreal; $5 million was paid out for Réparaction 
programs for 950 households; $5 million for rooming house RRAP; 
$15 million cost shared for households under Maisons lézardées; 
private-public partnerships, 13 projects in Quebec. We extended 
the first home loan insurance program; almost 24 per cent of the 
take up is in Quebec.

	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
have been told by CAVEAT of the details surrounding the brutal 
murder and rape of Ann Marie Bloskie. Her murderer was six 
weeks from his 18th birthday when he beat Ann Marie to death 
with a rock, sexually assaulted her corpse, left her, returned the 
next day and sexually assaulted her again.
<P>
	Why did the justice system not demand that this murderer be 
tried in adult court, since his actions are not actions of a young 
offender?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Young Offenders Act provided 
at the time of that offence and since then that young people, age 16 
and 17, can be transferred to adult court for a trial on such charges. 
If transferred to adult court they face adult sentences.
<P>
	The fact is that the Young Offenders Act contains those 
provisions. As the hon. member well knows, it is the provinces' 
responsibility to administer them. It is up to the courts and the 
prosecutors to apply them.

non-consensual sex videos and he would  require lifelong treatment 
and counselling. In our new Canada, this murderer would get 
lifelong treatment while he is in prison.
<P>
	Since the solicitor general has allowed this murderer to be 
released, what assurances can he give Canadians that this killer will 
not jeopardize more Canadian women? Why has the solicitor 
general not allowed publication of his name so that Canadian 
women can be protected?

	It is up to the local police authorities, in light of local privacy

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DEPARTMENTOFHEALTHACT">DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-95, 
an act to establish the department of health and to amend and repeal 
certain other acts, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am glad to have a few 
more minutes. Before being cut off I was responding to Bloc 
Quebecois members yesterday when they stated that the federal 
government had no right dabbling in health care. They failed to 
realize that a country must have certain standards. Hopefully the 
act will provide the standards.
<P>
	I had experience with the health services of the province many 
years ago when it brought in a universal health care system. Line 
ups were so long that patients started paying doctors under the table 
to jump the queue. We do not want that. It demonstrates that people 
who have money get the care prior to the ones who do not have 
money. That is not the Liberal way of doing things and it is not the 
Canadian way of doing things.
<P>
	We have heard the Prime Minister and the Minister of Health 
repeat over and over in the House that whether we are rich or poor 
we get the same health care, the same health services.
<P>
	The bill hopes to save taxpayers money by doing things more 
efficiently, by co-operating with the provinces, the municipalities 
and the federal government. How can we best deliver health 
services taking into account today's technologies? People are sent 
home almost the same day they are operated on or the next day. By 
using these technologies hopefully we will be able to do things 
more efficiently.
<P>
	This morning the Reform Party was jumping up, shouting and 
saying that there was nothing new in the bill. Its members offered 
their proposal. Their proposal is the American proposal where over 
69 million Americans do not have proper health care. The polls 
show very clearly that Canadians do not want that.
<P>
	My daughter just graduated from university and is now working. 
In the time of budget cuts when we had to reduce our deficit and 
our public debt I asked her as a young Canadian going out into the 
workforce who could pay for her health care, et cetera, what she 
would like the federal government to protect. Her answer was very 
interesting. Of all things the federal government is involved in she 
chose health care. She asked us not to touch health care. This is a 
Canadian starting out in the workforce, having graduated from 
university.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	We are not building Canada for ourselves. We are building 
Canada for future generations, for our children and for their 
children. This is why the federal government has to take leadership. 
We cannot turn it over to jurisdictions where there will be no 
national standards. We cannot turn it over to a system where in one 
province we have to pay a lot more for an operation than in another 
province. Then people start flocking to the province where services 
are more available.
<P>
	A personal friend of mine flew in from Florida for an operation 
in a Toronto hospital. He was a Canadian on vacation in Florida. 
Unfortunately there was not a bed for him. He had to fly to a 
Saskatoon hospital but did not make it. Is that the kind of health 
care we want, or do we want the kind of health care that when I 
need a triple bypass I get it right away because otherwise it may be 
too late?
<P>
	Let us build a country wherein it will not be too late to have an 
operation. Let us build a country where everyone has equal access 
when they need it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I will 
start with some general comments on Bill C-95 before the House 
today. I quite agree with the Reform Party's concern about the 
meagreness of our legislative menu, but our positions converge so 
far and no further.
<P>
	This government has made a habit of using ostensibly harmless 
bills to introduce provisions in which it assumes more and more 
powers. That is the case with Bill C-95. This bill establishes the 
Department of Health and amends and repeals certain acts. The 
purpose of this legislation is first of all to change the name of the 
department. What could be more ordinary?
<P>
	After a closer look, however, we see that this bill contains 
provisions that are quite the opposite of the changes we were 
promised during the referendum campaign. It is this aspect of the 
bill, these new measures that are supposed to clarify the mandate of 
the federal Department of Health and will in fact increase its 
importance, which are revealing. Clause 4(2)(<I>a</I>) and(<I>b</I>) is 
particularly disturbing.
<P>
	This clause provides, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-the minister's powers, duties and functions relating to health include the 
following matters:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>a</I>) the promotion and preservation of the physical, mental and social 
well-being of the people of Canada;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>b</I>) the protection of the people of Canada against risks to health and the 
spreading of diseases;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	On the pretext of intervening on behalf of the well-being of the 
people of Canada, Ottawa could outflank the provinces in an area 
that is a provincial responsibility. These two clauses in Bill C-95 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16329"> 16329 </A></B>
<P>
give an  indication of the very broad application this bill might 
have. It may have serious repercussions.
<P>
	Need we recall that the Canadian Constitution of 1867 
specifically recognizes health as an exclusive responsibility of the 
provinces? I know this government would rather not hear about the 
Constitution. That is just too bad. As long as this government keeps 
violating the Constitution, it will hear about it from Quebec, at any 
rate.
<P>
	The federal government's intrusion in this provincial jurisdiction 
flies in the face of the very principles of Canadian federalism. And 
then they wonder why it does not work. They are trying to use the 
power of disallowance, based on considerations such as national 
interest, peace and good government, and of course the 
government's spending powers, to again restrict the prerogatives of 
the provinces.
<P>
	However, as the federal government tries to encroach on 
jurisdictions that are exclusive to the provinces, its financial 
contribution decreases steadily.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	In less than 20 years, the federal government's contribution to 
health care funding dropped from 45.9 per cent in 1977 to an 
expected 28 per cent in 1997. Finally, to divert attention from its 
financial withdrawal, the federal government proposed in its last 
budget a more flexible transfer payment formula under which all 
the money goes into a single envelope called the Canada social 
transfer. The federal government announced in the same breath that 
it would withdraw unilaterally and cut payments to Quebec by 
$308 million in 1995-96 and by more than $587 million in 
1997-98.
<P>
	The provinces were given the choice of cutting in either 
education, health or welfare. What a great example of 
decentralization and co-operation. Talk about flexible federalism. 
When a government can no longer afford to pay, it must have the 
basic decency not to try to impose its national standards and 
objectives more vigorously at the same time.
<P>
	Since coming to power, the Liberal government has chosen to 
keep its deficit from growing by attacking social programs and 
going after the most vulnerable in our society. Yet, it is still trying 
to pursue Trudeau's old dream of controlling the provincial health 
care systems through national standards.
<P>
	The federal government is now getting ready to invade the 
provinces' jurisdiction through the back door. For example, 
subclause 4(2)(c) of the bill gives the federal Department of Health 
the power to conduct investigations and research into public health. 
You may think that this is a noble objective. But how will the 
federal government conduct these investigations and this research?
<P>
	Even though it is not mentioned in the bill, should the federal 
government have access to all the information needed to carry out 
its mission? Most of this information is often held by health 
organizations subject to provincial legislation.
<P>
	This whole debate may appear pretty technical, but it may lead to 
many futile squabbles and discussions simply because the federal 
government does not respect its own fundamental law.
<P>
	Of course, Bill C-95 shows our federal big brother's 
commitment to look after the health of all Canadians. It does not, 
however, tell us what steps the federal Department of Health will 
take to fulfil these noble ambitions. This is no accident. It is not in 
the federal government's interests to remind us once again that it is 
continuing its attempt to encroach on our jurisdiction over health 
matters.
<P>
	In fact, on November 2, in the debate on second reading of bill 
C-95, the hon. parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Health 
plainly admitted that ``its renewed commitment to a long and 
glorious tradition has inspired Liberal governments, politicians of 
every party and Canadian people over many years, indeed over 
many decades''. Later, her Liberal colleague, the hon. member for 
Pierrefonds-Dollard, added that the Minister of Health had, and I 
quote: ``strongly and successfully defended the principles 
championed for half a century by the Liberal Party, while 
developing Canada's health care system''.
<P>
	It is obvious that, through Bill C-95 in particular, the Minister of 
Health is carrying on the work that Marc Lalonde and Monique 
Bégin started. And after that, we wonder what is wrong with the 
federal system. Upholding a long and glorious tradition of 
duplication, overlap and encroachment, now I have seen it all. Just 
days ago, the Prime Minister promised major changes to 
accommodate the provinces, and Quebec in particular.
<P>
	But today, we have before us yet another bill put forward by the 
federal government, which is doing everything it can to centralize 
and once again intrude on provincial areas of jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	To paraphrase no committee chairman Michel Bélanger, this is 
the beauty of it. If the government is really committed to reducing 
the deficit, it should start by eliminating duplication and overlap 
with respect to health matters. But, on the contrary, Trudeau's 
followers are carrying on his work. I could mention, among others 
things, the fact that the department allocates important budgets for 
programs and projects that already exist in Quebec. Here are some 
examples: the strategy for the integration of handicapped people, 
the fight against family violence, the new horizons program, the 
seniors secretariat, the fight against tobacco, the anti-drug strategy, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16330"> 16330 </A></B>
<P>
the strategy against AIDS, the program on  pregnancy and child 
development, the forum on health, and so on.
<P>
	What happened to the commitment made barely fifteen days ago 
by the Prime Minister, who promised that changes would be made?
<P>
	You will understand that, as an elected member representing 
Quebec, I simply cannot support Bill C-95.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Raymond Bonin (Nickel Belt, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to express my support for Bill C-95.
<P>
	In this connection, I would like to discuss what Health Canada 
has accomplished and recall that our country is very proud, and 
rightly so, of its health care system.
<P>
	In fact, there is no other system like it in the world. We also have 
the Canada Health Act, which contains the five basic principles of 
our system: universality, accessibility, comprehensiveness, 
portability, and public administration.
<P>
	Our health system has contributed enormously to our excellent 
quality of life. Furthermore, co-operation at the international level 
helps us stay abreast of new advances in health care in many other 
countries. Thanks to this co-operation, users and providers are 
informed of what is being done in the rest of the world. All 
industrialized countries exchange information and, as a result, are 
able to act efficiently and effectively.
<P>
	Canada has already introduced a number of measures to help 
achieve its goal of renewing the health care system. We are 
reinforcing the community aspect of health care, improving the 
role of consumers with respect to health care and seeking a more 
integrated approach to health which goes beyond health care. A 
large proportion of our present and future interventions is focused 
on the principal factors that determine our health. A fundamental 
truth has transpired, and it is that health is more than just care. This 
is an incentive to understand the complex set of factors that create a 
society whose members are all in the best possible health.
<P>
	Governments and communities are examining social, economic, 
physical and psychological aspects as well as other factors. The 
work being done in these areas supports and complements the 
services provided by the regular health care system.
<P>
	We are beginning to understand the close and complex 
connections between factors that determine our health, and our 
decision-making is aimed at improving the quality of health care 
services. The national forum on health plays an important role in 
this respect.
<P>
	In fact, the forum's role is to project a model of health care for 
the twenty-first century. The forum's team consists of 24 Canadian 
men and women: health professionals, volunteers and consumers 
who have come from across the country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	While our appreciation of the complexity of the interrelated 
factors that contribute to overall health has grown, so too have the 
challenges in making effective choices about how to allocate 
increasingly limited resources.
<P>
	The federal government has taken a leadership role in 
communicating with all stakeholders, including the public, in 
terms of the kind of future systems we want and can afford. The 
national forum on health will play an important role in this regard.
<P>
	If we are to preserve and improve our health care system we 
must first decide what is essential. In this regard the national forum 
on health and other bodies will provide important advice to the 
government.

	One of the jobs of the members of the forum is to engage in 
honest and open discussions with Canadians about influences on 
our health and on our health care system in the coming years.
<P>
	Four working groups have already been set up and are 
responsible for various aspects: decisions based on convincing 
evidence, health determiners, values and achieving a balance.
<P>
	The forum was set up in response to Canadians' concerns, and 
Canadians are justifiably proud of their health system.
<P>
	The forum is trying to find ways to improve both the health of 
Canadians and the effectiveness and efficiency of health care 
services, and public participation is vital to the fulfilment of its 
mandate.
<P>
	Through a range of activities, the members of the forum are 
informing the public about the problems and the options for 
improvement of health and health care services in Canada.
<P>
	The forum's broad public consultation will enable all Canadians 
to help develop recommendations.
<P>
	Every Canadian will have an opportunity to express his or her 
values and convictions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The federal government is also working in concert with its 
provincial and territorial counterparts through the conference of 
ministers of health. One of our common priorities in order to 
enhance the appropriateness and quality of health care has been to 
promote and strengthen the use of clinical practise guidelines. We 
want to orient health care on which practices work best for different 
groups at risk.

<P>
	I would also like to point out that Canada is renowned worldwide 
as a centre for research, treatment and pharmaceutical 
developments.
<P>
	Specifically, our country is a leader in the area of chemotherapy. 
Throughout the world, researchers and practitioners are investing 
in work of great significance to the millions of Canadians suffering 
from cancer or an infectious disease, and to those who are at their 
side in their struggle. The work done so far has had tangible results.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In 1990 approximately 413,000 Canadians who had been 
diagnosed with cancer within the previous decade were still alive. 
More than one-third of these people had lived more than five years 
since their initial diagnosis. Many of them had chemotherapy to 
thank for their success in fighting cancer. This year alone a further 
125,000 Canadians will be diagnosed with cancer. They will look 
to advances in treatment such as chemotherapy for answers and 
hope.
<P>
	In addition to chemotherapy, vaccines play another important 
role in our public health efforts. For example, while the hepatitis B 
vaccine is used successfully in the prevention of infection it also 
prevents the development of cancer of the liver. Another example 
is the BCG vaccine which is accepted as a therapeutic agent for 
treating cancer of the bladder and is also known to be used in the 
prevention of tuberculosis especially in countries where the 
incidence of tuberculosis is high.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We also know that the appearance of resistant strains in the case 
of tuberculosis, for instance, is a cause of grave concern among 
public health authorities.
<P>
	In a world in which international travel has become 
commonplace, experience has shown that the progress we have 
made in fighting infectious diseases within our borders is no longer 
enough.
<P>
	These factors are so many reasons why Canada puts such 
emphasis on health issues. Many of our health care priorities centre 
on the use of chemotherapy.
<P>
	Health Canada is both a partner and a facilitator in medical 
research and efforts deployed in the public health sector in Canada.
<P>
	This is an indication of the importance of progress achieved 
thanks to research and the government's resolve to continue this 
work.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The federal role in research has been generally well accepted in 
this country. Provincial research programs have frequently 
developed their own provincial research councils around the 
federal council to avoid overlap while ensuring their own research 
goals are met.
<P>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
	One of the best examples of the provincial research model is that 
of Quebec. Some hon. members may not be aware that one of the 
chief architects of the conseil de recherches, now the fonds de 
recherches, is the present Quebec minister of health, Jean Rochon. 
Mr. Rochon is a former dean of medicine at the University of Laval 
as well as the chair of the external advisory committee for Health 
Canada's national health research development program. He is also 
the author of the Rochon report and has worked for the World 
Health Organization. I suppose it is not surprising that research in 
Mr. Rochon's province is so well organized.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Contacts at the international level play a key role in the process. 
These contacts are long established, and we now have many 
mechanisms to help us overcome the barriers of time and space and 
work as a team to conquer disease.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, just think what Pasteur would have 
accomplished with the help of Internet! Whether we are talking 
about cancer or infectious diseases, the entire population of this 
planet benefits from the co-operation of Health Canada with all 
concerned. I believe that together we will be able to make the 
requisite changes in our cherished health care system and bring it 
into the next century. I think we are on the right track.
<P>
	I would now like to quote an old Arab saying: ``He who has 
health has hope; he who has hope lacks nothing''. With the help of 
all concerned, Canadians will keep both health and hope.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I was 
particularly touched by the comments of the member for 
Parkdale-High Park about his friend who on coming back from 
Florida was not able to find suitable medical treatment in Toronto. 
He had to go to Saskatoon and unfortunately it was too late.
<P>
	Few issues treat all of us the same but the issue of health is one 
of them. All of us are concerned about health not only for ourselves 
but also for our families, friends and neighbours.
<P>
	The hon. member for Nickel Belt, who just spoke, said that our 
country is very proud of its health system. I agree with that. He also 
said our health service has greatly contributed to our wonderful 
quality of life. I also agree with that.
<P>
	The problem, I suggest, is the fact that the Liberals seem to think 
that they have a corner on wisdom when it comes to health care, 
that only they have the answers. This is really unfortunate.
<P>
	I have also listened to the postering of the Bloc Quebecois during 
this debate. This is the official opposition that the Liberals choose 
to have in this House of Commons, contrary to anything else they 
may say. All the Bloc can do is posture about the whole situation 
with respect to Quebec in this country. It seems to me a shame 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16332"> 16332 </A></B>
<P>
when we are actually dealing with an issue that has something to do 
with all of us.
<P>
	The member for Parkdale-High Park said we must build a 
health care system before it is too late. Unfortunately, with the 
greatest respect to that member and to the Liberals, I say that the 
status quo as it pertains to medicare as it is presently constructed is 
not an option and that is the whole problem. The status quo is not 
an option.
<P>
	Someone earlier in the debate today said that the Liberals were 
committed to medicare and to seeing that there are no barriers to 
access. I suggest that one of the greatest barriers to access is the $7 
billion that the Liberals are pulling out of this part of the program.
<P>
	Let us take a look at health care. The health minister threatens 
the provincial governments if they choose to try and come up with 
some new solutions or some different ways of looking at things in 
the same envelope from which they are taking $7 billion over two 
years.
<P>
<B>(1535 )</B>
<P>
	The province of British Columbia has decided that it has to take 
some action because it is being cut back so drastically by the 
federal government that it again is responded to by the HRD 
minister with threats.
<P>
	All of us in the House have times when we have to sit in front of 
students who are saying, what about the funding for education? We 
have to say we are sorry but that is part of the $7 billion package 
that is being cut back.
<P>
	I suggest that this is not an honest policy. The Liberals are saying 
they are committed to medicare and yet at the same time they are 
taking $7 billion out of health, CAP and education. It is just not 
honest.
<P>
	The member for Nickel Belt brought up the issue of the forum. 
He speaks about having a frank and open dialogue with Canadians. 
What I am speaking to here specifically is that words can become 
walls because they can create a caricature.
<P>
	It is the desire of the majority of the Liberal members to create a 
caricature. They are saying the Reform Party is opposed to 
medicare, is opposed to saving what the member for Nickel Belt 
has already said, that our health service has greatly contributed our 
wonderful quality of life. The status quo cannot be maintained and 
we are the only party in this House prepared to say that. Let us take 
a look at what the options are, as opposed to simply rolling back 
and pulling in the amount of money that is presently available.
<P>
	The member for Nickel Belt asked the question, let us determine 
what is essential. What is essential? Are all medical services 
essential? In what situation is cosmetic  surgery essential? In what 
situation is liposuction essential? In what situation is sex change 
surgery essential? There has to be a list saying what medical 
procedures are essential. What is going to be covered by the 
contributions of people paying taxes in Canada?
<P>
	I would suggest with the greatest respect and honestly in honour 
of what the member for Parkdale-High Park had to say about his 
friend, we must bill before it is too late. I ask him and I ask all 
Liberals in the House to realize that they do not have a corner on 
wisdom. They do not have a corner on a desire to see health care 
maintained and enhanced. In fact, the Reform Party has a plan 
called medicare plus which opens up a whole new way of being 
able to get to the root problem. The status quo cannot be 
maintained. We must make changes and we are prepared to make 
suggestions for changes.
<P>
	In summary, I respectfully request that the Liberals within the 
hearing of my voice today reconsider and realize that they do not 
have a corner on wisdom. Perhaps we, in the Reform Party, have a 
couple of ideas that are at least worthwhile considering.
<P>
	Why will they not co-operate with us in getting into an open 
dialogue so that Canadians can have an opportunity to have input 
into this process so that truly we can build a sustainable health care 
system in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in 
support of Bill C-95.
<P>
	In creating the Department of Health, this bill not only makes 
good administrative sense, it also makes good economic sense. The 
concepts of health and economics are intertwined. The health of the 
Canadian people is vital to the health of the Canadian economy and 
the health of the Canadian economy is vital to the health of 
Canadian people.
<P>
	Our medicare system is based on sound economic principles, the 
same kind investors look for in evaluating a private sector 
enterprise. There are four main reasons for the success of this 
system.
<P>
	First, our publicly funded system has enormous economies of 
scale. We have only one insurer in each province that provides 
standard health insurance coverage to all residents. No risk rating is 
needed. Payments to providers are simple. Financing the system is 
streamlined.
<P>
	Second, our system results in lower overhead costs. Researchers 
at Harvard have found that Canada spends only 1.1 per cent of 
gross domestic product on health care administration. The United 
States with its private health insurance scheme spends about two 
and a half times that much. If we spent as much as the Americans 
do on administration, health care expenditures in Canada would 
increase by $18.5 billion a year. That is more than the entire health 
care budget for the province of Ontario.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16333"> 16333 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	Third, a publicly financed system can ensure universal coverage. 
That is an important element to a healthy workforce which 
contributes to a more competitive economy and economic growth. 
When there are fewer work days lost to illness productivity 
increases. Healthier people make fewer demands on the system. 
They live longer and they contribute more to the overall wealth of 
the nation.
<P>
	The fourth factor that makes public health insurance more 
efficient is government's tremendous bargaining power in 
negotiating the cost of service by setting and enforcing global 
budgets for hospitals and physicians' fees. This gives government 
powerful levers to keep health care costs under control. In fact real 
per capita public health expenditures in this country have been 
declining since 1993. Estimates for 1994 suggest public spending 
on health declined in real terms by about 3.4 per cent.
<P>
	Economic analysis makes it clear that Canada's health system 
provides major economic benefits. These benefits stem from 
efficiencies and cost savings associated with public funding.
<P>
	Our health system attracts investment to Canada and it helps 
business to compete from Canada. Enormous economies of scale, 
lower overhead costs, improved worker productivity, tremendous 
bargaining power and proven results; if you heard, Madam 
Speaker, of a private company that could point to those attributes 
you would be rushing off to call your broker.
<P>
	Our public health insurance system is a major asset to business. 
It is not a subsidy. It is an efficiency. We have entered an era when 
the public sector's role is quite appropriately being re-examined. 
Valid questions are being asked about government's place and the 
values of public funding versus private funding.
<P>
	Health care is one area where government is not just as efficient, 
it is more efficient. It is not by accident that the United Nations 
rates Canada number one in the human development index. It has 
taken effort, and the development of the medicare system has been 
an important part of that.
<P>
	It is also not surprising that an Environics survey in late 1993 
concluded that 79 per cent of Canadians believe it is very important 
for the federal government to sustain the health system. Medicare, 
as we know, is an insurance program. In effect we have used our 
ingenuity, our foresight and tax dollars to create a giant insurance 
pool covering all Canadians. Health care needs and the related 
costs that medicare covers would generally exist no matter what 
system we have in place to pay and as we know health services are 
never free. Public or private, somebody must pay.
<P>
	All we have to do is look at the auto industry. For every car that 
rolls off the assembly lines of Detroit the  cost includes an average 
of more than $700 U.S. for privately funded health insurance. Is it 
any wonder that the big three automakers have consistently been 
among the strongest voices for a comprehensive public health 
insurance plan in the United States? Universal coverage is much 
more difficult, if not impossible, in a system based on private 
insurance schemes. We have evidence of that in the United States 
where fully 15 per cent of Americans are without any health 
insurance at all.
<P>
	One fact will put this in perspective. We spend only 1.1 per cent 
of our GDP on health care administration. That is about $272 per 
person. The U.S. spends about two and a half times that much, 
about $615 U.S. per person and not one of those billions of 
additional dollars goes to patient services.
<P>
	There is no direct relationship between increased health care 
spending and health outcomes. Health is determined by a number 
of factors of which health care is only one. The environment within 
which we are raised and live in is another. We do not necessarily 
gain better health from extra health care spending.
<P>
	With those two facts it is clear that controlling health costs 
makes sense for both the public and the private sector. The need is 
to spend money wisely. Our medicare system, through 
federal-provincial funding, covers 72 per cent of total health 
spending in Canada, but some costs add nothing to positive 
outcomes.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	The first economic benefit of our medicare system is that we 
have administrative overhead costs under control. We have one 
organization in each province that provides insurance coverage, not 
dozens or hundreds, as in an American state. We do not have the 
elaborate and costly processes that private insurers need to rate the 
risk of people or groups.
<P>
	Think for a moment about private car insurance and the different 
premium structures for young, old, men, women, experienced and 
accident-prone drivers. We do not require the intensive control 
systems private insurers use to monitor premiums and set payment 
schedules. Simply put, we do not spend as much on overhead.
<P>
	The relative difference in spending between us and our 
neighbour to the south saves our economy $30 billion a year. That 
is why we have large employers, seniors, working people, and 
health activists warning against the erosion of medicare. They 
know that costs will increase significantly with a two-tier system. 
They know another thing: we will all foot the bill.
<P>
	Hon. members might be interested in another related economic 
benefit of Canada's medicare system; that is, a better record of 
controlling costs. Each provincial and territorial government is the 
predominant buyer of health care in their jurisdiction. This gives 
them enormous leverage to give the most service at the best price to 
taxpayers. They can negotiate fee structures and  service costs in a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16334"> 16334 </A></B>
<P>
way no private insurer could ever hope to. They can shift spending 
to achieve more cost-effective outcomes.
<P>
	In comparison with the public sector record, the private health 
sector has had little success in cost control. It accounts for more 
than a quarter of all health spending, and its costs have been 
growing at more than six per cent per year since 1990. Individuals 
and insurers in the private sector have found little leverage to bring 
these costs under control.
<P>
	Canadians understand this difference. We have agreed as a 
country to pool our risk across society. We have agreed to let 
governments work out fair prices as the buyer on our behalf. The 
economic benefits of our medicare system are something all 
Canadians can share. We win in the quality of our health care 
system, which is second to none in the world. We also win in 
economic terms.
<P>
	I am proud to support the passage of Bill C-95, which gives a 
new name to a department that has been working hard and well for 
all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Training 
and Youth), Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, today I rise to speak in 
support of Bill C-95. It is with great pleasure that I do so.
<P>
	To me the bill symbolizes a fundamental feature of our 
federation: the ability to achieve an appropriate level of the 
decentralization of powers between the federal government and the 
provinces. This is illustrated by our system of federal-provincial 
transfer payments for health. The system embodies a balance 
between the powers of the federal government and the powers of 
provincial governments, which is serving our country well. It 
provides for the national character of our health system while at the 
same time recognizing the constitutional jurisdiction of the 
provinces and territories over health care.
<P>
	Our system of transfer payments for health has gone through an 
evolution over the last 30 years, an evolution that parallels the 
evolution of our health system as overseen by the Department of 
Health and the evolution of our federation.
<P>
	In the 1950s, in an effort to foster the development of a national 
hospital insurance plan, the government passed legislation 
enabling it to cost-share health programs. The passage of the 
Hospital Insurance and Diagnostic Act in 1957 encouraged the 
development of hospital insurance programs in all provinces and 
territories. Through the offer to cost-share hospital and diagnostic 
services on roughly a 50-50 basis, the HID legislation allowed the 
government to share in the cost of provincial hospital insurance 
plans that met a minimum eligibility and coverage standard.
<P>
<B>(1550 )</B>
<P>
	By 1961 all ten provinces and two territories had public 
insurance plans that provided comprehensive coverage for 
in-hospital care for all residents. Then in the 1960s came 
legislation enabling the federal government to cost-share medical 
care insurance programs. In 1966 a federal offer to pay about one 
half of the cost of physician services insurance programs operated 
by the provinces became law in the medical care act. The act was 
actually implemented in 1968.
<P>
	At this point I would like to digress and perhaps bring a more 
human and local tone to the piece of legislation we are dealing with 
today. I would like to inject just how important this piece of 
legislation is to the territory I come from. I could probably 
exemplify that by using the particular issue of tuberculosis.
<P>
	In the Northwest Territories tuberculosis is still a major problem, 
as it is among the aboriginal population throughout Canada. In fact, 
I am an individual of the aboriginal population who spent 14 
months in a sanatorium for tuberculosis, which was the treatment 
in the early 1960s. There were many other people who also did. It 
became almost routine that families had members who were 
afflicted or died from tuberculosis or were treated for an extended 
period of time.
<P>
	The rate of tuberculosis among Canadian natives is 43 times 
higher than among non-natives. According to Statistics Canada, the 
rate of TB among status natives was 47 per 100,000 in 1993. By 
contrast, Bangladesh has a TB rate of 43.6 per 100,000. The rate for 
non-native Canadians across the country was 6.9 per 100,000.
<P>
	One big problem that has an effect on these numbers is the 
accessibility to the health system and proper testing facilities. The 
availability in the north is difficult, often as the result of a lack of 
proper equipment. Many of the communities where people are 
afflicted are very remote and very hard to reach.
<P>
	Lack of accessibility is also a problem for other communicable 
diseases, such as sexually transmitted diseases. In the north the 
STD rates are estimated by the Government of the Northwest 
Territories Department of Health and Social Services at 10 to 12 
times higher than the national average.
<P>
	Life expectancy numbers are another indicator of the general 
health levels of a population. Earlier this year the National 
Advisory Council on Aging, NACA, released its report, which 
contained more distressing numbers for the aboriginal population. 
A highlight of the report is that life expectancy for native women 
and men is 47 and 46 years, respectively, compared to 75 and 68 for 
the non-native population. The median age of the native population 
is 10 years younger than that of the Canadian population. The 
native elderly often experience premature aging, leading to death 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16335"> 16335 </A></B>
<P>
due to high rates of degenerative diseases. Native people use much 
more  informal care, family and friends, for certain dimensions of 
life-meals, shopping, et cetera-than non-native people.
<P>
	The needs of older native persons for core services, for example 
adult care services, exceed the needs of the comparable non-native 
population. Aboriginal seniors residing off reserves are frequently 
excluded from the communities in which they live and the native 
communities from which they come.
<P>
	It is also important to note that the Northwest Territories has the 
second highest alcohol consumption rate in Canada; five to six 
times the national average in reported violent assaults; and a 
suicide rate that is two to three times the national average. These 
are all symptoms, perhaps not directly related to health, but they 
have a huge impact on the wellness of a community and as a result 
have a huge impact on the health care system, either directly or 
indirectly.
<P>
<B>(1555 )</B>
<P>
	The approach in relating this to the whole health care system is 
to look at preventative health measures. That is the innovation all 
levels of government are looking at. Organizations, aboriginal, 
non-aboriginal, those who live in the north are looking at ways of 
cutting costs, looking at ways of taking preventative measures and 
innovative measures that are going to help provide a more efficient 
and effective system that will serve their people.
<P>
	One difficulty in the north that is taken for granted in southern 
Canada is interpreters. In many cases, without them a proper 
diagnosis cannot be made. Follow-up for major surgery is often 
difficult because patients have long distances to travel, often to the 
south. Often the follow-up does not take place for three to six 
months.
<P>
	Accessibility is often difficult. As mentioned earlier, people 
often have to travel long distances away from their families, their 
primary support system, to receive care. Also, accessibility to 
medicine and prescription drugs is a problem.
<P>
	We also have another important issue that aboriginal people and 
non-aboriginal people in the remote regions really take seriously, 
and that is nutrition. Nutrition and sustenance for those people are 
very important. The principal objective, for instance, of the food 
mail subsidy program is to improve nutrition and health in northern 
communities, which do not have year-round surface transportation. 
They are mostly isolated. There is usually air service and prices are 
from 30 per cent to 60 per cent higher.
<P>
	Thank God for the country food chain that the aboriginal people 
have sustained for themselves. This is very important. Last year the 
government extended the program for one year with a budget of 
$17.1 million pending a review of the program. The north 
experiences the highest levels of unemployment, poverty, and child 
malnutrition. This subsidy only applies to nutritious  foods that 
require refrigeration or have a short shelf life, as well as infant 
formula, infant foods, and non-carbonated water. The cost of living 
in the north is currently 30 per cent to 40 per cent higher than 
anywhere else in Canada, and in some areas it is even higher.
<P>
	We have a great health system in Canada, and we would like to 
support it and continue it and make it even better, especially for me 
in my riding in the Northwest Territories as part of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to commend the hon. member from across the 
way for so eloquently describing the plight of the people in her 
land. Truly, one of the profound tragedies in this country is to see 
the plight of the aboriginal people, a society that has been wracked 
in many cases by terrible levels of substance abuse, sexual abuse, 
interpersonal violence. Health care parameters, whichever way you 
wish to measure them, are some of the worst in our country.
<P>
	If we look at the reasons behind this, one of the things one cannot 
help but look at is employment and being gainfully employed and 
being able to provide for yourself and your family. The ability to 
have gainful employment is integral to an individual's self-respect 
and self-pride. In turn, that imparts a pride and self-respect on the 
community at large.
<P>
	A community and an individual cannot have self-pride and 
self-respect if it is given from somewhere else. They have to take it 
themselves. It cannot be given by a plethora of social programs 
from the federal government. These programs, while necessary, are 
not the answer.
<P>
	The reason I say that is if you look at the terrible statistics the 
hon. member from the Northwest Territories has mentioned, you 
will find that these are mere symptoms of programs and an 
approach to the aboriginal people in this country that have indeed 
failed and failed dismally.
<P>
<B>(1600 )</B>
<P>
	We have to work with aboriginal people to enable them to take 
care of themselves, to provide them with skills training and skills 
programs that will enable them to be gainfully employed. If we are 
able to do that, aboriginal people can stand on their own two feet 
and provide for themselves and their communities. Then, as we just 
mentioned, the incidence of sexual abuse, violence, STDs and 
infant mortality would come down.
<P>
	We have to change our approach, change the direction in which 
we are looking. This would not be a replacement of essential social 
programs. Usually we do not have gainful employment in areas that 
are far removed and very desolate. Sometimes it is possible 
through the forestry and fishing industries but usually it is not the 
case.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16336"> 16336 </A></B>
<P>
	It is important that aboriginal people be allowed to develop 
infrastructures and industries that can be self-sustaining in areas 
appropriate for them. Many northern and remote areas cannot 
develop sustainable industries that will provide for the needs and 
demands of people whether they are aboriginal or non-aboriginal.
<P>
	We are pouring in money to provide for people to live in areas 
far removed from where they can take care of themselves and their 
families. This approach must stop because it simply cannot work. 
Again the duty of the federal government will be to provide 
aboriginal people with the skills training necessary for them to 
stand on their own two feet. It is absolutely integral to anybody's 
ability to have pride and self-respect and to society's ability to have 
pride and self-respect.
<P>
	I hope the government does not pursue the same course it and 
previous governments have been taking for decades. The 
politically correct thing to say is that we will merely pour more 
money into social programs and social schemes for aboriginal 
people, but this will simply not work because it does not address 
the root causes of why the individuals were there in the first place.
<P>
	I hope the government takes a very careful look at its programs 
in the future to try to bring down the terrible parameters among 
aboriginal people and provide them with the ability to stand on 
their own two feet in the future.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Roseanne Skoke (Central Nova, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
welcome the opportunity to speak in support of Bill C-95, an act to 
create the Department of Health, because it is through the 
Department of Health that Canadians express the values that 
underlie the Canadian health system. I speak of the values 
embodied in the Canada Health Act, an act which is the 
responsibility of the Minister of Health and through her the 
Department of Health.
<P>
	The Department of Health is instrumental in protecting and 
preserving the Canada Health Act and with it the values that 
underlie Canadian society. The principles of the Canada Health 
Act, universality, accessibility, comprehensiveness, portability and 
public administration, are rooted in our common values. These 
Canadian values are equity, fairness, compassion and respect for 
the fundamental dignity of all. Canadian society has cherished 
these values for many years and the concern shown recently by 
those who feel the health system is threatened clearly indicates 
those values remain strong.
<P>
	The Canadian concern for the preservation of our health system 
is heightened when we hear the Reform Party's position on 
medicare throughout this debate. The Reform Party's position is 
simplistic and in reality is an attempt to undermine and destroy the 
five fundamental principles of the Canada Health Act.
<P>
	The Reform Party's promotion of user fees will not be tolerated 
by Canadians. The user fee system advanced by the Reform Party 
will lead to a United States health care system. This is unacceptable 
for Canadians. User fees will affect accessibility and universality. 
Universality is not based on insurability criteria or the number of 
pre-existing medical conditions that exist in a person. All 
Canadians are entitled to medically required health services.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	The first and fundamental principle in our Canada Health Act is 
universality. All Canadians should benefit on uniform terms and 
conditions from medicare. Universality really means that we as 
Canadians believe we are all the same when it comes to health care 
needs. It does not matter what our health status is or how big our 
wallet is or where we happen to live in the country. Everyone who 
needs health care will be treated the same. This is equity. It 
recognizes our dignity as human beings and shows we are fair and 
compassionate people.
<P>
	Accessibility is the second principle. What does it mean? It 
means that we should not face any barriers in receiving health care, 
no point of service charges such as extra billing or user charges. 
Underneath it means that we practise in Canada what we preach. 
We say that all Canadians are to be treated equitably and we ensure 
that they will be. The accessibility principle makes sure that no 
discriminatory measures can be put in place that would result in 
Canadians being treated differently. All are to have reasonable 
access to necessary health care services based solely on need.
<P>
	I call upon the Minister of Health to enforce vigorously the 
provisions of the Canada Health Act, to ensure that user fees or 
service charges are not implemented in any riding in any province 
in Canada. I wish to go on record today as supporting the Minister 
of Health in her initiatives to protect and defend the principles set 
forth in the Canada Health Act.
<P>
	The principle of comprehensiveness recognizes that Canadians 
have a range of health care needs and those needs should be met. 
Delve deeper, however, and we see that comprehensiveness means 
we practise fairness. It would not be fair to ensure only some 
medically necessary services and not others. For example, it would 
not be fair to cover only services that cost catastrophic amounts, 
while leaving other just as necessary services uninsured. 
Immunization of a child against measles is just as necessary as a 
coronary bypass operation. Indeed immunization has society-wide 
benefits.
<P>
	Throughout the debate the Bloc Quebecois continuously refers to 
the intrusiveness of the bill into provincial jurisdiction and reminds 
us of the exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces regarding 
administration and management of the health care system. The 
Bloc Quebecois has failed to advise the House of the flexibility that 
the Canada Health Act provides. Eighty-nine per  cent of Canadians 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16337"> 16337 </A></B>
<P>
including the Quebecois support the Canada Health Act and the 
medicare system.
<P>
	The delivery of health care is a provincial responsibility. 
Canadians respect this and the diversity that it brings. In the end we 
will all benefit from diversity because a successful innovation 
developed in one province can be borrowed and adapted by others. 
For example, let us look at the CLSCs developed in Quebec, the 
extra-mural hospital in New Brunswick and the quick response 
teams in British Columbia.
<P>
	Innovation has never been as important as it is today. During 
these difficult fiscal times the health system must adapt and 
change. It must do this at a faster rate than ever before. Innovation 
is needed to make sure that the health system continues to adapt to 
changing circumstances. Pressures on the health system are always 
changing: changing demographics, changing technologies, 
changing fiscal situations. The comprehensiveness principle 
recognizes that health systems must be adaptable and allows for 
innovation.
<P>
	The Reformers' approach to medicare simply implies that there 
is not enough money in the system to afford health care in Canada. 
They address the issue by compromising fundamental and basic 
values and principles set forth in the Canada Health Act. This is 
unacceptable. The user fee approach will lead to a United States 
health care system that is not to be supported in Canada.
<P>
	Money cannot be the determining factor of success in a health 
care system. If money were the major criteria the United States 
would have the best health care system in the world as it spends 14 
per cent of its GDP on health.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	Based on OECD statistics United States ranks 14th in the world 
among developing countries. Japan spends the least amount of 
money in the world on its health care system and Canada spends 
9.4 per cent of its gross domestic product on health care. Managing 
the system, protecting our values and fundamental principles will 
allow us to save money and to administer health care more 
efficiently and effectively.
<P>
	The fifth and final principle is that of public administration. Our 
health insurance plans must be operated by provincial governments 
on a non-profit basis. Public administration is the means by which 
we ensure all other principles. When health insurance is operated 
and funded through governments we can easily make sure that 
health care is universal, accessible, comprehensive and portable 
because we have direct control over it.
<P>
	After having heard the debate and comments of the member for 
Calgary Centre I urge him to read carefully Bill C-95. I draw to the 
hon. member's attention the words health and welfare. For the 
information of the House, welfare is now to be correctly directed to 
the  jurisdiction of the Department of Human Resources. Human 
resources is responsible for employment, training and creating 
opportunity for unemployed Canadians.
<P>
	On the other hand, health is to remain within the Department of 
Health. Through Bill C-95, the creation of the Department of 
Health, the department responsible for the Canada Health Act, we 
are affirming the principles and values that we hold dear as 
Canadians. I urge all members of the House to do the same.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is the House ready for the

<P>

	The House resumed from November 6 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-94, an act to regulate interprovincial trade in and 
the importation for commercial purposes of certain manganese 
based substances, be read the third time and passed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16338"> 16338 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> When Bill C-94 was last 
before the House, the hon. member for Athabasca had 34 minutes 
remaining in debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, in 
resuming my presentation on this topic I should like to briefly 
review where I was yesterday when I was interrupted by the vote. 
As I was saying, when thanking the witnesses who appeared before 
the committee to discuss in all sincerity and earnest the topic 
before us, trying to influence the government's position on Bill 
C-94, it was very apparent the members of the committee and the 
government were not prepared or interested in listening to anything 
the witnesses had to say simply because their minds had long since 
been made up to support the minister's political commitment 
which had long since been bought and paid for.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	We went on to talk about the issues the minister had raised in 
support of her bill. Yesterday the member for York-Simcoe had 
been babbling on about the Reform Party's being in the pockets of 
Ethyl Corporation, this evil corporation with its head offices in the 
U.S. That was absolute rubbish.
<P>
	Right from the beginning as I met with both sides on this issue 
and discussed their positions, which was more than the minister 
was willing to do, it became very clear someone was distorting the 
facts on the issue. Over the summer months I spent a tremendous 
amount of time researching the information available and judging 
the information before us. The more I did that the more I came to 
believe that the positions of the Canadian Petroleum Producers 
Institute and Ethyl Corporation were correct and that the motor 
vehicle manufacturers' position was very flawed.
<P>
	That was brought to my attention through endless studies done in 
Canada and the U.S. on the subject. It certainly was the judgment 
of the Environmental Protection Agency, two courts in the U.S., 
and a lot of independent testing done on the subject.
<P>
	I went on yesterday to talk about some of the positions and the 
flaws in those positions put forward by the government, one of 
which is that MMT causes damage to the OBD II technology in 
1996 cars. The evidence brought forward in the U.S. and Canada in 
the most extensive series of tests ever done on a fuel additive in the 
world failed to verify the motor vehicle manufacturers' position on 
that interference of the OBD II systems.
<P>
	The issue of sparkplug failure was a favourite issue of the 
minister in that sparkplugs were failing up to 17 times higher in 
fuel with MMT than in fuel without MMT. We referred to very 
extensive testing in the U.S. on the subject, independent testing that 
failed to find any connection whatsoever between MMT in gasoline 
and the failure of those sparkplugs. The failure of the  sparkplugs 
was an inherent flaw in that particular brand of sparkplug and had 
little to do with MMT.
<P>
	When we were in committee and we asked for evidence to be 
brought forward from the MVMA to show us where this failure of 
the sparkplugs was proven, it brought forward a number of pictures 
of sparkplugs. The first was a picture of a sparkplug that looked 
almost brand new, which aroused some suspicion. Any sparkplug 
that has ran 50,000 kilometres or more has some discolouring on 
the porcelain section and does not look like the sparkplug in the 
picture.
<P>
	The other picture was of a sparkplug that was very fouled and in 
terrible condition. The representative from the MVMA pointed out 
these two sparkplugs were identical sparkplugs used in identical 
vehicles, one run with MMT fuel and one without. When we took a 
closer look at the pictures clearly they were not even the same type 
of sparkplug. They were different sparkplugs.
<P>
	Immediately we began to doubt the validity of the evidence 
being presented when presented as one thing when even laymen 
like ourselves on the committee could very easily see the evidence 
was flawed, manipulated and not correct. I do not think the claim of 
the sparkplug failure had much validity, which raises doubts about 
the entire evidence.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	Then we went on to the issue of tailpipe emissions from the 
vehicles and how they would affect our environment. In the process 
of the Environmental Protection Agency study and to satisfy the 
U.S. clean air act requirements for the reintroduction of MMT in 
unleaded gasoline in the United States, Ethyl Corporation 
conducted the most extensive series of tests ever undertaken on a 
gasoline additive. The testing program was designed with the 
assistance of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. 
automakers to evaluate and document the effects of MMT 
performance additives on automobile tailpipe emissions and to 
determine the implications for air quality if the MMT additives 
were used in gasoline.
<P>
	The initial MMT emission test program involved 48 cars, 
representing a broad cross-section of automobiles driven in North 
America, operated for a total of more than three million miles. Half 
of the 1988 cars used a test fuel with additives and the other half 
used the same fuel without additives. Tailpipe emissions were 
checked every 5,000 miles.
<P>
	In committee various witnesses put forth a lot of very technical 
evidence. I pointed out earlier that the validity of the evidence 
concerning sparkplug misfiring was suspect and there was also that 
same suspicion regarding the data concerning tailpipe emissions. I 
will give the House another example of that suspect evidence.
<P>
	In committee the hon. member for Hamilton-Wentworth, a 
member of the government,  raised these concerns regarding the 
data presented concerning tailpipe emissions. From the blues of the 
Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable 
Development of October 24, 1995 he said: ``What interests me is 
that this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16339"> 16339 </A></B>
<P>
chart shows very clearly that Canadian cars using MMT have a 
significantly lower NOx emission than those used in the United 
States not using MMT. Am I not seeing improvements with MMT 
as opposed to the opposite?''
<P>
	The witness responded by saying: ``I think you are seeing a false 
improvement as a result of MMT''.
<P>
	The hon. member for Hamilton-Wentworth responded by 
saying: ``It is your chart. If that data is false then surely the other 
data that shows improvements in the emissions of hydrocarbons 
and CO2s and carbon dioxide, then these other two charts are also 
suspect. What I am trying to get at is what does any of this data 
mean? If you say that one is false, are these two therefore right or 
are they all false?''
<P>
	In spite of his serious suspicions to the evidence before him this 
member failed to raise any concerns with the content or validity of 
the bill in the clause by clause review or at report stage and here we 
are at third reading. Will the hon. member for 
Hamilton-Wentworth now vote to hold the bill until further 
independent research is done to verify that suspect evidence?
<P>
	We studied this matter over the summer. The Environmental 
Protection Agency participated in this test program in determining 
the test protocols and the definitions involved. Also many 
independent testing facilities were used to analyse the data using 
similar protocols and procedures to those laid out by the EPA.
<P>
	The data were subjected to rigorous, independent statistical 
analyses to evaluate the impact of the additive over 75,000 miles of 
vehicle operation.
<P>
	An additional test fleet of 44 cars of 1992 and 1993 models were 
tested and yielded similar results to the 1988 fleet. Four models of 
the 1992-93 test fleet were driven 100,000 miles without any 
catalytic system problems due to MMT. All the MMT cars met 
exhaust emission standards at 100,000 miles. Two other 1988 
models were also run to 100,000 miles without exhaust failure due 
to MMT.
<P>
	These programs took nearly five years and cost millions of 
dollars. It is the most extensive series of tests ever performed in 
support of a fuel additive waiver. The evidence is pretty strong as to 
the effect on tailpipe emissions of MMT.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	The next issue in question which has been raised by the minister 
in the House is health. In committee we heard experts from Health 
Canada's monitoring and criteria division who presented their 
conclusions from a December 6, 1994 risk assessment which 
focused on new  epidemiological studies and a Canadian exposure 
data entitled ``Risk Assessment for the Combustion Products of 
MMT in gasoline''. The study concluded that the use of MMT in 
gasoline does not represent a health risk to any segment of the 
Canadian population.
<P>
	Specifically the report states: ``Airborne manganese resulting 
from the combustion of MMT in gasoline powered vehicles is not 
entering the Canadian environment in quantities or under 
conditions that may constitute a health risk''. The study also 
concludes there is no connection between levels of ambient 
respirable manganese and MMT sales or use in unleaded gasoline, 
whether examined by geographic area or by season.
<P>
	The last and probably most important issue in the whole debate 
in the House and in committee was based on the uniformity of 
gasoline in the North American market. On April 25 of this year the 
hon. Minister of Industry stated: ``It is crucial that we have 
uniformity standards''. The hon. minister is referring to the fact 
that at the time MMT was not used in the U.S.A. but was in 
Canada, and for that reason it was important to have the same 
gasoline in the North American market.
<P>
	I would like to know now if the minister still agrees with this 
statement because the U.S. court of appeals has now ordered the 
U.S. EPA to grant Ethyl Corporation's application for a waiver, 
paving the way for the use of MMT in unleaded gasoline in the 
United States. The EPA has until early December to appeal. Our 
sources say that is unlikely.
<P>
	Several U.S. refiners have provided written notice of their 
intention to use MMT. Ethyl has received orders pending the 
appeal date from not only the U.S.A. but from Mexico, Argentina, 
Russia, Bulgaria, Indonesia and Peru. Most of the rest of the 
countries of the world are still using leaded gasoline, which makes 
the issue irrelevant for them.
<P>
	The uniformity of gasoline additives within North America 
would now require Canada to maintain rather than restrict the use 
of MMT. If the Minister of Industry still stands by his statement, I 
hope to see him vote against the bill in the House on third reading. 
If he no longer stands by his statement, the House would really like 
to know why he now believes that uniformity in the North 
American market is no longer crucial.
<P>
	With this question of uniformity in mind, why do we not hold the 
bill on the Order Paper until after the appeal period has expired, 
particularly now since the American automakers have approached 
Ethyl to do independent testing in the U.S.? Does the government 
believe the uniformity of gasoline is no longer crucial in North 
American markets?
<P>
	The refineries were among the groups that appeared before the 
committee to discuss this bill and to lobby in opposition to the bill 
simply because of the increase costs to the refineries in the event of 
banning MMT. For the  benefit of members opposite who seem to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16340"> 16340 </A></B>
<P>
be in a great frenzy to promote the use of ethanol in gasolines, the 
refineries clearly stated that should MMT be banned in Canada, 
ethanol would not be used as a substitute for MMT. Economics 
would simply dictate that instead of using MMT a much enhanced 
refining process would be required which would cause greater 
volumes of crude oil and greater emissions from the refining 
process of a number of undesirable elements, including carbon 
monoxide and sulphur dioxide.
<P>
	Also concerning environmental pollution, there were a number 
of studies by Calgary based T.J. McCann and Associates Limited 
and Environ International Limited of California-MMT is banned 
by name in California-showing that the likely range of increase in 
nitrous oxide emissions if MMT were to be banned would be 
equivalent of adding 32,000 to 50,000 tonnes per year to the 
environment, the equivalent of putting over a million additional 
cars on the road by the year 2000.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	Last May Environ of California concluded that Environment 
Canada in the McCann study underestimated the annual increase in 
tonnes of nitrous oxide emissions that would result from the 
removal of MMT, saying it would result in between 49,000 and 
62,000 tonnes more nitrous oxide into the environment.
<P>
	Putting these studies into a non-technical format, removing 
MMT would increase nitrous oxide levels from automobiles by up 
to 20 per cent, an action which contradicts Environment Canada's 
environmental management plan and Canada's signing of a 1998 
international treaty promising to freeze nitrous oxide emissions at 
1988 levels.
<P>
	Canada's major cities are faced with increased pollution levels. I 
find it hard to believe the Minister of the Environment is pushing 
legislation that would increase pollution. She knows nitrous oxide 
emissions are the cause of urban smog. Therefore she should be 
supporting any means to reduce nitrous oxide. Now she will 
probably tell the House that the new OBDs will reduce pollution 
and therefore will counteract the increased levels of nitrous oxide.
<P>
	I remind the minister the OBD systems in no way affect the 
emission or pollution levels. They are simply a monitoring system 
and will not therefore affect the emission control systems in the 
amount of pollution they allow into the environment.
<P>
	I note there is no support for this bill from the provinces, 
specifically my province of Alberta as well as Saskatchewan, Nova 
Scotia, New Brunswick and Manitoba. I have also in my possession 
a copy of a letter from the minister of natural resources from 
Quebec urging the government to reconsider its position on MMT 
considering recent events in the U.S.A.
<P>
	Also, what is truly amazing is the complete turnaround of the 
official opposition, which supported the government's initiative on
<P>
second reading. Despite the fact that its members were a rare sight 
at the committee hearings, on third reading they appear to be 
supporting our position on the bill and opposing the government.
<P>
	I and other members of the committee who studied the bill, if 
open minded, would have to come to these conclusions. The 
evidence presented as to the effects of MMT on OBD II is at best 
inconclusive. The use of MMT in gasoline has no detrimental 
health effect on Canadians, as confirmed by Health Canada. If the 
use of MMT has any measurable impact on the environment, it 
would be a positive impact due to the reduction of the smog 
producing nitrous oxide.
<P>
	If fuel harmonization in the North American market is crucial, as 
the Ministry of Industry stated in the House on April 25, in view of 
recent events in the U.S.A. the bill will not aid in the harmonization 
but will provide the opposite result.
<P>
	The bill sets a dangerous precedent for the future of the Canadian 
environment. If we are to continue the great progress in the 
reduction of automobile emissions we have seen in the last number 
of years, we must have a harmonization or a co-operative effort 
between the auto manufacturing industry and the manufacturers of 
automobile fuels. If the bill is any indication of the way the auto 
manufacturers plan to co-operate with the fuel manufacturers, it 
certainly does not bode well for the future progress in the 
technology of automobile emissions.
<P>
	We must postpone passage of the bill while independent testing 
is conducted on the effects of MMT on OBD II and also to give us 
time to assess the situation in the USA after the time expires of the 
appeal court decision.
<P>
	Therefore I will be voting against the bill at third reading. I 
certainly will be watching to see how Alberta's only representative 
in cabinet and the representative for Alberta's resource industries 
will be voting, as well as the member for Sarnia-Lambton, who 
has been amazingly silent on this whole issue, considering he 
represents the constituency where the Ethyl plant is located and 
where the resulting layoffs from the government's decision will no 
doubt occur. I will be watching this very closely.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a 
pleasure for me to rise again to speak to Bill C-94, the manganese 
based fuel additives act.
<P>
	We have heard all kinds of arguments for and against the 
legislation now before the House but it is clear there are still 
misconceptions on the other side.
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	I will focus on the crucial reasons we seek to ban the use of 
manganese based fuel additives in Canada. We are  doing this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16341"> 16341 </A></B>
<P>
because it is good for the environment, good for Canadian 
consumers and good for Canadian business and workers.
<P>
	The ban benefits the environment by supporting the latest 
development in technology for reducing emissions from motor 
vehicles. That is significant because vehicles are still the largest 
single factor contributing to air pollution. In recent decades we 
have seen major improvements made by vehicle manufacturers and 
fuel producers. These have certainly lowered the amounts of 
pollutants released by individual vehicles.
<P>
	During the same time the number of cars and trucks on the road 
has grown considerably. As a result, gasoline and diesel powered 
vehicles are still responsible for 60 per cent of the carbon 
monoxide emissions in Canada. They are responsible for 35 per 
cent of the nitrogen oxide emissions. They are responsible for 25 
per cent of the hydrocarbon emissions and they are responsible for 
20 per cent of the carbon dioxide emissions. Given those numbers 
we must make every effort to lower vehicle emissions for the sake 
of air quality in Canada.
<P>
	Certainly we have seen progress since the 1970s. One decisive 
step was the phase out of lead from Canadian gasoline starting in 
1977. Another has been the improvement in fuel efficiency of cars 
and trucks. Still another has been the introduction of emissions 
control equipment.
<P>
	Now we are in the midst of taking another major step, the 
introduction into our cars and trucks of onboard diagnostic 
systems. These systems are designed to monitor the performance of 
pollution control systems in our cars, in particular to monitor the 
catalyst, and to alert the driver to malfunctions in those emission 
control systems.
<P>
	In essence a properly functioning onboard diagnostic system is a 
built in inspection and maintenance tool. As we know, inspection 
and maintenance of a vehicle can greatly reduce vehicle emissions. 
For proof of this we need only look at programs that require 
vehicles to be emissions tested from time to time.
<P>
	For example, the Vancouver area has the air care inspection and 
maintenance program which is conducted on an annual basis. In the 
tested fleet of cars the programmers reduced hydrocarbon 
emissions by 20 per cent, carbon monoxide emissions by 24 per 
cent, nitrogen oxide emissions by 2.7 per cent and fuel 
consumption by 5 per cent. That is a municipal, metropolitan 
emissions monitoring system.
<P>
	The new onboard diagnostic systems which we will have in our 
vehicles could allow all Canadians to benefit from such emissions 
reductions. As I said, they are built in emissions monitoring 
systems. However, there is one obstacle to this: the continued 
presence of MMT, an octane enhancer currently used in unleaded 
gasoline.
<P>
	The automotive industry is convinced that MMT adversely 
affects the sophisticated new onboard diagnostic systems. It affects 
the effectiveness with which those systems can monitor the 
emissions and warn us when emissions are increasing.
<P>
	This is not an isolated statement or an assertion on my part but 
the conclusion of Ford, Chrysler, General Motors, Toyota, Honda, 
Subaru, Nissan, Mazda, Mercedes, BMW, Volkswagen, Volvo, 
Saab, Lada, Jaguar, Land Rover and Hyundai.
<P>
	General Motors is a major employer in my riding of 
Peterborough, employing approximately 8,000 people. General 
Motors employees are concerned that the investment in the new 
modern onboard diagnostic systems in the 1996 models not be 
wasted.
<P>
<B>(1640 )</B>
<P>
	The list of supporters I have just cited includes virtually all of 
Canada's automakers and importers and all of their workers. When 
they speak with such unanimity, we need to listen to their message 
carefully. Their opinion is based on hundreds of thousands of 
vehicles running millions and millions of kilometres on MMT 
gasoline in Canada, not on 48 vehicles running a few million 
kilometres in the United States. This opinion is based on the 
experience of the producers and users of the vehicles of an entire 
nation, not of a few cars selected by the EPA in the United States.
<P>
	Suppose the efficiency of the catalyst in our vehicles' pollution 
control system is reduced by 50 per cent due to abnormal wear or a 
manufacturing deficiency. The catalyst is one of the key controls of 
emissions by our vehicles. The result of this reduction of 50 per 
cent in its efficiency would be a twofold increase in emissions 
compared with a properly functioning vehicle.
<P>
	However, at the present time drivers would be unaware of the 
increase in pollutants as a result of the decline in efficiency of the 
catalyst in their cars. They would be unaware of the increase of 
pollutants if MMT interferes with the proper functioning of 
onboard diagnostic systems, the systems which monitor emissions 
from vehicle.
<P>
	The member opposite mentioned the case of sparkplugs. There 
are real indications that the use of fuel containing MMT causes 
sparkplug failures. GM Canada, the automotive corporation which 
is closest to my riding, reports that sparkplug failures for one 
particular Canadian model are 17 times higher than a comparable 
U.S. model. Again this is not some laboratory experiment, not 
some engines running on a bench in a factory or a few vehicles 
driving around California being monitored by technicians. This is 
the opinion of one of the major Canadian automobile producers. It 
is one of the largest employers in the country.
<P>
	As I mentioned in my previous speech on this legislation, the 
federal government gave the petroleum  and automotive industries 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16342"> 16342 </A></B>
<P>
a considerable period of time to get together to sort out this 
problem. I suggest the federal government has now waited long 
enough for the fuel producers and the automakers to resolve this 
dispute between themselves. If we do not act now the federal 
government's vehicle emissions reduction program will be in 
jeopardy. We risk missing out on major reductions in smog, carbon 
monoxide and hydrocarbons.
<P>
	The time has come to make a decision. Bill C-94 is a decision in 
favour of Canada's environment.
<P>
	Members will note the bill helps the environment by improving 
onboard diagnostic systems and the efficiency of our vehicles. We 
do not base our argument on environmental improvements simply 
on the reduction in emissions of MMT. We base them on the affect 
of MMT on the emission monitoring systems in new models of cars 
and trucks.
<P>
	Therefore Bill C-94 is the decision in favour of the environment. 
It is also a decision in favour of Canadian consumers because it 
ensures they will have access to state of the art emission reduction 
technologies. Unless we act now we could face a situation in which 
automakers will be forced to turn off the onboard diagnostic 
systems in new models because of the damage MMT causes.
<P>
	In fact, one manufacturer is already bringing models off the 
assembly line with the onboard diagnostic systems partially 
disconnected. Some manufacturers are no longer prepared to pay 
the substantial warranty costs for damage caused to pollution 
control equipment. In the end, it is we, the Canadian motorists, who 
have to pay more to have our cars maintained because of this kind 
of industry action. The government will not allow the buck to be 
passed to the Canadian consumer. For their sake we need to move 
now and pass Bill C-94.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	Solving the MMT issue signals the government's desire to 
ensure that Canadians have access to fuel formulations that will not 
impede the performance of the vehicle emission control systems. 
We know that this is only a small step in the process of reducing 
vehicle pollution.
<P>
	The petroleum industry needs to keep making improvements in 
the composition and properties of the fuels that automobile engines 
burn. The auto industry needs to keep making improvements in 
vehicle emissions control technologies such as those offered 
through the onboard diagnostic systems that I have just been 
discussing.
<P>
	The government, for its share, must act now to reduce pollution 
by vehicles. Very recently in Whitehorse the Canadian Council of 
Ministers of the Environment which includes our own minister of 
the environment and sustainable development endorsed a report on 
cleaner vehicles and fuels. The report calls for reducing pollution  
from automobiles by means of tougher national for vehicle 
emissions and fuels.
<P>
	It also calls for actions to improve fuel efficiency and to promote 
advanced technology as well as vehicles running on alternative 
fuels. Further, the CCM report recognizes the importance of 
inspection and maintenance programs to ensure that emission 
control systems are in good working order. I have addressed that 
matter and the way MMT relates to it.
<P>
	By acting on the report Canada will have a new program for low 
emission vehicles no later than the year 2001 with an earlier 
phase-in, in harmony with the United States if feasible. There will 
be new standards for cleaner gasoline and diesel fuel. The result 
should be significant health benefits.
<P>
	This Whitehorse report was prepared through a consultation 
process involving representatives from industry, environmental 
groups and other stakeholders. What we are doing here today will 
help achieve the aims of that report. We need to act now. We 
cannot, as the member opposite keeps suggesting, afford to wait or 
delay.
<P>
	In the past year we have heard a great deal about a much wider 
atmospheric issue, that of global warning triggered by the 
greenhouse effect. Scientists have concluded we cannot wait for 
hard and fast proof that human activities are causing an 
unprecedented climb in global temperatures because by the time 
we have the proof, we will be overtaken by climate change of 
possibly catastrophic dimensions. Instead we need to act now on 
the precautionary principle. There is sufficient evidence to indicate 
a danger and action now will be beneficial in any case.
<P>
	The actions we should take to avoid a possible climate changes 
are actions which we should be taking anyway to make this planet a 
healthier place to live.
<P>
	Of course, and I accept the member's arguments on this point, 
MMT use in gasoline is not specifically a global warming issue but 
the same principle applies. There is plenty of evidence to show the 
danger MMT presents and if we eliminate its use now there are sure 
to be benefits to Canada's environment, Canadian consumers, 
Canadian industry and workers.
<P>
	That is why Bill C-94 makes such eminent sense. That is why I 
am going to support this legislation and why I urge all members of 
the House to support it.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, in 
congratulating the member for Peterborough for his lucid 
intervention I would like to ask him the following question.
<P>
<B>(1650 )</B>
<P>
	In his view are the interests of consumers, car users and car 
buyers, in the riding of Athabasca, in the riding of Laurentides or in 
any other riding of members of  Parliament who have expressed 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16343"> 16343 </A></B>
<P>
opposition or doubts about the necessity of removing manganese 
from gasoline, well served by those who oppose this bill?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Adams:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
question. He draws attention to the fact that this legislation affects 
virtually every Canadian. In addition to its improvement of the 
environment, it affects the health of us all.
<P>
	Every person who has a car or a truck is affected by this 
legislation. These onboard diagnostic systems which we are 
discussing and which manufacturers tell us are directly affected by 
MMT in gasoline add a great deal to the cost of a car.
<P>
	If the manufacturers fail to hook up the systems, the cost of the 
car will be the same but Canadian drivers will not have the benefit 
of those expensive systems although they have paid for them. Even 
more, they will not have the benefits of the improvement in the 
environment which will result from proper monitoring throughout 
the year, day in, day out, every driving hour, the emissions from 
their vehicle.
<P>
	I find it unfortunate, given that the federal government allowed 
the petroleum industry and the automobile industry a very 
considerable time to come together and discuss this matter. It is 
very unfortunate that the member opposite reduces this argument to 
a battle between the petroleum industry which this government 
supports and Canadians. This is simply not the case.
<P>
	The petroleum industry in the United States adapted to the ban 
on MMT very quickly. It has the technology to do that. The larger 
part of the petroleum industry on this continent has been producing 
gasoline without MMT in it.
<P>
	It is extremely unfortunate that the member opposite makes this 
argument on the basis of these large petroleum corporations that 
already have the technology to take the MMT out and simply bring 
Canada in line with what has been the norm on this continent for 
many years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I have a couple of questions for the speaker.
<P>
	He mentioned that one of the rationales behind banning MMT in 
Canada is that the North American market, which is much bigger 
than the Canadian market alone, has been MMT free. The 
Americans have been MMT free for some time, based on a decision 
in the United States that prohibited the use of the product.
<P>
	Now the court decision appears to be allowing MMT to be used 
in the greater North American market and by far the bigger market 
will be having MMT starting almost immediately. The EPA has 
decided not to appeal the decision to allow MMT. Therefore it 
looks as if the Americans are going to have MMT soon.
<P>
	None of the quotes from Saab, Honda, GM or other car maker 
has been tabled in this House. The government will not table them. 
Rather than forcing this bill, which has no scientific backing, 
through, would it not be wiser, based on that uncertainty about this 
greater gasoline market, to hold off on banning MMT in Canada if 
it is going to be allowed in the United States? I would like the 
member's opinion on that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Adams:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question. I know he has been following this debate very seriously.
<P>
	First I want to pick up his remark about lack of scientific 
evidence. His colleague, in the speech which preceded mine, 
referred to rigorous statistical analysis and phrases of that sort.
<P>
<B>(1655 )</B>
<P>
	Members opposite know that an experiment based on the opinion 
of 27 million automobile owners is based on a very solid scientific 
foundation. How much better a foundation scientifically than 48 
vehicles that have driven three million miles, which is 
approximately five million kilometres. On the scientific evidence 
side, I urge the member to bear in that in mind. We are talking here 
about manufacturers who have been monitoring hundreds of 
thousands of vehicles.
<P>
	Going back to the member's remark and the Reform Party's 
point that the decision has been made in the United States, we know 
that the United States has a very legalistic system. All sorts of 
groups, particularly large corporations, can take advantage of the 
system to fight decisions they do not like.
<P>
	I would remind members opposite that MMT is banned in the 
United States at present. We will see if it is going to come in. The 
great state of California, which is comparable in population and has 
more vehicles than our whole country, has enormous automobile 
problems. It has been trying to tackle them with many of the most 
stringent regulations in the world. The state of California has 
banned MMT.
<P>
	If and when we see the state of California, which is progressive 
in this regard, acting the way the Reform Party expects then I think 
the member will have a stronger base to stand on.
<P>
	In general, I do not think that Canadians should follow the 
lowest common denominator. We should aim for the highest 
standards and try to achieve them where we can. That is what we 
are doing in this case.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened very intently to the excellent presentation by 
hon. member. I have just a quick question.
<P>
	He mentioned a number of varieties of automobiles. I believe he 
stated that all automakers in Canada and many of the foreign 
automakers were supporting this initiative.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16344"> 16344 </A></B>
<P>
	Is this something that just evolved in the last month, or two or 
three months? Or have these studies been ongoing for several 
months or perhaps years, as the automakers make their plans and 
directives for new equipment and machinery that will go into their 
automobiles for future generations?
<P>
	I wonder if the member could perhaps address that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Adams:</B> Madam Speaker, I have to compliment my 
colleague for the best question I have received.
<P>
	First, this is based on the many years of experience of our auto 
manufacturers and importers running vehicles on Canadian 
gasoline with MMT in it. The spark plug point is based on 
experience over that period of time. However they have been 
forced to do this by the development of the new onboard diagnostic 
systems. In the same way we monitor the speed of the vehicle or 
how much gasoline there is the tank, we can now monitor what 
emissions are going from the exhaust pipe. Those onboard 
diagnostic systems are a new, very expensive, exciting innovation 
in the automobile industry. They have been coming along for some 
years but in the 1996 models they are particularly sophisticated and 
expensive and that is what is forcing the issue at the present time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Madam Speaker, a point 
of order.
<P>
	The hon. member referred to some studies that included all 
vehicles in Canada. I wonder if he is willing to table those studies 
so we can all take a look at them. I am not aware of them and it is 
very important for the House to have that material available so we 
can examine the evidence.
<P>
<B>(1700 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Adams:</B> Madam Speaker, I suspect technically the question 
is out of order, but I am glad to reply.
<P>
	I was referring to the experience of Canadian manufacturers over 
many years and to their monitoring of vehicles. That information is 
readily available from manufacturers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chatters:</B> You said scientific tests.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> For a member to deposit 
papers with the Chair there must be unanimous consent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The 
member for Peterborough mentioned prior to the last intervention 
that he thought the previous question was the best one of the day. I 
thought mine was the best one of the day.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry but that is not a 
point of order and the time has expired.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I welcome this second opportunity to speak to Bill 
C-94, a bill that as you can see is extremely technical and 
extremely controversial.
<P>
	Perhaps I may remind our listeners that the purpose of this bill is 
to prohibit the use of the product MMT in the production of 
gasoline. Technically, MMT is currently used to shorten the 
refining process and the time it takes to reach the octane level the 
oil companies want. Removing MMT will mean the oil companies 
will have to use a longer refining cycle. The product is a 
manganese-based additive that has been used in practically all 
unleaded gasoline in Canada since 1977.
<P>
	There are a number of issues at stake here which we should 
examine very closely. First of all, we have the automobile 
manufacturers' lobby which, as was pointed out earlier-and most 
of our colleagues did so-supports the minister's bill. They claim 
that the MMT in gasoline will clog and cause malfunctions in the 
so-called OBD II anti-pollution devices that will be installed in 
cars very shortly, and this is already the case for 1996 models. 
MMT would be indirectly harmful to the environment, because if 
the OBD II anti-pollution device does not work properly, cars will 
pollute more than they should, since with this device they would 
otherwise run very efficiently.
<P>
	So MMT is not in itself harmful but, according to automobile 
manufacturers, it would indirectly harm the environment by 
impeding the effectiveness of a device installed in automobiles to 
control pollution.
<P>
	According to a press release issued by the Canadian Automobile 
Association on June 12 this year, in 1996 all cars sold in the United 
States will have to be fitted with a new kind of detection device. 
This ``green'' mechanism will ensure that the vehicle's 
anti-pollution devices remain fully effective over the years. 
However, if gasoline sold in Canada still contains MMT, these new 
devices will not function properly, as tests have proven.
<P>
	I will continue this text later on, but I just want to say that like 
my Reform Party friends, I also more or less joined in the 
demonstration given by automobile manufacturers of the tests they 
had done. I also thought it was rather inconclusive, and I have the 
same reservations as the hon. member for Athabasca who referred 
to the spark plugs he had examined. I was not convinced by this 
demonstration.
<P>
	Second, we asked, and my Reform colleagues are now asking for 
more serious tests to be tabled in the House, and they have a very 
good reason for doing so, because we have seen no serious tests to 
prove these allegations, and I do not think we will.
<P>
	According to the text provided by the automobile manufacturers, 
they have decided not to make this new equipment available to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16345"> 16345 </A></B>
<P>
Canadians if we continue to add  MMT to gasoline. In the final 
analysis, Canadians will be the ones to suffer, both economically 
and environmentally, because their vehicles will pollute more than 
anyone else's.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	On the other hand, last spring, I demonstrated to this House that 
it would be in the interest of the major oil companies primarily if 
this bill were not passed. They in fact allege that MMT permits 
gasoline to be produced with a significant reduction in 
environmental costs at the refining stage. We can readily imagine 
this: longer refining without the MMT additive means more 
pollution from the process.
<P>
	If we believe the figures given my office by the Canadian 
Petroleum Products Institute, these environmental costs should go 
up by at least $50 million at the refining stage for these companies.
<P>
	According to representatives from the oil industry as well, MMT 
requires less intensive treatment, which means less carbon dioxide, 
nitrous oxide, carbon monoxide and sulphur dioxide from the 
stacks of plants producing gasoline. Furthermore, MMT allows 
refineries to reduce the aromatic cycles of gasolines and thus 
benzene emissions.
<P>
	The Canadian Petroleum Products Institute also mentioned that, 
according to its members, the decision to prohibit the addition of 
MMT to gasoline must be made on a sound scientific basis, and this 
is the request being made. They therefore examined MMT from 
three standpoints: the environment, health and its actual effect on 
car emission systems.
<P>
	From an environmental standpoint, according to the companies, 
the addition of MMT clearly protects the environment. It cuts 
nitrous oxide emissions by between 15 and 20 per cent, thus cutting 
smog in cities. There is complete agreement on this point in both 
Canada and the United States.
<P>
	From a health standpoint, here in Canada, Health and Welfare 
Canada has published two reports indicating that MMT in gasoline 
represents no health risk for Canadians. In the United States, a very 
decisive decision by the court of appeal confirms it.
<P>
	Thirdly, from a vehicle emission control standpoint, the United 
States environmental protection agency has always maintained 
there was not the slightest evidence that MMT had any damaging 
effect on the equipment.
<P>
	So we can understand, when we contemplate the issue before us, 
in connection with Bill C-94, that, regardless of the fate of the bill, 
Canada's pollution levels will inevitably increase. We are therefore 
not faced with a choice between good and evil, we really have to 
choose between two evils, if I may put it that way. If we remove 
MMT, the production of gasoline will cause more pollution; if we 
keep MMT, and if indeed it does inhibit  the functioning of vehicle 
anti pollution devices, we will also increase pollution.
<P>
	So we are faced with two cases of increased pollution. The 
question is to decide logically and scientifically which is the better 
choice. It seems to me that the Minister of the Environment is not 
usually supposed to choose solutions that increase pollution; it 
should be the other way around.
<P>
	Under the circumstances, what is leading the Minister of the 
Environment to actually decide which of the two solutions is less 
polluting? The answer to that is: nothing. When you really look at 
the issue, it does not matter whether you are the petroleum 
industry, the members of the Reform Party or the Bloc, it is clear 
that there are no basically independent and scientific data to 
provide the proof.
<P>
	We only have to look at what happened with this in the United 
States to be convinced. On October 20, the United States appeal 
court for the District of Columbia-we quoted from the text in 
second reading, I think-decided to oblige the United States 
environmental protection agency to register MMT as an additive 
for unleaded gasoline. To date, the EPA has refused. In its decision, 
the court stated:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``On November 30, 1993 the EPA found that MMT had no 
adverse effects on automobile emission control systems''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Of course, we looked at what we had before us at the time. It 
does not mean that more detailed studies would not prove the 
opposite, but studies showed that MMT had no real effect. The EPA 
recognized de facto that MMT did not have a harmful effect on 
antipollution systems according to the tests which were done 
before them at the time.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	I submit to this House that the Minister of the Environment is 
supposed to be aware of these facts since-as her Quebec 
counterpart and our friends from the Reform Party pointed out 
earlier-several provinces, including Quebec, are now moving in 
the direction advocated by Reform members. As my colleague 
from the Reform Party mentioned, the Government of Quebec did 
send the minister a letter clearly explaining in detail its position on 
this matter.
<P>
	The ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeal I just referred to goes on 
to say, and I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
``For purposes of the resubmitted application EPA determined 
Ethyl had demonstrated that use of MMT at the specified 
concentration will not cause or contribute to  a failure of any 
emission 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16346"> 16346 </A></B>
<P>
control device or system to achieve compliance with the emission 
standards''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The few tests that were done and submitted to the court show no 
effects. And we have not heard of any tests that would point to a 
different conclusion.
<P>
	It is therefore increasingly evident that MMT will be 
reintroduced in the making of gas in the U.S.; in any case, there is a 
chance that it will be. Yet, the Minister of the Environment spends 
her time in this House talking about harmonizing Canada's 
environmental decisions with those made in the U.S. and elsewhere 
in the world. Under the circumstances, by proposing and defending 
Bill C-94, the Minister of the Environment is contradicting herself 
somewhat because if we ban MMT and if the U.S. approves this 
additive within a year, we will then have to reharmonize all these 
decisions.
<P>
	The bottom line is that if independent scientific tests showed 
conclusively that MMT is harmful, I think the House would vote 
unanimously to ban MMT. But not enough tests have been done.
<P>
	Given these facts, we have a right to question the environment 
minister's real motives in introducing this bill and trying to ram it 
through.
<P>
	On the one hand, it is obvious that the minister is trying to 
accommodate the interests of the powerful Canadian automobile 
manufacturers' lobby which happen to be located for the most part 
in her riding. On the other hand, the hike in gasoline prices 
resulting from this legislation, if passed, might prompt many 
consumers to try alternative fuels, such as ethanol, whose major 
producers also happen to be in the Hamilton area.
<P>
	If this interpretation is not accurate, then there is only one 
explanation. Quite simply, the minister is doing, with respect to the 
MMT issue, the same thing she did about the <I>Irving Whale</I>: she is 
improvising. Members will recall that, on many occasions in 
dealing with the latter issue-and I will not dwell on this 
either-the minister has shown that she was not qualified to deal 
with the situation.
<P>
	I suggest that, then too, the minister claimed to have at hand a 
load of studies which enabled her to send all other stakeholders 
about their business, at the risk of causing an environmental 
disaster. We know what this lead to: $12 million were spent for 
absolutely nothing, to refloat a ship that is still sitting on the 
bottom of the river. And these $12 million are coming out of the 
taxpayers' pockets, and not the Irving's pockets. The problem still 
remains unsolved as we speak. This ship is leaking and Greenpeace 
is about to get involved. Nothing has been settled. The whole thing 
will have to be done all over again. What we are requesting are 
studies to tell us what is the best way of going about this.
<P>
	We are confronted with a similar situation in Bill C-94. In order 
to avoid an environmental disaster, you have to do a minimum of 
scientific studies to assess the environmental impact of the 
contemplated measures. Otherwise, you are merely improvising.
<P>
	As regards the environmental impact studies on MMT, it is 
increasingly obvious that the rigour of these studies leaves 
something to be desired. Under the circumstances, I agree with the 
hon. member for Laurentides, who spoke on this issue yesterday 
and asked that the bill be deferred to a later date, when more 
comprehensive studies can establish beyond a reasonable doubt 
whether or not the addition of MMT to gas creates a dangerous 
source of pollution.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	The provinces pretty well agree that we should wait a little and 
do the required studies before making a final decision. I am talking 
here about independent scientific studies which would be public in 
nature.
<P>
	Oil companies also support that position. They have been telling 
us from the beginning: ``If there is conclusive evidence that the use 
of MMT in automobiles is harmful, we will change our whole 
system''. We should wait, as pointed out by our Reform Party 
colleagues, for the results of the tests being conducted in the United 
States, before making a decision.
<P>
	For all these reasons, we feel that we do not have all the required 
information to make an informed decision. Consequently, we will 
not support this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
good friend from the Bloc made some good points. The jury is still 
out and the evolution of fuels will continue. We have taken lead out 
of fuels. We can look at the MMT situation. We have to look at our 
colleagues in California. The member for Peterborough was right. 
They are leaders in this field.
<P>
	I will be speaking to this bill and directly concerning the onboard 
diagnostic equipment. Vehicles have new onboard diagnostic 
equipment systems. They are monitoring devices which feed back 
to the engine to make the engine control the emissions. Coming out 
of the tailpipe are oxides of nitrogen, unburned hydrocarbons, oil, 
carbon and water. Every time one gallon of gasoline is burned it 
produces one gallon of water. If we look at the tailpipe of any 
vehicle we will see water coming out of it. The use of a three way 
catalytic converter can control a lot of these things.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member is the next speaker. He 
is certainly entitled to use up the time for questions or comments if 
he wishes, but he is the next speaker on debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jackson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have more of a comment than a 
question. I understand what the hon. member is  saying but there is 
a point to be made about the onboard diagnostic equipment systems 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16347"> 16347 </A></B>
<P>
in cars because they could counteract the effects of what comes out 
of the tailpipe.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, how appropriate. I went to 
California during the summer break and I was able to see, as the 
Liberal member pointed out, how terrible the smog situation is in 
that state, whose population is as large as the whole population of 
Canada.
<P>
	What we are saying is that, to the best of our knowledge, there is 
no scientific evidence to back up what is implied in this bill, which 
is that MMT will in fact damage the pollution control system. If 
indeed California has made its choices a long time ago, it must 
have relied on some kind of test, and not only on vague ideas. If we 
could have access to these tests, we would readily admit that we 
have to ban the use of MMT in gasoline. Passing this bill is not a 
matter of principle, but a matter of pollution.
<P>
	If the use of MMT is banned, I know some people believe that it 
will be replaced by ethanol, but the oil companies have clearly 
stated that they would not use ethanol as a substitute for MMT. 
Instead of using MMT, they would require a more enhanced and a 
longer refining process.
<P>
	This would automatically lead to an increase in pollution. We are 
faced with two options: if we ban the use of MMT, we increase 
pollution due to the gasoline refining process, but, according to the 
auto industry, if we do not ban the use of MMT, we will damage the 
pollution control equipment, which will also lead to an increase in 
pollution.
<P>
	If we could have some concrete evidence, we would be in a 
better position to make up our minds and vote immediately on this 
issue. But we do not have any, we have no scientific data, which is 
why we stand by the position we have taken.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak about the environment. In the natural 
environment everything is related to everything else. Looking at 
the hydrostatic cycle for instance, when water evaporates and goes 
up in the atmosphere, it mixes with all kinds of contaminants and 
then comes back to earth.
<P>
<B>(1720 )</B>
<P>
	Photochemical smog is caused by the reaction of sunlight with 
nitrogen oxide, particularly in Los Angeles which is in a valley. 
Los Angeles is a good example because it has more cars than any 
other place. I am not sure exactly why it does not have any mass 
transit systems. I have visited Los Angeles quite often and I know 
the damage to the environment is bad. It is broadcast over the radio 
every day that there is eye  irritation from smog, or that people with 
respiratory problems should stay off the streets.
<P>
	I am going to address the onboard diagnostic equipment. Most 
members probably do not have the technical knowledge I have. I 
understand what they are saying about MMT, that an infinitesimal 
amount of nitrogen oxide will be emitted. However, I make the 
case that it could be controlled by installing devices on the 
vehicles.
<P>
	I will begin by speaking about what happens in a car. A person 
gets in a car and turns it on which uses gasoline. Gasoline has 
potential energy of 19,000 British thermal units per pound or per 
pint, depending on the kind it is. The gasoline is control burned in a 
vehicle resulting in pressure, forcing a piston down, turning the 
crankshaft, making a circular motion to the power take-off to drive 
the wheels which propel us along the road.
<P>
	In a four stroke cycle engine the air comes into the engine 
through an intake manifold with the intake valve and opens the 
piston moving down to the bottom of the cylinder, causing a 
vacuum in the cylinder. Injectors in this case, or if it is a 
carburetted engine a venturi effect would cause aspirated air in a 
stoichiometric ratio, which is about 14 parts of air to one part of 
gasoline by weight, or 9,000 parts of air to one part of gasoline by 
volume. That is what the computer will try to monitor by what is 
called a map sensor. Placed somewhere in the intake system of the 
vehicle is a piece of foil which takes a certain amount of 
temperature. That foil knows exactly the volume of air which is 
going into the engine. The injectors are monitored by a computer 
which says: ``I have this amount of cubic feet of air. Give me this 
amount of gasoline''.
<P>
	During deceleration periods, for instance on old carburetted 
engines coming down the hill with the throttle closed, a very large 
vacuum is created and the gasoline gets very rich. Those kinds of 
cars create a lot of pollution. On a modern car the system shuts off 
completely because of the onboard diagnostic system. There is 
absolutely no gasoline getting in, so it works quite well.
<P>
	On the intake stroke, the piston moves down and the cylinder is 
charged. The next stroke is the compression stroke. Both valves are 
closed, the piston moves up and it compresses the thing to about a 
tenth of its value. Because we are trying to get rid of nitrogen 
oxide, we have had to lower the compression ratio of engines. By 
lowering the compression ratio and bringing the temperature up, 
we can control nitrogen oxide as well.
<P>
	The piston comes up and compresses the gas into 10 per cent of 
its original volume. A sparkplug triggers it at a particular time. The 
timing is changed depending on the rate of speed in order to ensure 
that when the actual expansion of the gasoline occurs, when the 
pressure builds up, it reaches a certain angle on the crank. If it 
happens before or after, the engine fights against itself  and it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16348"> 16348 </A></B>
<P>
actually loses its power. The sparkplug is triggered to fire at a 
precise time, again by a computer.
<P>
	The process takes place very quickly. An engine running at 4,000 
RPM has 2,000 power strokes per RPM. If we divide that by 60, we 
will get about 33 sparks per second. The process would last for 
maybe one-thirtieth of a second. We can see the process happening 
very quickly. What happens is that all of that stuff escapes and goes 
into the exhaust system. It has to be monitored by a three way 
muffler, which I will talk about in a minute.
<P>
	The last stroke is the exhaust stroke. The piston moves from the 
bottom to the centre, coming up with the intake valve closed and 
the exhaust valve open. The piston pushes the gasoline out of the 
tailpipe.
<P>
	In the tailpipe there is a catalytic converter. In that catalytic 
converter is rhodium. Rhodium actually removes oxygen. There is 
platinum and palladium. Palladium actually adds oxygen. If we had 
H2 coming out and we wanted to change it to something else, we 
would add O. We could add O by using an air pump, which is seen 
on some cars, or we could add O by using a computer triggered 
diverter to pass the exhaust gases over the platinum, adding 
oxygen, and now we would have H2O. We have two sets of oxygen 
instead of one, which changes it into water. If we have CO, for 
instance, which is carbon monoxide and we want to change it to 
harmless carbon dioxide, we add O and get CO2. We have two Os.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	This is what the diagnostic pieces of equipment are doing. These 
speak in hertz. They go back and forth and report to the computer 
exactly what is happening. If there is a knock in the engine, then the 
computer knows and it will trigger the spark and retard or advance 
the spark.
<P>
	If the contaminants coming from the tailpipe are one thing or 
another, the oxygen sensor in this particular case will pick it up, tell 
the computer it is getting too many hydrocarbons and the computer 
will tell the injector to shut off. That is what we are talking about 
when we talk about onboard diagnostics.
<P>
	In the onboard diagnostics, there are things like an EGR valve. 
An EGR valve is used particularly to control nitrogen oxide. As I 
have said before, nitrogen oxide is the thing we talk about a lot. We 
say it is the main smog producer.
<P>
	One of the ways manufacturers get rid of nitrogen oxide is by 
using exhaust gas recirculation. The unburned gas out of the engine 
is recycled back through some mechanisms inside the engine and 
are burned again. The effect of burning it with the rest of the fuel 
that is in the engine drops the combustion chamber temperature. By 
dropping the combustion chamber temperature, it reduces the 
oxides of nitrogen.
<P>
	The NOx is also reduced from earlier emissions by using a heat 
stove. You might have seen on cars where there is an intake 
manifold and there is actually a heat stove. The heat stove allows 
either hot air to come off the exhaust pipe directly into the engine 
or it may mix. At some point in time hot air comes up past the 
exhaust pipe because it gets some heat off of it and some of it 
comes in through the snorkel. The two are mixed before the air gets 
into the engine. On a cold engine it makes the engine warm up very 
quickly.
<P>
	On modern cars, the onboard diagnostics trigger what is called 
an open loop system. Most everyone knows that when you get in a 
car, you do not pump the gas and do all those kinds of things we did 
with older cars which had carburettors on them. The reason we do 
not do that is that the computer and the onboard diagnostics 
monitor everything. It monitors the temperature. It knows if the 
engine is cold. If you come out and it is minus 20 degrees, it knows 
that the crankshaft is not turning because it is not picking up any 
RPM due to a magnetic device which is triggering it.
<P>
	The oxygen sensor indicates it has pure oxygen and the computer 
reports back in hertz very quickly, the same as brand new 
computers here, where the speed gets quicker. On these cars the 
onboard diagnostics are getting very, very quick in corresponding 
with one another. That is why there is talk about the effects of this 
onboard diagnostics.
<P>
	Imagine an exhaust sensor for instance in the exhaust system. If 
certain kinds of additives are used in the gasoline and it catches and 
interferes with the way it records or sends the information back to 
the computer, it would affect the way the car works. Of course, if it 
affects it then it triggers other things. What would happen is we 
would actually get more pollution than if we were using MMT 
because the thing is not working right.
<P>
	The onboard diagnostic equipment is very important to us. 
Onboard diagnostic equipment must be added to cars.
<P>
	I recently purchased a new car and I have a book here to monitor 
it. We have to closely monitor the new equipment. Instead of miles 
per gallon we are getting litres per kilometre. We have to get the 
amount of kilometres and divide it by 100. For instance, on my new 
car I am getting about 10.5 litres per 100 kilometres, which is about 
27 miles to the gallon. If I am getting 8.5 litres per 100 kilometres, 
I am getting something like 33 miles per gallon.
<P>
	We will find that the new vehicles are more fuel efficient than 
the old ones. The consumer will benefit with onboard diagnostic 
equipment. Canadians need to have the onboard diagnostic 
equipment. We do have this argument with fuels, but that argument 
should be between the automotive manufacturers and the fuel 
companies, and not this House.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="INTERVENERFUNDINGACT">INTERVENER FUNDING ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration from November 1, 1995, of 
the motion that Bill C-339, an act to provide for funding of 
interveners in hearings before certain boards and agencies, be now 
read a second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the debate on second reading of Bill 
C-339, standing in the name of the hon. member for Oxford.
<P>
	This bill, which is quite straightforward, establishes the 
principle that a proponent of a project that requires review and 
approval should assist with funding for interveners who would like 
to be heard. The hon. member for Oxford suggests adopting the 
principle that the proponent pays.
<P>
	On the face of it, we would support the principle of funding 
groups that want to participate in public hearings, because often, 
groups that represent less advantaged people in our society cannot 
afford to go and put forward their views and their interests or pay 
for scientific studies or even for the transportation to get to the 
hearings.
<P>
	Consider the studies required in the far North, for instance, 
where interveners lack the financial resources to travel, pay for 
accommodations, and so forth, when defending the interests of the 
people they represent.
<P>
	We have seen in the past citizens who were at a distinct 
disadvantage because they did not have the same resources as large 
businesses or developers to defend their interests. In fact, these 
businesses and developers can afford to pay lobbyists on a regular 
basis to push their projects ahead, while small groups that are not 
as organized and are not supported by the big guys are always 
looking for financial support.
<P>
	In other words, we do support the principle that proponents pay 
for the administrative costs related to the reviews. However, after 
examining this bill more thoroughly, we realize it has a much 
broader scope than it purports and offers few guarantees for the 
arm's length nature of the process it proposes.
<P>
	First of all, we should realize that this bill will create funding 
committees. Some public organizations already have a funding 
option. One example is the Environmental Assessment Agency 
established by Bill  C-56, which provides for a sort of funding from 
the government.
<P>
	How will the new funding panel work with the assessment 
agency? Naturally the government could save money by having the 
proponents pay, but why not simply amend Bill C-56 to include the 
concept of ``funding proponent''.
<P>
	We have to ask ourselves whether the panels proposed in Bill 
C-339 are not another layer of administrative structures and 
duplication within the federal system. We can also see in this bill 
the danger of federal interference in provincial jurisdiction. For 
example, in Bill C-56, the Environmental Assessment Act, the 
federal government is clearly meddling in provincial affairs. We 
could therefore end up with projects assessed by both levels of 
government with proponents having to pay twice to fund various 
interveners.
<P>
	I do not suppose proponents are interested in this costly 
duplication, which, moreover, delays the whole process of project 
approval. It is an obvious hinderance and has an impact on our 
economy and on job creation.
<P>
	I would now like to consider the independence of the funding 
panels. According to subclause 4(2), a review authority that 
receives an application from an intervener for intervener funding 
shall appoint a funding panel from its membership.
<P>
	To my mind, this provision reveals that the funding panel is 
clearly not independent of the review authority. Indeed, what 
happens when the authority assigned to review a project comes 
under the authority of a department that is the project promoter?
<P>
	The best example is doubtless the case of the refloating of the 
<I>Irving Whale</I>. Do you think that SVP, the Société pour vaincre la 
pollution and RMPG, the Regroupement madelinot pour la 
protection du golfe, could get funding through this bill? I have very 
strong doubts.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	People who will be appointed to the funding panel under the 
authority of the Minister of the Environment will certainly be 
under pressure from that same minister not to give groups such as 
the SVP and the RMPG, which are strongly opposed to her project, 
an opportunity to be heard.
<P>
	In other words, I believe that the government will have the 
power to choose which groups it is willing to listen to, and it will be 
able to reject those groups that do not share its views.
<P>
	Transparency and independence are lacking in this bill. The 
concept of funding proponent is good, but the process proposed in 
this bill is flawed. Therefore, the bill does not achieve its ultimate 
goal.
<P>
	About this process, it is worth noting that it appears to be rather 
cumbersome and complicated. For one thing, the funding panel 
will have to determine if the intervener  is eligible for funding, and 
from what we can read in clause 4, the least we can say is that 
interveners will be scrutinized. Also, the bill provides for an appeal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16350"> 16350 </A></B>
<P>
process to the review authority and ultimately to the Federal Court 
of Canada if the proponents and the interveners are not satisfied 
with the funding panel's decisions.
<P>
	Knowing full well how slow bureaucracy can be, I am sure that 
some interveners will be left high and dry. Projects will be 
completed and interveners will still be waiting for the outcome of 
the appeal process. The same goes for the proponent. In fact, I 
wonder if projects will be allowed to proceed during the appeal 
process. I would like the member for Oxford to answer this 
question.
<P>
	Finally, we think that this bill contains good ideas and that the 
principle on which it is based is innovative, but it has serious flaws.
<P>
	Bill C-339 is off the mark.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today in support of Bill C-339, an 
act to provide for funding for interveners in hearings before certain 
boards and agencies.
<P>
	I think we all know that politicians at all levels of government 
are suffering from a serious lack of credibility right now. People 
feel politicians are not listening to what they have to say and are 
refusing to tackle the very real concerns that touch their daily lives. 
They have the perception that government is selling out to the 
interests of big business. It may well be they are right, but for the 
wrong reasons. It may well be that the voices of the people are not 
being heard in many instances because they just do not have the 
funds to travel across the country to make their views known. They 
just do not have the money to hire lawyers, experts, researchers, 
and writers to present their point of view. The interests of the little 
guy are in fact getting lost in the shuffle.
<P>
	Over and over people have been saying that they want to have an 
input into government decision-making. We, as a government, 
have told them that we agree. However, as the Minister of the 
Environment said during the debate on the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act, ``It is one thing to say that people 
have a say; it is another thing to give them the tools to exercise 
their right.''
<P>
	Bill C-339 addresses this problem in a concrete way. By 
ensuring funding, it provides the tools necessary for the average 
citizen, regardless of his or her financial assets, to be heard in the 
decision-making process. Intervener funding will assure the public 
that those with a valid interest will be heard at future hearings and 
that the public will have input into government decisions.
<P>
	It is important to note that in drafting this excellent piece of 
legislation the member for Oxford was able to draw upon 
legislation that already exists in the province of Ontario. He was 
not reinventing the wheel. The Ontario government proclaimed the 
Intervenor Funding Project Act in 1989 as a three-year pilot 
project. In 1992 the province of Ontario conducted a review of the 
Intervenor Funding Project Act. This review, entitled ``Access and 
Impact: An Evaluation of the Intervenor Funding Project Act, 
1988'', showed broad support for the objectives of the legislation. 
The project was extended to the spring of 1996. I would like to 
quote from this report, as I think the experience in the province of 
Ontario is very close to that in the entire country:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The manner in which many administrative decisions were made in the 1960s 
and 1970s excluded members of the public, even though many decisions were 
required to be made in the public interest.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	Too often, agencies and tribunals were only presented with the 
view of the regulated industry or the applicant for an approval. As 
agencies are now faced with a bewildering array of social, 
economic, and moral questions, a critical view is that excluding 
diverse interests is no longer appropriate.
<P>
	Increasing public access to administrative decision-making is 
important for several reasons, first of which is fairness. Decisions 
regulating the conduct of businesses affect small or large segments 
of the public. Sometimes individuals are financially affected, each 
to a small degree, as with telephone or utility rates. Sometimes an 
individual's health and well-being are affected, as with 
environmental and food and drug regulation. In principle, if people 
are affected by decisions they should have the right to be heard.
<P>
	Second is quality of decisions. Where regulatory decisions affect 
the public and are required to be made in the public interest the 
quality of those decisions is improved when members of the 
affected public participate. They apprise the tribunal of facts that 
might not otherwise come to its attention. They assert different 
perspectives and opinions about the consequences of the decision 
to counter the assertions of the regulated industry. In this way the 
tribunal gains a better understanding of the range of dimensions of 
the public interest it is charged with serving. Better decisions 
result.
<P>
	Third is accountability. When members of the public participate 
in administrative decisions they gain an understanding of the 
balance that is struck between competing interests in reaching a 
decision. This process improves the accountability of the 
decision-maker and legitimizes the decisions for those who 
participate.
<P>
	I believe these statements fairly sum up the reasons in favour of 
the bill.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16351"> 16351 </A></B>
<P>
	During earlier debate there was some question of the fairness 
of requiring a private company to finance the group that may kill 
its application as well as some question of what would happen if 
the company were financially unable to fund the interveners. 
Again I would like to quote from the access and impact study:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We believe that more effective monitoring of the costs and benefits of the 
process will be achieved if those who are the focus of these decisions, the 
proponents, are made to bear the costs. It is they who are the centrepiece of the 
regulated activity. A critical aspect of that role requires effective participation 
by other interests while ensuring that participation is responsible.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I think it is obvious that a proponent who has to pay for this 
intervention will suddenly realize that consultation and 
co-operation and compromise are in their best interest, thus 
reducing or even eliminating the need for the intervention and 
confrontation.
<P>
	I urge all members to support this legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me pleasure to speak today on Bill C-339, an act 
to provide for the funding of interveners in hearings before certain 
boards and agencies.
<P>
	The bill introduced by the member for Oxford raises an issue of 
extreme importance to the House. The issue of intervener funding 
is of great interest to all elected officials. Parliamentarians are the 
first to recognize that public participation is fundamental to any 
meaningful consultative process. I believe that organizations that 
represent a relevant public interest should be able to participate in 
review processes.
<P>
	The question that does need to be answered is how do we fund 
citizens whose views should be brought forth.
<P>
<B>(1745 )</B>
<P>
	It would be useful to the debate to look at an intervenor funding 
program at work today. I will take a slightly different approach 
from other speakers on this subject and refer to the federal 
environmental assessment process which has included a participant 
funding program since 1991. The need for such a program was 
identified many years before.
<P>
	The 1987 white paper on the reform of the federal environmental 
review process addressed the need and proposed the establishment 
of a participant funding program. In national consultations carried 
out as part of the above reform some funding was made available 
by the previous government. The funds were administered by the 
federal environmental assessment review office and were provided 
to participants in the activities of federal or joint panels reviewing 
such projects as the Sainte-Marguerite hydroelectric development 
project and the Vancouver airport.
<P>
	The environmental assessment of large projects subject to public 
hearings is very complex and often results in  several volumes of 
technical information. We therefore cannot expect informed public 
participation unless the groups representing the citizens directly 
affected by the projects have access to funding. Participation in the 
environmental assessment process requires staff and technical 
resources for analysing reports, drafting the response, preparing 
briefs and presenting these views at public hearings.
<P>
	The participant funding program established in 1991 did not 
guarantee intervenor funding for all environmental assessments. 
This was not considered to be fair so the government recognized 
the flaw and created a statutory obligation to do so as promised in 
the Liberal Party's red book. Our government listened carefully to 
many Canadians who indicated that intervenor funding if carefully 
administered adds value to the environmental assessment process.
<P>
	Accordingly the Minister of the Environment in Bill C-56, an act 
to amend the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, put forth as 
a key amendment a legally entrenched participant funding program 
that ensures interested individuals and groups have the resources 
they require to participate effectively in the process. As a result the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act now recognizes 
intervenor funding as an integral component of the assessment 
process and creates a statutory obligation to establish a funding 
program for that purpose.
<P>
	The Minister of the Environment deserves much credit for 
making this amendment among others to the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act. The legal provision for intervenor 
funding goes hand in hand with other elements of the 
environmental assessment process which recognize the importance 
of public participation. These include the provision of numerous 
opportunities for public involvement at various stages of the 
assessment process and the creation of a public registry through 
which interested persons can have access to documents relating to 
all current assessments of the environment, both federal and joint 
federal-provincial.
<P>
	The participant funding program presently administered by the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency has many different 
uses and criteria because public input is crucial and should not be 
frivolous. The present program makes funds available for different 
stages of the environmental assessment process. It outlines exactly 
who is eligible and it describes what kind of activities will be 
funded. The program is funded over a six-year period and is made 
up of funds allocated by the federal government.
<P>
	Bill C-339 brings forward an aspect of intervenor funding that is 
of increasing importance: who should pay for public participation 
in environmental assessment. The debate on the issue is diverse in 
the opinions brought forth. There are those who support the 
proponent pays principle. Others suggest that any more cost to  
development would be the straw that breaks the camel's back. 
Others point to the ability to pay based on small versus large size 
businesses. Many will point out it is unthinkable that taxpayers foot 
the bill for those who will reap profits. There are diverse opinions 
in the harmonization of federal-provincial environmental 
assessment processes. It is certain there is no simple answer or easy 
direction.

<P>
	The government has recognized the need to look carefully at 
process efficiency as well as at all related expenditures. The 
Minister of the Environment is responding to this need. In last 
year's budget the Minister of Finance announced a special 
initiative:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Minister of the Environment will develop, in consultation with 
concerned ministers, provinces and stakeholders, proposals for recovering 
costs attributable to environmental assessment as well as options for 
streamlining procedures and time lines for the environmental assessment 
process.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is very clear. Since then the Canadian Environmental 
Assessment Agency has been developing the options in 
consultation with stakeholders.
<P>
	What I have just said is a fair mouthful with respect to an 
environmental assessment process. It has brought in some of the 
factors that have to be considered in looking at a bill of this import, 
of this initiative and of this way of looking at how we do things 
with respect to public intervention, public interest and public 
hearings.
<P>
	It has always been a policy of the Liberal government to involve 
the public. The best example I could give of that is the recent 
special standing committee on Canada's defence policy where 
policy was formed from the bottom up. Previously, to my 
knowledge, it was always done from the top down. The public 
process in formulating the white paper on defence was very 
important to this party and is why we did it that way.
<P>
	Returning to the subject at hand in Bill C-339, if we are looking 
at cost recovery with respect to public participation, it is obvious 
that any successful initiative will have to contain certain process 
efficiency elements. If we are to ask proponents to assume certain 
costs we must be able to commit to efficiency of process. If 
individuals or organizations are to pay the cost of public 
participation surely they must receive some guarantee that there 
will be a certainty of process.
<P>
	I have spoken long enough to make the point I wanted to make 
on the bill. I have used the example of a recent system that is in 
operation. There are still some questions to be answered. However 
in looking at Bill C-339 some of the proposals put forth and some 
of the examples used could be used in the model. The concerns are 
being addressed and we look forward to the options that will be 
presented.
<P>
	Bill C-339 contributes very positively to the debate on public 
participation by recognizing these concerns.  However I caution 
that we should wait for the completion of the government process I 
have just described before we proceed, as we say in the navy, at full 
speed ahead.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to rise in the House in support of Bill C-339 sponsored 
by the hon. member for Oxford.
<P>
	In so doing I need to address the question of exactly what is 
meant by intervenor funding. I would characterize intervenor 
funding as up front funding to assist Canadians before they 
participate in a process, to assist Canadians who have real interests 
in matters of public concern before a board, commission or an 
agency.
<P>
	One needs to reflect on the question of who should receive such 
intervenor funding. The strongest argument can be made that such 
funds should be available to landowners first and foremost, to 
people whose properties are impacted by a decision of government 
and who have every right and responsibility on behalf of their 
families to participate in a decision by this government or by any 
government. They have the right to participate to make sure the 
best possible decision is made and that their rights as property 
owners and as Canadians are respected.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	My colleague has previously spoken about making sure we do 
not fund frivolous objections. I would certainly support that. All 
too often people are quick to make frivolous objections and want to 
intervene in the process. I would not support funding for those 
kinds of objectors, but certainly there are many legitimate concerns 
that need to be raised by Canadians and we ought to fund such 
individuals.
<P>
	The funding needs to be up front. People need to know they will 
have an opportunity to hire counsel and various other experts to 
assist them in their presentations. They need to know that before 
the fact and not after the fact. To me it really is not legitimate 
intervenor funding and proper if it is not guaranteed to people up 
front.
<P>
	In supporting the bill I do so with some firsthand involvement in 
the process. As the member of Parliament for London-Middlesex 
and as the chair of the southwestern Ontario Liberal caucus, and as 
my colleague for Oxford well knows, I have been directly involved 
along with him and other members in our region in issues of this 
type in southwestern Ontario.
<P>
	We have had several instances of the building of interprovincial 
pipelines through our region which have involved the public in 
protracted disputes, the most recent one before the National Energy 
Board. Landowners are laying out thousands of dollars of their own 
money having to organize themselves without the help of counsel 
unless they pay for such counsel. Why? It is because a company 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16353"> 16353 </A></B>
<P>
wishes to use their lands supposedly for the public good but 
certainly for the good  of the company. Yet the people involved 
have to make sure their rights are respected.
<P>
	In the latest example the people went before the National Energy 
Board some months ago and won the argument they put forward. 
They made a very good case. Yet the whole question of funding is 
up in the air for these people and we need to address that.
<P>
	Perhaps the biggest inequity is that in Ontario there are two sets 
of rules where landowners are concerned. The first set of rules 
comes under the provincial government. If a pipeline comes under 
provincial jurisdiction such landowners are guaranteed that they 
will have funding provided to them under the provincial rules. 
However, if the pipeline involved comes under federal jurisdiction 
there is no such guarantee. It is a very clear and obvious inequity.
<P>
	In the case of some of my constituents, farmers have two 
pipelines on their land barely feet apart, one coming under 
provincial jurisdiction and one coming under federal jurisdiction. 
When they are involved in hearings before the National Energy 
Board or other agencies or commissions, they are funded when 
they go to provincial hearings but are not funded when they go to 
federal hearings. This seems patently unfair and certainly an 
inequitable situation that our government needs to address.
<P>
	I fully support my colleague from Oxford and his Bill C-339. As 
a Liberal I believe it is the role of government to ensure the little 
guy has full opportunity to participate on a level playing field with 
big corporations in society. We have to do everything possible to 
facilitate that.
<P>
	It is not enough to say to people that they can appear before the 
National Energy Board and argue for their rights as citizens. It is 
simply not enough to do that if they do not have the means to do so, 
if they do not have the wherewithal to make that presentation. That 
means funding and that is why I fully support the bill. I think the 
member is on the right track. The government needs to make sure 
the playing field is level, that this inequity is addressed and that a 
landowner, particularly in the province of Ontario, does not have to 
play under two different sets of rules. The only way we can ensure 
that is to have meaningful, up front, intervenor funding available to 
serious Canadians, certainly landowners, who have a legitimate 
concern and who want to argue that concern before whatever board, 
commission or agency.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	I fully support the bill and applaud my colleague for bringing it 
forward. I hope the bill will pass.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin-Norfolk, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
my privilege to speak on Bill C-339 as introduced by my colleague 
representing the riding of Oxford. I take this opportunity to 
congratulate and thank my colleague for the great amount of work 
and research he has put into Bill C-339. He truly has done a 
marvellous job.
<P>
	The primary objective of this legislation is to give all of those 
who speak in the public interest the opportunity to be heard before 
federal boards and agencies. Federal boards and agencies will make 
better decisions with a higher level of public input, consultation 
and participation. Bill C-339 is designed to assist those with bona 
fide concerns. It is not meant to provide funding for special interest 
groups. It is in the interest of each of us for the public interest to be 
heard. Bill C-339 will ensure the public interest is heard.
<P>
	Bill C-339 is modelled after the intervenor funding act in the 
province of Ontario. The bill establishes the principle that a 
proponent of a project that requires approval by a federal board or 
agency should financially assist those who are intervening in the 
public interest before the board. The bill allows intervenors to put 
forward their perspective in a way which would allow the board to 
make a decision having the best information available.
<P>
	This intervenor funding act will be a significant step forward for 
groups speaking in the public interest that do not have funds 
available to make an adequate representation in a highly technical 
age.
<P>
	Before receiving funding, intervenors will need to meet the 
following criteria. First, that the intervenor represents a clearly 
ascertainable interest that is relevant to the issue before the review 
authority and that should be represented at the hearing. Second, 
that the intervenor does not have sufficient financial resources to 
make a representation without funding. Third, that the intervenor 
has made reasonable efforts to obtain funding from other sources.
<P>
	Fourth, that the intervenor has established a record of concern 
for a commitment to the interest. Fifth, that the intervenor has 
made reasonable efforts to co-operate with other intervenors who 
represent similar interests. Sixth, the absence of funding would 
adversely affect the representation of that interest.
<P>
	Seventh, the intervenor has a proposal that specifies the use to 
which funding would be put, has the ability to record the 
expenditure of the funding and has agreed to submit an accounting 
to the panel for the expenditure and allow the panel to examine its 
records to verify the accounting. In other words, the funding would 
be used to help balance the playing field between those with 
money, with resources, and those without. It would add an element 
of accountability for government funds.
<P>
	Intervenor funding is not a new concept in our country. The 
province of Ontario currently has an intervenor funding project act 
which has served as the model for this legislation. The Ontario act 
was in turn modelled on the funding provided for the intervenors 
before the Mackenzie Valley pipeline inquiry, known as the Berger 
commission, in the mid-1970s.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="16354"> 16354 </A></B>
<P>
	This commission, charged with the duty of investigating the 
appropriateness of a pipeline through the Mackenzie Valley in the 
Northwest Territories, determined that many diverse interests in 
the region should be represented at the hearing. In order to 
compete with the finances available to the proponents of the 
pipeline, money had to be provided to the citizens groups.
<P>
	Environmental groups and native representatives obtained 
funding in order to present their views on how the pipeline would 
affect their interests. Without funding it would have been difficult 
for the intervenors to retain technical and legal experts for the 
purposes of putting forward testimony on how the public would 
affect environmental and native interests in the north.
<P>
	The commission made clear that intervenors would have to show 
that absence of funding would adversely affect the quality of their 
presentations. This burden is placed on intervenors in this 
legislation who must appear before a funding panel for approval.
<P>
	While funding from the Berger commission was provided by the 
federal government, Bill C-339 does not call on the Canadian 
taxpayer to provide funding for intervenors. Instead, the proponent 
of the project will provide the funding. Clearly if the proponent is 
required to bear the cost of interventions they are more likely to 
work with potential intervenors to find a solution before going 
before the board or agency. The Ontario experience has shown the 
effectiveness of this method of funding.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	This bill is important because it is in the interest of all of us that 
the public interest be heard. Federal boards and agencies will be 
able to make better decisions based on a higher level of public 
access and consultation.
<P>
	Bill C-339 is designed to assist those bona fide concerns. It is not 
meant to provide funding for special interest groups. I urge all 
members to support Bill C-339.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="MANPOWERTRAINING">MANPOWER TRAINING</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this late show question refers to a question I put to the 
Minister of Human Resources Development on Bill C-96, which 
seeks to give the federal government full control over manpower 
training.
<P>
	My question was asked before the referendum. Now that the 
results are known, I can say that bringing up that question again at 
this time will give us rather clear indications as to the real desire 
for change that exists in the federal government, if it agrees to 
withdraw Bill C-96 or to amend it in such a way that the provinces 
will have full jurisdiction over manpower training.
<P>
	This is an opportunity for the federal government to proceed 
with a meaningful decentralization and to delegate jurisdiction 
over manpower training. We are frequently asked why both levels 
of government are so stubbornly determined to keep their 
involvement in that area. The answer is that one of the two 
governments, the Government of Quebec, and the governments of 
all other provinces for that matter, has jurisdiction over education, 
and that education has a direct impact on manpower, because it 
includes not only primary, high school and college level education, 
but also the training of people who are coming back or want to 
come back on the labour market and want to get better training.
<P>
	The other level of government got involved in the area of 
education by using its spending power and misusing, I would say, 
the unemployment insurance fund. This year, for example, a $5 
billion surplus was created in the fund, and the department wants to 
use that money to meddle in manpower training.
<P>
	This is a real life situation where useless duplication between 
governments is very expensive for Quebecers and Canadians and 
programs that are set up are not always effective. The purpose of 
<P>

<B><A NAME="16355"> 16355 </A></B>
<P>
our representations is to ask the minister if he could withdraw Bill 
C-96 or find a  way to give to those provinces who want it complete 
control over manpower.
<P>
	This is not only a matter of administrative agreements. Such 
agreements were offered in the past, notably to the previous 
Quebec Liberal government which, although a federalist 
government, turned them down, since, without full delegation, it 
would be difficult for the Quebec government to take on such a 
responsibility.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	This will have an impact on several areas of activity. In taking 
action, the Quebec government must be able to take into account 
the impact on social assistance and on other aspects of training, for 
instance, and, thus, draw up an action plan for several years to 
come.
<P>
	If the delegation is only good for three or five years or is not 
complete, the Quebec government will not be able to ensure the 
success of its actions. This is why it is hoped that the federal 
government will agree to delegate the whole area of manpower to 
Quebec, in compliance with the request made as a result of the 
consensus reached by the unions, the Conseil du patronat, as well 
as by all of the political parties in Quebec. Therefore, in these times 
when the federal government is again promising us change, will it 
show at last a real willingness to do so?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member is obviously confused as to the intent and scope of 
Bill C-96.
<P>
	For example, clause 6 of the bill does not provide the Minister of 
Human Resources Development with any new powers. These 
already existed within the predecessor's departments and are 
simply consolidated to provide a more efficient response to the 
needs of Canadians.
<P>
	Clause 20 allows the minister to enter into agreements. Again 
this is nothing new, as the minister already has similar authority 
under existing legislation. As the member should know, this 
authority is very important to serving the needs of Canadians. For 
example, under the program for older worker adjustment, the 
minister signs agreements with provinces to set up the program and 
with financial institutions to buy annuities on behalf of designated 
unemployed older workers.
<P>
	This program has been of particular importance to Quebec where 
in 1994-95, the federal government spent $35.4 million, 
representing 66 per cent of total expenditures nation-wide to buy 
annuities on behalf of 1,255 older Quebec men and women. By the 
end of 1994-95, 4,260 Quebecers were benefiting from annuities 
purchased under the authority of POWA.
<P>
	Of course, the federal government will continue to seek out the 
co-operation of its partners in establishing flexible programs and 
efficient arrangements. The  government has continuously acted in 
this spirit since its election in October 1993.
<P>
	For example, the Canada student loans program provides grants 
to women and persons with disabilities. Quebec has chosen to opt 
out and runs its own student loans program. In 1994-95, Quebec 
received a federal payment of over $92 million to do so.
<P>
	The new Canada health and social transfer will provide block 
funding to provinces for post-secondary education, health and 
social assistance. The CHST will enhance provincial flexibility in 
allocating federal resources according to each province's priorities.
<P>
	The strategic initiatives program funds innovative projects based 
on provincial priorities. We were all pleased when the minister 
announced on August 29 that he had come to an agreement on this 
important initiative with his Quebec colleague. As a result, an 
estimated 29,000 additional Quebecers will be receiving assistance 
over the next three years under the APPORT and Formation 
professionelle au secondaire programs.
<P>
	It is clear that the hon. member is more interested in ideology 
than ideas. This bill is another step forward in the reform process 
leading to a more efficient and effective government. I urge him to 
support Bill C-96.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CHILDPOVERTY">CHILD POVERTY</A></H4>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
respond to the remarks made by the Minister of Human Resources 
Development in answering a question on child poverty. Today, I 
would like to get a better answer than the one the minister then 
gave me.
<P>
	When I asked him if he would agree that cuts to the 
unemployment insurance program and the transfers to provinces 
would force more women and children to join the ranks of the 
poorest citizens, the minister simply answered this, and I quote: 
``One of the real purposes for undertaking a major modernization 
of our social programs is to tackle the whole problem of poverty 
faced by women and children''.
<P>
	Those are fine principles. But reality is another matter 
altogether. Moreover, in conclusion, the minister even had the 
nerve to recall that the fight against poverty requires efforts by all 
levels of government, employers, unions, social groups and 
women's associations.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	That is really showing a lack of responsibility. How can we not 
be totally disconcerted by a government that casually offloads its 
burden onto all the others, while pretending that it has good 
intentions?
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="16356"> 16356 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to remind the government, and especially the Minister of 
Human Resources Development, to whom history will attribute the 
indecent increase in the number of poor women and children in 
Canada and in Quebec,  that the massive cuts and the shameless 
manipulation of the unemployment insurance fund have a direct 
and unavoidable consequence: they increase the number of welfare 
recipients.
<P>
	It is not hard to understand. In Quebec alone, last July, 477,771 
households were on welfare. In Quebec alone, as a direct 
consequence of the current government's ineptitude, there are 
almost 50,000 new social welfare recipients since it came to power. 
In Quebec alone, 249,567 children count on welfare benefits for 
their very survival and are suffering the consequences. That is more 
than a quarter of a million children. And the minister has the gall to 
tell us that women's associations must do their share. He has the 
gall to tell us that social groups must also do their share.
<P>
	This government must review all the cuts it wants to make. It 
must look at them through its gender analysis prism it has been 
boasting so much about on the international scene. The social 
program reform so dear to the minister would not stand up to such 
an analysis very long, and that is why his government is waiting so 
long to implement it. The conclusion is obvious: the reform will 
clearly penalize women and children the most.
<P>
	This government must work to reduce poverty among women 
and children, and not to increase it, as is currently the case.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the federal government is very concerned with poverty among 
Canadian children. Of particular concern are the six out of ten 
lone-parent families headed by women who live in low-income 
situations.
<P>
	The best security for children is for their parents to have jobs. 
Consequently, the government is working diligently to establish 
conditions that create full-time employment. As a result of these 
efforts, women now occupy more than half of the 505,000 new 
full-time jobs that have been created across Canada since October 
1993, as well as the 142,000 jobs created in Quebec.
<P>
	For those who have not yet found employment we have 
introduced a higher benefit rate for unemployed poor families. This 
benefit rate is now providing up to $1,000 more in benefits for 
these UI claims. As of July 1995 over 383,000 Canadians have 
benefited from the 60 per cent benefit rate, including nearly 
300,000 women. In Quebec over 110,000 claimants have received 
the 60 per cent benefit rate, including over 85,000 women.
<P>
	The government intends to present shortly a new program of 
employment insurance, which will better help unemployed 
Canadians find jobs. As the Prime Minister stated in a speech on 
November 1, ``We have to change the focus because we want to 
give a dependable security for the people who are raising families 
on low incomes''.
<P>
	Beyond these changes the Department of Human Resources 
Development has launched a series of strategic initiatives with 
provincial and territorial governments. In Quebec the federal 
government is supporting a major initiative to help over 25,000 
parents make the transition from social assistance to work. Federal 
support of up to $54 million will be provided for the wage 
supplementation program in the next four years.
<P>
	In the member's own riding of Quebec there are several human 
resources development projects under way involving 
approximately 400 women, which are aimed at helping them 
overcome the difficulties in order to enter the labour force.
<P>
	The federal government continues to take serious and concrete 
actions to improve the well-being of Canada's children. Through 
reform of social programs at both the federal and provincial levels 
more can be done to tackle the serious issue of child poverty.
<P>
