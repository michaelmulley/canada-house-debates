<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, actually 
Bill C-10 is not that bad.  It is a reasonable bill because it 
changes the title of the bill to refer to payments in lieu of 
taxes rather than grants in lieu of taxes.  That is a pretty 
reasonable thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing we need to recognize is that the bill provides a 
certain element of fairness and equity to municipalities so that 
they can actually predict what will be happening and they can 
make projections in terms of budgeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is supported by the Federation of Canadian 
Municipalities.  It is certainly consistent with Reform Party 
policy, which is that governments should be paying the same 
property taxes that other citizens of Canada pay. It is very 
important that we have fairness, equality and equity in the whole 
business of property taxes as far as the government is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However some very significant amendments need to take place at 
this time.  In particular, we need to recognize the 
accountability factor in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides discretionary power to the minister. It gives 
the minister the discretionary power to do a number of things. He 
may pay the taxes; he may not pay the taxes.  He may make those 
payments or he may not.  He may pay those taxes late.  If they 
are paid late, he may decide whether or not they are in fact 
late.  He also may decide whether he should pay supplementary 
payments, such as interest payments, on those particular late 
payments of taxes.  All of that is at the discretion of the 
minister. The same discretion also applies to the corporations. 
While the constitution provides that the Government of Canada 
cannot be forced to pay property taxes or make payments in lieu 
of taxes, the coercion element cannot be done unless there is a 
constitutional amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another factor could be introduced here.  That factor is to 
ensure that the minister, when he decides to change the 
assessment, the time of payment or the supplementary payments in 
lieu of interest or a late payment, in all of those cases the 
minister should be required to provide a reason for his 
particular delay or his change or amendment of the amount that he 
should be paying to the respective municipalities. That should be 
a requirement of the minister. It does not ensure that the 
minister does not have discretion; he does have discretion, but 
he must account for that discretion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that is a reasonable amendment.  It is one which I think 
we should all expect.  Why is that so important?  In lieu of what 
has just happened to one of the minister's colleagues in Human 
Resources Development Canada, I would think that the minister 
would welcome that kind of accountability.  Then the 
municipalities could not say, “He is just doing this for his 
friends.  His friends, if he has some in municipal government, 
get paid right away and they get paid the exact amount. Others 
who are not his friends get paid later or they do not get paid 
interest or whatever”.  There could be no accusation of 
favouritism.  I think the minister would welcome that sort of 
thing. The same argument applies to the crown corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to refer to how serious this can become. There are some 
things that happened in that audit which was done recently.  I 
want to read a couple of those things into the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the findings of that audit was on 13 signatures that were 
selected during the file review.  It was revealed that in three 
cases out of the 13, that is almost 25%, the delegation 
instrument, that is, giving somebody the delegated authority to 
sign something, in three instances out of 13 files, which is 25%, 
the signing officer, that authority, could not be produced. 
In 25% of the cases the guy had delegated power but he could not 
actually say who had delegated that power to him.  This is

</I></B></P><P align=left>In six cases, almost half, the delegation was only valid upon 
notification of acting and for a limited period of time.  No such 
notification had been received for the period the document was 
signed.  Even if the delegation had taken place, it was for a 
very specific time, a time in which the person with the delegated 
power exercised signature authority that was outside the 
parameters originally delegated to him.  That is pretty serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another one case under contracting.  In four 
contribution agreements out of every ten reviewed, irrelevant 
clauses in standard agreements were not crossed out or blanks 
were not filled in to specify conditions such as the periodicity 
of the submission of claims or the period of notification if it 
were necessary for HRDC to terminate the project before 
completion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Listen to this one.  In one-third of the projects reviewed, the 
original dollar value of the agreement was upward in most cases. 
In 36% of these cases the reason for the amendment was not 
documented.  It requested one amount, the amount was reviewed and 
it increased in 36% of the cases.  This is the kind of thing that 
should never happen.  This has to be revealed through an audit as 
an indictment of the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are trying to introduce in this legislation is a clause 
that would protect and help the Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services.  It would be amended in such a way that it 
would make it easier for him to have an administration that is 
sound, honest, trustworthy and transparent and where the 
processes will bear examination.  It will make it clear to all 
and sundry that the minister is doing his job uprightly, 
honestly, fairly and in the best interests of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the amendments in group one are all about.  We 
specifically suggest Motion No. 4.  The bill currently reads that 
“the minister may make payments”.  It is not possible, as I 
indicated before, that he be forced to make those payments. We 
would suggest, however, that if he does not want to make those 
payments, then he must justify that particular situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are there such cases?  Yes, there are.  There is a dispute right 
now involving the Halifax Citadel with regard to who should pay 
the taxes on the property.  The Department of Public Works and 
Government Services has agreed to pay for the part that is a 
shelter but not for the entire structure.  The argument is that 
this has to be interpreted.  The department is suggesting that 
the interpretation be done by a court, which is not unreasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, should the assessment be left to professional 
assessment people?  I think this is an argument that clearly 
shows that Public Works and Government Services has done 
something right.  It is asking some good questions. However, the 
point remains that there has to be a reason given whenever these 
payments are stopped.  In this case the payments were stopped. 
The minister should be required by law to give a reason for his 
particular noncompliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other case has to do with the advisory panel that falls 
under Group No. 2, which I will not deal with here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now deal with Motion No. 7.  Motion No. 7 would amend the 
ministerial discretion which says “in the opinion of the 
minister” as pertaining to the period that the payment has been 
unreasonably delayed.  The municipality sends out a notice of 
taxation indicating that the bill is due at a particular time. 
The dates are very clear and very specific.  If the payment is 
not made at that time but made at a later date—let us say it is 
due on July 1 and the payment is not made until July 
31—according to the act, if in the opinion of the minister that 
payment is late, he may recognize it.  This is not a matter of 
opinion.  It is very clear that if the taxes are due on July 1, 
they are due on that date, not on July 31.  If the taxes have not 
been paid on July 1, then they are late.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment makes it clear that the minister should have a 
clear explanation of what it is he is doing when he opines a 
shift in date like this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this really does is it puts the payment in lieu of taxes on 
a more solid footing and moves in the direction of making the 
minister accountable.  It is in the interest of all Canadians, 
and I think in the interest of the minister, to have that kind of 
protection in law.  The minister would now be able to withstand 
any audit that might cast aspersions that he has not administered 
his department well.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am delighted 
to speak to Bill C-10.  We have been following it closely for 
some time in the riding of Saint-Jean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be debating something very important here. 
Historically, the Queen did not have to pay taxes to her 
subjects.  This is an old issue.  The Anglo-Saxon people were 
great colonizers and their practice was, as soon as they 
conquered part of a continent or a country, to establish a rule 
that the Queen, who had conquered the land, did not pay taxes to 
her subjects.  Quite the reverse, her subjects were to pay taxes 
to her, often excessively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are in a longstanding debate, which the government is 
trying to update, because it has been going on for some time. 
There have been changes over the years.  In the early days of 
Confederation, the federal government, following in the 
tradition of its predecessors, did not want to pay taxes to the 
people and to municipalities.  They did not want to make 
transfer payments.  The idea was to collect money to enrich the 
central government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years, the government was obliged to assume certain 
responsibilities, because the people in the municipalities knew 
very well that they had to pay their municipal taxes to the 
municipality.  Not only did they pay taxes to the federal 
government, but they had to pay them to the provincial 
government, and they paid property taxes to the municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was rather difficult for a subject to pay taxes on the full 
assessed value of his residence and see that the Queen or the 
central government did not pay taxes on federal buildings in 
municipalities.  Still the principle that the Queen does not 
have to pay taxes was maintained in part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To avoid saying that these were taxes the federal government had 
to pay, they were called payments in lieu of taxes.  This is the 
point at which the arbitrariness starts, because I pay taxes on 
the full assessed value of my residence, but things are not at 
all the same for the federal government, which never pays on the 
full assessed value of buildings and land it owns in 
municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years, some municipalities have come to realize that 
the situation was not only arbitrary, but that it was also 
extremely difficult to budget year after year, because they find 
themselves at the mercy of the minister who can say “Listen, I 
sent you <I>X</I> number of dollars last year or two years ago. Now I 
am considering reducing that amount”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give the figures for Saint-Jean. The city of Saint-Jean has 
a budget of $50 million, out of which $4.2 million come from a 
federal transfer in lieu of taxes. This is easy to understand. 
There are many federal properties in the riding of Saint-Jean, 
including the military base, Agriculture Canada's research 
centre and the old military college. Incidentally, I hope the 
government will announce in its February 28 budget that it will 
correct the current situation and reopen the military college. 
However, this issue was already a concern when that institution 
closed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the military college closed, the city of Saint-Jean was 
getting $900,000 in taxes from that institution. Members can see 
why the city is anxious to find out what will happen regarding 
these taxes.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That amount was maintained in the money given to the military 
college, with the result that, today, the city of Saint-Jean 
receives $4.2 million from the federal government, out of a 
budget of $50 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But when we found out that a consultation would take place and 
that it would be important for the federal government to 
determine certain conditions and provide certain specifications 
on how it was going to hand out that money from now on, I 
immediately warned not only the city of Saint-Jean, but the 
various municipalities in which there are federal properties. 
I did that because the examples from recent years clearly show 
that when the government wants to reform soomething, it is never 
because it wants to give back more to the public. It is always 
to give less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many typical examples, including the Canada social 
transfer. At one time, before the Canada social transfer, the 
federal government was giving money to the provinces for social 
assistance, health and post-secondary education. What has the 
Liberal government done since 1994? It has put all this into a 
single program, a single item called the Canada social transfer. 
And the amounts transferred are no longer the same. The 
provincial government is currently experiencing a $1.7 billion 
shortfall. No wonder things are bad in emergency wards, not only 
in Quebec, but in the other provinces also. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is unemployment insurance, now dubbed employment 
insurance, where, in the name of reform, the government has 
managed to arrange for individuals to receive less.  Right now, 
the government is pocketing between $6 and $7 billion, having 
reduced eligibility for these programs and worked it so that now 
people pay premiums from the first hour of work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot more goes into the government coffers than comes out, 
with the result that the government is getting richer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wanted to be sure that when the government said that it 
was going to consult, to set up a panel with the municipalities 
to discuss the issue, that these municipalities would not be 
left worse off. 
We know what happens when the municipalities have less.  The 
federal government hangs on to the money and the provinces, 
municipalities and citizens are left to make up the difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public is sick and tired of taxes and tell us so repeatedly. 
I hope that the government is now going to introduce parameters 
that are just and fair for municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this connection, we have suggested a number of changes that I 
hope will be implemented. 
An advisory panel has already been set up, that will advise the 
minister when there is a dispute with the municipalities.  While 
we are on the topic, one thing we would really like to see is a 
lot of surveyors because they have the necessary specialization 
and will probably establish as fairly as possible what the 
federal government owes the municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will also end arbitrary actions for once and for all.   The 
city of Saint-Jean will be able to annually budget an amount that 
it can be sure to have, instead of the minister getting up on 
the wrong side of the bed one morning and closing a federal 
institution in a municipality and he no longer paying the taxes 
since it has been closed or he wants to sell it to someone else. 
Until it is sold, the municipality is in limbo, sort of, 
deprived of revenue from the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that if we want the minister to have a good advisory 
panel, this must include surveyors, and in order to keep this 
from ending up, as usual with the Liberals, as another patronage 
plum, or nepotism, it is also important for these people to be 
appointed by a public competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, generally speaking, we are fairly satisfied to put an end to 
the arbitrariness.  With the new measures, we feel the 
municipalities are going to be in a far better position to 
prepare their budgets efficiently, and I also hope the 
government will not take seize the opportunity to say “Now we 
have new parameters, we will reduce our transfers a little”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will keep an eye out for this.  It is very important for 
those of us in the City of Saint-Jean and in the surrounding 
municipalities to be able to plan budgets properly year after 
year.  There are many federal buildings and we want to ensure 
that the revenue from them will at least be the equivalent of 
what we were receiving before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope these new parameters will mean more municipal revenue 
instead. It is important for me to speak on this matter today 
because of the importance of federal government buildings to the 
municipalities in the riding of Saint-Jean.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to 
participate briefly in today's debate on Bill C-10. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than anything else, this bill reminds us of that horrible 
time in Canadian history when the Conservatives formed the 
government.  It is one of those points that we cringe to recall, 
but it is real.  Those early years in the 1990s were terrible 
years for Canada, terrible years for Canadians and, quite 
frankly, a disaster for the House, with continuous contempt of 
parliament and a disregard for the rules and traditions of the 
House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Which the Liberals pretended they cared 
about then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  At that time the Liberals indicated that 
they were concerned.  Now they have demonstrated that they are 
probably worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to concentrate on the Conservative government under Brian 
Mulroney, and later Kim Campbell, because they started what this 
bill attempts to address.  In 1992, one of the low points in the 
history of our country when the Conservatives were in office with 
a huge majority, they decided they were going to do something to 
punish municipalities from coast to coast.  There were thousands 
of municipalities and the Conservatives said “We are going to 
freeze our grants in lieu of taxes to the municipalities”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The municipalities had just gone through difficult, struggling 
times and were trying to predict their revenues for the next 
year.  After all, they were, and are, the closest government to 
the people in terms of delivering programs.  The municipalities 
make decisions on sewers, water treatment, road building, 
sidewalks, tot lots, parks and recreational facilities for the 
people of their cities.  Given the fact that most Canadians are 
now living in cities, the municipal governments have become very 
close to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The municipalities depend on their ability to predict revenue 
sources to plan their budgets.  There are somewhere between 
50,000 and 60,000 federal properties in cities, which are all 
supposed to make grants in lieu of taxes.  This enables the 
municipalities to plan and budget for the future, to plan to 
introduce new programs to assist the needs of the people in the 
various municipalities across the country.  Along came the 
Conservatives, who said “Forget all your work.  Forget all your 
planning.  Forget all your projections.  Forget all the 
improvements you want to make to your city.  We are going to 
freeze your grants.  We do not care what you think.  We do not 
care what you say”.  There were no consultations, no 
discussions.  They said “We are so smart because we have formed 
the Conservative government in Ottawa.  We are going to freeze 
your grants in lieu of taxes, and to hell with you.  We do not 
care what you think”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  They froze their grants off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  They froze their grants right off. 
Imagine what that did to the leaders of the municipalities across 
the country.  They were shocked.  All of a sudden their plans 
went out the window.  They had been dutifully planning, working 
hard on behalf of the residents of their cities, all for naught 
because the Conservative Government of Canada froze their grants 
overnight without telling them anything about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You know how wrong that was, Mr. Speaker.  You know how wronged 
the people of Canada were at that point.  You knew what a wrong 
and inappropriate decision that was to take, but the 
Conservatives took it nevertheless.  It was a very dark day for 
our country and a very dark day for the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that my colleague from Winnipeg—Transcona remembers the 
day when that announcement was made.  It was a very dark moment, 
but that is what we have to live with from time to time.  My 
friend from Winnipeg—Transcona says that to this day he has not 
gotten over that shock.  I know he means it because it was one of 
those dastardly deeds that takes place every now and again in the 
House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something had to be done.  We could not allow the federal 
government to do whatever it wanted to anybody and at any time. 
Constitutionally it had the right, and it used it in a very 
brutal and inappropriate fashion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the people at the Federation of Canadian 
Municipalities for the excellent work they do on behalf of 
municipalities across the country.  They have a thoughtful, very 
democratic, grassroots approach in terms of policy direction. 
They said “Something has to be done.  We can't have this any 
longer”.  Therefore, Bill C-10 started that long process and 
today it is at report stage and we are looking at some of the 
amendments put forward by my hon. colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a bill that we support as New Democrats.  Anything that 
brings transparency, anything that brings a sense of 
reasonableness, of decency, of fairness, of equity has to be 
supported.  This bill is a major step in accomplishing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically, the bill will change the term “grants”.  Let us 
face it, today “grants” has become a four letter word.  It has 
five letters, but basically it is a four letter word.  It is a 
nasty word because of what the Minister of Human Resources 
Development has done.  It is a very bad word because of the 
abuse, because of the political favouritism, because of the 
patronage, because of the pork-barrelling that the present 
government used when granting moneys to various organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members said “We have to get away from the use of 
that term, so we will call it payments in lieu of taxes”, known 
as PILTs.  That makes sense, payments in lieu of taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize the positive aspect of this legislation.  If there 
is a federal piece of property in a municipality, the federal 
government is obligated to pay taxes to the municipality to 
reflect the property value.  That is how municipalities raise 
their funds, through taxation, through property taxes.  The 
government recognizes that federal properties must pay taxes; 
however, there is a wrinkle.  There is always a little wrinkle. 
I applaud my friend from Kelowna for pointing this out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot of discretion in the bill.  This group of 
amendments speaks to how the minister can decide whether the 
government should make payments, whether it should pay penalties 
on late payments, whether it should hold off making payments and 
so on.  There is a lot of discretion which is left to the 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is one thing we have learned in the last few days it is 
that when there is discretion left in the hands of ministers they 
sometimes seem to abuse it.  I use the example of our friend, the 
Minister of Human Resources Development, whose constituency, by 
and large, does very well economically and gets tonnes of grants. 
As a matter of fact, I think we would look long and hard to find 
a single business or a single organization in her constituency 
that did not get a grant.  She went up to people who were walking 
down the street and said “Excuse me, I am the Minister of Human 
Resources Development.  Do you want a grant?”  Why not?  It is 
very serious.  That was a clear abuse of that position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are trying to find a way to get around this in the 
legislation.  I applaud my friend from Kelowna, who said that we 
must ensure there is a clause which requires the minister to 
explain why he or she is not doing what is asked by the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support this group of amendments.  They state that if the 
minister in his or her wisdom decides not to pay the taxes on 
federal property in a particular city, that minister has to 
explain why he or she is not doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are problems, and I will refer to two of them.  My friend 
mentioned already the situation in Halifax with the Citadel and 
the discussion of who owns that piece of property, how much of it 
is federal and how much is municipal.  There is also the issue of 
first nations properties within city limits.  Is that federal 
property or is it first nations property?  Where does that come 
in? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are areas where it will take discussion and perhaps, in 
the end, even a court decision before the final outcome is 
determined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This group of amendments would give the minister some 
flexibility.  However, ministers who have flexibility cause 
Canadians to squirm.  Therefore, we are saying “Yes, we will 
give the minister flexibility to deal with these special cases, 
but the minister must explain why he or she is not paying the 
taxes that the municipality is expecting”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to the 
first group of proposed amendments to Bill C-10. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I believe that the bill still does not go far enough to 
ensure that municipalities get their fair share of property taxes 
from federally owned property, I believe that it is an 
improvement to the original Municipal Grants Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the bill went to committee, my colleague, the member for 
Tobique—Mactaquac, was successful in having his amendments 
adopted by the Commons committee.  One of the provisions of the 
bill would create a new advisory panel to resolve disputes 
between the government and municipalities over evaluation of 
federally owned property and payments owed to municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Originally Bill C-10 proposed that the Minister of Public Works 
and Government Services appoint all the panel members, pay them, 
choose the chairperson, and he would be able to fire them at any 
time if he disagreed with any of the panel's decisions.  This was 
a problem because public works is involved in most of the 
disputes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my colleague's amendments would give the panel members 
more independence by having them appointed and paid by the 
cabinet instead of the minister.  This would ensure more balance 
and fairness within the panel, although I personally would have 
preferred a much more independent structure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very clear that municipalities are not being treated 
fairly with the system that is now in place.  I met with the 
people of the municipality of Alma last week and they have very 
good reason to be upset with the government.  This is what the 
citizens of the municipality of Alma had to say about this 
matter: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very concerned with this government's cuts in federal 
payments in lieu of taxes that our municipality has been recently 
experiencing.  We are the Service Centre to Fundy National Park, 
which is located in the Alma Parish.  We have federal buildings 
inside the municipality as well, those being the Alma Post Office 
and housing owned by Fundy National Park. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also they obtain money from the provincial government to help 
cover fire protection for the local service district, which 
includes the national park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They go on to say that the assessments for the outlying areas 
were cut by $2.5 million, which was reflected in a decrease to 
the municipality over $3,000.  They also lost $34,166 in federal 
assessments, which cost them a decrease of another $3,921 in 
revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A small community with a population of approximately 312 
residents cannot afford these cuts, as it cripples a community 
such as Alma. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the people of Alma and I must add that the citizens 
of the community of Dorchester in my riding are finding 
themselves in the same situation because they have in their 
community a federal correctional building. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sometimes wonder if this is part of the government's long term 
plan in closing rural communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us face it, first we took away employment insurance 
benefits, which directly affected small rural communities.  That 
forced people to leave their communities, which forced schools to 
close, meaning less families building in communities.  If that is 
not enough to shut down the community, the government cut federal 
payments in lieu of taxes to make sure these municipalities could 
not survive.  That is the Liberal way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the amendments we are debating today will not fix 
all of the problems within the Municipal Grants Act and I will 
explain why.  One of the amendments proposed today is that we 
change the language of the legislation so that the federal 
government is compelled to pay its tax bills just like every 
other municipal taxpayer.  I certainly agree with the intent of 
this amendment, but unfortunately municipalities are not 
recognized as a level of government in the constitution or by the 
federal government.  They are entirely a creation of the 
provincial government.  It is understandable that my friend would 
come up with a simple solution, which, on the face of it, would 
appear to make sense.  Why not treat the federal government like 
any other taxpayer? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that we have a constitution that we have to live 
with today.  Although I am sure that we all have things we would 
like to see changed in the constitution, none of that will happen 
today.  According to our constitution, as it is now, 
municipalities do not exist, they have no jurisdiction in law and 
they do not have any official relationship with the federal 
government or the crown.  Therefore, the federal government 
cannot be bound by any decisions made by a municipality.  It can 
only undertake to voluntarily follow a decision or a bylaw passed 
by a municipal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments, although well meaning, would have the effect 
of changing the constitution without going through the 
constitutional amendment process.  Nevertheless, I congratulate 
the member for having brought forward this point for debate. 
This is a subject which merits further discussion.

</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Motion Nos. 8, 9, 11 and 12, the member for 
Kelowna is attempting to address the outstanding issue concerning 
business occupancy taxes and certain crown corporations. 
Specifically these amendments would require Canada Post, the 
Royal Canadian Mint, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation 
and similar crown corporations to pay business occupancy taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly the mandate of these crown corporations has changed 
over the years since the Municipal Grants Act was last updated. 
It used to be that these crown corporations served a purely 
public policy purpose and in the unlikely event they every made a 
profit it was more by accident than by design.  Now these 
corporations serve two purposes.  Not only do they continue to 
serve an important public policy role, but they also have the 
mandate to earn a profit in order to recover costs and to lessen 
the burden on taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the hon. member for Kelowna that if these crown 
corporations are conducting business and earning a profit they 
should be paying business taxes.  The question is how much. After 
the discussions our party had with representatives from the 
Federation of Canadian Municipalities, and after having 
questioned witnesses from the FCM at the public works committee, 
we are convinced that this is a problem that will soon be solved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Municipalities and the federal government are continuing to 
negotiate over what portion of each crown corporation is devoted 
to purely profit making activities.  That discussion is not yet 
finished.  Municipalities have asked us not to hold up this bill 
while those negotiations are ongoing as there will be an 
opportunity to fix that issue in the very near future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as 
all other speakers in the House today have noted, this 
legislation ensures that the federal government pays its fair 
share of taxes to all municipalities in a timely fashion.  The 
development of this legislation should be considered as a model 
in terms of co-operation and consultation with interested 
stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When representatives of the Federation of Canadian 
Municipalities testified before the committee examining Bill 
C-10, they indicated their strong support for the bill and 
praised the level of consultation between themselves and the 
Department of Public Works and Government Services.  In light of 
the depth of consultation that has taken place, including 
amendments made by the Conservative Party that were accepted at 
report stage, the government will not be supporting any further 
amendments, specifically those listed in Group No. 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>References have also been made to the dispute advisory panel 
that is enshrined in this legislation.  It will serve as a forum 
for the presentation of respective positions of both 
municipalities and departments or crown corporations when 
differences of opinion respecting amount of payments in lieu of 
taxes arise between the two parties, which is to be expected at 
times.  This was a key recommendation by the municipalities 
during the minister's consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will also note that appointees will be required to 
possess a background of knowledge in the areas of real property 
evaluation, real property assessment, real property or assessment 
law, or other related disciplines.  This is a relatively small 
area of expertise and typically the same people are recognized as 
impartial experts by municipalities, assessment authorities and 
federal officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The municipal payments programs has served both the government 
and municipalities well since 1950.  Extensive consultations 
between the government and municipalities have led to the bill 
before the House today.  It improves existing legislation and the 
Federation of Canadian Municipalities supports the bill in its 
current form.  It applauds the relationship with the Department 
of Public Works and Government Services.  I believe it is time to 
adopt the bill without any further amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to see progress being made in the 
relationship between municipalities and senior levels of both the 
provincial and federal governments.  The debate today concerns 
Bill C-10 and the Group No. 1 motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I continue I would like to commend the Federation of 
Canadian Municipalities, the Association of Manitoba 
Municipalities and the individual municipalities in my riding 
that have contributed to and worked on the legislation to enable 
the rules to be more clearly defined and set out, in effect 
making the federal government responsible on paper and 
accountable for the grants it will be giving to the 
municipalities in lieu of taxes. 
Legislation is never perfect.  As a result several motions and 
amendments are being submitted to try to improve the legislation. 
I will touch on those later in my speech.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now touch on the purposes of this act.  Not everyone in 
my riding is fully clear on what Bill C-10 is doing.  It 
essentially addresses the issue of compensation for untimely 
payments.  It deals with the fair and equitable administration of 
payments in lieu of taxes, setting out clearly the 
responsibilities of the senior level of government.  It also 
establishes an advisory panel to advise the minister on disputes 
concerning payment amounts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interaction between government levels is of utmost 
importance.  We have another level of government in the area of 
the aboriginal reserves which is getting into the situation of 
acquiring additional lands by removing lands from the local 
municipalities in given areas.  In the riding of 
Selkirk—Interlake the area of the Regional Municipality of 
Grahamdale is running across this problem.  It does not seem the 
government has dealt fully with setting out the guidelines and 
the terms for grants in lieu of taxes on behalf of Indian 
reserves that should be made payable to local municipalities when 
they lose their taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is an issue for another day and another debate, but it is 
an issue that should be addressed.  I am taking this opportunity 
in the debate on Bill C-10 to raise it so clarity can be brought 
to the relationship between Indian reserves and local 
municipalities in how they deal with taxes between each other and 
providing services to the citizens of those communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The history of concern over the levels of responsibility among 
the different governments goes back to 1950 when the government 
initially started making payments in lieu of taxes.  It has taken 
some time, but we now see that it is being codified in 
legislation to remove a lot of the ambiguity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee set up in 1995 was the joint technical committee 
on these payments.  It was formed to examine issues associated 
with federal payments in lieu of taxes.  Its findings addressed 
some of the issues through non-legislative means, which is fine 
and dandy when there is good co-operation between the federal and 
provincial levels of government.  As we are seeing in agriculture 
today, that co-operation is not always there.  The agriculture 
issues I talk about are the safety net ones where the provincial 
governments and the federal government are not working 
co-operatively.  That relates directly to the necessity for bills 
like Bill C-10 to clearly establish this relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the legislative changes that is primarily in place deals 
with interest on payments made after an agreed upon date when the 
taxes or grants in lieu of taxes should have been paid.  The 
legislation states that it is in the opinion of the minister and 
at the minister's discretion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With something as straightforward as the payment of taxes or the 
payment of a grant in lieu of taxes which has a set and agreed 
upon date, the minister does not need any leeway in compensating 
municipalities for money they lose because the federal government 
has failed to live up to its agreement to pay its taxes on time. 
The average Canadian property owner who must pay his taxes would 
quickly find out if he were late by one day that interest begins 
to be applied. 
I think that discretionary aspect of the legislation could 
certainly be removed.

</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to third party leases there is some question in my 
mind as to whether or not the people who lease government 
property or a portion of a government property are paying their 
full share of business taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian coast guard building in Selkirk—Interlake has been 
partially leased out to a private business entity. I have tried 
to find out some information on it, but the coast guard is kind 
of like HRDC.  It does not want to give out any information.  It 
really drives us nuts, but we will keep trying.  Is this business 
entity paying its full and fair share of taxes, the same as any 
other business located in the city of Selkirk?  I raise that 
question so that the government will hear it and address it if in 
fact there is a problem in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments put forward by the official opposition and the 
other parties should be seriously considered by the government. 
Where they are actually improvements to the bill, I would like to 
think that the government will support those amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party and I as the member of parliament for 
Selkirk—Interlake support the legislation.  As I have said, we 
recognize that a lot of work by the municipalities and their 
associations has gone into this issue.  The most redeeming 
feature of the whole legislation is the level of co-operation 
that has been shown and the recognition that the federal 
government should not be telling the provinces how they will 
negotiate and imposing rules on local municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, I am in favour of the legislation.  It will be an 
improvement to the relationship between the municipalities and 
the federal government.

campaigns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say that although Delphine was a very active individual 
her most significant contribution to the world was that despite 
all the difficulties her failing health caused, she managed to

</I></B></P><P align=left>It started in the United States in 1926 by Carter G. Woodson. 
The celebration of Black History Month in Canada first gained

result of the civil rights movement in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since then the celebration of Black History Month has become an

today I would like to raise again with the Minister of Transport 
and with others an issue which I think should be of concern to 
all members of parliament, or at least those members of 
parliament who have rail lines running through their 
constituencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the railways, all of them, are running longer 
and longer trains.  We are now seeing 10,000 foot trains as a 
rule.  I am told sometimes there are 12,000 foot trains. They are 
tying up railway crossings for a much longer period of time than 
is allowed for in the rules.  It is only supposed to be five 
minutes. 
However, there are crossings in my riding, and others may have 
the same, where trains are taking 45 minutes to clear the 
crossings.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have raised this with the Minister of Transport before.  This 
is a real issue which needs to be dealt with.  The railways are 
abusing the rules and some day someone is going to die because 
they are abusing these rules and because the government has 
refused to do anything about it.

that the Liberal government wants to renege on another of its

</I></B></P><P align=left>In a recent article in <I>La Presse</I>, we learn that the Liberals 
would like to delay the renewal of the infrastructures program 
in order to use it for purely electoral ends.  This federal, 
provincial and municipal program is vital to Quebec and Canada. 
This is true too for quality of life and especially public 
safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec, the Canadian provinces and territories and the

Speaker, today the Minister of Justice will table in the House 
legislation to ensure that federal laws conform to our human 
rights obligations.  This represents the culmination of the work 
of many groups and individuals around the country, too many to 
name, who have worked so hard over the past 15 years to achieve 
the goal of equality in our society.  They deserve our thanks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This historic legislation will enshrine in the statutes our 
obligations under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and 
the Canadian Human Rights Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the right thing to do. It is also supported by a vast 
majority of Canadians who believe that one of the most important 
characteristics of our society is its tolerance based on the 
elimination of discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent court decisions have indicated that our statutes must be 
updated and this will end the need for constant litigation such 
as that presently brought by the Foundation for Equal Families.

of particular concern to my constituents.  I commend the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of Nova Scotians who are 
being severely threatened in relation to rising fuel costs.  The 
price of oil has jumped to more than 50 cents from 32 cents per 
litre in recent days.  Diesel has gone up 70 cents a gallon in 
four months forcing truckers out of competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nova Scotians are finding themselves financially burdened due to 
the increase in fuel costs throughout the province largely in 
part due to federal taxation.  In April 1997 this Liberal 
government was supposed to rid Canadians of the GST but actually 
created the HST in three Atlantic provinces to a fixed rate of 
15%.  This tax is applied federally and cannot be changed at the 
point of sale.  This has hurt many citizens, in particular 
seniors and low income earners. Essentials in life are becoming 
more and more unattainable for those on fixed incomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the Minister of Finance along with the Minister of 
Industry to take immediate action to examine closely these huge 
increases in prices of crude oil.  Nova Scotians and indeed all 
Canadians cannot continue to struggle under crippling high fuel 
costs compounded by massive tax grabs. There is a budget coming. 
Please give Canadians relief.

certainly never said any such thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The human resources minister also stated publicly that 
opposition members could not have a copy of a master list because 
no such thing existed while Liberal MPs were being handed copies 
of that very list.

have no problem with it.  It was done for prisons, it is going

that he would like a master list that would cover all the grants 
and contributions that are supported by my department.  That is 
40 different programs.  Some of them can be managed and focused 
riding by riding but for others we just do not have data riding 
by riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated earlier, I have asked my department to look at 
these 40 different programs to see if there is a way of bringing 
the information together so that members of parliament can have 
it in a consolidated fashion for their ridings.  I would be glad 
to continue to report to the House on this as we make progress.

that kind of information about Winnipeg Centre?  He had 
everything that ever went into that riding, including the 
salaries of HRDC employees who work in that riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister not realize that it is not a question of the 
credibility of the Liberal Party or the Liberal government, it is 
the credibility of government per se as a positive instrument for 
job creation that is at stake here?  She should be concerned 
about that.  Not everybody is.  We are, she is.  Why will she not 
act in a way to restore the credibility of government as a job 
creating agent and provide this information?

Mr. Speaker, the minister continues to choose her words very

as the House knows, I was answering questions about the 
transitional jobs fund almost on a daily basis from time to time. 
I was very aware of issues in the transitional jobs fund and I 
was forthcoming in my responses.  If the member checks 
<I>Hansard</I> he will see that I identified circumstances, 
administrative challenges in particular projects.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian public is kept in the dark about the biggest case 
of government mismanagement in history, and yet Liberal MPs were 
privy to all this dirty detail yesterday.  Could this be because

They should spend some time on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the hon. member's particular question about 
grants and contributions in my riding, I am glad to say that the

been asked about by the Reform Party.  If the hon. member would

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think 
I could have given a better answer than that one.  The Prime 
Minister has been likened to the godfather of grants and 
contracts.  Donate to his campaign and one has a 33% chance of 
getting a grant or a contract, so the bureaucrats and the 
managers of HRDC have to bend the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How else can the minister explain that one-third of the projects 
got upward amendments to the original dollar amount requested? 
<P><A NAME="LINK113"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

opposition party has no interest in having a Government of Canada 
that participates with its citizens and communities to improve 
the opportunities that could be made for those who need support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we know on this side of the House is that these people 
would shut down all grants and contributions.  What they would 
have is for every man and woman to look out for themselves.  On 
this side of the House, our Prime Minister understands that the

Canadians, and we stand behind him.

</I></B></P><P align=left>With reference to the transitional jobs fund, I have answered

</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that the minister has a strange definition of 
forthcoming.  However, since she was told of these problems

the hon. Prime Minister and the hon. House leader love to refer 
to all of the grants received by the opposition ridings, as if to 
imply that we are part of the problem over on that side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. Prime Minister if he would show me an 
opposition riding in which business cronies and criminals got 
millions of dollars, just as they did in the Prime Minister's 
riding when he interfered with the process. 
<P><A NAME="LINK135"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member's premise for his question is totally 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has not interfered with the process.  The 
decisions were made by officials according to the rules.  I hope 
that is the case in the hon. member's riding and others, where 
Reform and other opposition members pleaded in writing for 
support from these programs.  They pleaded, they begged, and now 
they are saying they do not like the programs.  What a double 
standard. 
<P><A NAME="LINK136"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the minister of HRD. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the minister explain why in May 1997 the Liberal member 
representing Vancouver East qualified for a TJF, and why two 
weeks later, after the federal election, there were no further 
funds to this riding, which is very poor compared to the 
minister's own riding which did get funds?  Even the website that 
the minister is so proud of says that TJF is available in 
northern Ontario only. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the minister explain these glaring contradictions? 
<P><A NAME="LINK137"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize that the hon. 
member represents one of the poorest and most challenged regions 
in this country, Vancouver East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to recognize that we invest significantly, and I 
think very wisely, in that area and we will continue to do so. 
<P><A NAME="LINK138"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
minister has not answered the question about the contradiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that my riding is not an exception.  That is why we in 
the NDP have repeatedly demanded in question period, in committee 
and on the order paper a full disclosure from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the minister said to the leader of the NDP that she 
could make it easy for us all if she put a question on the order 
paper.  Well, we did, before that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the real question is, why is this minister making it so hard 
to get public information and full disclosure? 
<P><A NAME="LINK139"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my intention is not to make it difficult, 
and as I have said on numerous occasions today, given the 
conversations that we had yesterday at committee, I have gone 
back to people in my department and asked them to look at the 40 
different grants and contributions to see if they can pick the 
information out, put it together in some kind of reasonable 
fashion, which then could be provided to members of parliament 
for their use. 
<P><A NAME="LINK140"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, can the minister of HRD tell the House how many TJF 
projects were publicly announced by regional ministers without 
the recommendation in support of the projects from the elected 
member of parliament from that riding? 
<P><A NAME="LINK141"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, that too sounds like a question for the 
order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I must say that I agree. 
<P><A NAME="LINK142"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, PC):</B> 
Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, the only losers in this scandal are 
the people living in high unemployment regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that this program can work if we take the political 
influence out of it.  I myself learned through the media that the 
regional minister at the time had approved and announced $80,000 
in TJ funds against my own recommendation.  That company has 
since then closed and no jobs were created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need job creation programs, but we do not need the abuse of 
the government.  What will the minister do to make sure the 
abuse stops? 
<P><A NAME="LINK143"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, again, when looking at the transitional 
jobs fund, the hon. member herself I think recognizes the 
importance to her region which that program has had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that there is a way in which to work in ridings with 
community members, with the support of members of parliament and 
others, to make sure our investments are wise and continue to 
provide opportunities for those who need opportunities.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the minister appointed a panel of distinguished 
Canadians, led by former House Speaker John Fraser, to monitor a 
major program of change initiatives within the Canadian Forces. 
Recently that committee reported its findings.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence,

committee, which I appointed a couple of years ago, is most 
welcome.  It clearly indicates that reforms are taking place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We asked them to monitor over 300 reforms that came from the 
Somalia commission and numerous other reports on change to the 
Canadian Forces.  They said such things as:  “We believe that 
the reform program is gaining momentum.  The department and the 
Canadian Forces have substantially met the goals of the reform 
measures”.  It is a very positive report.

delivered by courier to the department.

two days, a number of events have taken place in this House. 
Today, it is happening again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, referring to one of our questions to the Minister of 
Human Resources, the Speaker of the House commented that the 
question was too specific. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, the Minister of Human Resources Development and the 
Prime Minister had told us “Your questions are too vague. 
We would appreciate more specific questions. Give us examples of 
mistakes that were made, of instances where money was 
misappropriated”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did our best, even though we still do not have access to all 
the lists, to find the most specific examples possible, 
including one, which I raised myself, involving a $5 million 
subsidy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With due respect to the minister, it seems to me that $5 million 
is important enough an expenditure for the minister to at least 
look at before authorizing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker of the House seemed to back down on this issue and, 
later, he let us ask our very specific questions. Then, the 
minister even told a Reform member that his question was too 
vague and she wanted a clearer one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You have the responsibility to tell us how my colleagues and 
myself must act in this House. 
Even today, after the minister replied that the question was too 
precise, too in depth, you said you agreed with her. I have not 
heard such comments very often in my life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How should opposition members act to please you, Mr. Speaker? 
Should we ask very broad questions, so as to allow the minister 
to say anything, or ask very precise questions and be told they 
are too precise and cannot be answered? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know the rules for asking a question in a 
parliament such as this one. In the other one that I have known, 
the more precise the question, the more accurate the numbers 
quoted, the happier the journalists, the happier the public, and 
the more the Speaker would let us carry on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Roberval has raised 
a very specific point. I agree with him that, when questions are 
asked in the House, the answer is very often to the effect that 
the question is too vague, too precise or something of the sort. 
This is perfectly normal when questions are asked in an 
atmosphere of debate such as during question period in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the question addressed to the Minister of Human Resources 
Development concerned the percentage of applications or programs 
where something happened. It is a matter of statistics. A 
question that requires the production of statistics is a 
question for the Order Paper. That is what the minister said, 
and I indicated that I agreed with her to avoid having a 
supplementary question that would have been identical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really had to interrupt the member when she asked the 
question, and say that it was a question for the Order Paper. 
The minister said the same thing. I indicated that I agreed, 
that is all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the question is precise, it is acceptable. That is why I said 
I agreed with the minister's answer, to stop the member for 
Beauséjour—Petitcodiac from asking another question. I hope 
everyone agrees on that.

age of 18 to 16.

able to obtain a driver's licence and drive vehicles.  They are 
able to join the Armed Forces of Canada. They are able to get 
married and raise children.  They can leave school on their own 
volition.  A variety of things occur at age 16 but the one thing 
they are not permitted to do is to vote for the member of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> (a) The original 
estimated operational lifespan of the Sea King was 15,000 hrs or 
25 years, 1988. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) The current lifespan of the Sea King has recently been 
extended to 2005. The aircraft with the most flying hours totals 
12,011 hours. The average flying hours for the fleet is 
approximately 10,511. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) The following measures are being taken to extend the 
operational life of the Sea King: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>i. Center Section Repair: This involves replacement of the Main 
lift frames of the helicopter required as a result of fatigue 
cracking. Repairs to 19 of the 30 aircraft have already been 
completed. The replacement of the main lift frames for the 
remainder of the fleet should be completed by may 2002. Each 
replacement is performed concurrent with the 
ongoing third line repair and overhaul contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>ii. T-58-100 Engine Upgrade: This involves replacing components 
of the T-58-8F model engine that are no longer available with 
parts that are more readily available and in widespread 
commercial use. The upgrade, which also provides more engine 
power, is performed concurrent with the ongoing third line repair 
and overhaul contract. Five of 30 aircraft have been fitted with 
the upgraded engine; upgrades on the remaining aircraft in the 
fleet are to be completed by May 2002. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>iii. T-58 Engine No. 4 Bearing Housing: This involves replacing 
the current bearing housing as the part is no longer available. 
This replacement started in 1997 concurrent with the ongoing 
third line repair and overhaul contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>iv. Main Gearbox Upgrade: This involves upgrading the main 
gearbox with more durable internal components and an improved 
lubrication system, required as a result of flight safety 
concerns—such as incidents where the gearbox overheated—and the 
T-58-100 engine upgrade. One of 30 aircraft has been modified 
with the modification of the remaining aircraft in the fleet to 
commence in January 2000, to be completed by July 2002. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>v. ASN-123 Tactical Navigation System Replacement: This involves 
replacing the obsolete ANS-501 TACNAV computer with the ASN-123 
TACNAV, which is a more modern system. The replacement started in 
1997, concurrent with the existing second line periodic 
inspection effort, at 12 Wing, CFB Shearwater. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>vi. DC Power Upgrade: This involves either replacing the 
transformer rectifier units with solid state devices that are 
more compatible with some of the more modern avionics recently 
installed or using in-line-noise suppression filters to clean up 
the aircraft power. Both options are currently under review. 
Prototype design and installation should occur in fiscal year 
1999-2000, with modifications on the remainder of the fleet to 
commence in fiscal year 2000-2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>vii. Emergency Inverter Replacement: Repair parts for the 
inverter that is currently being used are becoming increasingly 
difficult to purchase. Prototype design and installation will 
occur in fiscal year 1999-2000, with replacement on the fleet to 
commence in fiscal year 2000-2001.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>MUNICIPAL GRANTS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK252">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill C-10, an act to amend the 
Municipal Grants Act, as reported (with amendments) from the 
committee; and of the motions in Group No. 1. 
<P><A NAME="LINK253"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne—Blainville, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Ottawa government has finally put before the House of Commons 
Bill C-10, respecting payments in lieu of taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The need for such legislation has been obvious for years, and 
the issue has been studied several times over the last five 
years. 
However, the wheels of government, as we know, grind exceedingly 
slow when it is not seeking to encroach upon the rights of 
provinces, as in the case of the so-called clarity bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, of course, the government moved quickly, even to 
the point of imposing closure, as it did yesterday. But better 
late than never. The Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services has finally recognized the need to legislate, and I 
quote from clause 2.1 “to provide for the fair and equitable 
administration of payments in lieu of taxes”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For 50 years, the federal government, as everyone knows, has 
been making payments in lieu of property taxes to municipalities 
with regard to federal properties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Except for some reservations, which are reflected in our 
amendments, we consider Bill C-10 to be an improvement over the 
existing Municipal Grants Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the new act and regulations, crown corporations will have 
to pay interest on arrears and supplementary payments just like 
departments. Crown corporations will also have to make payments 
when their tenants do not fulfil their obligations. This is 
obviously a step forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently, the municipalities' finances are in order. The same 
would be true of higher levels of government if the rule the 
municipalities must abide by had been followed, a rule that 
every head of household knows very well: Never borrow money to 
buy groceries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the drastic cuts in transfers to the provinces by the 
federal government have had compelled Quebec to share the 
financial consequences with the municipalities, in addition to 
putting the health care and education systems in jeopardy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, payments in lieu of taxes made by the federal 
government represent a greater share than ever of revenue in 
many municipalities, including the six cities in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, Bill C-10 does not go as far as to force Ottawa to 
make payments in lieu of taxes to cities and villages on the 
basis of the municipal evaluation rolls, as is the case for all 
the taxpayers. That would be asking too much. Rather, the real 
progress achieved in this bill is the extension of the type of 
structures covered by these grants and the reduced arbitrariness 
in the determination of amounts to be paid.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our amendments are designed to improve the law and, since they 
are based on common sense, I am confident all my colleagues will 
approve them. Some were mentioned this morning by my colleague, 
the member for Saint-Jean. Among the other amendments that were 
tabled, one aims at defining more accurately certain terms 
which, because of their ambiguity, might be open to dispute when 
the legislation is implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also asking for a statutory review of the law on a 
regular basis. This review is important because it will allow us 
to follow up and make appropriate changes. With this review, the 
municipalities will also be able to express their views clearly 
and directly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the bill before us is good, and it will be made 
even better by our amendments. We are living and will 
increasingly be living in a universe where the globalisation of 
the economy and the levelling of cultures will threaten the 
individual in his heartfelt sentiment of belonging to his 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After his family, his municipality is the community with which 
he has the closest ties. I am thinking here mostly of the cities 
in my riding, which are large enough to provide their citizens 
with all the services they need and, at the same time, small 
enough to maintain warm human relations instead of seeing them 
lost and diluted because of high numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But this community must have sufficient resources, and that the 
buildings owned by the two levels of government actually not pay 
the full cost of the utilities provided to them, the same 
services provided to the residents, that is security, water, 
roads, and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill C-10, the federal government is encouraged to take on a 
fair share of those expenses. Our party will vote in favour of 
this bill and do everything it can to see that it is implemented 
as soon as possible. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK254"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to make a couple of comments on the way the bill is 
being administered.  Everyone in the House basically agrees that 
it should go ahead and that the bill has merit.  The Federation 
of Canadian Municipalities, even though it has some concerns, is 
in favour of seeing the bill go ahead, but the government has not 
invoked time allocation as it has done close to 60 times when 
anyone wanted to talk about something that it did not agree with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend my colleague, the critic for this department, on his 
work on Bill C-10.  The bill is highly technical.  I congratulate 
him on his analysis and on the amendments he has proposed which 
have been designed primarily to increase ministerial 
accountability.  Given what has gone on in the House in the last 
week, ministerial accountability is a virtue sadly lacking in 
some departments, in particular HRDC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Grants seem to be a feature of life where the government is 
concerned.  When granting procedures are as unstructured as they 
seem to be in HRDC—and they are certainly not mentioned in 
law—and a program is put together to please someone, there is 
political pressure, allegations of corruption, favouritism and 
those kinds of things.  I feel the bill goes a long way toward 
addressing some of those concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would not want the industry minister, for instance, to make 
decisions without guidelines when he is handing over taxpayer 
money.  He had in his mind that he would turn over about $20 
million of Canadian taxpayer funds. 
However, people felt their wallets getting a little lighter. They 
felt the industry minister rifling through their wallets and they 
were an uproar.  Without a structured plan in place these kinds 
of abuses can take place.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Federation of Canadian Municipalities is to be commended for 
putting the pressure on the minister to come forward with 
guidelines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The two certainties in life are death and taxes.  In 
Saskatchewan we are seeing the death of many communities because 
of the state of our economy.  The amount taxpayers have to pay is 
often not known because of uncertainties in income going to 
municipalities.  This bill will address those uncertainties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Municipal governments have been at the mercy of federal 
governments when making decisions on what buildings they will be 
given grants in lieu of taxes and on the amount of the grant. 
This will help a lot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill attempts to address a problem that is in our 
constitution, which exempts the federal government and crown 
corporations from paying municipal taxes on their properties.  It 
took from the date the constitution was written until 1950 to get 
something in law to establish a program of grants in lieu of 
taxes.  Up until then everything was left up to ministerial 
accountability.  As I said previously, that has created no end of 
difficulties for municipalities because they do things much the 
same way as HRDC does and the way the industry minister has 
attempted to do things.  People need certainty in their lives 
beyond death and taxes.  They need to know when the money is 
coming to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has proposed a number of amendments. Motion No. 
4 reminds us that the bill currently reads that the minister may 
make payments.  One of the things we do not agree with in the 
legislation is the minister having the ability to make the 
decision without being held accountable somewhere and in some 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to hold the minister accountable for any changes in the 
payment or for the lack of payment, this motion would require the 
minister to sit down and write to the taxing authority, which 
would be the local government, the reasons for the changes or the 
withholding.  Local governments need to be given a certain level 
of respect by this place.  Currently, that does not often happen. 
We can see that in the way payments in lieu of taxes are handled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 5 reads that it is up to the opinion of the minister 
to decide whether or not a payment has been unreasonably delayed. 
We want to lessen the minister's discretion in that area so it 
is not based just on his opinion.  The requirement in Motion No. 
5 is that the minister provide written reasons to the taxing 
authority if he decides not to make a supplementary payment. This 
provision would hold a minister of the crown accountable for 
decisions that he or his department has made.  He would not be 
able to just simply say “Well, it is my opinion.  You have to 
live with it.  That is as good as it is going to get”.  It can 
get a lot better if the minister has to sit down and explain his 
reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the bill we see “in the opinion” or “may” or 
something like that.  My colleague's amendments are based on 
holding a minister to a standard that requires him to make a 
rational decision and to put it in writing so that the taxing 
authority can make the decision known to the people they 
represent.  They are after all going to the same well as the 
federal government.  When they have to increase taxes, the people 
should know why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 8 deals with discretion as to the method of payment. 
This would again require the minister to provide written reasons 
to the taxing authority.  It also provides for ministerial 
accountability.  Why was the method of payment chosen by the 
minister?  Can it be made in annual instalments?  Yes, it can. 
Can it be made with interest if it is on an annual instalment? 
Yes, it can.  Can it be made in a lump sum payment without 
interest? Again, the answer is yes.  Does the minister have to 
say why he chose to do it that way?  No, the minister does not. 
This amendment should make it possible for the local authority to 
find out why the minister made the decision that he made.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three government agencies, the Royal Canadian Mint, 
Canada Post and CMHC, that hold property in local communities. We 
would like to see these agencies make payments in lieu of taxes 
as well.  In order to do that at the present time, it would 
require an order in council, which would give the minister far 
too much discretion because of the way these types of things are 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 16 provides for crown corporation accountability with 
regard to non-payment in lieu of taxes.  Like the minister, crown 
corporations may make payments in lieu of taxes.  And again, 
without constitutional amendment, the bill cannot read that they 
must make payments.  However, there are ways to get around that. 
In order to provide for some level of accountability, crown 
corporations should be required to provide, in writing to the 
taxing authority, their reasons for non-payment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a number of concerns over inconsistencies that the 
government is able to introduce into its method of making 
payments to taxes.  In one instance it can get out from under a 
requirement one way or it can basically lead a municipality 
around without letting it know why it is doing what it is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last motion deals with how the advisory panel provides 
advice to the ministry.  The minister may accept or reject the 
advisory committee's advice, and that is acceptable.  After all, 
that is what advisory committees do, is advise based on the best 
information they can get.  However, the minister does not have to 
provide a rationale for why she or he accepts that information.

bill has a lot of merit and a lot of support from the 
municipalities in Canada, and we want to register that support. 
However, there are improvements that can be made to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now addressing the motions in Group No. 2 and I wish to 
address my remarks specifically to Motion No. 33, which is the 
motion dealing with the advisory panel.  I would like the folks 
watching the debate this afternoon to be aware of exactly what 
this section provides.  I will read clause 11.1(2) of the 
proposed bill.  Clause 11.1(1) establishes an advisory panel and 
11.1(2) deals with the mandate of the advisory panel.  It reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The advisory panel shall give advice to the Minister in the event 
that a taxing authority disagrees with a property value, property 
dimension or effective rate applicable to any federal property, 
or claims that a payment should be supplemented under subsection 
3(1.1). 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of an advisory panel of this type is a commendable 
move.  It brings into existence a mechanism which would allow the 
minister to test his particular orientation and also that of his 
officials so they could look at the assessment being proposed and 
the amount of taxation being levelled against particular 
properties and make sure that the advice has the benefit of 
consultation and expertise.  There are some very good reasons for 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example.  I referred earlier to the case dealing 
with the Halifax Citadel.  In this case Public Works and 
Government Services Canada agreed to pay for part of the 
building, that part which was designated as shelter, but it was 
not prepared to pay the other part.  I commend the department for 
recognizing that there is a difference, but we get into some 
difficulty in interpreting exactly how we go about making the 
determination as to where the shelter begins and ends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The suggestion was made by departmental officials that this 
interpretation, which is essentially a civil one, should be done 
through the civil courts.  That is not a bad suggestion, as I 
said earlier this morning.  However, there is a better and a much 
less costly suggestion, which is the advisory panel.  It could 
come to grips with this very nicely.  Its members would be 
business people.  There are some suggestions that there would be 
professional assessors on the panel and some legal people, so 
this could all be done with competence, by people who are well 
versed in this area.  Let them do the work rather than going 
through the legal channels of the court system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Citadel is an immediate case that could come to the 
attention of this panel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other example is Sable Island.  In this controversy the 
department has stopped payment altogether.  It has simply said 
that it is not paying any taxes until it knows to whom it is 
supposed to pay the taxes. 
Who has jurisdiction in this area?  Is it the province?  Is it 
the federal government?  To what degree are the respective groups 
responsible?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That of course would not be a problem for HRDC.  It would simply 
pay, but that is not the case here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the minister for taking responsible action, but what I 
would like to do, and what the Reform Party wants to do, is to 
make sure that there are precautionary measures which would allow 
the minister to be sure that he is accountable and that these 
kinds of things do not disappear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to refer to the amendment because I think it is 
important.  What we would really like to do is add a section 
which would follow immediately after the provision for the 
establishment of the panel to ensure that the panel provides 
advice to the minister.  The way the act reads now, the minister 
may accept that advice, he may reject it, he may simply ignore 
it, or he may amend it.  What we are suggesting in the amendment 
is that where the advisory panel gives advice to the minister 
under subsection (2) and the minister decides not to accept that 
advice in exercising any power under this act in respect of the 
subject matter of that advice, the minister shall without delay 
provide the advisory panel and the taxing authority in respect of 
whom the advice was given with written reasons for that decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we believe that written reasons are so important?  I 
think there is a very good example that came out of the audit of 
HRDC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will refer to two lines of that report, which say that the 
original dollar value of the agreement was amended in one-third 
of the projects.  That is one in three.  These are agreements 
that came out of HRDC and money was given to these projects.  The 
amount of money was reviewed, and in most cases it was revised 
upward.  In 36% of these cases there were no reasons given for 
the change in dollars awarded.  The people asked for an amount of 
money, they got more, and there is no documentation as to why 
those amendments were made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another example.  I will read directly from the 
auditor's report.  When it comes to the monitoring or the 
overseeing of projects, “some program officers expressed the 
opinion that financial monitoring was not required if the results 
were achieved within the agreed budget”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What that really means, or could mean, is that there is 
absolutely no accounting.  As long as they did not spend any more 
money than they were given on a particular project everything 
would be okay.  Whether the results actually were achieved is 
another issue.  Whether they actually did not have to spend all 
the money on that project was not important either.  If they 
provided an inflated budget and the HRDC people, or whoever was 
doing this, granted the full amount, and they actually achieved 
the results and only needed half of the money, or a portion of 
that money, then that was perfectly all right.  That is 
irresponsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people in a business have a budget for certain expenditures 
for equipment, installation or services that are provided for 
that business, and it will cost roughly $10,000 to do it, and 
then they discover as they go along that it really will cost only 
$8,000, what do they do with the $2,000?  Do they automatically 
take that $2,000 and let it disappear, or do they apply it in 
another way and let it come back to be disposed of in a way that 
is most beneficial to the business? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt in my mind that a private entrepreneur would 
take that money and reapply it and not automatically inflate the 
expenditures in that area to meet the allocated budgetary 
provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is precisely what we are looking at here.  That is one 
area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing we are looking at is to make sure that the 
minister, while having tremendous discretionary power given to 
him by the constitution, the law of this land, which is to 
protect the interests of the people of Canada, is accountable and 
transparent, and that the processes are such that they are fair 
and equitable to all concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That would be good for the municipalities.  That would be good 
for the provinces.  That would be good for the minister.  That 
would be good for the government.  It is time we brought about 
some fairness and equity in all of these cases. 
Where a minister is not required to take a particular and 
specific requirement that he must pay, he at least must provide 
reasons for what he did or did not do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have listened 
with great interest to what my colleague from the Reform Party 
has had to say. His remarks were totally relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois will be supporting Bill C-10, although we 
might have liked to have seen a little less discretionary power 
left with the minister, a little more of a framework for the 
minister, just for the sake of transparency.  I believe the 
municipalities would have been pleased to see that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, apparently out of concern for efficiency, the 
minister's discretion will be exercised a bit more in the 
shadows.  That is the major reason why the Reform Party and our 
own party felt some reluctance to pass the bill. 
That is why I had proposed so many amendments, in order for the 
committees set up by the minister under the act to include 
people with expertise in assessing and surveying property in the 
various ridings.  That was the primary purpose of the amendments 
proposed by the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, they were not accepted, apparently out of concern 
for reaching a decision as efficiently and rapidly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We bow to that argument in the end, because we are aware that 
the municipalities are anxious to see the bill adopted at all 
stages. 
We will not delay its passing, but I would nevertheless make a 
recommendation to my colleague over there, the government House 
leader.  Next time, in order to avoid a debate like the one we 
have been having today, he might suggest to his ministers that 
the bill include provisions to make it transparent, unlike the 
goings on at the present time in Human Resources Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think everyone would stand to gain from this.  The 
municipalities, the Federation of Canadian Municipalities also, 
would agree with such a proposal, as would all of the 
stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am the last Bloc Quebecois member to speak.  We can move on to 
passing this bill, with the hope that the municipalities will 
find what they want in it, after such a long wait.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to address a couple of issues raised in this last 
portion of the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that the panel's recommendations would not be binding 
but we must understand that the property of Canada was exempt 
from taxation under the Constitution Act, 1867 and federal 
payments in lieu of taxes remain at the discretion of the 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services.  The 
discretionary powers of the minister under the act may not be 
delegated to another body.  There is no doubt however the 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services would place a 
high value on the advice of the panel which will be structured to 
be as independent as possible from the Department of Public Works 
and Government Services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In respect to making the recommendations of the panel public, I 
would like to remind members of the House that the panel's 
recommendations will be provided simultaneously to the minister 
and the taxing authority which requested the review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, this bill ensures the prompt payment of taxes.  It 
provides certainty.  It gives structures for dispute mechanisms 
and an ongoing joint technical advisory committee.  It has the 
full support of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities.  The 
government has accepted amendments at committee.  All parties 
except the Reform Party are satisfied with the bill in its 
present form. 
The government respectfully suggests that the bill be adopted in 
its present form without amendment.

co-operated so effectively.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP)</B>  moved: 
<A NAME="LINK276">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should adopt a 
national housing strategy and housing supply program, in 
co-operation with the provinces, that recognizes housing as a 
human right and meets the goal of providing an additional one 
percent of federal budgetary spending to meet basic housing needs 
in Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Mr. Speaker, a few days ago a homeless man died.  He 
died alone underneath a park bench huddling to protect himself 
from the blistering cold winds of winter.  He died a few hundred 
yards from where we stand today.  He died behind the Chateau 
Laurier in the shadow of Parliament Hill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, this story is not unusual.  Homeless men and 
women are dying in cities and towns right across Canada:  Robert 
Cote; Eugene Upper; Irwin Anderson; Gino Laplante; Mirsalah-Aldin 
Kompani; Lynn Maureen Bluecloud; Al; Vernon Crow; Jens Drape. 
These are just a few of the names of those we have lost to the 
homelessness crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read their names into the record of this House because it is 
this House and the Liberal majority in it that failed them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is this government that must bear the responsibility for this 
terrible loss.  It is their retreat from social housing 
construction and their steadfast refusal to initiate a national 
housing strategy and supply program that has contributed to a 
housing crisis that has ballooned out of control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is the only developed country in the world without a 
national housing strategy.  What a disgrace.  As parliamentarians 
we come to Ottawa to enact laws and to push forward policy that 
will better the lives of all the people of Canada, the rich and 
the poor.  But I say today, the rich can care for themselves. It 
is on behalf of the poor that we must work the hardest, because 
in a country as wealthy as ours nobody should be forced to live 
out of doors, to beg for food, or to die on the streets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I introduced this motion, which reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should adopt a 
national housing strategy and housing supply program, in 
co-operation with the provinces, that recognizes housing as a 
human right and meets the goal of providing an additional one 
percent of federal budgetary spending to meet basic housing needs 
in Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The root cause of homelessness is lack of housing.  It is as 
simple as that.  Housing activists have said it, reports have 
confirmed it, homeless families know it and yet the government 
refuses to act on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians know what needs to be done.  We need the government to 
commit to a national housing strategy, a strategy that calls for 
the following:  a federal investment of an additional 1% of 
overall spending on housing, or $2 billion annually; a national 
approach that is national in scope and in vision.  That means no 
more patchwork solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a return to the supply of social, not for profit and 
co-op housing.  The federal government has not built any new or 
co-op housing units since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ottawa must heed the call of the Federation of Canadian 
Municipalities and take the lead by funding a new housing program 
that would create 70,000 units each year for 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the Liberal members will stand up in the House today and 
point to the announcement made by the minister responsible for 
homelessness in December and argue that it is sufficient to deal 
with this crisis. I am sad to report that this is absolutely 
untrue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 17 the minister responsible for homelessness went to 
Toronto to announce a three year $753 million homelessness 
strategy.  The problem was that she left out the homes.  It is 
like agreeing to build the house but cutting off the money before 
the roof is on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After months of travelling and consulting and with a projected 
$100 billion budgetary surplus at their disposal, the Liberals 
only announced one new program:  the supporting communities 
partnership initiative. 
It is a $305 million investment but it is over three years. 
Beyond that, the details remain very hazy.  Most people have 
interpreted it to be a source of matching federal funds for a 
patchwork of one time local projects. The rest of this so-called 
new money targeted to existing emergency and RRAP programs will 
go toward shelters and temporary beds.

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Liberal plan announced so far solved the homelessness 
and housing crisis in Canada?  It will not.  The reason it will 
not is because it fails to reverse the government's fateful 1993 
decision to withdraw from social housing construction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal solution it appears is to institutionalize shelters, 
and that is no solution at all.  By offering their support to 
this motion, members of the House of Commons can rectify that 
mistake. We can send a message to the finance minister that we 
want to see a real commitment to end the housing crisis on 
February 28 when the minister rises to outline his government's 
budget priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of handing out tax breaks for their wealthy friends, the 
Liberals should direct some of the projected $100 billion surplus 
to social housing construction.  If they forgo on just one of 
their proposed tax breaks, the elimination of the 5% surtax on 
people who earn over $65,000 a year, the diverted dollars could 
build 10,000 desperately needed social and co-op housing units. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, based on research by the House of Commons research 
branch, if the government met the goal of the 1% solution 
advocated by this motion and by others the initiative would 
employ 44,550 Canadians each year for 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The upcoming federal budget is an opportunity for the finance 
minister to recall his own words of 1990, a decade ago. Then in 
official opposition and as chair of the Liberal Party's task 
force on housing, he condemned the government of the day, the 
Mulroney government, for doing nothing while the housing crisis 
continued to grow out of control.  This is what he said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>...the government sits there and does nothing; it refuses to 
apply the urgent measures that are required to reverse this 
deteriorating situation.  The lack of affordable housing 
contributes to and accelerates the cycle of poverty, which is 
reprehensible in a society as rich as ours. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the now finance minister had to say a decade ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three years later, the now finance minister steamrolled his own 
report and in its place introduced a budget that slashed all 
federal funding for the creation of new social housing units. 
This single act meant that 75,000 new social housing units that 
had been targeted for construction were never built, a decision 
that has denied tens of thousands of families the right to decent 
and affordable housing.  What an absolute shameful act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to right that wrong.  It is time to admit that this 
decision was not only short-sighted, it was shameful.  If the 
government refuses to admit that, if it continues to keep its 
head in the sand, believing that band-aid solutions are the only 
solutions worth funding, then the sad reality is that more people 
will die. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on all members of the House to support this motion as a 
way of sending a message.  In doing so, they will be joining a 
massive wave of support which has come in from across the 
country.  In truth, I have been overwhelmed by the public 
outpouring of support for this motion and the 1% for housing 
campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thousands of people lent their names to our petition and 
postcard campaign in support of Motion No. 123.  These are piled 
up on my desk just as a sample of what has come in from across 
the country.  The petitions continue to flood into my office, and 
that is not all.  I have received hundreds of phone calls in my 
Ottawa and Vancouver offices.  Many people have called in simply 
to express relief that housing is finally on the agenda. Hundreds 
of other Canadians have contacted me by e-mail to lend support 
or, in some cases, to share a story of how the housing crisis has 
impacted on their life or on the life of a friend or loved one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know too that hundreds of letters and e-mails have gone to the 
minister responsible for homelessness because people sent me the 
copies of the letters they sent to her: people like Randall 
Ducharme, who works in a shelter in Vancouver and met with the 
minister responsible for homelessness when she travelled to 
Vancouver in the summer.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Randall wrote this message to the minister the day after he had 
received news of yet another death, this time a teenager, “a 
bright light” he says, who “succumbed to the perils of an 
increasingly selfish Canada”.  He letter reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Claudette, when you visited me at Dusk to Dawn—a Vancouver 
shelter—in the summer of 99—you promised me something would be 
done.  Thus far your government has only applied more band-aid 
solutions.  Libby Davies has a motion that will enable the 
government to set into motion a long-term solution that is in 
line with the spirit of a Canada I can be proud of.  I urge you 
to support M 123. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Al Mitchell, who runs a shelter in Vancouver, says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has it occurred to anyone that that if existing programs were 
adequate, we wouldn't be trying to get your attention to a 
crisis! 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also received hundreds of letters, many from individuals and 
many others from organizations, shelters, frontline housing 
advocates, politicians and unions.  The list is too long to go 
through, but I would like to give an indication of some of the 
kinds of support that came in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Toronto Disaster Relief Committee, which was the initial 
champion of the 1% solution, has done an absolutely amazing job 
in bringing the national disaster of homelessness to the 
forefront of the public agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have support from the New National Housing Network and the 
Tenants Rights Action Coalition in Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would particularly like to thank the Canadian Auto Workers 
Union for its leadership.  It launched its own national campaign 
and actually put up $1 million to support housing.  It showed 
that it was very committed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have the support of the National Anti-Poverty 
Organization, the city of Nepean, the Canadian Federation of 
Students, the Working Group on Poverty in Vancouver, the Street 
Nurses Network in Toronto, the Canadian Mental Health 
Association, the Calgary and District Labour Council, the 
Canadian Labour Congress, the Centretown Citizens Ottawa 
Corporation, the Alliance to End Homelessness in Ottawa, the B.C. 
Government Employees Union, the Brunswick Street United Church in 
Halifax, Hope Cottage in Halifax, the United Steelworkers of 
America, the Canadian Unitarians for Social Justice, the city of

Hospital Employees Union, the John Howard Society, the Community 
Social Planning Council of Toronto, the Carleton Graduate 
Students Association, the Franciscan Sisters of Atonement in 
Vancouver, the Saskatchewan Federation of Labour and the Social 
Planning Council of Winnipeg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have support from End Legislated Poverty, an organization 
made up of groups in my home province of British Columbia working 
to end poverty.  They have sent a statement that I think is 
representative of the overwhelming call to action expressed by 
most of these groups.  They said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Emergency shelters provide immediate crisis services, but the 
existing shelters are severely overburdened.  Shelters are not 
enough:  we need real, long-term housing solutions. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are just a sampling and a fraction of the organizations 
that have supported this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has come to turn the disgrace of being the only 
industrialized country without a housing strategy into a rallying 
point for those of us who care about social justice and want to 
live in a country governed by compassion, not contempt for those 
struggling to make ends meet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to stop the desolation.  It is time to curtail the 
housing crisis in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on all members of the House to support the community's 
call for help.  Homelessness is an unnatural disaster.  It can be 
solved if the political will exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will end by asking if I have the consent of the House to make 
this a votable motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Vancouver East has asked for the unanimous consent of the House

commend the hon. member who is presenting this motion to the

I really think that is noble.

</I></B></P><P align=left>To ask for a strategy is also a good idea, but it assumes that 
there is a policy which determines the overall focus and 
direction of the government.  Unfortunately, a strategy without a 
policy to determine the focus really ends up being nothing more 
than a program to throw money at a problem.  Unfortunately, that 
is precisely what the Liberal government is doing all the time. 
It does not have a a focused program to deal with problems. 
Whenever something happens that is a bit of a problem, the 
government just throws money at it and thinks it will go away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look a bit deeper.  What should a national housing 
strategy really be achieving?  I want to commend the hon. member 
for bringing this forward.  She has indicated very clearly that 
Canada does not have a national housing policy.  The Canada 
Mortgage and Housing Corporation does not have a national housing 
policy.  The government does not have a housing policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are all kinds of patchwork programs.  Probably the most 
blatant of these was the one announced on December 17.  It was a 
joint announcement made by the Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and the Minister of Labour, who is 
responsible for homelessness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion suggests a national housing strategy.  It suggests a 
housing supply program.  It suggests that housing is a human 
right—and I agree that everybody has the right to shelter—and 
it suggests that an additional 1% be added to the federal budget 
to meet basic housing needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing wrong with looking at these things and saying 
“This is what we should have”.  The difficulty is that we do 
not have anything that pulls all of this together.  I would like 
to suggest that the hon. member do that.  Had she done that, we 
might have come to a conclusion that would mean more than simply 
throwing money at the problem.  We might have actually come to 
grips with what is at the heart of the issue and what needs to be 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a majority government.  It can run anything it wants. 
It has a surplus and it has the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation, with all of its talents, abilities and research. 
Why does the government not have a policy?  It seems so obvious 
that there should be a policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the difficulty that the HRD minister finds herself in 
today, I now know for sure what the problem is.  The problem is 
that if the government has a policy, a direction, an objective 
and a focus, then it also can be held to account for achieving 
that focus and that objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it does not want to be held accountable, if it does not want 
to be held responsible, if it does not want people to say “See, 
you did not do it”, all it has to do is say that it does not 
have a policy and throw a few dollars at the problem so the 
people will be quiet and go home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that is what is happening.  We really have to be 
careful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give a few examples.  Look at the leaky condo situation 
in the lower mainland of British Columbia.  It is absolutely 
unbelievable what is happening.  We have had many conversations 
about this.  The buildings are rotting from the inside out 
because there is a failure in the exterior envelope.  It is 
pretty obvious from all the discussions that have taken place 
that errors were made by the builders, the inspectors and the 
architects.  Errors have been made virtually all along.  The one 
thing that is being avoided is placing the blame on the building 
code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Probably there is fault in all four areas.  The building code is 
at fault, the inspectors are at fault, the builder is at fault 
and the architects are at fault.  One of the insurance companies 
that insures architects for errors and omissions has declined any 
further renewal of policies for architects because it feels there 
will be so many claims on the leaky condo issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada Mortgage and Housing, which has guaranteed these 
mortgages through financial institutions, says it is not 
responsible for anything that happens in these leaky condos, that 
all it is insuring is the mortgage.  In other words, it is saying 
that its only legal obligation to the financial institution is 
the repayment of the mortgage.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that there are a lot of people who believe, perhaps 
incorrectly, that when the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation grants them the assurance that it will repay the 
loan, there is an understanding that the building which is being 
mortgaged is sound and that they can depend on this.  Obviously 
the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation does not think that 
is right.  Therefore, it feels it has no obligation.  We will 
find out if in fact there is no obligation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another issue.  The only person who is not protected is 
the poor consumer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at a lot of other areas to see why it is that 
people are found on the streets.  Why are there so many who are 
homeless?  There are many reasons for this.  We could argue that 
some of the social policies, both at the provincial and federal 
levels, have failed and have thrown people on to the streets who 
are unable to look after themselves.  They have been told “Mind 
your own business.  Find your own food.  Find your own shelter. 
Find your own clothing”, when it was known fully well that they 
could not do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at this very carefully.  It is not a simple 
matter of throwing money at the problem.  We have to look at what 
is the policy we should have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the government policy that we should have?  This is the 
way the minister approached it.  On December 17 he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to provide you with the details of the contributions 
of Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation...to the Government of 
Canada's strategy to address homelessness which was announced by 
the Honourable Claudette Bradshaw and myself on December 17, 
1999.  Funding for existing housing renovation programs for 
low-income households will be increased substantially and there 
will also be several policy enhancements aimed at focusing some 
of the additional spending more directly on homelessness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In total, a further $311 million will be spent over four years 
on these initiatives.  This is in addition to the $300 million 
over five years that I announced in 1998 for the Residential 
Rehabilitation Assistance Program...the Emergency Repair 
Program...and Home Adaptations for Seniors' Independence....The 
$311 million in total funding is broken down as follows: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>$200 million to double the current annual budget for RRAP... 
</I></B></P><P align=left>$40 million over four years for a new component of RRAP to 
facilitate the conversion of non-residential buildings to 
residential use... 
</I></B></P><P align=left>$28 million to double the current budget for On-Reserve RRAP over 
four years... 
</I></B></P><P align=left>$43 million in additional funding for the Shelter Enhancement 
Initiative over four years (...$12 million per year for the 
following three years) and an expansion of the program to include 
shelters and second stage housing for youth. 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By April 1st of next year, nearly $138 million per year will be 
spent on CMHC housing renovation programs, compared to 
approximately $60 million annually prior to this announcement. 
This represents more than twice the amount that CMHC invested in 
these programs in previous years. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Note the $138 million on CMHC housing renovation programs.  It 
was $60 million prior to this and now it is $138 million.  How 
many different ways does the government count the same dollars? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. Minister of Labour, the federal co-ordinator for 
homelessness, on December 17 announced $753 million to alleviate 
and prevent homelessness.  A cornerstone of that program is the 
new supporting communities partnership initiative which will 
amount to $305 million over three years.  The total is $753 
million.  Of that total $305 million is new money.  That is all. 
The minister is saying she is doing all of these things, but in 
reality about $400 million is simply being moved around.   She is 
doing something all right.  She is moving money from one hand to 
the other.  That solves nothing.  This is an insult to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national housing policy is a major issue for Canadians.  The 
government should be held to account and asked when it is going 
to come up with a national housing policy that will work and 
solve the problems.  It should not just throw money at it.  It 
has done that for years and it has not solved anything.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
take part in this debate.  I congratulate my NDP colleague for 
introducing this motion in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The subject at issue is no longer a secret to anyone.  Recent 
years spent fighting the government's budget deficit have hit 
society's disadvantaged the hardest.  It is therefore 
appropriate, when the first fruits of this new budgetary era are 
gathered, to think right off of those who have suffered most at 
the hands of this government's policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem of social housing is one specific and eloquent 
example of this government's approach in recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Barely a few months after it took office, during its first 
mandate, the Liberal Party decided unilaterally to get out of 
social housing as of January 1, 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is when the government began negotiating with each of the 
provinces and territories to move away from this responsibility, 
knowing full well that these agreements did not meet the 
provinces' real needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Quebec, this arrangement comprises essentially a transfer of 
management to the Société d'habitation du Québec for all social 
housing funded by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. 
To fulfil that mandate, it gets nothing more than the funds 
required to meet the CMHC's existing commitments regarding 
existing housing units, which in no way meets the current needs 
of the poorest households. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces that have already signed on are getting a share of 
CMHC's budget that is equal to or in excess of their demographic 
weight or needs. As for Quebec, based on CMHC's budget 
expenditures for 1995-96, it only receives an 18% share, while 
its demographic weight is 24.5% and its needs amount to 27.4%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it so important to invest in social housing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1990 and 1995, the number of Canadian households 
spending more than 50% of their income on housing went from 
583,710 to 833,555, a 43% increase. We know that single-parent 
families, persons living alone, young people under 25 and older 
couples are very affected by the lack of affordable housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is urgent that the federal government realize the scope of the 
needs and give new moneys to the provinces, so that they can set 
up an investment plan for social housing that will reflect the 
realities of the neighbourhoods, cities and regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government's withdrawal has had a negative impact, 
particularly on women. Indeed, in the area of health, employment 
insurance and other areas, women were hit particularly hard by 
the cuts made by this Liberal government. Social housing is no 
exception. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being a woman and a tenant often means being unable to find good 
quality housing at an affordable price. A recent document 
prepared by FRAPRU shows the housing situation as lived by 
women. The Liberals would do well to read that document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give two examples. I was stunned to learn that in 
Drummondville, which is in the centre of Quebec and which is the 
largest municipality in my riding, there are 2,370 households 
with an average income of $20,640—with women being the primary 
source of income in 44.7% of the cases, that are spending more 
than 30% of their income on housing. Moreover, 1,105 households, 
or 20.9%, are spending more than half of their income on 
housing.

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that, according to the government's criteria, 
a household spending more than 30% of its income on housing is 
paying too much for housing.  Imagine when this figure climbs to 
50% and higher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet the economy of the city I represent is in good shape, proof 
that housing is not just a problem in certain less fortunate 
regions.  It is a problem throughout Quebec, throughout Canada. 
But there is worse—and I will give two examples—because, in the 
Prime Minister's own riding, the situation is catastrophic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of favouring certain rich promoters in his region in 
order to buy votes, the Prime Minister should look after the 
poor, the least fortunate in his riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Shawinigan, the main city in the Prime Minister's riding, the 
average income of households where women are the primary earners 
is $16,072.  The figures show that 1,635 of them, or 55.5%, 
spend over 30% of their income on housing and that 870 
households, or 29.5%, spend over half. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the Prime Minister cannot honestly be proud of the 
situation of poor women who rent housing in the municipality of 
Shawinigan, which he represents in the House.  Their average 
income of $16,072 is the lowest of the 59 cities studied by the 
Front populaire pour le réaménagement urbain, or FRAPRU. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 27, 1999, the Bloc Quebecois asked the minister 
responsible for the homeless the following question: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the Minister of Labour, who is responsible for the homeless, is 
the first to admit that the federal government has made cuts 
that hurt the most disadvantaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the Minister tell us, of the cuts the government has made, 
which ones most hurt those most disadvantaged in our society: 
cuts to employment insurance, cuts to social housing or cuts to 
the Canada social transfer, which forced the provinces to cut 
services? 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And here is her answer: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—in travelling across Canada, what we notice most with respect to 
the homeless is that the provinces have closed psychiatric 
hospitals. Former residents of psychiatric hospitals are turning 
up at food banks. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is unbelievable. It is really hard to understand that, in 
her visits to food banks and self help groups, the minister did 
not realize that a large majority of people who go there do not 
necessarily have psychiatric problems, but are simply poor. It 
is unfortunate that the minister should make political hay on 
the backs of those most in need and the homeless instead of 
giving them back immediately the money her government has taken 
away from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As if this contempt for the homeless were not enough, the 
government has more than once used the Prime Minister's ways to 
repel protesters who want to show how desperate they are and to 
ask for assistance. 
On the hill, the RCMP pepper sprayed protesters, and, a couple 
weeks ago, force was used against several people who were trying 
to deliver their message directly to the Prime Minister's 
office. Some compassion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Action is urgently required. Ten years ago, the federal 
government promised to eliminate child poverty by the year 2000. 
The year 2000 is here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make up for its broken promise, the government has to 
understand that child poverty means there are also women and men 
living in poverty. Some families have to cut back on basic 
necessities and food to pay the rent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Social housing is a crucial weapon in the fight against poverty.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to stand before the House today 
on behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party and as the member 
of parliament for Beauséjour—Petitcodiac to debate Motion No. 
123. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1405"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the lack of safe, secure, affordable housing is 
one of the most important factors contributing to poverty for 
many Canadians.  I thank my colleague the member for Vancouver 
East for presenting this very important motion to the House and 
for giving us the opportunity to debate this growing problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although we support this motion, I must add that we have some 
concern regarding the requirement to spend exactly 1% of the 
federal budget on housing needs.  We believe that allocating an 
exact amount without knowing what is needed is a problem when 
indeed that amount may not even be sufficient to solve this 
growing problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate this is not a votable motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To address this growing problem we need first and foremost a 
national strategy to deal with homelessness.  That strategy must 
provide affordable housing and address the problem of growing 
poverty.  We need a plan to reduce homelessness with targets for 
reducing poverty and an increase in the amount of affordable 
housing available to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will that plan include the commitment of new finances?  Of 
course.  We may need more than 1% of the federal budget or we may 
need less.  New money has to be part of an overall strategy to 
wrestle this problem to the ground but it is not the answer in 
itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recognizing that there is a key link between economic policy and 
social policy and that good social policy is good economic 
policy, the PC Party of Canada has a long history of concern with 
poverty and its consequences.  For that reason on March 3, 1999 
the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada 
announced the creation of the PC national caucus task force on 
poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many members of our party caucus from both houses of parliament 
held meetings across the country during the spring and summer of 
last year to listen and learn from a wide variety of witnesses. 
We were shocked by the conditions under which so many Canadians 
are forced to live.  However, we were inspired by their courage 
and by their refusal to relinquish hope.  We were awed by the 
hard work and dedication of the many groups and individuals who 
are striving for positive change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The task force acknowledged that no single strategy, no matter 
how well designed, could be expected to address all aspects of 
what is an extremely complex, multifaceted and challenging 
problem.  It is also recognized that such an objective cannot be 
accomplished overnight.  Therefore the recommended initiatives 
target the near, medium and longer term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Flexibility is also required as is a mechanism by which to judge 
the success of the strategy in reducing and eliminating poverty 
in order that various components can be modified as necessary and 
new ones added. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key to the success of any attempt to address the causes and 
consequences of poverty and homelessness in Canada is by 
developing partnerships among the federal, provincial, 
territorial and municipal governments, people living in poverty, 
organizations representing them, and the business community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the task force's recommendations made it clear that it 
does not have any desire to intrude on areas of provincial 
responsibility, the federal government must play a facilitating 
and leadership role with the support and co-operation of other 
governments in Canada as well as the non-profit and business 
sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During these meetings witnesses made it abundantly clear that a 
lack of safe, secure, affordable housing is one of the most 
important factors contributing to and compounding the poverty of 
many Canadians, and that action is desperately needed to ensure 
that such housing is available to the thousands of Canadians who 
are inadequately housed and homeless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An income deficiency rather than a housing deficiency is at the 
heart of inadequate housing and homelessness.  People in poverty 
have a housing problem not because there are not enough homes but 
because there are not enough safe, secure affordable homes 
relative to their level of income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our report several recommendations were made in regard to 
support for children living in poor families, employment, income 
support and taxation, housing and homelessness, special 
assistance for vulnerable populations, support for the voluntary 
non-profit sector, and accountability for results.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among the recommendations dealing with affordable housing, our 
party's task force recommended that the federal government in 
partnership with provincial, territorial and municipal 
governments develop a national housing policy which acknowledges 
the need for the federal government to be an active partner in 
the provision of funding and leadership in the area of social 
housing and commits Ottawa to provide the provinces and 
territories with significantly increased funding to implement 
programs designed to meet specific objectives in support of this 
national housing policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A portion of this federal funding should be directed to new 
co-operative housing supply programs and housing trusts.  The 
money that Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation is now 
required as a result of the passage of Bill C-66 to pay the 
government as compensation for the crown guarantee of its 
mortgage insurance program should be reinvested instead in 
affordable housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such recommendations would ensure that a long term solution be 
found for the growing shortage of affordable housing. By 
undertaking a well managed affordable housing program, valuable 
government moneys could well be spent to stem the chronic 
shortage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I notice that there is not a quorum in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member has 
requested a quorum call.  We are under a special order in which 
there will be no quorum calls or dilatory motions, so it is to no 
avail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate there 
are not enough members interested in the serious problem of 
homelessness in the country.  In those of us who are here we 
certainly have quality, but it would be nice to have numbers. 
Usually numbers are what really count here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC task force on poverty also studied direct ways of 
eliminating the causes of homelessness and made recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the federal government should work with provincial, 
territorial and municipal governments and the non-profit sector 
to develop and implement a national homelessness strategy. It 
would include a comprehensive range of measures aimed at 
preventing and alleviating homelessness in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the federal government should present an annual report 
card on homelessness to Canadians to be tabled in parliament 
detailing federal measures undertaken to address homelessness and 
setting specific objectives for the following year.  I am sure if 
we had had a report card under HRDC we might be able to find out 
where that money went. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the federal government should work with the provincial 
and territorial governments to help them fund a series of 
measures to be delivered by organizations active in the mental 
health field and those working with homeless people, including 
the provision of mental health services, community support, 
addiction treatment, employment assistance and housing, to help 
homeless Canadians develop greater personal autonomy and 
facilitate their reintegration into society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the federal government should make available at no 
charge the use of federally owned facilities which are not being 
used for other purposes to temporarily shelter homeless people in 
response to requests from local governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such recommendations would help to eliminate in the short and 
long term the causes of homelessness and would get the homeless 
off Canada's streets, especially at this time of year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians agree that the federal government needs to do 
more.  The announcement made by the Minister of Labour and the 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services in December to 
build more homeless shelters was a start. However with the use of 
over $300 million to conduct new studies on ways to administer 
such programs, all agree that the money could be better spent 
helping the homeless.  We also need a national housing strategy 
that includes affordable housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC party supports the motion presented by my colleague the 
member for Vancouver East but we would argue that adequate 
financial resources need to be allocated in order to solve this 
growing problem. 
<P><A NAME="LINK280"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to address Motion No. M-123 presented by the member for 
Vancouver East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and again the member has spoken out on this issue calling 
attention to the importance of housing.  I do not think anyone in 
the House can doubt she is a passionate advocate. I am pleased to 
say that our government already shares her concern on this 
question and has taken a number of steps to help low income 
Canadians generally and to ensure Canadians have access to 
quality housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion recognizes that the issue of housing need is directly 
related to the root issue which is that of poverty.  A housing 
affordability problem occurs when a large portion of a family's 
income is consumed by housing costs to the extent that money for 
other necessities is lacking.

have been made, including the introduction and enrichment of the 
child tax benefit.  The child tax benefit will reach an annual 
level of close to $7 billion by the middle of this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are working with the provinces and territories on the 
national children's agenda to improve supports for families and 
for their children.  We have sought to reduce the burden of 
taxation on low income families.  Targeted tax cuts in the 1998 
and 1999 federal budgets have taken 600,000 lower income 
taxpayers completely off the tax rolls.  The significance of this 
initiative cannot be overstated.  Some 600,000 lower income 
Canadians no longer pay a penny of federal tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Income support is not the only approach.  My hon. colleague will 
recall that last year the government made the commitment to 
invest $11.5 billion in our health system.  This represents the 
largest single investment we have ever made. Because 
administration of the health system falls under the 
constitutional jurisdiction of the provinces and territories, the 
federal government made this offer on the condition that each 
provincial and territorial government must commit to use these 
funds exclusively for health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This additional funding was designed to help the provinces and 
territories to deal with immediate concerns in the health system, 
including diagnostic and treatment services for those with mental 
health issues or drug addictions, those most likely to be found 
on the streets in need of adequate housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members know that decent housing at a reasonable cost is 
essential.  There are current housing problems in the country 
which need to be addressed such as the pressing housing needs 
that exist in a number of aboriginal communities.  We must 
address the changing needs of an aging population.  There is the 
problem of homelessness particularly in larger cities across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government is committed to action across the broad spectrum 
of housing issues.  We are taking a comprehensive approach.  We 
are seeing concrete results.  The primary instrument for the 
Government of Canada's action in the area of housing is the 
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.  As Canada's national 
housing agency, CMHC is responsible for the government's housing 
policy.  The corporation's goal is to promote affordability, 
accessibility and choice in housing for Canadians.  Each of 
CMHC's core activities supports this goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The corporation's work on behalf of Canadians rests on four 
solid pillars: housing finance, assisted housing, research and 
information transfer, and export promotion.  Let us take the 
example of housing finance.  CMHC mortgage insurance, which 
guarantees mortgage loans issued by financial institutions, plays 
a crucial role in helping Canadians gain access to home ownership 
or rental accommodation with the lowest possible down payment and 
interest rates no matter where they live in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For generations of Canadians saving for the down payment on a 
first home has been a challenge.  Thanks to CMHC-protected 
reduced down payments, home ownership has become a reality for 
more than 610,000 first time home buyers since the program's 
inception in 1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second important pillar that supports the valuable work of 
CMHC is research and information transfer.  CMHC's research helps 
Canadians to understand and meet the housing challenges of 
tomorrow.  Working in partnership with the housing industry, 
research into housing issues results in developing solutions to 
improving the quality and technical performance as well as the 
affordability of housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well there is the commitment to assisted housing.  The 
Government of Canada currently contributes $1.9 billion annually 
to meet the housing needs of low income Canadians, supporting 
644,000 units across the country.  For years Canada's social 
housing services have been provided in partnership with 
provincial, territorial and municipal governments, and with 
housing agencies and sponsor groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another successful program which the Government of Canada 
supports through CMHC is the residential rehabilitation 
assistance program.  The minister responsible for CMHC announced 
last December a further $200 million over four years, effectively 
doubling the budget for RRAP.  This is part of the Government of 
Canada's overall $753 million strategy to address homelessness. 
As well the minister announced the creation of a new component of 
the program to convert non-residential buildings to residential 
use for a total contribution of another $40 million.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current budget for RRAP on Indian reserves was doubled, 
which will result in an additional $28 million over four years. 
These funding increases are in addition to the $300 million over 
five years announced in 1998 for this program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>RRAP is a very successful program.  It provides funds to low 
income home owners and owners of properties where low income 
Canadians live.  The owners use the funds to bring their 
properties up to minimum health and safety standards.  They have 
been referred to by other speakers as safe, clean and affordable 
buildings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years we have seen firsthand that RRAP makes a tangible 
difference in the lives of thousands of disadvantaged people 
across Canada.  The examples of RRAP's success stories are too 
numerous to list, but the program is having a positive impact in 
communities across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give the House a brief glimpse of what the government is 
achieving through two examples.  In Winnipeg there is a 40 bed 
rooming house in the inner city called Nakiska II.  This facility 
is primarily used by natives from communities in northern 
Manitoba who come Winnipeg for medical care.  Nakiska II received 
a RRAP commitment of over $380,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Vancouver there is the Metropole Hotel, a 60 unit building 
that received CMHC loan insurance to purchase the building and 
$1.1 million in RRAP funds for much needed repairs.  The 
Metropole provides affordable housing for low income inner city 
residents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are just two examples of what RRAP is achieving throughout 
Canada.  What these projects all share is that they are based on 
partnerships and involve the local community.  They prove the 
worth of our emphasis on community solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I stress again that CMHC is committed to ensuring 
that Canadians remain among the best housed people in the world. 
However, our government is aware that there are too many of our 
citizens who do not have adequate housing.  Rest assured that the 
government through CMHC will continue to improve Canadians access 
to quality, affordable housing.  By working together with our 
partners at other levels of government, with community groups and 
with the housing industry, we will continue to help Canadians 
buy, build and rent homes.  In so doing we will improve the 
quality of life for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Housing is a joint responsibility of all levels of government: 
federal, provincial and municipal.  For this reason the 
government cannot support this specific motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  There are eight 
minutes remaining in the debate.  The last five minutes of the 
debate go to the sponsor of the motion, so there are three 
minutes remaining for any member who wishes to rise.  Seeing no 
members on their feet, I invite the hon. member for Vancouver 
East to sum up in the last five minutes of debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK281"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have listened to the debate of the various party representatives. 
I thank the members present who participated in the debate on 
this important motion which certainly has a lot of support. It 
was interesting to hear the perspective of the different parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From what I heard, the Reform Party member basically said there 
was not too much wrong with the motion.  He talked about the 
problem with leaky condos, with which I would concur. It is 
interesting that the Reform Party, which I do not think 
historically has been an advocate of social housing, seems to 
think that housing is a human right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said that there is a need to have a national housing 
policy.  I do not care whether we call it a policy or a strategy 
as long as we get the housing built.  The member believed that 
was important.  When this matter comes up in future debates I 
urge the Reform Party to be true to its word, to show its 
commitment and support, particularly when it comes time for the 
budget, and to be committed to an allocation that will result in 
housing being built. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the member from the Bloc Quebecois that only two 
provinces are still constructing social housing in Canada.  Those 
are British Columbia and Quebec.  Both provinces are doing a good 
job of trying to keep up with the demand, but as the member 
outlined so well it is often the poor or single women or lone 
female heads of households who suffer the most.  I know from my 
own experience in Vancouver East that unless those federal 
dollars are present the provinces simply cannot do it alone. 
That is the reason we need a national housing strategy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also appreciate the comments of the member from the Tory 
party, the member for Beauséjour—Petitcodiac. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concern was expressed about the 1% for housing. I would like to 
explain that the 1% for housing emanates from the fact that right 
now governments spend about 1% on housing.  The member from the 
government side told us that CMHC spends about $1.9 billion 
currently on housing. This motion calls for an expenditure of 
about $2 billion.  That is what is committed now. We are saying 
that an additional 1% is required in order to meet this very 
basic need in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Tory member also talked about her party's task force on 
poverty.  For the record it was the Tory government that began 
the demise of Canada's social housing programs.  It was continued 
by the Liberal government and we are at this crisis today. 
Nevertheless I was happy to see support for the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the government position, after hearing the long list 
of all it is doing, it begs the question, why do we have a crisis 
in this country?  Why do we have a crisis in homelessness and 
housing despite the RRAP programs which the member spoke about, 
despite the research, despite the mortgages that exist?  It is 
because we are not constructing new units. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very glad that those 660,000 units exist. I know families 
who live in that housing and their lives have changed as a 
result.  However unless we can build new social housing with a 
federal commitment for dollars, then we will still see people on 
the streets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that the government rests on what has been 
done in the past and does not recognize the reality before us 
today.  I think we would all agree that homelessness is caused in 
part by poverty.  It is a lack of housing and it is also growing 
poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at the social policies that have been decided on 
by the Liberal government.  The cuts to EI have forced many women 
into poverty. Child poverty has increased 50% since the 
resolution was first brought forward in 1989.  These realities 
are a result of social policy that has come from the Liberal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did hear that there is support for this motion.  If there is a 
commitment, if there is a will, then we can address this issue 
and we can decide that we want a real national housing program 
with the federal government present in co-operation with the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on members of this House and seek unanimous consent to 
have this motion made votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Vancouver East has asked for the unanimous consent of the House 
to have her motion made votable.  Does the hon. member for 
Vancouver East have the unanimous consent of the House to move 
the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired.  As the 
motion has not been designated as a votable item, the order is 
dropped from the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 2.28 p.m. this House stands adjourned until Monday, 
February 14 at 11 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 2.28 p.m.)
