</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, I am now prepared to rule on the 
question of privilege raised on Friday, November 28, 1997 by the hon. 
member for Prince George—Bulkley Valley and on Monday, December 1, 1997 
by the hon. member for Markham.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Prince George—Bulkley Valley raised the 
matter of a premature disclosure and newspaper publication of 
part of the draft report of the Standing Committee on Finance 
concerning pre-budget consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Markham also objected to the premature 
disclosure of the draft report and to the fact that some 
committee members had been denied access to the draft report 
until after the occurrence of the leak. The hon. member for 
Markham further claimed that the delay in providing him with the 
draft report interfered with his ability to carry out his 
functions as a committee member in examining the draft and 
preparing, if necessary, a dissenting opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. members for bringing these matters to the 
attention of the House.  I would also thank the other hon. 
members who raised points related to these questions for the 
Chair's consideration. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me begin by saying that the matter of the premature disclosure 
of committee documents is one which has been raised on a number of 
occasions in the past few weeks. The Chair has clearly set out the 
principle that committee matters should be raised on the floor of the 
House as a result of the presentation of a report from the committee 
concerning them. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a further principle related to premature disclosure of 
committee documents which Speaker Jerome used as the basis for a 
ruling given on October 22, 1975.   No potential breach of in 
camera proceedings can be taken up without a specific allegation 
of misconduct directed against particular individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer hon. members to citation 877(2) of Beauchesne's, 6th 
Edition, which clearly states that a complaint concerning 
premature publication of a committee report is incomplete without 
reference to the specific source responsible for the disclosure 
of the report.  In consequence, I cannot find that this matter 
constitutes a prima facie breach of privilege at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the issue concerning the preparation of 
dissenting opinions, Standing Order 108(1)(a), which gives 
committees the power to append dissenting or supplementary 
opinions, is permissive in nature.  It is up to each committee to 
decide whether or not dissenting opinions should be appended to a 
report and the form that they should take.  However, when a 
committee has taken the decision to permit the appending of such 
opinions, it is only reasonable that that decision should be 
reflected in its work plan.  Any adjustments to that work plan 
must be made in a spirit of fairness to all members of the 
committee.  The majority must allow reasonable time for 
dissenting opinions to be submitted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerning the question of access to draft material by members 
of a committee, I once again remind members that committees are 
masters of their own affairs.  As such they are free to order 
their proceedings as they see fit.  At the same time, the Chair 
is troubled by the fact that some members may feel unable to 
adequately perform their parliamentary duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Drafts of committee documents, whether they are prepared by 
government members or opposition members, should always be made 
equally accessible to all members.  I know that all members value 
the collegial nature of the work that is carried out by 
committees of this House.  I remind the committee chairs that 
good working relations require that all members be able to 
present their views and contribute appropriately to the committee 
process. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank the hon. members for Prince George—Bulkley 
Valley and Markham for having brought these matters to the attention of 
the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36, I am pleased to present a petition 
from a number of Canadians, including some from my riding of 
Mississauga South. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners would like to bring to the attention of the 
House that managing the family home and caring for preschool 
children is an honourable profession which has not been 
recognized for its value to our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners also agree with the National Forum on Health in 
its section on investing that the Income Tax Act does not take 
into account the real cost of raising children when one provides 
direct parental care in the home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners therefore pray and call upon Parliament to 
pursue tax initiatives that will eliminate this tax 
discrimination against families who provide direct parental care 
to their children in the home.

behalf of people in the riding of Medicine Hat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are very concerned that the government is funding groups 
to consider the removal of section 43 of the Criminal Code. 
Therefore, the petitioners request Parliament to affirm the duty 
of parents to responsibly raise their children according to their 
own conscience and beliefs and to retain section 43 in Canada's 
Criminal Code as it is currently worded.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK21">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House proceeded to the consideration of Bill C-17, an act to 
amend the Telecommunications Act and the Teleglobe Canada 
Reorganization and Divestiture Act, as reported (with amendment) 
from the committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK22"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
believe you will find unanimous consent for an order that all 
questions necessary for the disposal of the report stage of Bill 
C-17 be put at 12 p.m. today, that any divisions requested 
thereon not be deferred, and that the House proceed to the third 
reading stage immediately after completing the report stage, and 
that all questions to dispose of that stage be put no later than 
1.59 p.m. with any division that may be requested deferred until 
the conclusion of Government Orders this afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is there unanimous

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK23"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a point of 
order. At this stage of the report, I tabled two amendments that were 
not approved by the Chair and I would like to make my case before the 
House. One of these amendments concerns clause 1 and the other concerns 
clause 8. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to include a definition of “basic telecommunications 
services”, as this expression is used for the first time in the 
Telecommunications Act. There is a definition of “telecommunications 
services” but not of “basic telecommunications services”. 
This new expression appears for the first time in Bill C-17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to amend clause 8 to include a definition, specifying that 
this definition also applies to the telecommunications services required 
by any person who wishes to participate fully in Canadian society. This 
is not adding anything new to the objectives of the Telecommunications 
Act as stated in section 7 of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respectfully submit that my amendments should be accepted as they 
are required because there is no definition of what constitutes basic 
telecommunications services and the intent underlying my amendments is 
in keeping with the objectives of the policy stated in section 7 of the 
Telecommunications Act.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  For the benefit of 
hon. members who may not be aware, in a situation such as this 
the Chair makes a ruling based on whether a motion changes or 
introduces a new aspect to the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After consideration with table officers and carefully looking at 
it, the last three lines which state that it shall ensure that 
the definition covers the telecommunications services needed by 
any person who wishes to participate fully in Canadian society do 
in fact broaden the legislation beyond the scope that was 
initially considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the Chair rules that the motion is not in order. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. The motion included two parts. The first one asked that the 
expression “basic telecommunications services” be defined. I would be 
surprised if the House said it is not interested in finding out what 
“basic services” means. I do not think it is the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first part could at least be deemed to be in order, and I would 
ask for the consent of the House to at least accept that first part, so

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> The reason we are 
debating a ruling that has already been made is that in the 
opinion of the Chair it is the appropriate thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a point of clarification for hon. members, the member for 
Mercier presented a notice of motion which was done legitimately, 
the way it should be done. The Chair had difficulty with one 
aspect of the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member for Mercier is prepared to remove item (c), then 
with the concurrence of the House the Chair would be prepared to 
accept the motion as amended.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont—Dundas, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
has been our experience at one time or another that to negotiate 
some of these items across the floor of the House without all the 
pertinent information is rather difficult to say the least. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in the spirit of co-operation that already exists on 
this bill, and I know that an order has already been accepted in 
terms of putting limitations on the time of debate at report 
stage, I wonder if there might be a willingness if it is deemed 
possible by the Chair to resume the debate at report stage.  And 
while we have some resources and officials from the department we 
could look at the matter raised by the hon. member for Mercier 
and see if in fact there is a possibility of raising the matter 
she raised in the first motion which has not been deemed 
acceptable at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will put whatever resources we have out disposal forward and 
see if there is room to accept the motion being put forward.  I 
wonder if we should not pursue the debate.  We are actually 
taking up some very valuable time on the matter while we are 
negotiating across the floor of the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The chief government

what we need to do and to make sure all members are aware of the 
exactly what is going on.  If the hon. member for Mercier would 
make available to other parties the amended version, in concert 
with the chief government whip, we will get into debate and then

</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said: Mr. Speaker, when the Bloc Quebecois said it was prepared 
to support the bill, which deprives Teleglobe and Telesat of their 
monopoly, it did so for two reasons. First, because in the negotiations 
with the World Trade Organization, Canada insisted that ownership remain 
primarily Canadian, something which we feel is extremely important. 
Second, because in its original bill, the government increased its 
powers and those of the CRTC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, I made it clear that we felt the minister and the CRTC 
do not make sufficient use of their powers to protect consumers. At the 
same time, it is obvious that if neither the minister nor the CRTC have 
adequate powers, they cannot do anything for consumers. This is why we 
agreed with the spirit of the bill, in its original form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our committee heard officials from several major telecommunications 
companies currently providing services to Quebec and Canada, but not to 
the international community. They told us repeatedly that they did not 
want to be subjected to a licensing regime. They wanted such a licensing 
regime for international companies that will now be allowed to bring 
their cable services to Quebec and Canada, but not for them, because it 
would be too costly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee also heard consumer groups from Quebec and Canada. 
They told us that, on the contrary, a licensing regime for international 
and national telecommunications companies at the beginning of this 
period of deregulation and end of monopolies was the best guarantee that 
consumers would know what to expect when they got services from one of 
these major companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consumers are currently facing a difficult situation. Advertising 
in the telecommunications sector is second to none and consumers do not 
know what to expect. They do not always know their rights either, and it 
is not easy to take action, even with the CRTC in place.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under such conditions, consumer associations said that they would 
agree with a licensing regime. The CRTC also testified and stated that 
although it agreed with the first version of the act and with a 
licensing regime, it was because it was not required to implement a 
licensing regime for all classes of services, since it could choose and 
since this regime could contain a number of requirements that would even 
facilitate the application of the Telecommunications Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So in fact we did not hear any evidence on this, except perhaps the 
concerns expressed by companies presently operating in Canada and in 
Quebec that regulations would become more intrusive, but it seems to us 
that this concern is contradicted by what the CRTC said when it claimed 
that, on the contrary, this would make enforcement less intrusive, more 
simple, and more predictable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So under such conditions, we did not hear any evidence that can 
convince us to support the amendment that the government agreed with. I 
must admit that this may seem strange, but we prefer the spirit of the 
initial version and this is the reason why, in the case of the clauses 
that you listed, we have re-established the original intent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I would like to add something that I consider extremely 
important. It is the fact that the field of national and international 
telecommunications is changing extremely rapidly, both at the 
technological level and the service delivery level. The population 
cannot keep up with all these changes. 
So it is important, even if we think we can foresee what will happen in 
two years, that the CRTC have this ability to determine the types of 
licences in a field that is changing so quickly, without having to have 
the legislation amended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, we did not hear any evidence that can convince us to 
support this amendment. We understand and we respect the objectives of 
these large corporations, which wanted to limit licensing to 
international companies, but we think that these companies could 
understand at any rate that the CRTC took a direction that even the 
consumers find regrettable and are trying to deal with by stating that 
their rights must be respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be remembered, and I will probably repeat this today, 
that for the consumers, deregulation and competition have resulted in a 
rapid rise in rates. 
Consumers are being told that by going forward with deregulation, by not 
interfering in the market and by opening it to competition, all problems 
will be solved and it will become a dream world, but they are not quite 
ready to believe this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be pointed out that when the departments were redesigned 
in 1993, in fact under former Prime Minister Kim Campbell during her 
brief period as head of the government, and whose initiatives seem to 
suit the present government very well, the Department of Industry became 
of course a department for microeconomic development, but also the 
department responsible for protecting consumer rights. So we believe 
that in this respect, the department and the minister should ensure that 
Canadian companies can develop in a competitive environment, but, more 
importantly, they should also ensure that this environment does not have 
a negative effect on consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So I wish to point out again that the field of telecommunications 
is changing extremely rapidly. It is an area where international 
players, through partnerships, mergers, and stock purchases are in fact 
constantly changing, even if it seems that Canadian features are being 
kept. Their international image, if I can explain it like this, is 
constantly changing.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I cannot understand why the department did not insist and 
explain to the large corporations that it had not intended to unduly 
compromise liberalization policies that enhance competition, as long as 
this competition continues to ensure that the people will receive 
services that are affordable, accessible and reliable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, we realize now that reliability is a problem. There have 
been problems in Quebec, we know that there have been problems elsewhere 
also, and so the CRTC should be given the means to react differently 
than with the piecemeal approach it now has. This is what we considered 
and still consider to be the proper course of action, and we are 
disappointed that the government has changed its mind on this.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments and 
points that have been brought forward by the member for Mercier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She has proposed a number of amendments to the licensing 
provisions basically found in clauses 3 and 7. The substance of 
the amendments proposed by the Bloc Quebecois are to expand the 
scope of licensing powers of the CRTC from international services 
to the wording that existed prior to the amendments and agreed to 
by the committee, in which the CRTC had broad authority to 
license both international and domestic providers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out that we did have an extensive review of this 
bill at the Standing Committee on Industry.  Every witness spoke 
on this subject during the committee review.  It was the opinion 
of the committee and the main concerns of the parties that 
appeared before the committee that the licensing provision in 
this bill at this time be limited to international services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We listened to a number of witnesses express their strong 
support for the introduction of a licensing regime for 
international services but express great reservation about the 
use of the power for domestic services.  Others argued for the 
retention of the broad powers, such as the Bloc with its 
amendments here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the House knows, with any knew regulatory tool there are 
costs and benefits.  With respect to the international services 
there is clear evidence that such a tool is necessary.  While 
there will be compliance costs, they are small compared to the 
benefits of making sure that the changes of the Teleglobe 
monopoly to an international competition is made properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We acknowledge that there would be some benefit to have 
licensing authority for domestic services.  However, we already 
have a fairly well developed regulatory framework.  It is not 
clear on the additional costs and benefits and which one 
outweighs the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard very clearly that in its work in telecommunications, 
which is an environment that changes and advances every day and 
an environment that we as Canadians need to be leaders in, the 
CRTC has been moving away from regulating everything to making 
sure there is competition in that arena.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We listened to all the arguments made in committee. The decision 
to restrict the power to international service was taken after 
hearing all of the parties. We believe at this time that it is 
the right decision. It is most important that we get on with our 
requirements on adhering to the various telecommunications 
treaties that we have signed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be against this amendment. I understand very clearly the 
member's concerns which she has brought forward, but I advise the 
House that we would be against this amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
think this is an important circumstance in the list of amendments 
the hon. member has brought forward.  It is important for a 
couple of key reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first is that we need to ask ourselves a question as we did 
in committee concerning the issue of international licensing as 
opposed to domestic licensing.  What really are we trying to 
accomplish and what is the cost benefit of doing so? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been mentioned previously by the hon. member on the other 
side, numerous presenters at committee expressed concern around 
adding a new layer of domestic licensing to telecommunications 
service providers.  Yet we could find no clear justification for 
adding this new level of licensing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today under the CRTC, the Telecommunications Act and the 
Competition Act, there are already vehicles through which the 
government can deal with any problems in the industry.  These 
vehicles that currently exist if exercised expediently are all 
that are needed.  To layer a new level of licensing on to 
business interests in the telecommunications industry which are 
currently not under a licensing regime is just an expansion of a 
bureaucracy for no clear benefit.  That is what became so evident 
in the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that is why we stand against these particular 
amendments put forward by the Bloc member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We always have to ask and we are going to continue to ask the 
question, whenever there is some new overlay of regulation or 
licensing and the cost that is involved in adding the new 
licensing or administrative overlay, what is the benefit derived 
for the consumer.  Somebody is going to have to pay for this 
licensing process.  Someone is going to have to administer it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ultimately we know who that someone is.  It is the taxpayer.  It 
may be passed on to industry, but industry just flows that back 
to the consumer.  One way or the other the taxpayer or the 
consumer funds these new regulatory regimes that are layered on 
top of the ones that are already there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was my concern in committee and it remains my concern. 
Unless we can demonstrate a very clear payback to the consumer 
for having these new licensing powers or licensing restrictions 
placed on players who currently do not have them and have not had 
them, and there have been no significant problems that cannot be 
dealt with through existing legislation, then we should not 
entertain adding a new level of bureaucracy to what is already 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even at the international level there is some question as to how 
long the need for licensing will be there if we are truly moving 
to global competition.  We feel it is a valid question to examine 
how long we will need the licensing regime at the international 
level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In general, my thrust is to let us make the current restrictions 
and legislation which is there today and surrounds this industry 
effective, instead of adding on new layers of bureaucracy to try 
to add new restrictions to the industry.  It is already doing 
quite well without it.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> It is necessary that 
the hon. member for Mercier make her amendment in writing and 
submit the amendment at the table. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, I now wish to speak to 
Motion No. 10, while my colleague writes out this amendment, which 
uses the same wording as Motion No. 11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the substance, this new provision is, in fact, an amendment 
to the wording in the initial bill.  But it is not merely 
technical.  Once again, consumers told us that, with the 
termination of monopolies over national service—that is what we 
are talking about, we are no longer talking about international 
service—there are problems with 9-1-1 service.  There are problems 
with telephone directories. 
There are problems with companies deciding to transfer subscribers 
to another company with no warning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is therefore a need to ensure what is known technically 
as interoperation.  But it is not just a question of interoperation 
of cables, whether they are fibre-optic or whatever.  It is a 
question of services.  Consumers are saying that what is needed is 
not just to facilitate interoperation, but to ensure a continued 
focus on public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at all the other clauses that give this clause 
meaning, what we see is that the CRTC will have authority to 
delegate to others, to a third party.  In order to ensure that this 
third party does not focus solely on efficiency, on reducing costs 
to a minimum, but that it also focuses on public interest, this 
must be spelled out. 
Otherwise, if it had not been spelled out that it was for the 
purpose of facilitating interoperation, it could have been said 
that in any event there was provision for it in the spirit of the 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, in taking this approach, we want to address public 
interest, the CRTC must be given the mandate, in this particular 
clause, of ensuring that there is a continued focus on public 
interest in the way the CRTC will manage or transfer to third 
parties this responsibility of administering databases.  This is 
extremely important.  There can be secrecy surrounding databases: 
looking after directories, operating a 9-1-1 service, or other 
services not yet available.  It is extremely important that public 
interest be included. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge my colleagues, from all parties in the House, to 
support this amendment, which adds something not to the CRTC's 
spirit but to its mandate in these particular cases.  These are 
cases affecting ordinary citizens. 
There is the need to look out for the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that there is no reason to object.  On the 
contrary, it seems to me that it would even be to the political 
advantage of all my colleagues to say that, in this particular 
instance, where we are naturally ensuring the best competition 
between businesses, we are not, at the same time, forgetting about 
members of the public, who are faced with the new situation of 
having to deal with several companies providing local, long 
distance and now international services.  They may well be 
receiving sales pitches in three different areas.  There will 
perhaps be problems with 9-1-1 service, with directories, with 
databases and other services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge my colleagues from all parties in the House to speak if 
they wish, but to be sure to support this amendment, which I think 
is essential.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The signal to liberalize, if, of course, it presumes we 
recognize that the economy is changing, is an extremely bad one 
unless accompanied by a greater interest in defending consumers, 
because these large companies exist only because of consumers; they 
are service companies.  We must therefore ensure that, in the 
upheaval surrounding the termination of monopolies, consumers at 
least can count on their interests not being abandoned.

<A NAME="LINK43">&nbsp;</A>

</I></B></P><P align=left>That Motion No. 10 be amended by adding after the word

<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we 
will certainly be interested to review the amendment put forward 
by the hon. member from the Bloc.  I think it is an interesting 
concept and we will be giving it full consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am particularly appreciative of the opportunity to speak to 
this amendment which has come forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impact of this part of the bill is very significant.  The 
concern which many of the presenters at the industry committee 
had pertained to this section of the proposed legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to this amendment the proposed legislation gave new, broad 
sweeping administrative powers to the CRTC which some witnesses 
referred to as a blank cheque or as being open ended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To quote from the proposed legislation, prior to the amendment, 
at subclause 46.1 of clause 6: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(1) The Commission may administer 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a)  numbering resources— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And it goes on to define what that means.  It continues: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) any other activities that the governor in council may 
prescribe that are related to the provision of telecommunications 
services by Canadian carriers. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was how the subclause read prior to the amendment.  At that 
stage the commission could administer any other activity related 
to the provision of telecommunications services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not too surprising that so many witnesses saw this as 
being a blank cheque to the regulator.  This is an open door to 
more regulation, not at all consistent with Reform's longstanding 
call for less government interference and less micro management 
of the telecommunications marketplace by the CRTC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, it is not consistent with the minister's statement 
concerning this legislation in the House on November 4 when he 
referred to this legislation as a step forward in the 
government's strategy to promote competition, innovation and 
growth in Canada's telecommunications industry.  He also stated 
that the objective of the legislation was to free Canada's 
telecommunications and information technology sectors to be 
competitive, dynamic industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should all take note that the majority of witnesses to the 
industry committee were also concerned about these broad sweeping 
powers being given to the regulator.  This kind of thing, where 
regulators can change the rules at any time in the middle of the 
game, chases players away.  It does not attract them.  The 
business interests in the telecommunications industry are no 
different and that was made abundantly clear to the industry 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not to cast aspersions on the hardworking individuals 
currently charged with the task of carrying out the regulations, 
it is simply a recognition of the nature of bureaucracies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is inherently easier for them to grow than to shrink and the 
open ended approach to the legislation, without this amendment, 
provided a whole new growth opportunity to the CRTC, a 
bureaucracy which in our view is already far too extensive.

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the amendment to clause 6 paragraph 46.1 address this 
point?  The amendment serves to clarify and define the new 
administrative powers of the CRTC.  I would have liked, though, 
to see it go even further in clarifying its administrative 
powers.  However the amendment is a move in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The restriction applied is that the CRTC may only consider using 
its new administrative powers when it can clearly be demonstrated 
that it would “facilitate the interoperation of Canadian 
telecommunications networks”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Telecommunications advancements have driven the changes we are 
all witnessing in this industry.  Competition has driven down 
prices, rewarded efficiency and stimulated new markets and 
innovation.  Some practices which were acceptable in the past are 
no longer practical.  Some common services carried out by the 
incumbent telephone companies may be better administered by a 
third party which serves all the Canadian telecommunications 
network of common Canadian carriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Long distance and local switch network competition creates a 
valid argument for a neutral third party to administer things 
like the North American numbering plan, which will manage the 
assignment and portability of area codes and telephone numbers. 
In other areas is the need for a third party to administer 
funding mechanisms by which long distance revenues of the various 
carriers contribute to the support of local switch network 
service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been suggested that some portion of common administrative 
functions concerning 911 or directory services might also some 
day be included as part of the third party administrative 
functions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These administrative third parties, if and when they are 
created, will be under the regulatory oversight of the CRTC. 
Therefore the amendment constrains the commission to only getting 
involved in administrative functions which will clearly serve to 
facilitate some common aspect of network interoperability per the 
kinds of examples given.  This is better than the wide open “any 
other activities” wording of the unamended version of the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out to the government, the CRTC and the industry another 
constraint which is applicable to the amendment.  Section 7 of 
the Telecommunication Act deals with Canadian telecommunications 
policy.  Item (f) in this section requires that the policy must 
foster increased reliance on market forces for the provision of 
telecommunications services and ensure that regulation where 
required is efficient and effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These new administrative bodies must be designed with management 
processes that reward efficiency and effectiveness.  This is 
doubly important to the industry as well because the legislation 
in clause 6, section 46.4, allows for those performing these 
delegated administrative functions on behalf of the industry to 
charge the industry participants for the services provided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ultimately, though, we recognize that these costs would be 
passed on to the consumer, which further underlines the 
commission's responsibility to build in competitive business 
models rather than government oriented models for those entities 
which perform the common telecommunications network functions. It 
would reward those who increase the quality of service for lower 
cost rather than those who would have bureaucracy grow and always 
spend the budget plus a bit more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, the amendment constrains the open ended blank cheque 
which concerned us and the industry when the minister first put 
forward the legislation.  It constrains the administrative powers 
of the CRTC and delegates it to only those areas which can 
demonstrably be shown to facilitate interoperation of the 
Canadian telecommunications network to move from a monopolistic 
environment to a more open ended and competitive model. 
Therefore I will be recommending that we support this amendment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am

</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I will talk about Motion No. 10 and the amendment.  As

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We are debating the 
group.  Because the group encompasses everything within it, we 
can be sufficiently broad in context that it will allow the hon. 
member for St. Albert to wax eloquent for at least another seven 
minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  I appreciate that clarification, Mr. 
Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 10 gives the CRTC wide latitude and almost unlimited 
powers, if not unlimited powers, regarding the regulation of 
these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make a point on the question of accountability. Who 
holds the CRTC accountable?  Being a quasi-judicial body we all 
know that it is not accountable to anybody other than its members 
who sit at the government's pleasure and can be replaced if it is 
felt that they are not fulfilling their obligations in a manner 
the government would deem appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw that last week when the chairman of the Canada Labour 
Relations Board was deemed to be participating in bad behaviour 
and now the government has taken action to remove him from his 
position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accountability is the issue.  Motion No. 10 talks about giving a 
group of unknown, unelected and unaccountable people complete and 
absolute authority over matters that have great importance to 
Canadians as they conduct modern ways of communicating through 
telephone and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accountability is near and dear to my heart.  I think of what 
happened, for example, in NavCan.  The federal government, in its 
wisdom or lack thereof, decided that it would create an 
organization.  We thought it was privatization.  It was called 
privatization by the government.  When we looked at the situation 
we learned that it was nothing close to privatization in any way, 
shape or form.  Basically it was government by another format, 
government without accountability.  That is exactly what we have 
in Motion No. 10.  The CRTC has government without 
accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, if I can use NavCan as an example, the government set up 
that organization on an uncompetitive basis.  I give the Minister 
of Industry some credit, because Teleglobe has now been 
privatized and is allowed to operate in a competitive 
environment.  NavCan was one of the bungles by the Department of 
Transport which decided that privatization did not mean 
competition.  As a result we see an organization with none of the 
constrictions of having to live up to a competitive environment. 
In fact it has been given a monopoly in perpetuity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those types of decisions being made by government are totally 
inappropriate.  I am glad to see that the same has not happened 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also look at NavCan and see that the competitive environment 
does not apply because it has been given a perpetual monopoly.  I 
wonder what kinds of accountability have been put in place. 
Unfortunately I see none. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Motion No. 10 we are seeing much of the same thing.  There is 
very little in the way of accountability.  When we take a look at 
NavCan we find out there are no shareholders because it is a not 
for profit organization. It has no shareholders to be accountable 
to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is on the board of directors?  The airlines and the players 
are on the board, but they are accountable to someone other than 
the people who have to pay.  The Canadian travelling public is 
being taxed to pay for the navigation service and has absolutely 
no say whatsoever in the decision making of the organization. 
We have no say in the decision making of the CRTC in Motion No. 
10.  Therein lies the relevance of the argument that sometimes 
accountability is very important in this country.  Accountability 
is very important in democracy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is giving the CRTC these wide ranging powers, and 
I quoted them earlier, to determine any matter and make any order 
with respect to databases.  It is pretty far ranging.  It is this 
need for more accountability that I think has got to be inherent 
in the process as the government looks at alternative service 
deliveries, this being one in Teleglobe Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea of privatization of the organization I think is very 
good.  That is where we are moving in this interconnected world 
in which we live.  We need to open up the business which the 
government has been in for so many years and has become stifled 
with over-regulation and stifled with bureaucratic 
administration. It is more than time to take these issues and 
allow the competitive forces to winnow out the waste, 
mismanagement and the inefficiencies to ensure that the Canadian 
public are given the best opportunities, the best service and the 
best quality at the best price.  That can never happen within 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we continue to give organizations such as the CRTC these 
wide ranging, unfettered powers which allow them the entire scope 
to dictate, enforce and impose their own vision of what they 
think the market wants, I sometimes have a great deal of 
difficulty agreeing with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the amendment put forth by the member for Mercier 
which says that it has to be consistent with the benefits of the 
Canadian public or words to that effect.  I understand that it 
puts some constraint on the CRTC.  I think the motion therefore 
is well deserving of its merit.  It is time that we brought some 
of these organizations to account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fundamental debate of accountability is growing today. 
People are wrestling with how we can build that in to ensure that 
the government's programs and decisions truly reflect what the 
public wants and are not ossified in a situation where we are 
stuck with yesterday's decisions even though the opportunities 
and technology allow for far better ways to provide the same 
service to the general public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what I am concerned about.  I used to be a small 
business person and service, quality and price were always 
important to my clientele.  As far as I am aware, these things 
are important to every Canadian who wants better service and 
better quality at less price, if that is at all possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned about this blanket sweeping authority that we are 
giving to the CRTC in Motion No. 10.  It is time that we try to 
rein in these commissions which have been given this blanket 
authority to ensure that they are accountable also in some way, 
shape or form.  They have to listen to people.  They have an 
obligation to ensure that they are effective in the way that they 
do their business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what I am saying about accountability.  It is all 
pervasive.  It is time that we looked at ways to ensure that the 
CRTC and other organizations meet the public demand.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to stand and discuss a couple of the amendments in 
this debate that really are of concern to us as Progressive 
Conservatives.  I will speak later at length on the bill but I 
want to address the two amendments in particular that we are 
concerned about.  The first one was addressed by the previous 
speaker.  We share the same concerns about power given to the 
CRTC and other regulatory bodies and also to the governor in 
council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our concern about the first amendment we were to deal with was 
the proposed licensing for all carriers. 
The committee heard many witnesses who argued that this was an 
additional and unnecessary burden placed on the national industry 
which was already functioning well without it.  Again, more 
burden, more paperwork, and it contradicts the whole purpose of 
the bill which is to privatize, commercialize and decentralize.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will now move on to the second amendment about the governor 
in council which in the original bill was allowed to prescribe 
changes in any area as it relates to the provision of 
telecommunication services— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  With apologies to 
the hon. member, I have already asked other members to stick to 
the amendment that is being debated right now, which is No. 10. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to make some 
comments on the remarks made by the previous speaker.  I 
understand the the member for St. Albert always wishes to 
discredit various tribunals and legislative bodies that we have 
in the country.  However, we heard very clearly from the users, 
the stakeholders, the people who will be involved in reducing or 
eliminating the monopoly of Teleglobe Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to know the rules for having a level playing 
field.  Although I understand his objective, I do not think it 
was relevant to the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another item is the amendment to the motion which states that in 
the public interest, each of the bodies or tribunals that we have 
set up, whether it is for telecommunications or other sectors 
across Canada, part of their mandate is to act in the public 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern with the amendment to the motion would be to call 
into question if the public interest should be held in this 
motion only and not in the rest of the act.  As I stated earlier, 
each one of the administrative bodies are there to act in the 
public interest.  My concern would be that the perception is 
given that the CRTC does not act in the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that the hon. member for Mercier meant that. 
However, it could be implied that the concern is for the public 
interest only in that section.  Therefore, I have a great concern 
that the comment is made only in that section.  Maybe we need to 
make sure and to reconfirm administrative acts and tribunals so 
that it is very clear that it is being done in the public 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a little unsure about the point made by the member from 
the Conservative Party.  I think we have gone beyond the points 
he was trying to make.  Therefore, I cannot respond. 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to make a few contributions to the 
amendment to the government amendment made by the member for 
Mercier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically, the purpose of that amendment is to ensure that when 
the CRTC carries out its operations that it does so in a way 
which will facilitate the interoperation of Canadian 
telecommunications networks and also acts in the public interest. 
We plainly have an ideological dispute in place as to the 
function of regulation and of operating markets and how we make 
sure that markets operate in the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally, markets will operate in the public interest. However, 
in other instances they will not and as a government and as a 
people we have to be prepared to ensure that markets which 
allocate resources and products in our community and in the 
country do so in a way which is in harmony with the public 
interest.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no sense in having an economy that works contrary to 
the public interest.  One of the problems of the position taken 
by the speaker on behalf of the Reform Party, the member for St. 
Albert, of course, is that he would permit ideology to dictate 
common sense.  We surely cannot in any sensible debate allow 
theory that does not work to apply to a situation in a way that 
would be contrary to the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think what we have is a situation in which Teleglobe and 
indeed the telecommunications industry as a whole have exciting 
opportunities both here at home and abroad.  It will be faced 
with important challenges as the world market is opened up and 
the Canadian market is further opened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is everybody's hope that Teleglobe survives, thrives, does 
well and creates more jobs in Canada and more profits that will 
of course be taxable in Canada and indeed provides a good service 
to not only Canadian users of telephones, indeed almost every 
Canadian, but also is competitive in the world economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the context of that and in the context of moving into what is 
unchartered territory, we have to ensure that the Canadian public 
interest is also protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take the point of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Industry that we should ensure that all regulation be in the 
public interest.  Of course, that is true.  However, I do not 
think it hurts to remind us that when we do regulate, when we do 
have an overseeing of agency which is designed to ensure that the 
industry in question being regulated is in fact operating in the 
public interest, it does not hurt us to be reminded that that 
agency should function in that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, flowing again from the comments of the member for St. 
Albert, his views seem to be that regulation is never in the 
public interest.  If only for him we might have an amendment 
which reminds Canadians that we have the public interest at heart 
when we look at making sure that markets work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the instance that markets work effectively for Canadians, 
then we can leave them alone.  We perhaps do not need to regulate 
very much the market for the buying and selling of bicycles. When 
we are dealing with something of this sort, we do have to ensure 
that Canadians are protected.  That is the purpose behind this 
amendment, and I support it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will be speaking to the amendment to Motion No. 10 which deals 
with the addition of the public interest phraseology into the 
amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I applaud the member from the Bloc in bringing this forward.  I 
think it is an interesting initiative and in general I support 
the idea that we need to make sure these quasi-judicial bodies 
like the CRTC are in fact operating in the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think she has some legitimate concerns to question whether or 
not they actually are.  I am not sure that this is the best way 
to deal with that concern, but I do applaud her for bringing it 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why I share her concern regarding whether the CRTC is actually 
operating in the public interest is not so much really with the 
telecommunications side, but I certainly do share her concern in 
general when it applies to the CRTC on the broadcast side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, we have a decision coming out of the CRTC in the 
next week or two where again they will be ruling on the ability 
for single faith channels to be broadcast within Canada.  Whereas 
just recently they did approve a Playboy channel to be broadcast 
in Canada, they are eliminating single faith channels from being 
broadcast in Canada, continually turning down that decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be very interesting to see if the CRTC will actually 
allow those Canadians who are pursuing this kind of broadcast 
channel to be allowed to have access to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the kind of accountability that I believe the member for 
St. Albert was calling for, accountable back to the people.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To say that we are always operating in the public interest, as 
per the member's motion here, I think that can be demonstrated to 
not always be the case by these quasi-judicial bodies. People who 
are part of the public need to have some input into the process 
to say what is in their best interest. It seems to be that there 
has been some disconnection from the public interest as expressed 
by the public and what is actually happening here. I hope that we 
see some change from the CRTC particularly having to do with the 
broadcast side of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we do need to make sure that the public interest is part of 
the CRTC's mandate.  I concur with the member from the other side 
though that by adding the public interest in this clause you 
would tend to want to add the public interest to every single 
clause in the entire act.  I would think it should be implied 
that the CRTC is acting in the public interest throughout the 
act.  To put it in one section and not have it in all the others 
tends to suggest that the other sections are not acting in the 
public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that maybe this is not the best way to approach 
it but I do concur with the member's intent.  Beyond just adding 
the words “public interest”, what we really need and for a long 
time what this party has been calling for is a complete review of 
how the CRTC exercises its decisions that are in the public 
interest.  There is some substantial breakdown there that needs 
to be dealt with on behalf of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we are primarily calling for in relation to this 
motion on the floor today. Again, I applaud the member but I 
think this might not be the best approach.  We would call for a 
comprehensive review of the CRTC's mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I understand the 
hon. member for Mercier has already spoken to this group of 
motions, but the Chair will accept the member for Mercier 
speaking again because the amendment to the motion was made at 
the conclusion of the member's dissertation.

<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not 
want to waste the House's time, but simply to respond to some of 
the arguments I have heard to the effect that inclusion of the 
public interest in this clause might suggest that it does not apply 
elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to simply point out that, when the government 
amendment states “if it determines that to do so would facilitate 
the interoperation of Canadian television networks”, I believe that 
“facilitating the interoperation of Canadian television 
networks” 
is also a general mandate of the CRTC.  Yet they take the trouble 
to mention facilitating interoperation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since a specific mandate is given, which is one of the seven 
elements of the Canadian telecommunications strategy, I find—and 
I believe there are a number of us that do—that it is not enough 
to state that interoperation must be facilitated, in areas 
affecting services to individuals in a changing world of 
communications.  It is also important to look after the public 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is a risk to the public interest, there is also one 
for interoperation. We do not want to suggest that, elsewhere, it 
is not necessary to facilitate interoperation of networks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that this amendment is fully justified and I would 
appreciate it if the government side were also concerned about the 
public interest.

attention of the Chair that an amendment was submitted by the hon. 
member for Mercier, which was moved to the end of the debate for a 
decision as to whether you would accept it or not.  The amendment 
addressed inclusion of a definition of basic services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You appeared to say just now that, if the hon. member for 
Mercier removed the last part of her resolution, you were prepared 
to accept it.  I would ask you therefore to follow up on that, 
please, because the hon. member has agreed to remove the last part 
of her resolution. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I thank the hon. 
member for Joliette for bringing that to the attention of the 
Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion which was originally put by the member for Mercier 
included three parts.  There was some discussion as to whether or 
not the motion would be deemed acceptable if it were amended by 
the member to remove the third part.  To do so we would have had 
to have had agreement of all hon. members because the motion was 
changed for technical reasons.  That agreement was not 
forthcoming.  Therefore the motion was out of order.  The 
previous ruling that the motion was out of order will not be 
changed.  The motion remains out of order.

believe that the House has been asked to consent on acceptance or 
refusal of the motion.  I do not believe that it was done at that

through you, the consent of the House so that this motion may be 
moved. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> The Chair was at that 
time trying to accommodate the member for Mercier on the motion. 
For the Chair to be able to accommodate the amendment would have 
required the consent of all parties.  That consent was not 
forthcoming.  Therefore the Chair is not able to accept the 
motion.  The motion is out of order.  That is the end of it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Telecommunications are the nerve impulses of the global economy 
in the emerging information society.  Information of all sorts 
from all areas span the globe in a matter of seconds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Changes in communications over the last number of years have 
been very rapid.  No nation can survive without it.  No nation 
can hope to compete in the global economy without the most up to 
date telecommunications systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The telecommunications sector is vital to the Canadian economy. 
It is the key to our international competitiveness and an 
important source of high quality jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only did employment in telecommunications increase 15% 
between 1994-95 but the sector also generated revenues of some 
$22 billion.  The sector accounts for over 145,000 high quality 
jobs and 3.4% of the GDP. It will be our key growth sector in the 
economy of the next century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much of that growth is due to the liberalization in domestic 
telecommunications that began some 13 years ago and has already 
greatly benefited Canadians and Canadian telecommunications 
companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The liberalization began with the licensing of competitive 
cellular telephone service in 1984.  It moved forward with the 
privatization of Teleglobe in 1987 and Telesat in 1992.  It 
advanced again with the introduction of long distance competition 
in 1992 and the passage of the new Telecommunications Act in 
1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a little over a decade, Canada has moved from a highly 
regulated telecommunications environment to one where competition 
can flourish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past three and a half years this government has 
continued to remove barriers to competition within Canada, 
modernizing the legislative framework that governs information 
and communication technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This liberalization can serve as a model for countries that have 
yet to make the transition from monopoly to competition based 
services.  It has equipped Canada with one of the world's most 
competitive policy frameworks as well as an independent 
telecommunications regulator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has also stimulated the development of new products and 
services, more consumer choice, increased economic growth and job 
creation, considering the licensing of new wireless services, 
personal communications services in 1995 and local multipoint 
communications services in 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw a launch of Canada's first local multipoint 
communications systems site just last spring.  LMCS is a wireless 
broad band system capable of carrying basic and advanced 
communications services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will enable Canadians to take full advantage of the 
information highway and offers a wide array of multimedia 
services.  It will soon provide Canadian consumers with a 
competitive alternative to existing cable and telephone services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The companies providing LMCS expect to invest over $1 billion 
and create 8,000 jobs within the next five years.  Few would 
argue that the liberalization of basic telecommunications 
services has benefited Canadians but Canada is not the only 
nation moving to liberalize its telecommunications industry.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, we are part of a world-wide trend.  The bill now before 
the House extends the liberalization begun in our domestic 
telecommunications industry to the international arena.  It 
clears the way for the implementation of an agreement that Canada 
concluded last February, the GATS agreement on basic 
telecommunications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the changes can be implemented administratively.  Others 
require legislation.  The bill provides the legal framework 
needed to implement the changes that require legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to acknowledge the contribution to this bill by the House 
Standing Committee on Industry.  This process resulted in 
amendments which improve a good bill.  I must compliment all of 
the participants for their forthright and direct debate on 
putting their points forward and assisting in moulding this bill 
into the bill that is before the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government consulted extensively with industry and the 
provinces before negotiating the agreement and numerous witnesses 
voiced their opinions during the committee's review.  The 
agreement eliminates many restrictions in the international 
telecommunications industry, liberalizing trade and investment. 
It covers basic telecommunications services, which include voice 
and data but not broadcasting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the agreement, Canada committed to eliminating monopolies 
in the two areas still closed to competition:  overseas telephone 
service and fixed satellite services.  The bill therefore amends 
the Telecommunications Act and the Teleglobe Canada 
Reorganization and Divestiture Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Teleglobe's monopoly will end October 1, 1998.  Telesat's 
monopoly will end March 1, 2000.  Canada also agreed to remove 
foreign ownership restrictions in satellite earth stations and 
the landing of international submarine cables.  This agreement 
will benefit both Canadian telecommunications companies and 
consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Telecommunications companies will benefit through greater access 
to important markets.  For example, the agreement gives Canadian 
companies full access to the U.S. market in basic 
telecommunications services.  The use of reciprocity tests by the 
U.S. Federal Communications Commission will be severely 
curtailed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian companies will be able to invest up to 100% in 
telecommunications firms in many foreign markets.  Canadian 
companies will also gain new access to the markets of developing 
nations.  Another benefit is access to the WTO dispute settlement 
process which provides the safeguards needed to ensure that 
countries live up to their commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provision of telecommunications services will be governed by 
clear rules and disputes between WTO members will be resolved in 
a timely manner through this effective and timely process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill also strengthens our ability to keep pace with a 
rapidly changing telecommunications environment.  The CRTC will 
ensure that international telecommunications carriers are 
licensed according to Canadian rules and regulations in a manner 
that is consistent with WTO rules so as to ensure a level playing 
field for all market participants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as domestic liberalization of telecommunications has 
benefited Canadians and Canadian telecommunications companies, we 
can expect to see similar benefits arising from the GATS 
agreement.  The agreement is expected eventually to result in 
less expensive international long distance telephone rates as 
competition increases in the overseas long distance market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will also stimulate telecommunications investment around the 
world, generating new opportunities for Canadian 
telecommunications service providers and equipment manufacturers. 
Not only will Canadian telecommunications companies be able to 
compete for a piece of the international telecommunications pie, 
but the pie will get bigger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will produce more jobs and economic growth for Canada and 
support a strong, innovative domestic telecommunications sector, 
one that will deliver more and better services to Canadians at 
lower costs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two areas of concern for Canada were not affected by this 
agreement.  Canada took an explicit reservation to allow us to 
maintain our current overall foreign investment regulations in 
telecommunications.  This investment regime has seen major 
foreign firms such as AT&T and Sprint make significant 
investments in Canadian firms while ensuring that they remain 
Canadian owned and controlled.  In addition, Canada has no 
ownership restrictions for resellers which compares well with the 
current situation in Japan, Europe and the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian culture is also protected as the agreement does not 
cover broadcasting, which continues to be covered by the 
Broadcasting Act.  One of the reasons broadcasting was excluded 
was to ensure the protection of Canadian culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The GATS agreement on basic telecommunications follows closely 
on the Information Technology Agreement which liberalized trade 
and information technology equipment.  Under that agreement, 40 
governments agreed to phase out all tariffs on computers, 
software, telecom products and semiconductors beginning July 1, 
1997 and eliminate them by the year 2000.  These 40 economies 
account for 85% of the world's annual $500 billion U.S. trade in 
IT products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Information technology plays a key role in our economy.  These 
products are the building blocks of most industrial and business 
processes.  Canadian users of information technology products are 
expected to benefit as tariff barriers fall.  Together these two 
agreements provide a springboard for economic growth and 
development in the next century.  They cover international 
business worth over a trillion dollars U.S.  Their combined 
effect will spur telecommunications investments around the world, 
increasing opportunities for Canadian telecommunications service 
providers and equipment manufacturers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only are they good for Canadians and Canadian companies, 
they contribute to international development by making 
information products and telecommunications services more 
affordable.  Canada's open and competitive telecommunications 
market has produced highly competitive Canadian companies which 
are well prepared to take advantage of the new business 
opportunities created by these agreements.  This is essential for 
Canada's continued competitiveness and economic health because, 
as much as we have accomplished, other countries are challenging 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New communications and information technologies are remaking the 
world around us.  If we do not want Canada to be left behind, we 
have to prepare ourselves for the new reality.  Canada has long 
been a world leader in providing its citizens with access to 
broadcasting and basic telecommunication services, such as the 
telephone.  In fact, we have virtually universal access to these 
core networks and services, with safeguards to ensure that 
Canadians retain access to these services in a competitive 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The combined forces of technology and trade liberalization are 
opening new frontiers, creating challenges that we can barely 
imagine.  The opportunities are there for Canada to seize, but 
only if we move decisively and quickly to take advantage of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada will benefit as a result of the GATS agreement.  I urge 
the House to move on this bill which is needed to implement the 
agreement with all due speed.  I thank my fellow colleagues for 
their great contribution in debate, in committee and in this 
House to make sure that this bill gets passed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the whole, I believe the bill makes some positive changes 
within the telecommunications industry, both within Canada and 
internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate that within the industry committee specific changes 
were made to the legislation which allowed for some key 
improvements that were badly needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I speak to the specifics of the legislation, I believe it 
would be wise to paint the context within which this legislation 
fits.  By doing this we will be better able to understand its 
significance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no longer news to say we are in the information age or the 
information revolution.  Alvin Toffler, in his book “The Third 
Wave”, 15 years ago foresaw the forces thrusting us into the 
information age.  I would suggest that we have only just entered 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The advances in information technologies, both in computing and 
telecommunications, will continue to reshape our work, our social 
structures and generally our lives for some years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have just begun to experience the impacts of the 
information age.  We are still developing new coping and 
information processing norms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some examples are that we no longer telephone a place to reach a 
person.  Increasingly we simply call the person and connect 
directly with him or her.  This can happen anywhere in North 
America.  In fact, it can happen in most places in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Voice and data mailboxes have removed time dependency on 
conversation.  Magazines have gone from 10 national magazines to 
hundreds, if not thousands, on news, sports and specialty issues. 
Television has gone from a two to five channel universe to a 200 
to 500 channel universe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The numbers of those accessing the Internet is growing 
exponentially.  With new information comes new ideas and in turn 
new data information packages result.  Globally we are 
overwhelmed with information inputs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard some years back that an engineer who graduates today 
from a four-year undergraduate program will be required to 
complete his degree effectively three more times in a 30 year 
career just to stay current. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also remember a statistic of some years back that if you took 
all the information in the world today and assembled it, 20 years 
from today it would amount to 3% of the total. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opportunities in this information age and information 
explosion are as significant as the social pressures it produces. 
The information age is transforming our world.  Truly, it is a 
global phenomenon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ability to move information around the globe at the speed of 
light is improving daily.  The digitization of voice, data and 
raw broadcast information, combined with fibre, wireless and 
satellite transmission technologies, multiplexing and compression 
techniques are making government policy shaped in the 
monopolistic earlier days of telephony and broadcast increasingly 
obsolete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government protectionist policies which attempt to stop or 
contain information at the border are becoming increasingly 
ineffective.  Attempts by governments such as ours to continue to 
separate telecommunications information from broadcast 
information will become increasingly ludicrous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As telecom and broadcast technologies converge through 
digitization, common transmission and delivery media, the ability 
to separate legislation for broadcast bits of data from 
telecommunications bits of data in transmission and delivery 
facilities will become unworkable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thankfully, Canadian technology in telecommunications and 
broadcast is state of the art in the world.  We have the 
opportunity to benefit from our product expertise like few other 
nations in the world.  A strong, proactive, Canadian pursuit of 
global markets is the best line of defence for Canadian 
sovereignty at home when compared to the old protectionist 
approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is within these realities that we are considering the modest 
changes proposed by Bill C-17.  The primary purpose of Bill C-17 
is to allow for the gradual winding down of the monopoly 
positions held by Teleglobe and Telesat.  This will allow others 
to legally carry long distance telephone traffic into and out of 
Canada.  Conversely, as part of the World Trade Organization and 
the GATT agreements, it will allow Canadian companies to more 
fully participate in international long distance markets.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill simply keeps us in the game and is more of a cautious, 
follow the leader approach than anything demonstrating a longer 
term vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has long been committed to increased 
competition in the telecommunications industries.  We support the 
move to an open marketplace which is not hindered by the expense 
and overhead of undue government interference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In general the legislation is improved by the committee process 
and the amendment today moves the industry in the right 
direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though 69 countries representing 90% of the current 
international long distance market signed on to the WTO 
agreement, Bill C-17 still calls for new international licensing 
which basically is there to protect Canadian incumbents from the 
new international players who may choose to provide service to 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conversely, these international entities will also place 
protective licensing regimes in their own countries.  Therefore 
we do not have true global competition but rather mutually 
agreeable licensing regimes between countries, usually intended 
to protect incumbent carriers in each country.   The consumer 
would be better served where true reciprocity and open 
participation existed rather than international licensing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Technological advancements may eclipse licensing requirements 
and render them obsolete within a few years anyway.  Even though 
I believe a sunset clause, which would provide an opportunity to 
review the licensing regime through reciprocal international 
agreements some time in the future, would send a stimulating 
signal to Canadian industry to be competitively aggressive at 
home and abroad, this would in turn serve to strengthen the 
companies and better serve the Canadian consumer in the long run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the government would not consider the inclusion of 
a sunset clause.  Thankfully though, due to the work done in the 
industry committee, the licensing regime is now restricted only 
to international long distance carriers rather than a new 
licensing regime for both domestic and international service 
providers as called for in the original legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second component of the proposed legislation applies more to 
the domestic market operation than to the international long 
distance marketplace.  The change I am referring to is the new 
administrative oversight powers granted to the CRTC by the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me make it clear that the Reform Party supports the 
efficient operation of the marketplace and a regulatory 
environment that promotes competition.  Thus, with the 
competition in the domestic long distance market and the 
development of competition in the local switched network market, 
the allowance for some measure of third party administrative 
function for common network interoperability makes some sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, it makes sense that a third party administration of 
the North American telephone numbering program rather than the 
incumbent telephone companies be responsible for this activity. 
There will likely be other administrative entities established to 
address other network interoperability concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CRTC is given the power to establish and oversee these 
entities.  Clearly the refinement to the original legislation 
which allows for broad new sweeping powers to the CRTC has been 
addressed and the administrative powers are now restricted to 
issues of network interoperability.  Without this change we could 
not have supported the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even with the restricted administrative powers granted to the 
CRTC by the legislation, we would encourage the government to do 
the following.  First, it should hold to its stated preference 
for less regulation and only entertain administration functions 
on behalf of the industry when the industry calls for the 
administrative body to take on the work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, consistent with section 7 of the Telecommunications Act, 
it should set a management structure in place which rewards 
efficiency and cost effectiveness for any administrative body 
that is established.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, it should ensure as per the legislation that the costs of 
the administrative functions are borne by the industry and not 
the taxpayer.  This should be done on a pay for services basis by 
participating industry players. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The end of the Teleglobe monopoly will not only allow 
competition from abroad to place downward pressure on overseas 
callings but will enable Canadian companies to enter the huge 
global marketplace, which is estimated to be worth $800 billion 
as compared to our $18 billion domestically.  The legislation 
will result in the end of the Teleglobe monopoly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill originally called for a domestic and international 
licensing regime.  In committee Reform pushed hard to limit the 
licensing regime to international telecommunications services so 
we would not see the reregulation of domestic services.  These 
changes were made in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also pushed hard to limit the blank cheque powers granted to 
the CRTC in the original bill.  The clauses in question were 
amended to better define the CRTC powers so they are not expanded 
from the current jurisdiction but can only delegate necessary 
functions to facilitate the interoperation of the Canadian 
telecommunications network. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is a step in the right direction in so far as it 
promotes competition and partially removes outdated foreign 
ownership restrictions that date back to the protectionist world 
of old.  However, more work could be done in eliminating the 
foreign ownership restrictions for Canadian telecommunications 
carriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While positive to an extent the bill is not far sighted in terms 
of where the telecommunications industry is going but is catching 
up to today's realities.  Increased globalization will soon cause 
additional pressures on our domestic telecommunications policy. 
It is too bad Bill C-17 does not look further ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-17, though imperfect, should be passed for the benefits 
it brings forth, which will enable the Canadian industry to 
better prepare for an ever changing marketplace.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, at the time 
of second reading, the Bloc announced its support for the bill, 
which, need I point out, puts an end to the monopoly enjoyed by the 
international telecommunications carrier Teleglobe and to Telesat's 
monopoly over Canadian satellites. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did so because in its initial bill, the government 
increased the powers of the minister and the CRTC in international 
telecommunications now that restrictions have been lifted and it 
took the opportunity to dust off the Telecommunications Act in the 
light of the new conditions of this lifting of restrictions in the 
domestic market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between second reading, report stage and third reading the 
government yielded.  Despite some concerns and reservations we will 
support the bill.  Since the end of Teleglobe's monopoly was 
announced some time ago and the company itself, whose head office 
is in Montreal, sought the end of its monopoly, we will support the 
bill at third reading, although we have many concerns.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately, to reach this point, the government, and we will 
encourage it to continue on the same path, had some difficulties, 
which we must acknowledge, in negotiations with the World Trade 
Organization.  It continues to insist on a majority of Canadian 
ownership of national telecommunications, although the majority has 
shrunk and can be circumvented in many ways through corporate 
ownership with the majority of shares of Canadian companies owned 
by American or other foreign companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I will take the opportunity to express my concerns 
and tell you that I and the Bloc will use all the means at our 
disposal to ensure that Canada does not let itself slide down the 
slippery slope to total deregulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should say right off that the Bloc Quebec sorely regrets 
Quebec's lack of powers in the fields of communications and 
telecommunications.  The Supreme Court dashed all our hopes, 
although history shows that Quebec was at the forefront in the late 
1930s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, since we have no direct powers, we cannot act 
directly.  I would also say that perhaps we are even more concerned 
about what the Telecommunications Act calls Canadian sovereignty, 
because it is unfortunately through this that Quebec sovereignty 
can be protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard optimistic speeches on the liberalization of 
telecommunications, the impact of deregulation and our confidence in our 
large corporations. I admire large corporations like Teleglobe and 
Nortel, and their entrepreneurial spirit, but at the same time I do not 
want to overlook the fact that Canada is dwarfed by the United States 
and that, as dynamic and promising as it may be, Teleglobe remains a 
minor player on the North American and international markets. Teleglobe 
is undoubtedly a dynamic company, but this does not mean nothing can go 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The telecommunications market is expanding, if not booming. And 
what we are going through in this area is similar to what was 
experienced during the industrial revolution at the turn of the century. 
In such a booming market, there can be fierce competition but it cannot 
last because large corporations have this natural tendency to try to 
make a deal one way or another and try to make it legal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bear in mind that the first consumer actions in response to the 
industrial revolution were aimed at preventing trusts, at preventing 
collusion between big companies. I am not saying this is wrong. There is 
no right or wrong in economics, only market forces. And market forces 
are ruthless. If you want to be part of the game, you have to be in the 
game. But when the market in question is a public services market, the 
lawmaker cannot assume that consumers will be well served by competition 
and—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on 
a point of order.  If this bill is really important to the 
government, I think the least that we could expect is quorum.  I 
think if you look, the government does not have quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Resuming debate. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for 
his intent, although I must say this threw me off a bit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was saying that the first actions taken by consumers in the early 
1900s were against trusts, against this kind of collusion between large 
corporations. It is not that they are bad; they are part of the market 
and are striving to be the strongest possible. 
When the market in question is a public services market and one as 
important as the telecommunications market, the government must maintain 
if not increase its power to ensure—and I quote a portion of section 
7 of the Canadian Telecommunications Act and I reiterate that I would 
very much like it to be Quebec telecommunications—that this 
Telecommunications Act is essential to protect the sovereignty of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ought therefore to be extremely vigilant. The remarks I have 
heard about reviewing the role of the CRTC are cause for concern. Of 
course, there are aspects of the commission that may seem irksome. One 
may not agree with its direction, but the fact remains that it plays a 
crucial role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of the concerns I will outline, the Bloc Quebecois will 
support Bill C-17. 
While we support this bill, it must be pointed out that full 
liberalization of international telecommunications will represent a 
major challenge, for Teleglobe in particular. Let me tell you that this 
is an area where employees fear for their jobs. The government may have 
guaranteed that the head office would remain in Montreal and guaranteed 
the pension fund, but employees fear for their jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can say that, for the longest time, Teleglobe, which is 
considered a flagship of the telecommunications industry in Canada, was 
a publicly owned corporation, a public service fully owned by the 
government. As such, it made several major discoveries. Its engineering 
team was renowned. Naturally, privatization opened new doors, but it 
should be pointed out that it was a flagship telecommunications 
corporation and that it become one when it was a crown corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our concerns have to do with the proposed amendments to the 
Telecommunications Act, and the lot of consumers in particular. With 
this bill, the government does more than give Teleglobe its freedom, so 
to speak, or put an end to a monopoly. 
It is a freedom not without risk, but it is the choice of the company 
and of the government. It is a choice that was difficult not to make, 
given the international context and the negotiations at the World Trade 
Organization.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, in the original draft, the government also seized the 
opportunity to review the powers granted to the CRTC and give it the 
additional power to issue licences, according to various classes, to all 
telecommunications service providers. However, somewhere along the line, 
at committee stage, the government withdrew the power it wanted to give 
the CRTC. 
It did so because major national telecommunications companies, such as 
Bell and AT&T, came and expressed concern that we were trying to do too 
much. They said that the CRTC already had all the necessary powers, that 
it was not good to pile layer upon layer of regulations, and that things 
were fine the way they were. I also heard the CRTC representative say 
that even if the CRTC had the power to require licences in respect of 
each class, it did not mean that such power would be used from the very 
beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seemed to us to make real sense to have the CRTC hold this 
power, should relations between national telecommunications businesses, 
telephone companies and consumers deteriorate. Also, it might be felt 
that the problems were too enormous, and that the resellers who, until 
now, were not subject to the regulations, were assuming a major role. 
So, it was a good idea to have the CRTC retain the power to require 
licenses from companies interested in providing local and long distance 
telephone services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The good thing with licenses is that consumers know exactly what to 
expect. Currently, the situation is very confusing for consumers. 
Telephone services have become essential services. Since people have not 
given up their telephone services in spite of the rate increases, it can 
be said that such services are now truly essential. 
A person living on their own, aged 70 or 80—or 56—and whose 
family is not nearby, even if they are not ill, but all the more so 
if they are, views a telephone with its 9-1-1 and 4-1-1 numbers as 
absolutely essential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have observed, and what consumers have told us—and 
this was the Consumers' Association of Canada and the Association 
des consommateurs du Québec—was that they first became aware of 
the termination of monopolies, of so-called liberalization and the 
benefits of competition, when they were charged higher rates for 
basic residential services, which had tended to drop.  That, then, 
is a real concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-17, the government has a provision, which we support 
and on which we commend it as well, which is the clause allowing 
the creation of a fund to which all providers must contribute and 
which will make it possible to ensure basic telephone services.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there is a snag, a big one that I have tried to remedy, 
which is that basic telephone service is not defined in Bill C-17 
or in the Telecommunications Act, and this poses a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as, under the circumstances, I want Teleglobe to be happy 
with the conditions imposed on it for competing in the 
international market and going to the U.S., so it is important that 
private consumers, those relying on the telephone as an essential 
service, not be powerless when faced with rate increases and 
scaled-down basic services.  This is why I wanted to see the CRTC 
at least obliged to define basic service. 
As I was unable to achieve that here, I will try elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will have to be a debate at the CRTC on what constitutes 
basic telephone services, because this affects ordinary private 
citizens, who are now lost among the benefits of competition, all 
the expensive advertising they receive for various local, 
long-distance and, probably soon, international telephone 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am saying is that it seems to me that this gives the 
Minister of Industry—not only he is the Minister of Industry but, 
with the reform of that department, he is also responsible for 
administering the Consumer Protection Act—additional obligations. 
In addition to being able to issue orders in council aimed at the CRTC 
in order to promote competition, the minister can also use such orders 
to strike a balance between liberalization, services to consumers and 
the cost of these services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, consumer representatives told us in committee that the 
only effects of competition they have seen so far are increases in core 
services. I will give you a concrete example: the increase in monthly 
local telephone rates, for each city, in 1992—I will start with 
Montreal—was $13.70. The rate today with the increase allowed is 
$21.30. This is a rather large increase. The proposed increase is $22 
effective January 1, 1998 and $27 by the year 2002. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have been told by the CRTC is that consumers are to be 
compensated for such increases through lower long distance rates. 
What consumer associations and other institutions told us—and I asked 
a question about this in committee, but I did not receive a satisfactory 
answer—is that to qualify for a reduction in long distance rates, they 
must first spend $40 on such calls. This will not benefit the people who 
have the greatest needs and whose income is the lowest. It is true that 
this benefits large users and companies, but the small consumer, the 
ordinary citizen with a low income who needs this service has to be 
protected. This is our role here in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberalization is fine, but it should not be at any cost and under 
any conditions. This is what we have to be careful about. 
This is why during this Parliament you will certainly see me rise, as 
long as I am my party's critic in this area, to speak not only about 
business development, which is very important, about the creation of 
companies, small and medium-size, which is also very important, but also 
to speak for the consumer. It is only by doing this that we can create 
the conditions required for a humane society, where many people are 
already being excluded and where the gap between the rich and the poor 
is getting wider. This is the reality created by the latest cuts in 
services. 
This is the reality created by the initiatives to reduce the deficit. It 
is not the people who are better off who paid for the fight against the 
deficit, it is the people who could afford it the least. They are the 
ones who paid for the effort to reduce the deficit. They made a major 
contribution. And now, they are paying again because of the 
liberalization of the economy and of services.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consumer associations pointed out another issue, and it is in 
relation to this that I was disappointed that my amendment was not 
accepted by the government. Consumer associations representatives stated 
that it was important that core services be defined. 
I have already spoken of this and will come back to it, but they 
also say, and it is important, that where services like 9-1-1, 
information, telephone directories and other data are concerned, 
where reliability and confidentiality are concerned, it will be 
important from now on in this telephone service in which there are 
no longer just monopolies on which conditions can be imposed, for 
there to be neutral organizations under the supervision of the CRTC 
which can continue to look after the interests of consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I greatly regret that, while the government has maintained 
such things as 9-1-1, directories and numbering, it has not agreed 
to include the point that this must not only facilitate 
interoperation—which, it seems to me was already part of its 
mandate under the seven major principles in clause 7 on 
telecommunications—but also ensure that the public interest be 
served. 
It is important to state this because the CRTC has received orders 
from the government that competitivity must be ensured, yes, but 
not to the detriment of the consumer.  This is why, in the case of 
these services which have to be managed effectively, that is to say 
properly and efficiently, or in other words at the best cost, the 
public interest must also be served. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consumers were also concerned that resellers be regulated, as 
well as national service distributors.  The fact that the CRTC has 
had its licensing power removed takes one part of its leverage away 
from it.  As for the question whether, with the new definition of 
telecommunications, telecommunicator and telecommunications service 
provider, resellers are covered, I have been told they are. 
At least the CRTC has one point of leverage left, but it will have 
to operate on a piecemeal basis, instead of making clear from the 
start the conditions under which these businesses may operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will point out to you, moreover, that the only reseller we 
heard said it was totally in agreement with the licensing power, 
which was aimed precisely at establishing normal rules of 
competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for customer protection, there is one aspect on which I 
touched in my speech on second reading, and will touch upon again 
here, the protection of confidential information.  The CRTC is 
mandated to ensure confidentiality, and that is fortunate.  But 
does it have the means to do so?  That is another matter. 
I wish to take advantage of this opportunity to point out that the 
fact that Canada does not have legislation to protect personal and 
confidential information makes it an unreliable partner for other 
countries which have such legislation, despite its boast of being 
good in a number of fields.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, perhaps you know that the European Union, which has 
adopted such protection, and which exchanges confidential 
information with countries it is sure will protect the information, 
can make such exchanges only with Quebec, because Canada does not 
have legislation to protect confidential information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You know right away that I am going to say Quebec has the best 
legislation in North America, and I am proud of it.  I hope the 
federal government will establish such legislation for 
interprovincial matters, without putting its big feet into Quebec's 
jurisdiction. 
That could be done by making Quebec's and doubtless other 
provinces' legislation effective in a number of areas, but I want 
to point out that there is a real problem, as a representative of 
the consumers' association pointed out to the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This person indicated that people have complained of problems 
they had with telephone companies exchanging subscriber lists. 
That does not make a whole lot of sense, but that is what they are 
doing.  It should be stopped.  These people complained to the 
Quebec consumer protection office and were told it was a federal 
matter.  There is a real problem.  We know subscriber lists are 
exchanged just as we know—and it is a small part—about very 
powerful telecommunications networks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went to visit Teleglobe and I was flabbergasted.  They are 
advanced, they are effective, and they are good but, at the same 
time, I can see how invasive of individuals' private lives the 
information they have could be if it were used by just anyone. 
There is a definite risk if anyone can do as they wish in this area 
of jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by again lamenting that Quebec does not have 
jurisdiction over either communications or telecommunications, 
although this does not come within the purview of the House.  The 
telecommunications revolution now under way will, in a few years, 
mean that the information highway will soon be much more than just 
a means of voice or data communication, but will also play a major 
role in the communication of culture.  As McLuhan used to say, the 
medium is the message. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the technical platform becomes identified with the 
message, then for a people such as the Quebec people, who have a 
culture to protect in North America, the fact of having no 
jurisdiction over communications, in the broader sense which takes 
in telecommunications, is extremely dangerous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on at some length about how I find this 
regrettable.  I am going to come back to it as often as I can, but 
I will take this opportunity to say, in order to capture the 
public's attention, that this telecommunications and communications 
revolution is as important as the industrial revolution.  We do not 
even see clearly the full impact of the bill being passed today. 
I do not believe anyone who tells me they know exactly what the 
impact will be.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to rise to debate Bill C-17. I feel like I am in 
a time warp.  Perhaps it is deja vu all over again, only 
backwards.  I remember sitting here years ago when the government 
members formed the opposition.  They opposed measures like this. 
Now that they are in government they are supporting them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of these measures were originally proposed and instigated 
by the Progressive Conservative government 10 years ago.  At that 
time Liberals were vehemently opposed to them.  The Teleglobe 
divestiture bill was introduced in March 1987 and the Liberals 
voted against it.  They said it was an awful thing, it would hurt 
Canada, it was bad for Canada, we cannot have free trade of this 
sort of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December 1991 a bill was introduced to privatize Telesat 
Canada.  Again the Liberals voted against it.  They said it was a 
terrible thing, we need all this protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The telecommunications bill was introduced in 1993 and again the 
Liberals opposed it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the aspects of the bill we are debating today enhance and 
endorse the proposals we made in 1987, 1991 and 1993.  They go 
even further than we went.  It is another example of a flip-flop, 
a change of direction on behalf of the Liberals who opposed the 
GST so strongly and then all of a sudden adopted it as their own. 
They love it.  They want it.  They have tried to expand it and 
they have tried to foist it on the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know the Liberals stood in the House hour after hour, 
night after night, pounding the table against free trade. Now 
they have enhanced, endorsed and expanded it.  They want to 
expand it even further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next thing we will see happen, I predict, is the EH-101 
helicopter position which we adopted.  We ordered the helicopters 
and the Liberals cancelled them.  It will be really interesting 
to see what decision they come up with.  Certainly the search and 
rescue people and the people in our military want the EH-101 
helicopters.  That was a decision made by us and changed by the 
Liberals.  It will be interesting to see if the Liberals again 
follow the Conservative lead.  They have certainly established a 
consistent pattern of following that lead. They can say what they 
like, but actions speak louder than words, and their actions 
truly say we endorse Conservative policies and love them and 
think they are great. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to join the debate on Bill C-17.  From the outset I 
would like to say that because it was our idea in the first place 
and because we support the general thrust of it and the fact that 
it makes the business much more competitive and viable, we are 
going to support the bill.  The Conservative Party will be voting 
in favour of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-17 implements many of the commitments made by Canada 
under the agreement on basic telecommunications to the general 
agreement on trade and services, which again is a form of free 
trade that was opposed by the Liberals when in opposition.  When 
we are back there in a few more years we will probably be doing 
the same thing again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This agreement was negotiated among 68 nations.  It liberalizes 
international trade in basic telecommunications.  It enhances 
freer trade in the telecommunications sector and it opens 
opportunities for Canadian businesses.  It makes it more 
competitive which will bring down the price for consumers. 
Everyone wins with this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the terms of the agreement, Canada is committed to end the 
carrier monopolies and to remove certain restrictions on foreign 
ownership.  In return, the other signatory countries will open up 
their markets to us.  Our companies, which have proven to be very 
competitive in this field, will be able to compete in other 
countries which they are now locked out of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously this is good for Canada.  That is why Progressive 
Conservatives support the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were a few concerns which we had.  Fortunately the 
Minister of Industry made some amendments after hearing testimony 
from the users and the people in the industry.  Appropriate 
amendments were made, and we even supported them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first amendment which we were really concerned with dealt 
with licensing only for international carriers.  Bill C-17 
originally proposed licensing for all carriers. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1345"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the committee had many witnesses argue that this is an 
additional and unnecessary burden placed on a national industry 
which was already functioning well without it and contradicts the 
whole bill.  We believe this will continue to be the case even 
under the terms of this new bill and, therefore, licensing for 
national carriers would be unnecessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second major amendment put forward deals with clause 46.1(b) 
where the governor in council may prescribe changes in any area 
that is related to the provision of telecommunication services by 
Canadian carriers.  Witnesses again came before the committee and 
argued that this would provide the commission with powers well 
beyond the intent of the legislation and far beyond what they 
needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment now in place deletes that clause altogether and it 
proposes a more specific description of the powers of the 
commission to be placed in the preamble to limit their power and 
leave the decision making up to the users and the people 
affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These major amendments were primarily industry driven and we 
support them.  We believe they offer a greater degree of freedom 
for the industry to compete and there is now much less regulatory 
burden than originally proposed, while maintaining adequate 
protection for consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also believed this industry would thrive under a 
framework we established when we were the Progressive 
Conservative government and authorized the Telecommunications Act 
and privatized Telesat and Teleglobe in the first place.  The 
proof today is in the success we have witnessed in this growth 
industry.  Certainly Canada is one of the major leaders in the 
whole world in this sector and has been able to access these 
markets and foreign markets through these approaches.  Our 
industry has already taken on the telecommunications world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are confident they will succeed and consumers will benefit 
from the competitive pricing in both national and international 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Minister of Industry spoke on this bill during second 
reading on November 4, 1997 he said “The purpose of Bill C-17 is 
to pursue the liberalization of Canadian telecommunications which 
started more than 10 years ago and has already benefited 
Canadians and Canadian telecommunications companies”.  That was 
really nice praise from the Liberal Minister of Industry for the 
Progressive Conservatives who initiated this whole process in the 
first place.  Certainly it is encouraging for us to see the 
Liberal government adopt and proceed with them and even take them 
further than we did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That ends my remarks.  We will be supporting this bill.  We 
approve of it in principle and we approve of it in particular. 
<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to participate in the debate on Bill C-17, 
an act to amend the Telecommunications Act and the Teleglobe 
Canada Reorganization and Divestiture Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that as part of its WTO and GATS basic 
telecommunications commitments, Canada agreed to substantially 
liberalize its international services market.  These commitments 
include, among other things, ending Teleglobe Canada's monopoly 
on overseas traffic next October 1 and removing traffic routing 
rules for all international services by December 31, 1999.  Bill 
C-17 is the legislation that puts these commitments into legal 
effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin today by saying a few words about 
Teleglobe Canada.  Most of us will know that Teleglobe Canada 
provides international telecommunications services for Canadians 
by routing calls to and from approximately 240 countries and 
territories.  The fiscal year 1996 was a year of unprecedented 
growth for Teleglobe as a global provider of overseas 
telecommunications services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Teleglobe has announced that it has reached major milestones in 
its international development and in the expansion of its 
customer base.  This was achieved through—and I think we all 
agree—intensive sales records, geographic expansion, new product 
launches and the optimization of Teleglobe's global network. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of all this, in 1996 traffic and earnings for 
Teleglobe increased substantially and its market capitalization 
doubled.  In addition, Teleglobe International has established 
its presence as a network operator in three of the largest long 
distance markets in the world:  the U.S., Germany and the U.K.  I 
am sure that in 1998 we will see Teleglobe continue its U.S. 
expansion and develop new traffic sources in Europe, Asia and 
Latin America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Teleglobe, as we know, views this legislation and the 
liberalization of this market as extremely positive for both 
consumers and industry participants since it believes it will 
stimulate further innovation and demand for international 
services.  This is in the context of Teleglobe losing its 
monopoly and being thrown fully into what is now a very, very 
competitive international market.

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Teleglobe is clearly poised for the new business opportunities 
that are resulting from this continuing trend.  Teleglobe is 
indeed a company of which Canadians should be proud.  It has been 
made clear this is a company that is not simply content with just 
surviving in the global economy.  It wants to lead the field of 
telecommunications, and this enthusiastic, positive and 
optimistic message comes through loud and clear from Teleglobe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will comment on how important this positive approach is as we 
in Canada go about building a first class economy capable of 
taking on and beating the world and yet at the same time 
maintaining a desirable level of social cohesion and community. 
This of course is not an easy task.  I come at this question 
fresh from our experiences in my home province and in the belief 
that what has happened in Saskatchewan under the NDP government 
of Premier Romanow presents useful lessons to Canada as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will relate a few words about how we might more effectively 
co-ordinate our economy as we move into this new global 
environment, or not so new global environment now.  The economy 
of one small prairie province is not the Canadian economy.  But a 
province that went from the brink of bankruptcy to the first 
balanced budget in Canada, which has had consistently the lowest 
unemployment rate in the country and leads Canada's economic 
indicators across the board must have done something right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It started from the premise that at heart society represents a 
commitment by those in it to share in the future together, shared 
opportunity and shared responsibility.  This has always been the 
Canadian way and must—without being Pollyannaish—be our guide 
as we strive to build a modern world class economy in Canada, as 
we strive to prepare to meet the economic challenges of the new 
millennium and to tackle the social and economic challenges of 
injustice and inefficiency, of mass unemployment and poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This must be done in an increasingly integrated global market, 
not by turning the clock back, not by evading the changes that 
have taken place in the global economy or even by just tolerating 
them, but by understanding, mastering and exploiting them to our 
advantage, by taking charge of change and making it work for all 
of us and by ensuring Canadians are equipped to prosper with 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This question could be merely rhetorical but what should we be 
doing differently?  What will work?  It is of critical importance 
for our national mindset for us all to be outward looking, 
optimistic and confident.  An important part of becoming world 
leaders is the confidence that we can do it, but we have to keep 
raising the bar and clearing it.  Teleglobe is a good example of 
that approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what Saskatchewan did which is entirely in keeping with 
what the new labour government in Britain has done and indeed 
with what social democrats all over the world have done.  It is a 
partnership process driven by the belief that we are all in this 
together, this being the task of building a world class economy 
and we being governments, business, labour, communities, 
educational institutions, aboriginal peoples, all of us.  No more 
sterile debates about public purses, private market versus state, 
employer versus employee, regulation or deregulation, them and 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened in Saskatchewan?  As I say, I recommend this 
approach to the federal government.  Stakeholders in partnership 
discussed and mapped out a vision, a future for that economy, not 
a plan but rather a direction and a set of goals based on 
identified strengths and weaknesses.  These goals included job 
creation targets and what the economy should look like in 10 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the same partnership process came the identification of 
what was needed in order to get there, how to strengthen our 
strengths and address our weaknesses.  Once again on partnership, 
assigning who could best do what was needed:  government, private 
sector, educational institutions, et cetera.  It has been a 
process of vision and tasks to attain that vision crafted in 
partnership, and it has worked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yogi Berra, the famous baseball wit said “if you don't know 
where you're going, you might end up somewhere else”.  I would 
recommend this partnership approach, which is in place in all 
successful economies around the world, to the industry minister 
and to the federal government.  We need not just consultation but 
real partnership so we know where we are going and how we are 
going to get there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a fair bit to do as we know.  Canada's wealth creating 
base is not large enough.  Our levels of investment in skills are 
insufficient and we have a significant innovation gap.  We all 
know only too well the crushing consequences of poverty and 
unemployment and underemployment as examples.  If governments 
cannot solve these problems alone, then neither can the private 
sector, nor can any of the stakeholders alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A modern and effective economic approach needs to provide the 
framework in which these challenges can be met and conquered and 
to build the partnerships necessary for success.  It is time to 
break out of the past and address today's and tomorrow's 
questions with contemporary answers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has a critically important activist role 
in this regard, activist but different from in the past.  We must 
continue to ensure that we have the very best of opportunities 
for Canadians in terms of job opportunities and the very best 
opportunities for those who create those jobs in our economy, the 
private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I believe that the market economy is the best mechanism 
generally for allocating the vast majority of resources and 
markets and, therefore, can and do work in the public interest, I 
do not think that in all circumstances they guarantee it. Here is 
a good example.  The market economy is in the public interest, 
but the public interest is not satisfied just by having a market 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are public policy goals that the market cannot achieve. We 
all know that:  education, health care, regional policy. The 
trick of course is to ensure that government intervention works 
to better achieve its purpose than with the market actions alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is an example.  While Canada has liberalized 
its telecommunications market, there is still clearly a need for 
rules to ensure an orderly marketplace and to ensure that the 
objectives of the Telecommunications Act continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is fair to say that WTO and the GATS agreement and 
the accompanying liberalization of Canada's international 
telecommunications services market will actually result in the 
entry of many more companies, both domestic and foreign, into the 
already competitive Canada-U.S. market and Canada-overseas 
market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our concern here is that these developments, along with the 
long-term downward trend and long-distance carriage council, make 
it increasingly possible for companies to circumvent Canadian 
telecommunications policy and therefore we need to ensure that we 
guard against that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is fair to say that some of the clauses in the bill, 
clauses 1, 3 and 7, would give the CRTC authority to introduce 
the licensing regime to ensure that our telecommunications 
policies are respected and for acting competitive safeguards to 
be put in place to prevent operators from exploiting differences 
and the different degrees that market openness exists between 
countries to gain an unfair advantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me conclude in the minute that I have left to indicate that 
Bill C-17 flowed from a number of free trade agreements and free 
trade type agreements that it puts into place to the commitments 
that Canada made in those deals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are agreements that ignore critically important issues 
such as the environment and labour standards and the protection 
of social programs, all very serious concerns to all Canadians. 
As a result, we seem not to have learned very much from these 
activities as these circumstances that are in the MAI show.  That 
being said—

the total transferred by the federal government to provincial 
governments, in particular to the Government of Quebec, represents 
a large part of Quebec's budget.  That is how our system works. 
There are certain provinces that do not receive transfer payments, 
but because Quebec's revenue is lower than that of other provinces, 
it benefits from the transfer payment system.  It receives large 
payments, and these payments have continued to go up since 1993.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
have cut much less than what the member is saying here and we have 
restored the government's financial stability. That is why we have 
succeeded, with these programs, in creating the proper environment that 
has allowed, since this government came to power, unemployment to drop 
from 11.4% in January 1994 to 9% today and to put our country's finances 
on the best footing in the western world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is good for everyone, and especially the poor because they

helps people return to the labour market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have increased to $2.7 billion the funding for initiatives to

Speaker, I could have torn off my clothes when I heard about the PQ 
government's threat to cut funding to universities and research centres 
that receive subsidies from the Canada Foundation for Innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, like a good Liberal, I refrained from doing so. Instead, 
I will put a question to the Minister of Industry: How will he reassure 
the universities and researchers who are being threatened and

the hon. member will not tear off her clothes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is yet another example of the Quebec government's bickering. 
The PQ is trying to prevent Quebec researchers from doing innovative 
work in their province. The federal government has a tradition of 
subsidizing research and development in universities and research 
centres. We now have the most important foundation—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians have a reasonable question when it comes to the Kyoto 
deal.  Single moms would like to know how much more it is going 
to cost them at the gas pump to put gas in their car.  Families 
that are trying to put bread on the table want to know how much 
it is going to cost their family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely the government did an economic study on the impact of 
Kyoto.  Can the Prime Minister tell us now where is the study and 
can he produce it today? 
<P><A NAME="LINK170"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have replied many times to this question.  I do not 
have to repeat it all the time.  It is evident that this party 
has no position at all on the environment.  It is well noted by 
all the parties and by the people of Canada that they do not care 
much about the environment.  We do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK171"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
we do care and we believe there must be a balance between the 
environment and economic stability in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are asking is a very simple question.  How did the 
government base its planning on the Kyoto deal?  It has had 
three, four, five positions now.  Does it have an economic study 
or not? 
<P><A NAME="LINK172"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  We have 
discussed that with the provinces.  All the provincial 
governments and the federal government have agreed that something 
has to be done, that we have to meet the level of 1990 sooner or 
later.  It was agreed.  In Canada there is only a little gang 
that does not believe we have to meet that commitment and I am 
looking at them.

Council on Social Development for the report it tabled this 
morning.  Its information is always very useful to the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is wrong when she says that every one of those 
reports condemned the government.  Last week Campaign 2000 
indicated that the national child benefit which we were setting 
up was exactly the way we should be working.  The Government of 
Canada is working on income through the child tax credit.  The 
provinces will be delivering programs in services, $1.7 billion 
over the next few years.  That is quite a bit.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
minister has clearly not heard what those reports are saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will he at least recognize the disastrous performance of the 
government's youth employment strategy.  Since the strategy was 
announced in 1996, 26,000 fewer young people are working. Instead 
of defending a failed strategy, will the minister put an 
effective plan for jobs for young people together now? 
<P><A NAME="LINK177"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources

six months and youth unemployment declined to 16.1%.  This is the 
best we have had in 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our youth employment strategy is working.  Tomorrow I will be 
working with the Career Edge people to make sure that the private 
sector people do their part as well.  The provinces also want to 
do their share.  Things are going well.  We are addressing it as 
a societal problem because they are the best educated we have 
ever produced.

the only party in this House not to recognize poverty as an emergency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the prime minister. Until recently, Canada had 
always shown great compassion for the underprivileged. But with the 
reduction in transfer payments to the provinces and the tightening up of 
requirements for employment insurance, there is an increasing number of 
poor people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should the government not be turning once again to basic needs, to 
what must be done to find clothing, food and shelter for the poorest 
Canadians? 
When will the government support the organizations that are trying to 
deal with these urgent needs? 
<P><A NAME="LINK180"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, poverty in Canada is a great concern to us and we 
are fighting against it. In fact, my colleagues, the Minister of Health 
and the Minister of Finance, announced yesterday $1.5 billion more at 
the community level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year, my colleague at the Department of Health provided $100 
million more for the Child Community Action Program. Much money has been 
invested in the national child benefit. We realize that more has to be 
done. We realize that poverty is a tremendous problem here, and we are 
taking appropriate action. 
<P><A NAME="LINK181"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I must admit that 
this is not easy to understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government was elected on promises, 
including that it would scrap everything, scrap free trade, scrap the 
GST, scrap the helicopter deal, which, until now, has cost us close to 
$1 billion in delays, and even to scrap the country with Plan B plus.

things like soup kitchens? 
<P><A NAME="LINK182"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have implemented several very important tax 
credits over the last several years, and, through these credits, we have 
encouraged a large number of players in the private sector who are 
associated with volunteer organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to encouraging and supporting soup kitchens through the 
partnerships that we have with volunteer organizations, we are seeking 
to create an environment for the economy, and this of course is not 
understood by our friends from the Conservative Party because of the 
extremely bad management that prevailed under them. We had to overcome 
a deficit of $42 billion. I think that too many Canadians are still 
having a difficult time, but there are better days ahead.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Some international economists have warned that the recent crisis 
in the Asian markets could have a negative impact on foreign

International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. 
colleague for his very insightful question.  It demonstrates that 
he understands that what happens in other parts of the world 
affects Canada.  That is why we are in Kyoto.  That is why we are 
pursuing trade liberalization around the world.  We are not going 
to let a temporary blip in the economies of other countries deter 
us from pursuing that as far as we possibly can.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister has steadfastly refused today to 
provide the House with the studies on which his government has 
based the economic impacts of Kyoto.  We can only assume, 
therefore, that there are no studies, that the government 
actually went ahead and made these commitments on emission levels 
without a study of the economic impacts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just so we are crystal clear, is the Prime Minister saying that 
the government has no study on the economic impacts of the Kyoto

figures.  A lot of figures were used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Opposition mentioned 3% of GDP over a period 
of 20 years.  In reality, there will be a lot more fluctuation in 
GDP predictions over two or three years.  We had to face the

make sure that Canada is not in an unfavourable position—

union demands, discrediting union leaders, and blaming union 
members for the breakdown in negotiations are quite the bargaining 
techniques.

walking away from the bargaining table and blaming the unions for 
the fact that a settlement has not been reached, instead of 
negotiating in good faith?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I must 
say that I was sorry to see that the union has more than doubled 
the amount of its pay equity demands; it has gone from the $2 
billion they first mentioned to $5.3 billion.  I think this is 
clear evidence of the union's bad faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear they do not want to negotiate and I think that, 
unfortunately, for the good of employees, it would be much better 
if the offer were submitted to them directly.  I have challenged 
the union to put our offer to their employees so that they could 
vote on it.

<A HREF="#LINKT56"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has three overall objectives.  The first is to 
revitalize corporate governance rules in relation to 
co-operatives.  It does this by providing access to modern 
corporate tools that other businesses already have through 
framework legislation such as the Canada Business Corporations 
Act, the Bank Act or the Co-operative Credit Associations Act 
which governs financial co-ops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-5 enables co-operatives to incorporate as a right.  This 
eliminates ministerial discretion as well as the current complex 
procedures that now govern incorporation of co-ops.  It reduces 
the cost of incorporation for both co-operatives and the 
government.  It places co-operatives and business corporations on 
the same level playing field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill gives co-operatives the capacity, rights, powers and 
privileges of a natural person similar to what business 
corporations now have.  Co-operatives no longer have to specify 
their fundamental purpose in their articles or to abide by the 
limited list of powers set out in the current act.  This helps 
co-operatives compete fairly.  It simplifies incorporation 
procedures and clarifies the boundaries within which a 
co-operative may act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us also changes the rules concerning the 
nomination and the election of directors as well as the duties 
and liabilities of those directors.  For example, the existing 
act requires a fixed number of directors and specifies there may 
be no less than three.  Bill C-5 gives co-operatives the right to 
establish the number of directors in their articles although it 
still specifies there may be no less than three. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current act requires that a director must be a member of the 
co-operative.  The bill requires that two-thirds of directors 
must be representatives of the members.  This allows more 
flexibility by the co-operatives to make their own decisions 
within boundaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In today's competitive economy it is important for co-operatives 
to recruit the best possible people, to serve directors and to 
help guide co-operatives.  These changes were requested by the 
co-operative sector to help it attract the expertise it required 
to the board of directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-5 makes the statutory duties and the fiduciary duties of 
directors of co-operatives consistent with the statutory duties 
of directors found in other corporate legislation.  It provides a 
due diligence defence for directors in situations where they may 
be personally liable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second overall objective of the bill is to provide 
co-operatives with new financing opportunities, something the 
co-operatives were restricted in, in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The co-operatives will be able to compete in capital markets 
with entities that already have access to equity investment. 
Under the bill membership shares can be issued with or without 
par value.  This is a change from the existing act where 
membership shares can only be issued at par. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill allows flexibility so co-operatives can choose to 
maintain traditional co-operative practices such as par value 
membership shares or to realize a gain through no par value 
membership shares.  This allows the flexibility for co-operatives 
to decide how they want to operate within the boundaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-5 gives co-ops the ability to issue investment shares to 
the public.  Investment shareholders are given rights and 
protections similar to those provided under the Canada Business 
Corporations Act.  This gives co-operatives the flexibility they 
need to raise capital and puts them on a level playing field with 
other business entities.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, although incorporated in the province of 
Saskatchewan, the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool is now listed on the 
Toronto Stock Exchange.  I remind the House that SaskPool shares 
have been available for over a year now.  The equity investment 
the wheat pool has acquired in capital markets has enabled it to 
embark on a very aggressive and visionary expansion plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A third overall objective of Bill C-5 is to strengthen the 
features that define and distinguish co-operatives.  We do not 
seek to change the principles that have provided the foundation 
for the co-op movement in Canada.  Rather we want to protect the 
differences between co-ops and business corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-5 co-operatives must satisfy the test of being 
organized, operated and administered on a co-operative basis 
before they can incorporate.  This incorporation test protects 
the uniqueness of the co-operative enterprise in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most fundamental principles of a co-op is that its 
members control its decisions.  Under the bill before us members 
continue to make the bylaws as they do in the current act.  This 
is different from the Canada Business Corporations Act where 
directors make the bylaws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members have considerable power to restrict the power of 
directors.  They have remedies in cases of acts of corporate 
oppression and a right of dissent in the face of fundamental 
changes to the structure of the co-operative.  Members have 
rights to call special meetings and they have rights to make 
proposals at the meetings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me summarize by saying that three objectives guide the bill 
before us.  First, we want to revitalize corporate governance 
rules.  Second, we want to provide access to new ways for co-ops 
to raise financing.  Third, we want to do all this without 
compromising the principles of co-operatives.  Indeed we want to 
strengthen their distinctive features. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-5 strikes a balance among all three of these objectives. 
It was originally designed by the co-op sector.  It has seen a 
number of improvements, both in consultation with other 
stakeholders and in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The co-operation of members of the standing committee in terms 
of hearing from stakeholders, especially stakeholders who helped 
in designing the bill, and of helping us to proceed with the bill 
in committee is very important.  It preserves the intent and the 
fundamental foundation of co-ops, yet allows them to participate 
in the marketplace on a level playing field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill deserves the support of the House.  I hope this 
afternoon we will continue to debate Bill C-5 and to support it 
to completion.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been mentioned by the hon. member across the way, I 
concur there was a great deal of co-operation both in committee 
and with the co-operatives in preparing the bill.  The 
legislation was prompted by a request from the Canadian 
Co-Operatives Association to the government to consider specific 
recommendations which would update current legislative provisions 
for co-operatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has been an encouraging note for me in this whole process, 
being relatively a new member of the House, is that I was able to 
observe an amount of responsiveness on the part of the government 
to the requests of those involved in the co-operatives industry. 
Certainly the co-operatives themselves demonstrated some 
responsiveness with regard to the bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I witnessed there was that the co-operative structure is 
built around a membership which holds the management of the 
co-operatives accountable.  It was instructive to me and perhaps 
it will be to this House. The system they use there, where 
membership puts in place the management and then in turn holds 
them accountable, is something I would like to speak to a little 
bit here this afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The co-operative management and its members realized that their 
livelihood was at risk if they did not make some changes to how 
they raise capital and how they are able to compete against other 
entities in the markets in which they are involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, they moved ahead to seek this change to the 
legislation which would allow them access to capital, would allow 
them to change their corporate structure through amalgamation and 
restructuring for greater efficiencies and for the long term 
investment community to get involved in co-operatives as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was this foresight that was driven basically by the 
membership and through the management that opened the door to 
this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The encouraging part in all of this is that the change was 
really driven through accountability back to the membership of 
the co-ops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think what is instructive here for us today is that in many 
ways there is a parallel that can be drawn between this process 
and what is going on in Canada today.  The people of Canada are 
in a sense the membership that we report to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that the membership has been calling out for 
some changes here in this House and in the legislative structure 
that Canadians have to live within so that they too can survive 
for the long term and plan effectively for their future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure that our management team here, particularly on the 
other side, is hearing Canadians on some of these critical 
issues.  What I want to refer to briefly, and it ties back to the 
co-operators bill throughout this talk, is the fact that right 
now we are facing 16% youth unemployment in Canada.  This creates 
challenges for our young people.  As well the current increases 
to the CPP seem to almost add to the challenge that our young 
people have in obtaining jobs with these high payroll taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are already taxed, as we have heard in this House many times, 
at the highest level in the G-7 countries.  Even with all of this 
tax, the increases in tax, the new payroll taxes and high 
unemployment, we still have a debt of $600 billion.  We have 
heard that the interest is $43 billion a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just taking more taxes has not kept us out of debt.  In fact, we 
have gone into debt even as taxes have increased.  It is not 
surprising that the membership, the people of Canada, is saying 
that it is time to make some management changes and change the 
way that the legislation allows them to plan for their future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had a lengthy discussion about some of the proposals we 
put on the plate for changes to CPP which to date have not been 
heard by the party on the other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We listened intently to the throne speech, hoping to see what 
Canadians have been calling for, that is paying down the debt and 
tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we saw primarily was 29 new spending initiatives on the 
part of this government.  No, that is not what the people of 
Canada are asking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently commissioned a survey in my riding so that I could 
stay in touch with my membership or my constituents.  It is 
consistent with what we are finding in some national polling that 
has been done.  I will refer to it briefly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Less than 1% of the respondents to a survey in my constituency 
felt that the government should embark on any kind of increased 
spending program.  It was a very small amount.  However, 78% of 
the respondents surveyed want debt retirement as a priority of 
the government that finds itself in a surplus situation.

<A HREF="#LINKT59"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Debt retirement was very much number one.  We see this in some 
of the other national surveys that have come out.  The remaining 
respondents, about 22%, wanted tax relief after debt retirement. 
My constituents do not feel that allowing the government to 
spend, spend, spend is the choice that should be made at this 
time.  I encourage the finance minister to resist any pressures 
from within his caucus and party to move to an increased spending 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My call is consistent with what we have recently heard from the 
premiers who came to Ottawa, to strongly encourage him to resist 
the Liberal temptation to fix all our problems with more 
government expenditure.  We have had enough of that.  It is not 
the way to solve many of these problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, my constituents told me in the recent survey that they 
are diametrically opposed to the path which this government is 
intent on following. Eighty-two percent of my respondents, and I 
think this is consistent with many Canadians across the nation, 
felt perfectly confident that they can manage and invest their 
retirement funds better than the CPP investment board and 
supported the idea of a super RRSP which they would own and which 
is insulated from government manipulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people in my riding are making the connection that big 
government results in big tax bills.  Given that connection, they 
do not want big government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consistent with this we are finding that Canadians are coming to 
the realization, as did the members of the co-op, that in order 
to survive and be strong for the long term, in order to have the 
best possible opportunities for all Canadians as they enter into 
the 21st century, there has been enough of the tax and spend 
approach of the previous two governments. They are saying that 
taking more from Canadians and giving it to the government and 
the government taking its administrative overhead portion and 
then deciding who should get back the revenue is not the way to 
solve many of the issues facing Canada today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are saying that it is time for changes. The priority is, 
first, pay down the debt and get it under control because our 
interest charges on that debt are $43 billion a year.  Some 
studies we have done tell us that interest for one year alone 
would pay for 4 million young people to go through a four year 
university degree program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another idea that helps us to understand how much the debt is 
costing at $43 billion a year is that it is enough money to fund 
the operation of every hospital in Canada for two years. However, 
at this time we are trying to sustain a health care system that 
is at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This tax and spend approach that the co-op membership realized 
is the same as Canadians are realizing, that it is putting at 
risk our social programs.  It is putting at risk the care and 
social security programs that we could have for less fortunate 
Canadians.  It is putting at risk much of what we hold dear as 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, there is a hopeful note in all of this, particularly 
with this bill.  I admit that the updated Canada Cooperatives 
Act is a good example of how government can respond to the 
requirements of the private sector.  It gives me some hope that 
it is still possible for government to respond to the voices of 
individual Canadians who are calling for some common sense in 
regard to the fiscal management issues of this nation. 
The Canada Cooperatives Act succeeds in modernizing Canada's 
co-operative movement by providing it with the financial tools it 
requires to compete effectively in the marketplace and remain a 
vital component of the Canadian economy; in many ways exactly 
what Canadians are asking for.  At the same time, the legislation 
respects and retains the traditions and the integrity of the 
co-operative movement in Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is significant that the hon. member across the way 
gave some of the accolades to the members of the industry who 
participated so fully in the formulation of this legislation.  I 
believe that is the key. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is when we hear the people who are going to be affected by 
the legislation when we shape it, the likelihood of us hitting 
the target is much more enhanced. On that note I feel that this 
particular bill is one that I will remember as a positive 
illustration of how our Canadian government can work for the 
benefit of both industry and hopefully one day for the citizens 
of Canada.

<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to state, on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, on this third reading 
that we too will be supporting this bill, which modernizes the 
Canada Co-operatives Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to point out that Quebec has a very strong 
co-operative movement.  Of the 2,973 co-operatives in Quebec, 
according to the most recent statistics of the Secrétariat aux 
coopératives, only six are covered by the Canadian legislation. 
It is important to point this out right at the start, in order to 
explain that, regardless of certain reservations I and the 
co-operatives of Quebec may have had at the start, after the work 
in committee, and because there were negotiations held in 
complete equality between the Canadian Federation of 
Co-operatives and the Conseil québécois des coopératives, I am 
pleased to state that we will be fully supporting this bill, 
setting aside those reservations and concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, I need to explain a bit about what I mean when I 
refer to reservations and concerns.  It must be stated that the 
Canadian Federation of Co-operatives, in creating this process, a 
process focussed on calling for new legislation from the federal 
government, has proceeded democratically through consultation, 
and made its request. The request was granted.  The Federation 
consulted the Quebec co-operatives and finally came to agree with 
the bill drafted by the government legal specialists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Canadian Co-operative Association was doing was to 
modernize the Canada Co-operative Act, and this must be said, as 
others have before me: co-operatives in this world we are living 
in, especially the big ones, have to compete in the market with the 
big businesses and multinationals and find themselves obliged to 
have capital it was hard for them to acquire under previous 
Canadian legislation, and this was also true of previous Quebec 
legislation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Co-operative Association wanted its members to 
have, and some of my colleagues will tell you about this, the means 
to ensure that this different form of business, a co-operative 
business, something that is eminently desirable in our society, 
could survive in a highly competitive environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to use third reading of this bill to draw 
attention to a kerfuffle that occurred when the committee submitted 
its report to the House.  The kerfuffle arose because the 
government proposed an amendment, which apparently deprived members 
of the power to permanently replace resigning members of boards of 
directors. 
I say apparently because government members noted, after I spoke, 
that the law clerks had made an error and that, without this 
amendment, two sentences in the bill would have been contradictory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point it out, since, because examination in 
committee was on a consensual basis, I felt obliged at third 
reading to oppose an amendment by the government that had not been 
debated, that was not submitted to us and that ran totally counter 
to the spirit of co-operation.  I did my work, but in the end it 
enabled us to see that the legislation did contain another 
provision permitting the members to retain their power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now move on to the next stage in my speech, which is to 
take this opportunity to stress the importance in Quebec of the 
co-operative movement. 
It is interesting to note that I am doing so based on the document put 
together by the Cooperatives Secretariat, which comes under federal 
jurisdiction. It contains statistics on all Canadian cooperatives in 
Quebec and the other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very interesting to see that, in Quebec, there are 2,973 
associations, including financial cooperatives, the Desjardins 
cooperatives as we call them at home. In all of Canada, there are 7,870 
cooperatives. This means that 38% of all Canadian cooperatives are in 
Quebec. In terms of membership, there are 6,210,000 coop members in 
Quebec out of 14 million for Canada as a whole. Here again, Quebec's 
share exceeds 42%, even though, I repeat, less than 25% of the Canadian 
population now lives in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cooperatives in Quebec report sales of $9 billion, which represents 
slightly more than 25% of the Canadian total. 
As we know, in western Canada, there are large cooperatives, especially 
those involved in the production and sale of wheat. In terms of assets, 
Quebec accounts for $54 billion or 33%, compared to $156 billion in the 
rest of Canada. That too is a very large amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, I think it is fair to say—and my hon. colleagues agreed 
with me—that Quebec is fertile ground for cooperatives. Naturally, a 
major player is the Mouvement Desjardins, the Desjardins financial 
cooperative movement, but it is not the only one. There are also other 
types of cooperatives in Quebec as in the other provinces. It is 
important to note this. We seldom talk about this different yet 
important aspect of our economy, so let us take this opportunity to do 
so.

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 204 consumer cooperatives in Quebec, 76 purchasing 
cooperatives, 48 marketing cooperatives, 5 fishermen's cooperatives, 96 
producers' cooperatives, 1,221 service cooperatives, 1,318 caisses 
populaires and a few others. Some of these coops have been operating for 
a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important—I would need more time than I have today at the 
rate at which things are going today—to at least mention that the 
cooperative movement was instrumental in ensuring Quebec's economic 
development, especially at a time when the economy was dominated by the 
United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, when we look at today's major Quebec-owned businesses, we 
notice that two public institutions were instrumental in developing a 
mixed economy in our province, that is a capitalistic and a co-operative 
economy. I am referring to the Caisse de dépôt et placement, and to the 
co-operatives. Among Quebec's major businesses, in addition to financial 
institutions, we find the Fédérée, which employs 5,000 people, and which 
plays a key role in food production, consumption and processing. There 
is also Natrel and others. I will not name them all, but there are quite 
a few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say a word about some co-operatives that we seldom talk 
about. Those found on the island of Montreal are representative. There 
are co-ops in the education, housing and agri-food sectors. 
There are also caisses populaires of a different type, such as the 
Coopérative de consommation des employés d'Hydro-Québec, and the new 
Coopérative des services télématiques Centre René-Lévesque. There is a 
co-op that offers Internet servers to all social and community 
organizations in the Montreal region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a type of co-op that does not get enough publicity, 
that does not get enough support. Yet, this type of co-op helps 
“create jobs” in a world where unemployment is rampant, including 
for professionals and people who have great qualifications. I am 
referring to workers' co-operatives. 
All the other co-operatives that I mentioned are co-ops whose members 
get together to give themselves services, including housing and consumer 
services, to transform products which they produce, or to have access to 
an Internet server. However, workers' co-ops are unusual in that their 
members get together to create work for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This type of co-op is more difficult to establish, because while 
its members must act like entrepreneurs and make their businesses 
succeed by producing, by selling, by developing a market and by being 
competitive, they are also employees governed by a collective form of 
management that is different from that of other businesses, including 
co-ops in which members are the employers but not the employees.

<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this type of co-operative is implemented, it allows 
businesses to get through severe financial difficulties.  We are 
familiar with some in Montreal, and elsewhere in the province, who 
have survived the depression and increased the number of jobs, 
major firms such as the printing co-operative Harpel.  These co-operatives 
are a testimony to the fact that it is possible, even in 
this day and age, to develop a business that is both competitive 
and profitable, allowing its employees to have a life, allowing 
them to experience other kinds of labour relations and of 
management, and allowing the workers who have joined together to 
create jobs for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat that we in the Block support this Bill C-5, an Act 
respecting co-operatives. 
After discussions between equals, the Conseil québécois des 
coopératives agreed to support this bill, which affects only six 
co-operatives in Quebec but may, if they come to operate in several 
provinces, apply to other co-operatives currently operating only in 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are therefore pleased to support this bill, even if the co-operators 
who called for it know that there are risks in allowing 
members in co-operatives who are in fact not members but holders of 
capital, who are providing assistance to the co-operative in 
competing with other businesses, while at the same time helping 
themselves through the profits they can earn as a result.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise in this House as a New Democratic 
Party member to speak at third reading of Bill C-5, an act 
respecting co-operatives.  I am also pleased to see that the 
legislation enjoys the support of all five parties in the House 
of Commons, reflecting perhaps that the co-operative spirit is 
becoming a pan-Canadian value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that because in Saskatchewan the co-operative spirit has 
been alive and well for a number of generations.  As a matter of 
fact, we in Saskatchewan view the world in a very clear way when 
it comes to using economic utensils to develop economies and to 
keep people working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the view of the New Democratic Party that our economy is 
composed of three engines.  There is the engine of government 
which generates and creates economic activity to a certain 
extent.  There is a second engine of the economy, the private 
sector, which generates and creates economic activity in jobs and 
revenues.  In Saskatchewan in particular but across this country, 
the NDP believes, a third engine of economic activity in our 
economy is the co-operative movement.  We feel the co-op approach 
to life is a very important approach and one that basically 
allows people to do things collectively in a co-operative way 
that they cannot do individually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel very strongly that Bill C-5 addresses some of the 
challenges which the co-op movement is now facing, the 
modernization of co-ops, the modernization of the economy, the 
more competitive nature of corporations and businesses competing 
with our co-ops around the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The co-op movement is very important when it comes to world 
trade.  We have been involved in very significant things with 
respect to economic development in this country through co-ops 
that we normally would not do. The co-op movement has been very 
significant in the international and global economy. We did not 
call it the globalization of our economy, but the corporations 
that were involved and structured as co-ops, like the 
Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, were actually trading in the 
international marketplace for decades before the terms 
globalization and global economy became the catch words of those 
who wish to do business all over the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased this afternoon to acknowledge a neighbour of 
mine in the gallery.  He lives on my street.  He is visiting 
Ottawa on business.  I am very pleased to see him here because 
not very often do we get to speak directly to some of our 
constituents.  I am very pleased that he is here.  I am not sure 
if he is impressed or not, but we will see what happens during 
the course of my remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This co-op bill is one which I think has gone through a very 
comprehensive process in terms of looking at how we can modernize 
co-ops, how we can assist them in meeting some of these very 
significant economic global challenges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to note the co-operative manner in which the needs 
of the Manitoba and Alberta pools were negotiated with other 
members of the co-op movement so that a jointly recommended 
amendment could be proposed in the industry committee at clause 
by clause and it was basically approved. In addition, there were 
a further five technical amendments at committee and two more 
technical amendments at report stage in the House which all 
parties supported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before getting into more of those items, I want to talk very 
briefly about another example of how important co-ops were in 
Saskatchewan in particular.  That is my example because I 
represent a constituency in Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a problem a number of years ago with gas pricing and 
oil pricing and availability of energy in our province.  The 
large oil companies, Imperial Oil and Shell, had the refineries 
and they were gouging our farmers.  They could not get their 
crops in the fields and seeded because of the high prices.  There 
was a huge hurdle to farming economically in our province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1940s a number of people got together and put together 
about $40,000.  They established Consumers Co-operative 
Refineries Limited.  In essence using resources that they 
collected in their own neighbourhoods and communities in the 
province of Saskatchewan, they built from scratch the Consumers 
Co-operative Refineries which still exists today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, the refinery is valued at somewhere around 
$1 billion Canadian.  It refines about 50,000 barrels of oil on a 
daily basis.  It not only has a refining capacity, but it has an 
upgrading capacity as well.  It can take the very thick crude and 
upgrade it through a process, and then refine it in a refinery 
which is right next to it and make all the things that are made 
from a barrel of oil.  Many people do not realize that 10,000 
different products can be made from a barrel of oil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am getting at is that the people of Saskatchewan were 
confronted with the problem of price gouging.  They developed a 
technology among themselves. They collected their own resources 
and built a refinery to the point now where it is worth a 
significant amount to our economy.  It employs about 250 people 
annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The president of the union is the spouse of my constituency 
assistant.  His name is Bob Johnson.  Bob has been president 
before, but remains president of the union. With his colleagues 
at the co-op refinery, he contributes significantly to the 
economy of our province.  They are able to do this as a result of 
significantly strong co-operative principles.  I remind members 
that those principles are based on the fact that individuals can 
do collectively what they cannot do individually. 
This is an example that has been very significant in our 
province.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example I want to share with my colleagues in the House

movement is not dying. It is actually a very strong, vibrant, 
growing movement not only in Canada but in other parts of the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, I was visiting one of the 37 communities in 
my constituency, the community of Strasbourg just last spring. At 
a public meeting there were a number of speakers.  One of the 
speakers was from the co-op college at the University of 
Saskatchewan in Saskatoon.  There was a slide show. It was about 
the new economic approach in the land of free enterprise, the 
United States of America, to solve some of the unemployment 
problems, to solve some of the dying rural community problems in 
the United States of America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The slide show was about the co-op movement that is a “new” 
economic utensil the Americans are now discovering and using 
quite dramatically in a very positive way.  The slide show talked 
about a midwestern community with a population of about 6,000. It 
had had a very significant decline in its population over the 
years. It was in the midwest in an agricultural community.  Young 
people were being educated and then were moving to other parts of 
the United States and finding jobs and earning a living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a group of people who got together as a community they asked, 
how do we stop this drain of our young people?  How do we stop 
the drain of jobs from our community? How do we enhance and prop 
up and get our rural economy back on its feet? Somebody had the 
bright idea of forming a co-op. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They formed a co-op and started with a bison farm.  They started 
raising bisons in a co-operative way.  Then they expanded to hog 
production, to grain and to a furniture factory.  They started a 
co-op for house building and contracting and also established a 
buying co-op where they could buy materials at contractor prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Bill C-5, this is a very applicable example. 
This shows that Bill C-5 which we are talking about today is 
modernizing the approach and the economic tools that co-ops can 
use similar to those in the midwestern American city I am talking 
about where they discovered this new movement of co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you know what that community is doing now?  They are hiring 
the children of the founders of this co-op for jobs which pay 
very significantly. They are managing these hog production 
plants.  They are managing the grain and farm production 
operations.  They are managing the furniture factory and other 
factories they have established on a co-operative basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course at the slide presentation in Strasbourg, Saskatchewan, 
everybody at the public meeting was saying, “We have been 
members of co-ops for 50 years. That is exactly what we have been 
doing and that is how we have been able to sustain a reasonable 
quality of life in our community”.  I might say that Strasbourg 
is a very significant community in my constituency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my party's spokesperson for co-ops I have been contacted by a 
number of co-op members in particular on this bill, many of whom 
support the bill but a few of them do not.  Let me take a few 
minutes now to address some of their concerns which were brought 
to my attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the first place, some were merely the result of some 
misinformation, for example, that the bill applied to all co-ops 
or that it compelled all co-ops to raise investment equity. In 
fact as we know, the bill applies to only about 51 federally 
chartered non-financial co-ops as did its 1970 predecessor.  It 
does not compel any of them to pursue any financing option their 
members have not already approved.  It simply enables them to 
choose from a few more options. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also true that a few people philosophically do not believe 
a co-op should raise investment capital. It is a deeply held 
conviction of a minority of people who are also uncomfortable 
with changes at the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool. Of course, for 
members who might recall this, the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool is 
provincially chartered so that when the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool 
wanted to expand its economic base to pursue value added 
processing of its primary production of grain and hogs and cattle 
and other things, they decided to expand in a number of areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of the co-op who control the co-op decided that they 
would go to the markets.  They made an amendment to provincial 
legislation, as we are doing with this Bill C-5 for other co-ops, 
to enable them to go to the market for more capital. 
I might add that since this was done the shares of Sask Wheat 
Pool have increased in value.  The members of the wheat pool who 
did not buy shares still control the company.  The wheat pool is 
actually doing a very good job.

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact just yesterday it was announced that the 
Saskatchewan Wheat Pool which is the principal shareholder of 
Fletcher Meats has now bought Harvest Meats, a meat processing 
factory in Yorkton, Saskatchewan.  It employs a number of people 
and is a very successful plant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That adds value to the products which members of the wheat pool 
and other farmers in Saskatchewan believe are important to our 
economy.  It adds value in the sense that it provides jobs to 
people living in Saskatchewan.  It also provides more profits for 
those who are members of the pool from which patronage can be 
shared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Patronage of course in a co-op is different than patronage in 
the Government of Canada.  Patronage in the Government of Canada 
is where the government of the day appoints people of its liking 
to highly paid positions. In many cases they are not accountable 
but they perform functions in the country. Patronage in a co-op 
is when a member supports the co-op and purchases goods from the 
co-op. They patronize the co-op and earn some value from doing 
that.  When they leave the co-op they have an asset which is 
theirs as a result of their patronizing their co-op. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the wheat pool, I believe that members of the 
large co-ops, the ones which are federally charted, since they 
carry out business in more than one province, need to have some 
choices available to them to take on the multinationals which are 
increasingly taking them on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was speaking with the minister of agriculture for 
Saskatchewan, Eric Upshall, the other day about this debate.  He 
pointed out that the wheat pool has been responsible for millions 
of dollars of investment coming into our province in the last few 
years which as a result has created many jobs.  He told me about 
a number of the details, one of which I shared with the House a 
few moments ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time the pool's market has been targeted by the 
American multinational Archer-Daniels-Midland.  The pool has 
needed to finance the upgrading of a lot of its capital to meet 
this challenge, at the very time when a large number of farmers 
are retiring and withdrawing their capital from the pools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also believe the co-op movement has demonstrated that the 
majority of its members support having this option available to 
them under Bill C-5. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Evidence was presented before the industry committee about the 
extent of the consultation process undertaken in the co-op sector 
prior to the tabling of a model bill with the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A first round of consultations took place at the grassroots 
level about what changes were needed in the bill.  This resulted 
in the development of a first position, which was then sent back 
for a second round of consultations, all within the co-op 
movement. After the co-ops and the federal Department of Industry 
and the co-op secretariat at the Department of Agriculture agreed 
to a draft piece of legislation, industry and the co-op 
secretariat then conducted a round of national consultation 
hearings themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The resulting legislation is thus the product of consultation, 
consensus, constructive engagements and co-operation.  Such a 
process does not guarantee unanimity, but I believe it reflects a 
sincerely genuine effort to obtain the input and support of as 
many co-op members as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also greatly strengthens the rights of co-op members. I 
am sure that co-op members of all points of view will be making 
use of these rights if their co-ops debate such new approaches 
and agree to pursue them under Bill C-5. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, on behalf of the New Democratic Party, we would like 
to see this bill move forward as quickly as possible.  We applaud 
the efforts of co-ops across the country to bring forward 
proposals to modernize their governing legislation and to meet 
the challenge of taking on the multinationals which are 
increasingly moving into Canadian markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support a vibrant and thriving co-op movement and believe 
this bill will assist in enhancing that goal. 
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a very short question 
for the hon. member for Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre. I 
appreciated his input in the committee with respect to the 
importance of co-ops.  He helped us to understand co-ops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ensure that although we are opening up the boundaries 
in which co-ops can participate, we will still maintain the 
principles of the co-ops as he has many times described them to 
me.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>   Mr. Speaker, I thank the parliamentary 
secretary for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view the bill does not really affect the principles of 
co-ops, the principle of open membership or the principle of one 
member one vote.  Members of the co-op will still control the 
direction of their particular co-op, even though they may take 
advantage of these economic utensils. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principle of doing collectively what cannot be done 
individually will always be around in a co-op.  The bill will 
assist co-ops on the larger scale in dealing with competition 
from international corporations and in expanding their co-ops in 
a vertically integrated way as other multinationals have done in 
the past. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is with pleasure that I once again speak to Bill C-5, which I 
have debated in the House of Commons twice before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will repeat one comment that I started off with the last time. 
When I was elected to the House of Commons I told myself and my 
constituents that when good legislation was put forward by the 
government I would congratulate the government on it and not 
simply be destructive in my criticism but be constructive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the government and to the Minister of Industry that 
this is a very good piece of legislation.  It allows 
co-operatives to go forward into the 21st century with the 
ability to make necessary changes to be competitive not only 
within themselves but with other industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Brandon—Souris is the home of almost everything.  The House has 
been privy to my rantings with respect to all the good things 
that have happened in my community.  We are also the home of a 
number of very successful co-operatives.  Members may be aware 
that the co-operative movement came to us from western Canada. 
Co-operatives involved people organizing around the common goal, 
usually not for profit but for the economic benefit of all their 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Co-operatives promote grassroots development, led by people 
rather than by government. They are a reflection of local people 
taking the initiative to understand the problems they face and to 
develop solutions.  Co-operatives find their roots in community 
based enterprise around the world, and certainly in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principles of the 1970 Canada Co-operatives Association Act 
were based on provincial legislation dating back to the early 
20th century.  While the provinces have been updating their 
co-operative legislation over the years, there have been no 
changes to modernize the framework of the federal act since its 
inception. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, in March 1996 the Canadian Co-operatives 
Association and its francophone counterpart jointly submitted 
recommendations to modernize the federal act.  The proposals were 
the product of consultations with both their memberships.  As 
previously mentioned, the most notable feature was the changes 
that most closely aligned the Canadian Co-operatives Association 
Act with the Canada Business Corporations Act.  Both associations 
agreed these changes enable co-operatives to modernize their 
operations to better compete in the domestic and international 
markets on a level playing field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-5 deals with a number of very innovative changes to that 
legislation.  The legislation came out of consultations, 
consensus and the co-operation of an organization that brought 
forward to government, in a very long process over five years, 
what it felt was necessary for the co-operative movement to 
continue into the 21st century. 
As we are well aware, a number of changes are required to compete 
in this globalized world in which we now live.  It was done, as I 
said, in full co-operation with the membership.

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One issue they dealt with was the form of capitalization a 
co-operative could now do.  The co-operative has a larger scope 
in adopting the structure between traditional and open market 
approaches, providing greater flexibility in establishing methods 
for members to finance their co-operatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill attempts to balance the rights of members with those of 
corporate directors, which is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-5 makes changes to the rules governing membership by 
removing all restrictions.  The rules are now solely determined 
by the co-operative and are laid out in its charter bylaws.  This 
means membership would be open to all, provided current members 
approve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-5 makes changes to the rules governing the issuing of 
shares.  The conditions of issuing membership shares are set out 
in the incorporation charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-5 will permit co-operatives with share capital to issue 
investment shares to their members and to the public, provided 
the members have agreed to do so and have set out the rules in 
the charter bylaws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Traditionally co-ops have looked only to their members to 
finance their operations.  This means that co-operatives can now 
become more competitive with their capitalization.  I speak of 
Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, a very prime example of what a very 
progressive co-operative can do in the competitive market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed changes equip the industry with the tools necessary 
for raising badly needed capital investment.  It is a response, 
for instance, to declining membership investment, resulting in 
co-ops not being able to upgrade existing expensive and outdated 
infrastructure.  This policy follows changes adopted by some of 
the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out that Bill C-5 is not a controversial bill, as I said 
earlier.  It was done with co-operation and with consultation. We 
in the Progressive Conservative Party will be supporting the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Agreement between all parties on the bill was slow as it took 
over as five year period to develop, but I believe they achieved 
a reasonable compromise with minor amendments at report stage. 
Overall the bill is a positive step in bringing co-operatives 
into the 21st century by making them more flexible, efficient and 
competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes in Bill C-5 are wide scale adjustments but I am 
confident overall co-op membership, some 4.5 million Canadians, 
will benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, this gives us a very good model by which to 
develop legislation:  listen to the people, listen to the 
industry that is being affected and put into legislation the 
necessary changes that allow it to adapt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will make an analogy between that and another piece of 
legislation brought to the floor of the House recently in which I 
have been involved.  I will make a comparison between Bill C-5, 
which I have already said is an excellent model that has worked 
extremely well, and Bill C-4 respecting the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-4, unlike Bill C-5, does not have a common goal that 
provides for the economic benefit of its members, the producers 
of the Canadian Wheat Board.  Unfortunately Bill C-4 did not have 
the same consultative process as Bill C-5 has had.  In committee 
we were told we had to rush Bill C-4 through without having the 
proper consultation because it had to get to third reading before 
the Christmas sitting was over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was sent to committee where we had to get it through.  Bill 
C-5 took time, took legislative opportunity, to make sure 
adjustments were made.  Bill C-4 did not come about in that 
fashion.  Bill C-4, unlike Bill C-5, does not take the initiative 
to understand the problems producers face or to develop 
solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-5 did that.  We listened to what the industry was saying 
about what it needed for the future, for the 21st century. 
Unfortunately the government did not understand the problems 
facing producers and did not put into place the necessary 
legislation to deal with those problems into the 21st century. 
Bill C-4, unlike Bill C-5, does not allow farmers to decide in 
their best interest to ban together to gain better control over 
the marketing of their products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-5 the membership makes the rules.  The membership is 
the owners. 
In Bill C-4 that is not the case.  The government still maintains 
ownership.  The elected board of directors is only 10 out of 15 
and the chief executive officer will be appointed by government. 
It does not allow the producers, the major stakeholders, to have 
a say on how they will be operated.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-4 unlike Bill C-5 has not updated its legislation and 
modernized its framework to adjust to the 21st century since the 
inception of the Canadian Wheat Board in 1935.  Unfortunately 
Bill C-4 does not allow the producers to have a voluntary or opt 
in, opt out situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am making an analogy between Bill C-5 and Bill C-4.  I 
appreciate the model which has been put forward in Bill C-5. 
Unfortunately it has not been carried through.  Unlike Bill C-5 
the proposals in Bill C-4 were not the product of consultation 
with all stakeholders.  The government already predetermined the 
options of producers before they were even allowed to speak in 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, the committee would not allow members or 
stakeholders to come forward to speak to a very important piece 
of legislation that would control their operations for the next 
numbers of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-4, unlike Bill C-5, fails to modernize the operations of 
farmers so they can better compete in domestic and international 
markets on a level playing field.  Bill C-5 allows for the 
co-operatives to compete on a level playing field with private 
corporations.  It allows them to modernize with more capital.  It 
allows them to make sure that they will be competitive and in 
business come the 21st century.  Bill C-4 unfortunately does not 
allow producers to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-4, unlike Bill C-5, does not speak to the wishes 
expressed by the majority of farmers.  Bill C-5 took that into 
consideration.  They sat down will all the stakeholders, talked 
to them and listened to them to put in place the right piece of 
legislation that would allow them to do that.  Bill C-4 would 
not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-4 and Bill C-5 could do so much for farmers.  Bill C-5 
achieves this with great success while Bill C-4 fails miserably. 
I hope the government over the holiday season has a change of 
heart and starts to listen to farmers, particularly those in 
western Canada, and does the right thing by providing Bill C-4 
with the much needed tools that farmers want to compete in the 
21st century, much as Bill C-5 does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The co-operative movement is a very important movement in my 
community.  During the question and answer period the last time I 
rose to speak, a question was asked by another member as to 
whether a member of a co-operative could speak honestly about it. 
I can stand here today and proudly say that I am a member of a 
co-operative.  We have one in Brandon, Manitoba, to which I 
belong.  It is the best way to provide that service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not wish to prolong debate longer than necessary.  I 
believe all parties are in agreement with this piece of 
legislation, which is unusual in the House.  The Progressive 
Conservative Party recognizes that in some instances the 
government listens.  In some instances it will let the people be 
a part of the legislation that is necessary to govern them.  We 
will be supporting the legislation when it comes to the vote.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia—Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened very carefully to my colleague.  He belongs to a co-operative. 
Good for him.  I too belong to a co-operative, a food 
co-operative.  As the member so eloquently said, it is rare that 
the House can almost unanimously support a bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Co-operatives are very important in our society.  Fifteen or 
so years ago, in my region, we set up a food co-operative.  Several 
food co-operatives were set up at the same time in Quebec, but many 
of them are closed now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that my colleague has some good experience in this 
area.  I put the following question to him:  Why do some and even 
many co-operatives have trouble staying alive, surviving, and why 
are there so few really vigorous co-operatives in certain areas? 
I would like him to tell me about his experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am learning to speak French, but 
I have difficulty answering in that language. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suspect that the co-operative is no different than any 
other business venture.  It depends on the people who are 
involved in the management of the co-operative.  It is obviously 
involved with the business acumen and experience that people have 
as to how good the co-operative is itself.  Some co-operatives do 
not succeed.  In some cases it is probably because of 
undercapitalization, underfinancing.  That is usually the reason 
most businesses fail regardless of whether they are a 
co-operative movement or in the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said initially in my opening comments that in our particular 
case co-operatives are a feel of the communities.  The 
communities and the people develop the co-operatives. It depends 
on the motivation of those individuals as to how successful those 
enterprises are going to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can honestly say that in western Canada the co-operative 
movement was very successful because people helped people work 
with people.  It was a grassroots movement.  The profits that 
came from the development of that business were put back into the 
business.  I would suspect it is a bit of a culture that came 
from that particular co-operative movement and perhaps the 
opportunity to have better capitalization when they went into the 
enterprise in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That would be my opinion. There are any number of reasons why 
some are good and some are not good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is the House ready for the question?

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>REVOCATION OF MANDATE OF INQUIRY COMMISSION 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK217">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
obtain the consent of two-thirds of the said House before 
revoking the mandate of an inquiry commission. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, the motion I am tabling today, Motion M-20, 
refers directly to events that occurred during the 35th 
Parliament and that continue to have repercussions today.  The aim 
of this motion is to correct a practice by the government opposite 
and by the governments before it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My motion reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
obtain the consent of two-thirds of the said House before 
revoking the mandate of an inquiry commission. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>You will understand that this motion is in reaction to the 
problems that occurred during the course of the latest commissions 
of inquiry set up by the government, more specifically, the Somalia 
inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You will recall that on July 2, the Minister of National Defence 
published the report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Deployment of 
Canadian Forces to Somalia, better known as the Létourneau Commission. 
The work of that commission became extremely important because of the 
events that were being revealed, but also because the media was 
following it closely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In their final report, the commissioners expressed strongly their 
concern over the major obstacles they had to face in carrying out the 
work of the commission. So that the scope and the importance of my 
motion can really be understood, I will quote some parts of the report, 
including from the chairman of that commission, Mr. Justice Létourneau. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Justice Létourneau said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Inquiries Act provides the authority to subpoena 
witnesses, hear testimony, hire expert counsel and advisers, 
and assess evidence. Under normal circumstances, such powers 
should have given us the confidence to present our findings 
without qualification. However, on January 10, 1997, while 
Parliament was adjourned— 
</UL>
<because it is the practice of the government opposite to do its dirty 
work when Parliament is not sitting. I am adding this, it is not Mr. 
Justice Létourneau who is saying this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Justice Létourneau continued: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the Minister of National Defence announced that cabinet had 
decided that this inquiry had gone on long enough, that all 
hearings must be cut off on or about March 31, 1997, and that 
a report with recommendations was required by June 30, 1997. 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was the response of the government to our letter 
setting out reporting date options and requesting an extension 
until at least December 31, 1997, a period of time that would 
have allowed us to conclude our search for the truth. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>You must realize that the Létourneau Commission only had one 
objective, and it was to uncover the truth on extremely serious events 
surrounding actions by people in the Canadian Armed Forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Justice Létourneau continued: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unexpected decision to impose a sudden time 
constraint on an inquiry of this magnitude is without 
precedent in Canada. There is no question that it has 
compromised and limited our search for the truth. It will also 
inhibit and delay corrective action to the very system that 
allowed the events to occur in the first place. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He continued, and this is important also: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As our investigation progressed, we were able to move 
closer to the key centres of responsibility as we moved up the 
chain of command. Unfortunately, the Minister's decision of 
January 10, 1997, eliminated any possibility of taking this 
course to its logical conclusion— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister, the Liberal cabinet, realizing that the 
investigations and the search for the truth carried out by Mr. Justice 
Létourneau were getting dangerously closer to the political decisions of 
that government, announced in January, on January 10 more precisely, 
that it had decided to put an end to the commission's work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Need I remind this House that the commissioners were appointed by 
the Minister of National Defence, by the government opposite?

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These commissioners can certainly not be said to be big, bad 
separatists or sovereignists who were there to break up the country. 
They were appointed by the government to seek out the truth. It would be 
one thing if he had been the only commissioner to make such remarks, but 
there were three of them saying the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of them, Peter Desbarats, even wrote a book entitled <I>Somalia 
Cover-Up</I>, from which I would also like to quote, because he goes even 
further than Mr. Justice Létourneau. He wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before we had a chance to resume hearings in January, after 
the Christmas holiday, on January 10, the Minister of National 
Defence announced that the commission would wrap up the hearings by 
the end of March and table a final report by the end of June—This 
announcement floored us all. I expected the Minister of 
National Defence to give us one or two months less than what we 
asked for, but the decision to put an end to the inquiry was 
unprecedented. Even four decades of watching politicians did not 
prepare me for this. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a man totally unfamiliar with how things are done in 
Ottawa. This is a man who studied political and governmental decisions 
extensively and was familiar with procedure. After all, he had been 
appointed to the commission on the basis of his great qualifications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He wrote in his book that he simply could not believe that the 
Minister of National Defence would decide to suddenly end the inquiry, 
without warning, when it was so close to its goal of finding out exactly 
what had happened. So, the commissioners were about to uncover the truth 
when the government opposite, in a move that could almost be called 
dictatorial, put en end to the inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also wrote, and I will end with this excerpt: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When observing my two fellow commissioners, I came to appreciate 
the expression—and this is very important—“judicial 
independence” as a reality. 
A government that acts so as to affect the independence of a public 
inquiry can only be foreign to our political traditions and 
jeopardize the principles of accountability. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This commissioner in the Somalia inquiry says that the government 
jeopardized the principles of accountability. This is a very harsh 
judgment. The author made a comparison with our American neighbours. As 
we know, Americans are very structured too. They have many commissions 
of inquiry, even more than here. We also know that the president enjoys 
a very strong central power. The author points out that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United States, even a president could not stop the 
Watergate investigation. 
Here, a simple cabinet can put a stop to a federal inquiry for 
political reasons, and no one gets upset about it. 
</UL>
<This is extremely important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the in-depth analysis of the motion, all agree that public 
inquiries are essential elements of a democratic system. It is a 
universally recognized principle that, without the existence of public 
inquiries, administrative democracy would be meaningless. These 
inquiries are tools at the service of those who are governed, that is 
the citizens, to monitor their administrative institutions. They are 
tools given to Canadians and Quebeckers to know what goes on in the 
federal apparatus, since we are in the federal Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the first time we look at this issue and at the powers of 
commissions of inquiry. 
In 1977, the Canadian Law Reform Commission described public 
inquiries as “a complement to the essential agencies of the state. 
They can investigate the government itself, a task which must of 
course be the mandate of a body outside the executive and the 
public service”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The quasi-judicial process of which commissions of inquiry are 
a part is a major guarantee of objectivity, which is of 
considerable importance when an agency must assess the exigencies 
of public interest.  By setting up boards or commissions with 
quasi-judiciary powers, the lawmakers institute a mechanism of 
preliminary investigation and participation by the governed in 
administrative action. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But these inquiries must be left to follow their course 
without undue interference by the government.  This requires 
respect for the independence of the judiciary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And what is the independence of the judiciary?  I refer to it 
because it has already been addressed in this House.  It must be 
understood that what I am proposing in Motion M-20 is a solution to 
establish some semblance of credibility in our democratic 
institutions, which suffer from undue interference by the 
government in the process of public inquiries.  It must therefore 
be understood that the very principle of the independence of the 
judiciary is what justifies the adoption of this motion. 
In other words, once a government creates a commission of inquiry, 
because the situation requires it, because the situation is so 
important that a commission of inquiry is required, the 
commissioners must have complete freedom to conduct the inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And, among other things, the government should have seen to it 
that Mr. Justice Létourneau, a man with training, a highly credible 
individual with a law degree and many qualifications, had complete 
freedom to conduct the inquiry, to ask questions.  Above all, there 
must be guarantees that the executive arm or the government will 
not interfere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation, because this is governed by section 2 of the 
Inquiries Act, stipulates that the governor in council may, 
whenever the governor in council deems it expedient, cause inquiry 
to be made into and concerning any matter connected with the good 
government of Canada or the conduct of any part of the public 
business thereof. 
When we look at the powers given the commissioner of a commission 
of inquiry, we see that the process must have been considered 
quasi-judicial.  And there is a difference between a commission of 
inquiry and a decision by the superior court, for example, or the 
supreme court or the court of appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, commissioners have powers to summon witnesses, 
powers to enforce, and certain special powers associated with the 
inquiry, such as entering offices, examining documents or whatever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, section 12 of the legislation stipulates that 
commissioners may allow any person whose conduct is being 
investigated under this act to be represented by counsel.  And in 
the Somalia inquiry we saw that, whenever members of the Canadian 
Armed Forces appeared before the commission, they were all 
accompanied by a lawyer, which is provided for in the act and which 
was completely legal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This shows that a commission of inquiry is something very serious. 
We must give as much power as possible to those who hear witnesses and 
who search for the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, those who were here during the 35th Parliament, 
those who witnessed the whole debate on the Somalia inquiry, those who 
saw certain things the government did during the Krever inquiry and 
those who witnessed certain things in the past all feel that commissions 
of inquiry deserve the close attention of the members of this House. 
Commissions of inquiry deserve that we remove, once and for all, the 
possibility for the executive branch, the cabinet or a minister to 
suddenly revoke the mandate of a commission as important as the Somalia 
inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To support motion M-20 is to support the improvement of procedures 
regarding public inquiries. 
To support motion M-20 is to ensure that our institutions truly reflect 
the concern of Canadians and Quebeckers to maintain a sound and 
sustainable administrative democracy. To support motion M-20 is to 
choose to know the truth rather than to let the interests of the 
bureaucracy take precedence. To support motion M-20 is to give Canadians 
and Quebeckers an opportunity to adequately take part in the affairs of 
our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To those who are about to speak against this motion, or who do not 
really support it, I will simply say that to oppose motion M-20 is to 
allow the government opposite to once again muzzle commissions of 
inquiry.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To oppose Motion M-20 is to say that responsible individuals 
who agree to chair similar commissions could find themselves 
overnight with less time or insufficient time to really achieve the 
goal sought, that is, the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To oppose the motion is to allow those who mock their 
integrity to move beyond all control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that this House, given the appropriateness of 
the purpose and the fact that the motion is an attempt to find a 
better approach in this House, will see that its sole purpose is 
“to obtain the consent of two-thirds of this House”.  That means 
that people on both sides of the House must speak before a 
commission of inquiry is terminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once a government decides to set up a commission of inquiry, 
I think it is up to the House of Commons to decide with the pros 
and cons of a debate here in the House whether the commission 
should be terminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that democracy in general would be the winner if this 
House passed the motion. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure for me to speak to Bloc Motion No. 20 concerning 
commissions of inquiry.  I listened with great interest to the 
remarks of the member for Berthier—Montcalm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Inquiries of various sorts are a fundamental concern for both 
Parliament itself, this House, and for the government.  Such 
inquiries are important tools which both Parliament and the 
government can use to deal with special issues, special problems, 
special concerns of particular times in our history.  Parliament 
itself has extensive authority in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the inquiries which we are discussing under this 
motion, which are set up under the Inquiries Act, Parliament has 
extensive authority to set up a committee or committees to 
conduct inquiries into any area of concern to members.  These 
committees have the usual full control of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently there was the special joint committee on the 
constitution which was chaired by the leader of the Progressive 
Conservative Party.  That is an example of a committee which was 
set up as a national base for an inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, as the member has said, under the Inquiries Act the 
government, as distinct from Parliament, has the authority to 
establish commissions of inquiry.  In this case a commission of 
inquiry is created by an order in council under the statutory 
authority of the governor in council.  This provides the terms of 
reference, the names of the commissioner or commissioners, and 
establishes the timeframe for the work of the commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is important.  The government of the day, under the 
Inquiries Act, sets up an inquiry.  It gives it its terms of 
reference and, as the member said, appoints the commissioners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From that point the inquiry runs as an autonomous, 
quasi-judicial body.  It is the arm's length characteristic of 
these inquiries which is a very important feature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member rightly pointed out, and described extremely well, 
the great powers which commissioners have once such a commission 
of inquiry is set up and running. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, these are arm's length bodies which the government of 
the day uses to look at special matters in the public interest. 
They are set up by law in a very particular way.  Any change to 
the overall mandate of such a commission requires a new order in 
council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Inquiries Act recognizes that the government has a role in 
ensuring that the operation of a commission of inquiry is 
consistent with its mandate. 
Commissions of inquiry have been widely used by governments 
throughout the history of this Parliament and have been an 
important source of information and policy development.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice that the hon. member mentioned just two or three 
commissions of inquiry, but since Confederation there have been 
over 350 public inquiries under part I of the Inquiries Act. A 
considerable number of these have had major impacts on Canadian 
public policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would mention the Rowell-Sirois commission on 
dominion-provincial relations,the MacMillan inquiry into banking 
and currency, the famous Laurendeau-Dunton commission on 
bilingualism and biculturalism which has had such an important 
effect ever since and that was in the 1960s on the way this 
government operates in a bilingual and bicultural way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could also mention the McDonald commission into certain 
activities of the RCMP.  Another in the late sixties was the Bird 
commission on the status of women.  That for the government of 
the day was a conscious effort to look into gender issues, into 
issues of equality.  Again, right through debates in this Chamber 
to this very day I think we have seen the impact of the Bird 
commission and the way the government of the day took the time in 
the sixties to look at gender issues in a broad way really for 
the first time in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another I would mention is the Donald S. MacDonald commission on 
the economic union in the 1980s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of those commissions are examples, as I mentioned, from 350 
which have had a considerable impact on public policy in Canada 
since Confederation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is committed to making sure that the terms of 
reference, the budget and the time limits for completion are made 
as clear as possible for any commission of inquiry to reduce the 
risk of undue delays and expenses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, I would like to thank the hon. member for 
Berthier—Montcalm for his interest in this important matter. 
Commissions of inquiry are an important matter.  It is a very 
important aspect of life in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest in considering this motion members should take 
note of the need to maintain the balance which exists in the 
Inquiries Act that provides the government with the ability to 
establish inquiries into public policy matters and not just with 
that power to establish them, but with the responsibility to 
ensure the efficient conduct of these inquiries. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to speak in favour of the motion put forth by the 
member for Berthier—Montcalm.  I am supportive of the general 
aim of this motion because it allows the important decision of 
whether to revoke the mandate of an inquiry commission to be made 
by the elected members of this House rather than in secret by the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The need for such a motion arises from the fact that commissions 
of inquiry are often investigating situations or events that took 
place as a result of a government action.  Leaving the power to 
shut down the inquiry in the government's hands clearly puts it 
in a conflict of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, members of an inquiry commission are undoubtedly 
aware that their mandate could be terminated if they uncover 
information that is embarrassing to the government.  We have 
actually seen that happen already.  They have no incentive really 
to investigate in such areas. If anything, there is an incentive 
to not investigate in areas that might uncover things 
embarrassing to the government.  How can an inquiry be expected 
to carry out its job properly under such conditions, even when 
the most conscientious and honest people are conducting that 
inquiry? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government member mentioned that there have been over 300 
commissions of inquiry.  He gave a few examples of some which 
produced reports consistent, I would say, with government policy 
of the day and so they were acted upon.  The vast majority simply 
end up gathering dust like the petitions to this place on shelves 
or in vaults somewhere without ever seeing the light of day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our constituents send petitions to this place thinking that we 
are going to act upon the requests that are in those petitions. 
As all members of this House know, they simply end up in the 
vaults of this place along with petitions that have been 
gathering since the turn of the century with no action ever being 
taken and the government taking the position that because it 
cannot verify the signatures, the petitions are hardly worth 
taking any notice of.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Reform first came to this place we suggested there be one 
day a month set aside just to discuss the largest petitions 
submitted to this place.  That would at least show constituents 
that we care.  That has never happened.  Similar things happen to 
these inquiries.  They just disappear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most recent and glaring examples of the need for 
reform, which was mentioned by the member for Berthier—Montcalm, 
was the shutting down of the Somalia inquiry by the former 
defence minister, Doug Young.  It became very apparent from 
questions asked by Reform members during question period in the 
last Parliament that there really was no legitimate reason for 
revoking the mandate of the inquiry and that his only motivation 
was to prevent any proof of a government cover-up being made 
public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely the power to halt an inquiry like that should not rest 
with the minister of the department that is under investigation, 
as was the case in that instance.  The voters of the minister's 
riding administered the ultimate punishment to him in the 1997 
election by replacing him.  We will never know whether it was 
because he shut down the Somalia inquiry, but there was some 
reason they removed him from his position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the decision to revoke the mandate of an inquiry 
commission is only one of many important decisions that are made 
behind closed doors by the government, often by order in council. 
Take, for example, the decisions made by the subcommittee on 
private members' bills which decides whether a bill will be 
votable or not.  It is bad enough that bills can even be declared 
non-votable, let alone the fact that the government can make the 
decisions about those bills in secret with no minutes and no 
explanation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I rose to speak in the House I called the deputy speaker 
in New Zealand, who is a personal friend of mine, to ask him some 
questions about a private member's motion I took to the 
subcommittee yesterday.  In passing, I mentioned that I was 
struggling to get the motion made votable.  He was aghast that we 
still have non-votable bills and motions in this place for 
private members' business because in New Zealand they are all 
votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion has been deemed non-votable by the committee.  This 
creates the suspicion that the government really does not want to 
address the issue by seeing the reaction of members to the 
motion.  It could be quite embarrassing.  With this in mind and 
in the interests of democracy, this may be an appropriate moment 
to ask for the unanimous consent of the House to make the motion 
votable.  I would like to ask for the unanimous consent of the 
House to make the motion votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
North Vancouver has moved for unanimous consent that the motion 
of the member for Berthier—Montcalm be made votable.  Is there 
unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Resuming debate, the 
hon. member for North Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  Well, no surprises there, Mr. Speaker.  As 
usual, members from the government side demonstrated their 
commitment to democracy in this place by rejecting a votable 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as shutting down an inquiry can be used as a way of 
protecting the government agenda, designating a bill or a motion 
non-votable is an effective way for the government to stop the 
advance of a measure that may be popular with the public but may 
not fit into the agenda of the government, the Liberal party 
line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this way the government is able to stop a popular bill from 
becoming law without having to go through the embarrassing 
process of voting against it.  It is a shame that we do not have 
the opportunity to have public votes where our constituents can 
watch us cast our judgment on such issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An especially interesting aspect of this motion is that it would 
require a two-thirds majority rather than a simple 50% plus 1. 
While I am in favour of the general purpose of the motion, the 
two-thirds figure seems to have been chosen somewhat arbitrarily. 
It was possibly selected in order to make the motion effective 
against the present government, although I find it strange that a 
Bloc MP would have chosen this threshold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consider for a moment what would happen in this Parliament if 
the Bloc wanted to help the government shut down a commission of 
inquiry. With the present balance of power in this House, the 
Bloc and the government combined would not be able to shut down 
that inquiry without the support of at least one other member, 
which reduces the influence of the Bloc in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second interesting aspect of the percentage chosen is the 
present insistence by the Bloc that the result of a 50% plus 1 
vote in Quebec is decisive in terms of a sovereignty vote.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet it adopts a two-thirds requirement to disband a commission 
of inquiry; two-thirds to disband a commission of inquiry, 50% 
plus one to disband the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, as I indicated at the beginning of this 
speech, I am in favour of the general thrust of the motion.  The 
appropriate percentage vote is certainly up for discussion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I too am 
pleased to take part in this debate this afternoon, which says 
the government should obtain the consent of two-thirds of the 
members of this House before revoking the mandate of a commission 
of inquiry.  I want to congratulate the hon. member for 
Berthier—Montcalm for bring the motion forward.  I assure him at 
the outset of my support of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone I think knows what is behind this motion and that is 
the Somalia commission which the member has upper most on his 
mind and our minds.  The Canadian peacekeeping mission to Somalia 
and the subsequent muzzling of the commission of inquiry by the 
Liberal government opposite constitute a sad and tragic episode 
in Canadian history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know now, something went horribly wrong in Somalia.  Some 
Canadian soldiers sent there to keep the peace became the 
torturers and murderers of the very people they were sent to 
help.  I know that only a very few Canadian soldiers were 
involved, but we cannot deny or hide under a rug what happened 
there.  Nor can we deny the ugly strain of racism that showed 
itself in at least one of our regiments stationed in Somalia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This behaviour was appalling enough.  What is even more shocking 
is the cover-up that occurred, a cover-up that included some of 
our senior defence personnel.  I think it is worth recalling how 
we found out about the tortures and killings in Somalia and about 
the cover-up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We first learned about it through some enterprising news 
reporters.  I congratulate members of my former profession and I 
would single out Michael MacAuliffe from CBC radio for bringing 
this unsavoury information to light in this country.  We learned 
more when soldiers with a conscience blew the whistle as well. 
Throughout all this the upper echelons of the military 
establishment continued to stonewall and, even worse, to destroy 
some documents and tamper with others.  We were not getting the 
full story on Somalia, so in 1994 the Liberal government named a 
commission of inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Initially the Liberals were great truth seekers and democrats. 
One might summarize that they enjoyed having a commission of 
inquiry probing into events that occurred during the term of the 
previous Mulroney government.  We all watched as the commission 
began its work.  We watched the stonewalling and obfuscation by 
military brass and their attempts to avoid having the real story 
come out. This subterfuge and these attempts at evasion prolonged 
the hearings and frustrated the commissioners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission and its proceedings also began to frighten the 
Liberal government.  They were now well into their term.  They 
did not want to see the defence department's dirty linen washed 
in public, particularly in the run-up to the federal election of 
this last June.  We all know what happened.  In the run-up the 
Liberals ordered the Somalia commission shut down as of June 30. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the three Somalia commissioners, Peter Desbarats, a 
former distinguished journalist and now an instructor of 
journalism at the University of Western Ontario, described that 
shutdown as “one of the most brazen cover-ups and denials of 
responsibly in the history of this country”.  He also called the 
Liberal action a “brazen cover-up and a denial of 
responsibility”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the inquiry was snuffed out we will never know exactly 
what happened in Somalia, and we will never really know who was 
responsible for the ensuing cover-up.  Exchange of information is 
the oxygen of a free and democratic society.  By shutting down 
the Somalia inquiry the Liberals deprived of that vital oxygen in 
this instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the best of my knowledge this is the first time ever that a 
federal government has shut down a commission of inquiry in 
mid-term.  In his remarks earlier the parliamentary secretary, 
who had done some extensive research, talked about 350 
commissions of inquiry, royal commissions, et cetera, but I did 
not hear him say how many had ever been shut down by the 
government.  I think our research is correct on this.

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the first time in the history of the country that a 
commission of inquiry has been closed down before it finished its 
work.  It is profoundly undemocratic and it set a very dangerous 
precedent for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind members opposite of just how valuable 
commissions of inquiry and royal commissions have been in the 
nation's history.  In the 1930s, for example, the Rowell-Sirois 
commission looked deeply into federal-provincial relations in 
this country.  That commission did groundbreaking work and its 
recommendations set the stage for a social contract that vastly 
improved life for millions of Canadians.  This was extremely 
important to people in the province of Saskatchewan, where I come 
from, who had been ravaged by the depression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Rowell-Sirois commission was an embarrassment to the federal 
government of the day because Ottawa had been sitting back and 
appeared content to continue to sit back and allow Canadians to 
suffer through that horrible depression.  The royal commissioners 
had a very different idea and outlined it.  As I said, it was an 
embarrassment to the government but it certainly did not move to 
shut down the commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Liberals did in this present context in snuffing out 
Somalia was self-serving and undemocratic.  In political terms 
the issues here are arrogance and accountability.  The Liberals 
believe they were born to govern and think they can do almost 
anything and get away with it.  They paid for this arrogance, 
however, in the last election.  Despite pre-election polls that 
indicated that it was going to be a cakewalk, they only won a 
narrow majority and only one seat in the province of 
Saskatchewan. They should be asking themselves why this happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This arrogant and unaccountable government has to be contained. 
It is for this reason that I support the motion of the hon. 
member for Berthier—Montcalm which states the government should 
obtain the consent of two-thirds of the members of the House 
before revoking the mandate of an inquiry commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remark on the hon. member's choice of the 66% figure. 
Government appoints a royal commission or commission of inquiry 
for a reason.  Once appointed the commission should remain free 
of interference and be able to complete its work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This private member's bill states that it should take more than 
a simple majority vote to shut a commission down.  For this 
reason I support the 66% figure used by the hon. member.  I also 
add parenthetically that a 66% vote would also make a good deal 
of sense when we talk about certain referenda in this country 
that could eventually break it up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the moment I will contain my thoughts on that and simply say 
that I support the hon. member's motion regarding commissions of 
inquiry and congratulate him for bringing it forward today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am very happy to speak to this motion today.  However, it saddens 
me that we in this House have to stand here and debate a motion 
that seems so obvious.  Unfortunately it does not seem obvious to 
this government.  In fact, it is this government that has made it 
necessary to introduce this motion by behaving in an 
irresponsible manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am speaking in particular of the Somalia commission inquiry. 
As members know, the Somalia inquiry was shut down for political 
and personal reasons earlier this year which is what brings us 
here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately closing down the Somalia inquiry proved that it is 
not incumbent on the government to do the right thing.  In that 
instance the government did the wrong thing.  I will speak about 
Somalia more in a moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I want to tell this House that we do support this motion. 
We support this motion for the simple reason that public 
inquiries are not called on a whim.  Inquiry commissions are 
created because there is a public concern that needs to be 
addressed.  As elected officials in this House, it is incumbent 
on all of us to take such matters very seriously.  It seems to me 
that if there is a good enough reason to begin an inquiry 
commission then there is probably a real reason to complete an 
inquiry commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course there might be real reasons to cut short an inquiry. 
If I could I would like to outline some of the reasons why a 
government, maybe this government, might want to end a public 
inquiry.  First, the inquiry might start revealing information 
the government does not want heard because it might prove 
embarrassing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, one of the people being investigated by the commission 
might just be the brother-in-law of Canada's vice regal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, there might just be an election looming and the 
government might just want to ignore the inquiry and get on with 
business or the business of getting re-election. 
These are very important reasons to shut down a public inquiry. I 
hope members will understand my point.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sad to say it was so easy for this government to shut down 
Somalia.  This motion will ensure that there are real reasons to 
shut down a public inquiry.  If I could I would like to quickly 
outline what was the cost in real terms of prematurely shutting 
down the Somalia commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Robert Fowler, then deputy minister of defence and now Canada's 
ambassador to the United Nations, says that on March 19 he told 
minister Kim Campbell and acting chief of staff Richard Clair 
that Somali teenager Shidane Arone had died three days earlier as 
a result of foul play at the hands of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Richard Clair, then acting chief of staff to the minister of 
defence, Kim Campbell, says he did discuss the death with Fowler 
and vice-admiral Larry Murray, then vice-chief of defence staff, 
on March 19 but nobody mentioned foul play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said at the time that to him the death was still a mystery. 
The right hon. Kim Campbell, then minister of defence, says that 
she was aware that there was an investigation going on March 17. 
She knows this because she received a briefing note on that day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that briefing note the death of the Somali is listed as 
perplexing and that Canadian forces had acted appropriately.  The 
right hon. Kim Campbell also knew from the same briefing book 
that Corporal Matchee had tried to kill himself because “he had 
roughed him up”, meaning Shidane Arone.  The truth was he beat 
him to death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not until March 30, 11 days later, that minister Kim 
Campbell learned that there was an investigation into the death. 
Because the Somalia inquiry was cut short, this has never been 
resolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result is that Canada's fine military has been dragged 
through the mud and still there is no resolution.  The result is 
that Canadians have less faith in their public servants as Robert 
Fowler remains Canada's ambassador to the United Nations and 
Larry Murray has just been appointed ADM in the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans.  Still there is no resolution.  The result 
is that Canadians do not know what the true story is, and still 
there is no resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is evidence enough that the government lost the right to 
unilaterally end a public inquiry.  If it is not, I would like to 
refer to the words of one of Canada's most respected sons, Chief 
Justice Brian Dickson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a speech given just last month Chief Justice Dickson said: 
“Something is drastically wrong when the public feels that its 
military is incompetent and led by an inept, if not corrupt, 
hierarchy”.  It was not fair to the dead Somalis whose death has 
not been fully understood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ending the Somalia inquiry early was not fair to the military, 
which needed a just resolution. And it was not fair to Canadians 
who deserve to have faith in their public institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to close today by informing this House that the 
government is still scared, but of what I do not know.  Less than 
two weeks ago I submitted a motion to the defence and veterans 
affairs committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read the motion: “That the committee invite the 
three Somalia commissioners to appear before the committee to 
speak on chapter 44 of the Somalia report `The Need for a 
Vigilant Parliament”'.  I am sad to say that this motion was 
voted down.  What are they hiding? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this motion is passed, the government will not be able to 
hide so easily.  Again, we do support this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  As is customary, the 
last few minutes of the debate are reserved for the mover of the 
motion.

<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, let 
me start by saying that the position taken by the government on Motion 
M-20 did not come as too much of a surprise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To take a different position would have been tantamount for it to 
admit it made the wrong decision regarding the Somalia inquiry. It would 
also be against their principles, that is to act to cover something up. 
If there is one thing that this government does not seek it is to shed 
light on certain administrative decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not too surprised that the government is not in favour of this 
motion. 
Something worries me and bothers me to some extent, though, and that is 
the fact that, when a member of the official opposition asked that my 
motion be made into a votable item, government members said no.

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a way, that both surprises me and does not surprise me, because 
we must understand that, with the support of the Reform Party, the NDP 
and the Conservative Party, all that would have been required for my 
motion to pass would have been the support of five Liberal members. I 
can understand that, to be on the safe side, they would rather this 
motion not be put forward or not be voted on in this House, just in case 
there were five members on their side who would vote against the party 
line, as some have done on other issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank the opposition parties, that is to say the 
Reform Party, the New Democratic Party and the Progressive-Conservative 
Party, for truly grasping the meaning and, more importantly, the 
significance of this motion. 
What I heard was also repeated often and dealt directly with the 
objective I was pursuing, namely the legitimacy of the commission, the 
importance of knowing the truth, the search for that truth and the 
protection of the population. I think that all opposition parties 
understood that. It is unfortunate that the government opposite is 
refusing to be responsive to an extremely important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government often says that opposition members are here only to 
criticize and do nothing that is positive. I think that this was an 
opportunity for the government to acknowledge that an opposition member 
was right on an extremely important issue, namely that when a commission 
of inquiry is created, considering how important that is, a vote of two 
thirds in the House should be required to end the inquiry. This is how 
the opposition parties are being thanked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is perhaps only one thing that they did not understand, and 
I would like to come back to that briefly. 
Members from the Reform Party and from the NDP mentioned that they did 
not really understand, at least the Reform Party did not, the two thirds 
requirement, for two reasons. The first was that this would limit the 
influence of the Bloc Quebecois on government decisions because the Bloc 
Quebecois does not have enough members to bring about an end to the 
commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this respect, it was not undue influence that I was looking for 
with this motion, but fairness, and I think that the two thirds rule 
would allow to demonstrate clearly that all members in this House wish 
to end or to continue an inquiry. My objective was absolutely not to 
give the Bloc Quebecois special influence over Parliament. I believe 
that with 44 members, we have more than enough to do to represent 
Quebeckers properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point that bothers me a bit more, and I would like 
to mention this, is that members of the Reform Party and the NDP 
claimed not to understand why it took 66% to terminate a commission 
or allow it to continue, while it took 50% plus one in the case of 
a referendum for Quebec to become a sovereign nation.  I hope that 
they said this off the top of their heads, that they did not think 
before they spoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe very sincerely that there is a difference between a 
vote by elected officials on an administrative matter, such as the 
continuation or termination of a commission of inquiry, whether it 
is important, as I was saying, or not, and the democratic vote of 
a people.  I think there is a fundamental difference between the 
decision of a people and an administrative decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not pluck the two-thirds rule out of thin air.  All 
members know, if they listen to their constituents occasionally, 
that in order for non-profit organizations to be able to change 
their by-laws they often require the consent of two-thirds of their 
general assembly.  This is not a criterion selected out of the 
blue, but one that I think is generally recognized in 
administrative circles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, 50% plus one in a democracy is a criterion that is 
also recognized internationally.  When a people vote in an election 
or a referendum, the majority, the 50% plus one, rules. 
There is nothing contradictory about this and I think that, if 
members give a little thought to their position, to what they have 
just said, they will understand that there is a fundamental 
difference between the two, and that the 50% plus one is the 
principle that Quebeckers defend each time a referendum is held in 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close with that.  I again offer the government an 
opportunity to agree to a vote on this motion.

allow this vote to be subject to the determination of the 
government whip.  He represents the cabinet and we all know that 
the cabinet is not very supportive of increasing the influence of 
private members in the House.

the way that we normally do in the House in Private Members' 
Business.

Chair is clear, the House leader of the official opposition has 
asked that the vote to be taken on the amendment to the 
concurrence motion be taken in the same manner as a vote in 
Private Members' Business.  Is the Chair correct? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, you are well trained in the 
Chair's duties.  You are absolutely correct.

the motion of the House leader of the official opposition. Is 
there unanimous consent?

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK251"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as the 
New Democratic Party's aboriginal affairs critic, I am deeply 
troubled by this government's continuing silence regarding the 
royal commission's final report and recommendations.  Obviously 
there is a pressing need to radically redefine the relationship 
between aboriginal peoples and the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tragic events of recent years at Oka and Ipperwash prove how 
urgently action is needed.  As time continues to pass, aboriginal 
peoples and other Canadians are left with the impression that 
this government has no clear idea of what should be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party has for a long time been calling on the 
government to put an end to the dependency and marginalization of 
aboriginal peoples.  As the royal commission clearly stated, to 
recognize our mistakes is the first step toward a new 
relationship based on mutual respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is compelling information in the royal commission's report 
about systemic physical, sexual and emotional abuses in 
residential schools, all in the name of our government's 
assimilationist policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make sure justice is done to the victims of abuse would be 
one small remedy which would begin an essential healing process. 
Formal apologies and compensation were offered to Japanese 
Canadians for treatment during the second world war.  Now is the 
time for apologies to and the healing of aboriginal peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly believe that a true partnership cannot be achieved 
without mutual respect and recognition.  The royal commission 
stressed the importance of recognizing that aboriginal peoples in 
Canada form distinct nations and, as such, have a right to 
fashion their societies in ways which reflect their values and 
cultures.  I certainly share this vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that sense, both explicit constitutional recognition and 
concrete actions to implement the inherent right to 
self-government are essential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government finally established a policy regarding 
self-government negotiations in 1995.  These negotiations are a 
first step to replacing the paternalistic relationship 
established under the Indian Act, but the unacceptable 
requirement of exchanging treaty rights for extinguishment of 
aboriginal rights is still part of the negotiation process.  How 
could we have a relationship based on trust and mutual respect 
with such a policy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also share the view of the royal commission that aboriginal 
governments must be considered as a third legitimate government, 
like the provinces and the federal government.  Nations are not 
like municipalities and this should be reflected in these 
agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginal nations should be able to decide which power they 
want to exercise in accordance with the charter of rights and 
freedoms and the fundamental principles of the Canadian 
constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the dramatic situation regarding health, education, 
housing and the employment of aboriginal peoples on and off 
reserve, these are a matter of priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginal peoples are better placed than anyone else to find 
solutions adapted to their own realities and traditions, but the 
government must not simply transfer its responsibilities and run. 
This situation must be addressed in true collaboration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important aspect of restructuring the relationship is to 
establish a fair base for dispute settlement.  The NDP is a long 
time supporter of an independent land claims commission. Such a 
commission should have a tribunal-like decision power and report 
its activities to Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A land base is essential to the exercise of self-government. The 
NDP supports the process presently in place for the creation of 
Nunavut.  It is also important that the Métis people, who have 
been ignored by governments since the last century, be recognized 
as having full aboriginal rights and a land and resource base to 
exercise self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on for hours talking about the changes which I 
believe are necessary to correct centuries of abuses and wrong 
policies.  My colleagues in the NDP certainly share the view that 
the very principle of a new relationship based on mutual respect 
lies in our ability to listen to aboriginal peoples.  History 
cannot be forgotten, but we can certainly act on it to create a 
better future.

I am pleased to respond to the hon. member for Halifax West on 
behalf of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development 
concerning the government's response to the Royal Commission on 
Aboriginal Peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has every intention of publicly responding to the 
RCAP report in the near future.  Contrary to the hon. member's 
belief, the government has not been silent on this matter.  Over 
the last year we have been consulting partners while undertaking 
an in-depth government-wide review of the commission's 
recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a lengthy, serious and important document that cannot be 
implemented overnight.  The government is committed to making 
significant structural change in its relationship with aboriginal 
peoples.  Therefore, we cannot proceed in isolation.  Many 
partners, aboriginal people, provincial and territorial 
governments and the private sector and other interested parties 
are involved in the development of responses to the 
recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The royal commission set out a 20 year program for change.  It 
would be a disservice to the commission and the aboriginal people 
if we responded to the report in haste or without thorough 
consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me also add that many of the changes recommended by RCAP are 
already in place or under way.  For example, this government 
recently expressed its commitment to the creation of a national 
aboriginal health institute, which was called for by RCAP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government will not table a response for the sake of 
tabling a response.  We want to address the many issues raised in 
the RCAP report in a manner that is reasonable and that best 
serves aboriginal people.  We want to table the right response to 
address the needs of aboriginal people.

<P><A NAME="LINK254"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
earlier this year two reports on sexually exploited youth were 
released in British Columbia.  In September the Downtown Eastside 
Youth Activity Society released a report examining the situation 
in the Downtown, Eastside and Strathcona neighbourhoods in my 
constituency of Vancouver East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In November a similar report of the sexually exploited youth 
committee of the Capital Regional District released a report on 
the situation in Victoria and the surrounding communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both reports came to a similar conclusion.  That conclusion is 
that we cannot isolate the problem of sexually exploited youth 
from other problems that face our communities and our young 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Victoria study, poverty and homelessness emerged as key 
issues.  Two-thirds of the youths surveyed reported that they 
were afraid of not having enough money to survive.  Almost half 
of them said that they were living on the street when they first 
became involved in the sex trade.  One-third reported trading 
sexual favours for a place to sleep. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Housing and poverty were also identified as the problem in the 
Vancouver study.  The difficulty sex trade workers have getting 
housing and other services contributes to their isolation and 
makes it harder for sexually exploited youths to get off the 
street. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both studies found high levels of drug use among sexually 
exploited youth.  In Victoria 25% were intravenous drug users. In 
Vancouver the figure was 75%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most appalling finding of the study was the number of 
sexually exploited youth who had been sexually abused prior to 
their entry into the sex trade.  Between 70% and 95% of youth 
surveyed in Vancouver were sexually abused prior to their entry 
into the sex trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In both studies the picture painted of sexually exploited youth 
was one of young people who felt betrayed by society and who were 
struggling to survive.  These young people are extremely 
marginalized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand that there are no quick fixes.  We do need 
solutions that make it easier for exploited youth to leave the 
sex trade and easier for them to survive until they make the 
decision to leave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among the measures which were put forward in these reports was a 
network of safe houses, a witness protection program to ensure 
the safety of sexually exploited youth involved in court 
proceedings, a change in the age of consent and changes in the 
law to allow more successful prosecutions against those who 
sexually exploit children and youth.  I will be working with the 
local community on these particular issues in the New Year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, there are concerns about how we address some of the 
problems facing these youths, including homelessness and the 
treatment of drug addiction.  Action on the solutions to these 
studies identified does require the active co-operation of the 
federal government.  I would urgently ask the federal government 
to examine these reports with a view to assisting with solutions.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the federal government has abandoned social 
housing.  We have not set any targets on poverty.  There is no 
doubt that increasing numbers of children are now at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the young people in the sex trade have completely lost 
faith with all government and with all authorities.  We have to 
be committed to this.  There have been too many reports produced 
and they all say the same thing, that increasing numbers of our 
young people are at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for this government to take action to provide 
housing, to end poverty, to provide better services, to provide 
better treatment programs for addiction, to assist these sexually 
exploited youth.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the involvement of young people in prostitution is a serious and 
tragic problem that has become more evident over recent years as 
the hon. member says.  I want to thank the hon. member for 
bringing this to the attention of the House. It is particularly 
troublesome because young people by virtue of their age and legal 
status are more vulnerable than adults to danger, exploitation 
and abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is extremely concerned about this 
problem, despite what the member said. For this reason it 
introduced Bill C-27, which Parliament passed last spring, to 
address some of the issues surrounding the involvement of young 
people in prostitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These new laws are intended to give the police more efficient 
means to enforce the offence of obtaining the sexual services of 
a person under the age of 18. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to easing the burden of young witnesses in 
prostitution related cases, Parliament also created a very severe 
penalty for those procurers who use violence or intimidation 
against youth involved in prostitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing is clear, however.  Criminal law alone will never 
suffice to eradicate child and youth prostitution.  It is a 
community problem that must be dealt with on many fronts, 
including the areas of social policy and education as the hon. 
member indicated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only by co-operating together at all levels, federal, 
provincial and territorial, that we will be able to tackle the 
root causes underlying the involvement of youth. It is 
anticipated that in late December, the 
federal-provincial-territorial working group on prostitution will 
be presenting to the federal, provincial and territorial 
ministers responsible for justice, its recommendations on 
legislation and policy practices concerning prostitution related 
activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A status report was presented recently at the federal-provincial 
meeting in early December in Montreal.  The issue of child sexual 
exploitation was a matter of concern to ministers.  At the urging 
of British Columbia, the Minister of Justice agreed to draft 
amendments to the Criminal Code to strengthen enforcement efforts 
against those who buy sex from children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the British Columbia and other provincial ministers 
further requested to increase the age of consent to sexual 
activity to 16.  This also will be seriously considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore we will be coming back to the House with some 
recommendations.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, a few 
days ago, I asked the health minister what he intended to do to help 
sports and cultural events, which are facing a transition period that is 
way too short. As we know, I was alluding to the harmful and undesirable 
effects of Bill C-71. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We supported the objectives pursued in the fight against tobacco 
consumption through this legislation. However, we think the means used 
to achieve these goals are not appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The three major producers concerned by the issue of sponsorship 
invest $31 million annually, which is nothing to sneeze at, and are 
facing an extremely sensitive situation. First, because the act is very 
coercive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The European Union decided to grant a seven-year transition period. 
Perhaps tobacco producers must stop sponsoring events. I agree that the 
issue must be considered, but it is not true that sports and cultural 
events should disappear, and I am referring to major events that have a 
very significant impact for large cities such as Montreal, Toronto and 
Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the current wording of the act, which we were urged to pass 
in the last Parliament, sponsorship by tobacco producers will be 
prohibited as of next October.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an extremely thoughtless move fraught with consequences, 
because you can understand that it is not possible for the Jazz 
Festival, the Grand Prix in Trois-Rivières and the open golf 
championship to find partners who will invest several million dollars in 
sponsorhsip on a notice as short as a few months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell you that, compared to what was done elsewhere in terms 
of the planning period provided, other countries had concerns similar to 
the ones the Minister of Health has about tobacco use and the bad 
influence publicity may have on young people. 
Yesterday, in a press conference, and again today, we were reminded that 
the European Union, which is confronted with a rather similar problem, 
has given sponsors seven years to withdraw. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is this period so important? Because tobacco companies are the 
main sponsors. When $5 million, $6 million or $7 million are invested to 
support a sports or cultural event, this has a significant impact and 
taking away this support without first finding new sponsors is not an 
alternative, and I hope the government will reconsider.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

the government acknowledged the concerns of the organizers of the 
Grand Prix of Canada in Montreal and the Molson Indy in Toronto 
and Vancouver.  These concerns were about the potential impact of 
the Tobacco Act's restrictions on the promotion of motor sport 
events that receive support from tobacco companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The former health minister committed to finalizing before the 
end of 1997 consultations with motor sports promoters and to 
present amendments that will respect the international standards 
concerning the use of logos on cars, drivers, pit crews and 
transport equipment.  The former minister also stated that this 
could be done in a manner consistent with the charter and our 
health objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Tobacco Act gives the government authority to regulate the 
production, promotion, labelling and sale of tobacco products and 
the access by minors to tobacco products.  The act is part of the 
federal government's broad strategy to reduce the use of tobacco 
in Canada. This strategy includes legislation, research, public 
education and tax policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government took the direction of the supreme court with 
respect to the freedom of expression that must be accorded the 
tobacco industry to communicate with adult consumers.  The 
government also listened to the concerns of arts and sports 
groups and we incorporated a transition period to allow these 
groups to find alternative sponsors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Health has been involved in consultations with 
affected parties on both sides of the issue.  An amendment will 
be prepared that will meet the commitment made last spring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three criteria any amendment to the act must be 
weighed against:  international standards, the charter of rights 
and freedoms, and our health objectives.  The charter and our 
health objectives are fundamental considerations and the issue of 
international standards is also important. We must ensure that 
any change to the act reflects these considerations and we will 
see that this is done.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on 
November 25 I asked a question of the Minister of Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development.  That question was in relation to the 
Indian First Nation in Oromocto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue at hand here is the mismanagement of funds at the 
Indian nation.  As a result of the mismanagement of those funds 
this Indian nation finds itself $1.3 million in debt.  Even after 
a cash advance of $464,000 it is still going through 
difficulties.  Some of those difficulties have to be addressed 
immediately.  I hope when the parliamentary secretary responds he 
can tell me that they have been addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Up until now, council members, band staff and others have gone 
for five weeks and longer without any pay.  Employees of the band 
have been laid off, including the band's police constable.  The 
power bill has not been paid and the health facilities are shut 
down.  Young people are also suffering.  For the young people who 
are attending university, some of their tuition and the moneys 
they need to continue their education have been cut off because 
of this mismanagement.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It reaches beyond the band as well. The Oromocto band with the 
assistance of the departments of Indian affairs and northern 
development and fisheries have moved into the commercial fishery 
and we all support that.  It is to make the band self-sufficient. 
Everyone of us supports that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty is that neither the department of Indian affairs 
nor the fisheries department want to take responsibility for 
moneys that are still owing the private sector in the fishing 
communities in southern New Brunswick. It has left some of those 
people in a very difficult position. That $1.3 million the band 
owes, if you wish, the moneys which they do not have to pay their 
bills, reaches outside the Indian community as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question that I had for the minister on November 25 was to 
see if she could expedite a process to relieve this difficulty 
both on and off the reserve.  That is the point I am making here 
this evening as well.  I am hoping that can be resolved. I did 
mention previously that they did have a cash advance of $464,000 
but that still has not paid the bills in the private sector in 
southern New Brunswick nor all of the bills on the reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am hoping that a resolution to this can be found somewhere.  I 
think it has to be the tightening of the regulations between 
departments and the drafting of some of these guidelines when we 
attempt to move our native people into the traditional fisheries. 
Bureaucrats at both fisheries and Indian affairs and northern 
development are making these proposals and drafting this 
legislation with the appropriate guidelines but apparently those 
guidelines do not work. They fall short of the line and the 
reporting procedures do not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of this delay we are moving into the Christmas 
season of all times to see people going without and they are 
hurting both on and off the reserve.  I am hoping that the 
parliamentary secretary can respond favourably tonight and tell 
us that yes indeed those guidelines have been tightened and yes 
indeed this problem has been recognized and will be resolved very 
shortly.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Officials from the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern

band council. These meetings proved to be very productive.  The 
department is currently working with the First Nation to assist 
in implementing the auditor's recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development 
has been working with the First Nation through a co-manager, the 
current financial situation at Oromocto indicates a need for 
outside intervention.  The department has contracted the services 
of a third party to work with the First Nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will ensure there is the required financial control on the

capacity of the Oromocto First Nation so that it will be able to 
assume control in the long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to keep in mind that First Nations are not 
federal agencies.  While First Nations do receive and administer 
funds from the department for specific purposes, they may enter 
into contractual agreements with other parties.  These are

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, over two months ago I rose in the House to ask a 
question of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans concerning the 
devastating plight of B.C. fishers and coastal communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the minister what leadership he was prepared to show to 
assist fishers who lost their jobs, their livelihoods and in many 
cases their hope as a result of the impact of the Mifflin plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time over two months ago the minister said that the 
member should be patient.  The patience of British Columbians has 
run out.  The hopes of British Columbians, particularly in 
coastal communities and particularly fishers, are fast running 
out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just this week we heard from the daughter of one of those 
fishers.  She is a 13 year old girl named Julie Nygren whose 
father and mother have been involved in fishing for many years. 
She says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It's hard to understand why our government won't stand up to the 
Americans and tell them it isn't fair to take our salmon. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Referring to the minister she says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that he isn't doing enough for B.C., or for Canada. He's 
almost on the American side. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder where the minister is.  He is from British Columbia, 
yet time and time again when it comes to speaking out for British 
Columbia too often he is attacking British Columbia, attacking 
the premier of British Columbia, and speaking up for the United 
States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Community Fisheries Development Centre has put a proposal 
before the government, before the Minister of Human Resources 
Development and the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, urging an 
active labour market transition program to put the people who 
have lost their jobs as a result of the Mifflin plan back to 
work.  It is not a TAGS program.  It is an active labour market 
program to find training certification programs to get them 
involved in restoring habitat, for example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the federal auditor general pointed out that the 
federal fisheries department had been very lax in standing up for 
fisheries habitat.  Instead of finger pointing I urge the 
government to come up with a program that gets the scientists to 
work together collaboratively, federally and provincially, to 
restore habitat and put people back to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also appeal to the federal Liberal government, in addition to 
supporting the $375 million transition program, to take a strong 
and constructive stand on the ongoing concern around the salmon 
treaty.  I appeal to the government to join the British Columbia 
lawsuit.  B.C. fisheries minister Corky Evans has appealed to the 
federal government to stand up, get involved and speak out on 
behalf of the people of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that the Government of Canada joined a lawsuit earlier on 
behalf of United States tribes.  I wonder why it is that it is 
not prepared to do the same thing with respect to the people of 
British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I appeal to the Government of Canada to speak out 
against the proposed seizure of fish boats by the Alaskans and to 
recognize that it would be a very destructive step at this very 
sensitive time when the eminent persons, Mr. Ruckelshaus and Mr. 
Strangway, are attempting to arrive at a solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The stakeholder process has failed.  What we need is political 
leadership at the highest possible level:  the prime minister's 
office, the minister's office and the office of the president of 
the United States.  We need strong transition programs but we 
also need a government that is prepared to stand up to ensure 
that the principles of the salmon treaty, particularly the equity 
principle, is respected and that B.C. coastal communities and 
fishers are able to live with dignity.

continue to use the services of the centre as the need arises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the beginning, the role of Human Resources Development 
Canada has been to assist west coast fisheries workers adjust to 
the structural changes to their industry and the poor fishing 
seasons of the past two years.  HRDC has used a strategic 
approach to address the challenges of the industry.  Together 
with local community and industry partners in the fishing sector, 
the government has ensured that services offered met the 
individual needs of affected workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past two years the government has committed over $22 
million, funding 129 projects to assist over 3,600 people.  While 
some of the reasons employment assistance is needed have changed 
from the previous two years, the government will continue to work 
closely with industry associations to develop and deliver both 
short term and long term interventions to help individual fishers 
and coastal communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Human Resources Development Canada will build on the work of the 
past two years to ensure that helping fishing industry workers 
remains a priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me assure the House that all projects have helped improve 
the employability of individual workers.  Local officials have 
received very positive feedback from workers, unions and local 
communities about the value of the assistance offered by the 
Government of Canada.  This was reflected in the recent report of 
the Community Fisheries Development Centre summarizing its work 
with Human Resources Development Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to refer here to a question that I asked the Minister of 
Human Resources Development on November 27 last. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure that everyone understands the background, I will remind 
the House what that question was: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister recently said that BC mine workers were not 
interested in a POWA. 
Yet, these workers are currently protesting in front of the 
minister's Montreal office. They are asking for a modified 
POWA. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the term I used, “a modified POWA”. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the repeated requests made by the former BC mine 
workers, will the minister finally see the light and take the 
necessary steps to ensure their financial security? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was my question. Here is what the Minister of Human Resources 
Development answered: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw the hon. member's attention— 
</UL>
<—and he was showing a document— 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—to a letter, dated the 27 and signed by the union president, 
which I am prepared to table in the House. It says clearly 
that the workers want an improved POWA, that they are not 
interested in a traditional POWA, only in an improved one. 
Therefore this has nothing to do with what the hon. member is 
asking for. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister finally show a bit of compassion and stop playing 
with words? I am asking for a modified POWA, and he is saying that what 
the workers want is an improved POWA. It is the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether we call it an improved POWA, a modified POWA, I could not 
care less, but was is important is that he wake up and that he give to 
the BC mine workers what they are entitled to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call it a modified POWA for the simple reason that Jean Dupéré, 
the president of Lab Chrysotile, is willing to contribute a considerable 
amount to the program that existed before, the POWA. Furthermore, Louise 
Harel wrote to the Minister of Human Resources Development to tell him 
that she was to ready to match any contribution that the minister might 
make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is an intelligent man. He has already proven that in 
the past. Why is he playing with the intelligence of BC mine workers by 
speaking of improved instead of modified?

<A HREF="#LINKT96"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I had used the term “improved POWA”, he would have said “They do 
not want an improved POWA, they want a modified POWA”. The minister is 
not lying, of course I am not allowed to say this here, but he is 
playing with words, to a certain extent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Human Resources Development, by showing a letter 
from Mr. Laliberté, the president of the workers who were paid by the 
hour, tried to undermine his credibility, and I found this extremely 
regrettable. What the workers of the former BC mine want is an improved 
POWA. If he does not like the word “improved”, he can use a similar 
word, I repeat that I really do not care. The fact is that Jean Dupéré 
is ready to contribute a substantial amount of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for myself, right now, I want to tell all the BC mine workers 
that I will never let them down in their attempt to get an improved or 
a modified POWA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human 
Resources Development, who will be answering later, will show a bit more 
compassion than— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> The Parliamentary Secretary 
to the Minister of Human Resources Development has the floor. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK267"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member has asked this question on a number of occasions.  He 
knows very well that the government is concerned about the 
situation of Black Lake miners and that it was among the first to 
come to their aid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Human Resources Development indicated in the 
House on several occasions that he has set aside nearly $3 
million to help the miners remain active members of the labour 
force.  The member across the way has repeatedly asked the 
government to help the miners through the program for older 
workers adjustment.  The fact is, and the hon. member knows this, 
POWA no longer exists.  POWA ended last March because it was not 
fair or equitable to all the workers in Quebec or elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This cost shared program was only offered in some provinces and 
contained so many restrictions that many older workers simply 
could not qualify.  Furthermore, POWA offered only passive income 
support and did nothing to help workers adapt to a changing 
labour force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of continuing to offer such ineffective support, forward 
looking governments like ours are focusing their efforts to offer 
Canadians active measures which will help workers improve their 
skills so they remain in the labour force and can adapt to a 
changing work place and a changing economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Human Resources Development is very sensitive to 
the needs of these individuals, so much so that he met with their 
representatives on October 29, 1997.  The workers informed the 
minister that POWA did not meet their expectations and asked that 
special measures be taken along the lines of those adopted by the 
Government of Quebec in similar situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government is ready to work with the province and the 
employer to help these workers, but it cannot help them through a 
program which no longer exists.  The government is offering the 
workers $3 million worth of active measures including target late 
subsidies, self-employment assistance and skills development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the kinds of improvements and the kinds of issues that 
we would like to bring forward.  We ask the member to bring that 
back to the people in his riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Hon. members, before 
we go to the next member, in a previous dissertation an hon. 
member came perilously close to what I would consider to be 
unparliamentary language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not intervene at the time, but I want it very clearly put 
on the record that even in a back-handed manner we do not refer 
to other hon. members as liars under any circumstance.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>THE ECONOMY 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK269"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
there is a growing gap between the health of the economy and the 
well-being of Canadians according to a recent report on an 
experimental index of social health developed by Human Resources 
Development Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This index suggests that since the late 1970s improvements in 
the economy have not been matched by increases in the social 
well-being of Canadians.  On the contrary, it shows that as the 
economy has grown Canadian social health has in fact declined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The index is composed of 15 indicators, some of which apply to 
all age groups.  Others such as infant mortality, teen suicide, 
weekly earnings of adults and poverty among the elderly apply to 
specific age groups. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1915"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT97"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this suggests that it is not enough to take care of the 
economy and then just assume that the economy will take care of 
the welfare and well-being of individuals.  The government needs 
to be and must be more proactive to ensure the well-being of all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What exactly does the parliamentary secretary of human resources 
development suggest be done by the federal government to narrow 
this gap and to ensure that, as the economy moves up, so too does 
the well-being of all Canadians? 
<P><A NAME="LINK270"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
government is quite concerned with the social well-being of 
Canadians and believes in stimulating public discussion on this 
very important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed this was the very purpose of the study mentioned by the 
hon. member.  The member should note, however, that there was no 
consensus on how to best measure social well-being.  In fact, the 
study itself explicitly rejects the idea that the index on social 
health is the only or even the best way to measure social 
well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nonetheless, as the hon. member suggests in his question, the 
Government of Canada has a key role to play in social areas and 
in levelling the playing field for all Canadians.  Canadians 
demand that we live up to this responsibility and it is a 
challenge we will gladly meet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why, in the Speech from the Throne, it was clearly 
stated that budgetary surpluses would be split on a 50:50 basis 
over the course of the second mandate, with half going to 
investments in social and economic priorities and half going to a 
combination of tax reductions and debt repayment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is this government has brought order to the nation's 
finances.  We have put our fiscal house in order and in this way 
we have regained the ability to address the priorities of 
Canadians, that is, our children and youth, our health care and 
education, our communities and our knowledge and creativity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to make social investments responsibly and with 
vigilance in strengthening the economy and working with our 
partners to solve the problem of unemployment, particularly youth 
unemployment, building a better future for our children by 
working with the provinces on a new national child benefit and a 
national children's agenda, ensuring Canadians get the education 
and skills they need to find jobs and work in new industries and 
ensuring that persons with disabilities have the tools they need 
to fully participate in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is committed to working effectively and 
efficiently with all its partners to modernize social programs 
for the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  A motion to adjourn 
the House is now deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, this 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 7.17 p.m.)
