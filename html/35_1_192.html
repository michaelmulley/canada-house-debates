moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House denounce the will of the federal government to restrict the 
provinces to the role of mere consultant by imposing on them new national 
standards for all social programs through the introduction of the Canada 
Social Transfer, which will enable the federal government to interfere even 
more in such areas as health, post-secondary education and social assistance, 
all of which come under exclusive provincial jurisdiction.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, this motion is presented by the official 
opposition as part of a very important debate that started 
recently with the tabling of Bill C-76 by the federal 
government.
<P>
	We are accustomed to seeing all sorts of things in politics, but 
I must say that in this case, the discrepancy between what the 
government says and what is actually going on is beyond belief.
<P>
	Last Sunday, at a meeting of the provincial wing of the federal 
Liberal Party in Trois-Rivières, the Prime Minister made an 
extremely aggressive speech-and this is an understatement, 
considering the tone and the content of what he said-in which 
he accused the present Government of Quebec of ignoring the 
acute poverty problems of Quebec. The Prime Minister based 
this accusation on the fact that Quebec has a very substantial 
level of poverty, borne out by the announcement the week before 
that more than 800,000 people in Quebec were living on welfare.
<P>
	The Prime Minister exclaimed, to the sound of thunderous 
applause by his supporters, that the Government of Quebec was 
to blame, the government of Mr. Parizeau who was so obsessed 
with the referendum question on sovereignty that he ignored his 
basic duty which was to deal with the issue of poverty in 
Quebec.
<P>
	Personally, as I listened to the news Sunday night on 
television, I had the impression that I was watching an arsonist 
accusing firefighters of doing a poor job, because in this 
particular case, the government that is most at fault, a 
government that, since it came to power, has been totally 
aggressive in its treatment of the vulnerable and unemployed 
members of our society, a government that has done more than 
any other to aggravate poverty in Canada and Quebec especially, 
since Quebec is still part of Canada and is still in a position to be 
treated this way by the Canadian federal system, by decisions 
that are made in Ottawa, that government has hit hardest at the 
unemployed.
<P>
	We had an election campaign in which the Liberal Party of 
Canada very skilfully read the mood of the people and realized 
that Canadians and Quebecers had serious concerns about jobs, 
maintaining social programs and maintaining the federal 
government's contribution to the implementation of its own 
programs. The Prime Minister managed to get elected on the 
basis of three words, which were always the same: jobs, jobs, 
jobs. All this is in the so-called red book which contains the 
Liberal government's promises.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
	However, for some time now there have been no more 
references to the red book. I remember that during the first year 
we were here in the House, practically every speech by a Liberal 
minister or member ended with an enthusiastic reference to the 
Liberal Party's commitments in the red book. The red book has 
now become invisible. All we have now is a black list of social 
program commitments abdicated by the Liberal government.
<P>
	The facts are there. The figures are eloquent and irrefutable. 
What has this government done to alleviate the problems created 
by poverty? What has it done? In fact, every action taken in the 
budget, every policy is aimed at aggravating the situation.
<P>
	Let us go back to the beginning. In January 1994, the Liberals 
tabled Bill C-3 which extended the ceiling on equalization 
payments, so that the provinces would receive $1.5 billion less 
during the next five years. We have no figures for this year, but 
experience has shown that when equalization payments are cut, 
Quebec has to pick up at least 40 per cent of the slack.
<P>
	There is more. This was a good start, but there is more. In 
February 1994, the federal government's first budget did what? 
It started by cutting $5.5 billion at the expense of the 
unemployed, which means the UI system had to do without $5.5 
billion, while an additional $2 billion was cut at the expense of 
welfare recipients and the education system, all in the same 
1994 budget for the years 1994-95 to 1996-97.
<P>
	Furthermore, according to an internal document of the 
Department of Human Resources Development, in 1995-96, 
Quebec alone will be stuck with 31 per cent of the cuts in 
unemployment insurance benefits made in the Liberals' first 
budget. This is stage two of the federal Liberal plan to aggravate 
the situation of the poor and the vulnerable in our society.
<P>
	Now, Mr. Speaker, we come to the February 1995 budget, a 
federal budget carved out with a really sharp axe. It reduced 
program funding transferred to the provinces by an additional $7 
billion, and this translates into a reduction in benefits for people 
on welfare, for students and the sick. In addition, funding for the 
unemployment insurance system was cut by another $700 
million. You may say that is quite a sum. I just hope that enough 
is enough. But no, I do not think that  the Liberals will stop at 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12031"> 12031 </A></B>
<P>
that, because one group has not been hit hard enough in their 
opinion, and that is seniors.
<P>
	Obviously, in this case, they realize how sensitive the issue is, 
that it is particularly despicable and that they are walking a fine 
line between what is acceptable and what is unacceptable. 
Nevertheless, they will not hesitate to make the move because 
they have already announced it. They said in the February 1995 
budget that they were going to re-examine the old age pension 
plan. Who could be so naive as to think that a government which 
has done nothing but cut social programs since it came to power 
will actually increase old age pensions when it scrutinizes that 
program? Nobody.
<P>
	Therefore, why the review if they are not going to increase 
pensions? The answer is quite clear. They are reviewing them in 
order to axe them. Obviously, old age pensions will not be 
spared by the Liberals, who realize that after cutting funding for 
the sick, recipients of welfare and students, another potential 
target for cuts remains: pensioners.
<P>
	They accuse me of demagogy. But, after citing all those facts 
and figures, I challenge any Liberal member to stand in front of 
me and deny even by one iota what I have just said, because I 
have just given a truthful rendition of the Liberals' actions. It is 
recorded in the public accounts, it is written in the reports to the 
House. It is part of the harsh, day-to-day reality of all those who 
suffer the consequences of this reprehensible attitude towards 
social programs.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	I regret that the government decided to hit old age pensions. It 
is obvious that the government is initiating a far-reaching 
operation, but it will encounter an opposition blockade when 
push comes to shove.
<P>
	At any rate, they have already cut the net income of seniors by 
$500 million through the tax increase they imposed on them in 
the 1994 budget. And the same Prime Minister leading the same 
government stepped up to the microphone one fine Sunday at the 
end of April in Trois-Rivières in Quebec, in an area hard hit by 
this problem, to say to hundreds of people frantically waving 
small Canadian flags that the Government of Quebec and the 
sovereignists are to blame for this.
<P>
	Quebec is not yet a sovereign state. Our current state of affairs 
and all of our problems and social traumas are the federal 
regime's doing.
<P>
	To refresh the memory of Liberal members, the truth is that 
for the next three years, if we add up all of the cuts contained in 
the last two budgets, Quebec will be deprived of close to $10 
billion in social program financing for those years. It will be 
deprived of $9.7 billion, I repeat, $9.7 billion. That is what the 
arrival of the federal Liberals in Ottawa has brought.
<P>
	We can look at all of this in terms of percentages, one simple 
figure to sum up the past 15 years. We all well know that the 
federal government has justified its existence and seen its role in 
relation to its contribution to social programs for a long time 
now. This used to be one of the federal regime's good points, 
which, we recognize, helped to make this country more civilized 
and a place in which wealth was more evenly shared and the less 
fortunate were treated with compassion. But for 15 years now, 
this has no longer been the case and the government has been 
moving away from these principles at a dizzying pace.
<P>
	Take Quebec for example. In 1980, the federal government's 
share in funding for Quebec's social programs was close to 50 
per cent. In 1997, the government's share will be only 28 per 
cent. This represents a drop of close to half of its contribution, 
an amount that will continue to shrink because we know that the 
federal government is leaning towards withdrawing its share of 
funding for programs, although they are essential.
<P>
	Figures do not lie. We are talking about statistics, amounts of 
money, resources and percentages. And other figures are so 
much more telling, more dramatic: they are about people. In the 
end, it is not a matter of things being left up in the air, of things 
being left at a level of an academic discussion or of things not 
going beyond debate in the House. No, in the end, it is a matter 
of people getting it in the neck, and this is what the Liberals do 
not understand. But they used to understand, and that was one of 
the grand traditions of the Liberal Party, which set it apart from 
the Conservative Party and from the Reform Party. Now, they 
are all one and the same, because it means nothing to them 
anymore. They forget, for example, that, in Quebec, since the 
Liberals came to power, the number of people on welfare has 
increased by 53,590. Almost 54,000 more people now live on 
social assistance in Quebec since the arrival of the Liberals.
<P>
	We are well aware that the new social assistance recipients, 
those new people on the welfare rolls, come from the ranks of 
the 40 percent of former UI claimants whose benefits were cut 
off. This too is one of the fine achievements of the Liberal Party 
in Ottawa. Not only did they reduce unemployment insurance 
benefits, they raised unemployment insurance contributions. 
What is more, they tightened restrictions so that fewer and fewer 
people can access UI benefits. Conclusion: people have stayed 
on welfare.
<P>
	When the Prime Minister, whom I might call the social 
arsonist, arrives in Trois-Rivières and blames the Government 
of Quebec for the increase in poverty, there is no doubt in our 
minds that he is the one responsible for the growing numbers on 
the welfare rolls through his hateful restrictions. The Prime 
Minister of Canada is turning people into welfare cases.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12032"> 12032 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> That is the truth.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard: </B>So now things have to be glossed over, kept 
hidden, and the best way, in the government's mind, to do so is to 
use new terms. So we have a marvellous new term: the Canada 
social transfer. It was preceded by trial balloons announcing the 
government's withdrawal from provincial jurisdiction, its 
confinement to its own jurisdictions and its transfer of money to 
the provinces to enable them to meet their responsibilities, and 
the rabbit that popped out of the hat was the Canada social 
transfer.
<P>
	We might have wondered what was happening at the 
beginning, but now we know, because it is in black and white in 
Bill C-76. The bill lets us know very clearly what it is all about. 
It is about a centralizing assault, the likes of which we have not 
seen since the shameful patriation of 1982. For the first time in 
15 years, the government is charging ahead, visor raised, along 
the route of massive and unequivocal centralization. It says so in 
the bill.
<P>
	Now the federal government will not be content just to 
encroach on provincial jurisdiction. It will not be satisfied with 
legal opinions from the Department of Justice. It will not be 
satisfied by merely appeasing its appetite for power. It is going 
to set up a legislative framework for itself to achieve its end. 
This framework is known as Bill C-76, legislation that is a 
charade as well, because it is one of the ways the federal 
government is concealing the fact that it is dumping its poor 
management onto the provinces.
<P>
	It is also charade, because the government is using it to mask 
the extent of the cuts it is imposing on the provinces. And it is an 
even greater charade, because it is claiming falsely to eliminate 
national standards. The fact of the matter is that no bill has ever 
given the federal government so much power to impose national 
standards. This does not apply just to the traditional social 
programs; it is throughout the bill. For the first time, a bill 
explicitly provides for the federal government's imposition of 
standards in post-secondary education, an area that is clearly 
under provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	For the first time, the federal government is empowering 
itself to say: ``I do not like this educational program. You will do 
it this way, or I will cut funding''. Same thing for social 
programs. Do not just take my word for it. Many observers and 
analysts have noted and seen very clearly that the aim of the 
exercise is to confirm the $7 billion cuts announced for the next 
three years and to give the federal government the power to 
dictate the set-up of the provinces' social programs to which it 
will be contributing less and less.
<P>
	I said authoritative voices have said this. I will quote, for 
example, Lise Bissonnette, who wrote the following in an 
editorial in <I>Le Devoir</I> last week. She said: ``According to Bill 
C-76, post-secondary education is now comparable to a social 
program. The bill allows Ottawa to apply national standards, in 
this area, as in  others. The provinces, whose jurisdiction over 
education is as clear as it can be in the Canadian Constitution, 
are at best assured of consultation''.
<P>
	<I>La Presse</I> agrees with <I>Le Devoir</I>. It may reassure the Liberals 
to know that in the March 31, 1995 edition of <I>La Presse</I>, Chantal 
Hébert writes, ``With the bill tabled in the Commons to 
implement its February budget, the federal government opens 
the door to the unilateral imposition of new national standards in 
areas such as post-secondary education, child care, etc. In fact, 
Bill C-76 now restricts the provinces to the role of mere 
consultant in this exercise. The bill has no provision requiring 
the provinces' prior consent to the introduction of new national 
standards for social programs''.
<P>
	In <I>Le Devoir</I> of April 21, Conrad Yakabusski himself writes, 
``Although Ottawa boasted in its February 27 budget of having 
freed the provinces of Canadian standards in the management of 
social programs, the Chrétien government now wants to make 
them adhere to a whole series of new national principles that 
would apply to a wider range of programs. And although it 
claims it wants the provinces to comply voluntarily with these 
principles, the federal government is about to give itself the 
powers it needs to impose them in case the provinces refuse to 
do so''.
<P>
	In closing, I will also quote Giles Gherson, principal secretary 
to Mr. Axworthy, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, who said, ``What would occur after the failure of 
negotiations aimed at setting national standards remains 
ambiguous''.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	The bill that is the subject of today's motion clearly shows 
what will occur if the announced negotiations between the 
federal government and the provinces do not result in an 
agreement. Without an agreement, it is clear that the 
government will find in this bill all the latitude and power it 
needs to impose its standards. I am very concerned when I hear 
that it is preparing to tell provincial governments like that of 
Quebec that if they do not comply, their funding will be cut off.
<P>
	Meanwhile, a historic, essential process is unfolding in 
Quebec: the preparation of a referendum on sovereignty. It is not 
every day that a people can decide whether it should face its 
future as a sovereign people or a province. Quebec will do this in 
the fall. The federal government, which has the nerve to tell us it 
will propose a type of flexible federalism after the referendum, 
is clearly showing us today what Quebec can expect if it stays in 
the Canadian federation.
<P>
	If Quebec stays in the Canadian federation, we can expect to 
live under the boot of the federal government, to let federal 
bureaucrats and politicians set standards for Quebec's social and 
education programs. They have the nerve to say this to us now, 
when we are on the verge of making our decision. I can tell you 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12033"> 12033 </A></B>
<P>
that Quebecers are taking note of this and that this will weigh 
heavily in the outcome of the Quebec referendum.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to the remarks made by the hon. 
Leader of the Opposition. It is pure demagoguery. I said so 
during his speech earlier, but I repeat it now for the whole House 
to hear because this is how I feel about it.
<P>
	I must say that quite extraordinary things were just said. We 
have just heard the Leader of the Opposition talk about new 
terms. The Leader of the Opposition, the expert in newspeak, as 
Mr. Orwell called it in his novel entitled <I>1984</I>, accused the 
government of using new terms. Members opposite, who are 
afraid to use the word separatism and use sovereignty instead, 
who do not want to hold a referendum unless they are sure of 
winning it, while rejecting federalism, talk about a federalist 
sovereignty, which means sovereignty with a federal 
parliament-you can see the distinction: a federalist 
sovereignty, but not federalism. That is the difference in the 
world according to the Leader of the Opposition.
<P>
	He spoke of massive centralization, while social groups come 
to Ottawa to denounce what they describe as a restriction of 
federal powers resulting from Bill C-76. I say that they are both 
going too far. There are those who, like the Leader of the 
Opposition, are prone to exaggeration by nature and see the 
devil at work everywhere. While he, naturally, sees excessive 
federal presence just about everywhere, others, on the other 
hand- This is a very serious issue and if the members opposite 
think otherwise, maybe they should listen to something else than 
their leader's speech.
<P>
	I have a question for the Leader of the Opposition. He 
denounced what he called national standards in child care.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	I heard him speak in support of what reporter Chantal Hébert 
said. In his remarks, he supported her position, coming out 
against so-called national standards supposedly set in the bill on 
child care.
<P>
	I wonder if he can think back to the election campaign in 
which he himself ran, in June 1988. Does he remember that there 
was a bill before the House at the time, a Conservative bill to 
establish a national child care system, and that he voted for this 
bill, that he went on to campaign with Mr. Mulroney and that, 
during the campaign, the public was told that the bill had to be 
dropped after third reading, after being adopted by the House, 
because the Senate had asked for one more day to consider the 
bill in committee? How could he get himself elected in a 
government that wanted to establish a system that he now 
accuses others of trying to impose?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Mr. Speaker, first, I want to make two 
comments on the hon. member's preamble regarding a winning 
referendum. Indeed, there is a fundamental difference between 
Ottawa's federalists and us, Bloc members and sovereignists in 
general. The difference is that we want a winning referendum, so 
that Quebecers can be a fully sovereign nation, like a normal 
people. We know full well that federal Liberals want a losing 
referendum.
<P>
	The federal government hopes that Quebec will once again go 
down on its knees, so that it can satisfy its centralizing needs and 
finish the dirty job started in 1982.
<P>
	As for social groups, the member tells us that they come in 
droves on Parliament Hill to urge the federal government to 
impose even more standards on the provinces. First, we did not 
see much of these groups and, second, I think the member is 
mistaken.
<P>
	These groups are not asking the federal government to set 
bureaucratic rules and increase its bureaucracy to control the 
provinces. They are asking the Liberal government to pursue its 
efforts, so that provinces can maintain civilized social programs 
which make sense. This is what people are asking the federal 
government.
<P>
	I have a suggestion for the Liberal member who just made that 
statement. When he meets with social groups making such 
complaints about the provinces while extolling the virtues of the 
federal government regarding social programs, he should 
provide them with figures indicating what the Liberal Party has 
done to them in the last two years. He should tell these groups 
that this Liberal government made drastic cuts in the UI 
program, that it also made cuts in social programs through 
transfer payments, that the situation will get worse year after 
year, and that his government is also about to target old age 
pensions. If the member tells these facts to social groups, they 
will go back to their provinces, because that is where their 
interests are best served. Indeed, the effort is primarily made at 
that level, thanks to the generosity and compassion of Canadians 
and Quebecers, not at the level of federal bureaucrats and 
politicians, who are constantly finding new ways to stop 
contributing to that effort.
<P>
	Thirdly, the child care program goes back to 1988, which is 
some time ago, but I clearly remember it. The legislation 
included provisions giving full scope to the provinces, while 
respecting their jurisdiction. It is the Liberal Party which 
instructed its majority in the Senate to block this $5 billion 
initiative designed to set up a true child care program.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to ask the Leader of the Opposition a straightforward 
question.
<P>
	If the federal government gave provinces exclusive 
jurisdiction over health, education, culture, language and 
immigration as per the Jean Allaire report, would the Leader of 
the Opposi-

tion then withdraw his pursuit of  separation and agree to 
recommend to Quebecers to stay in Canada?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Mr. Speaker, we will all agree that it is a 
purely hypothetical question.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	We only have to look at the Liberals opposite; they are 
petrified at the thought that these issues might be raised in the 
House. The track record of the Liberals, the federal government, 
the federal system and the efforts made to renew the Canadian 
Constitution and federalism has consistently been dismal.
<P>
	I will be frank with the the member; I would have been 
delighted by such an offer when I was a federal minister and I 
would certainly have accepted it since I was ready to accept the 
Meech Lake accord, which did not even go that far. But, since we 
could not have the absolute minimum, we will never have the 
maximum. We will not settle for anything less than Quebec's 
sovereignty .
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, you know, when 
you are the finance minister, when you hold an economic 
portfolio in a government, and even when your portfolio is not 
an economic one as was the case for the Leader of the Official 
Opposition, you really care about people's priorities.
<P>
	Obviously, the priorities of Quebecers, and Canadians as a 
whole, are job creation, and a meaningful future for their 
children and their fellow citizens. This is why it is so 
disappointing for Quebecers and Canadians to hear, day in and 
day out, the Leader of the Official Opposition and his acolytes 
talk about a political agenda which has nothing to do with the 
well-being of Quebecers.
<P>
	This is why it is so disappointing not to hear them talk about 
deficit reduction, fiscal restraint, new technologies. They never 
talk about the environment. They never talk about what really 
matters to the Canadian people because they have a political 
agenda which creates uncertainty and has nothing to do with a 
country's true objectives in an increasingly interdependent 
world.
<P>
	As a result, once again, we are presented today with an empty 
shell. The opposition really wants to waste the time of the House 
when it should be dealing with the real challenges facing our 
country and debate issues other than the fruit of the Bloc's 
imagination.
<P>
	Let us be perfectly clear, the objective, the plan of the federal 
government was clearly laid out in the budget speech. In the 
budget speech, which can be read in both official languages, one 
can see that it does not intend to impose anything on the 
provinces, or deliver the goods in the manner unfortunately 
described by the Leader of the Opposition in the speech he just 
made.
<P>
	Let us be clear, under the new system, there will be fewer 
conditions governing the use the provinces can make of 
transfers. The provinces will no longer have to abide by rules 
specifying which expenses are eligible for cost-sharing and 
which ones are not. They will be free-let us be clear about 
that-to adopt innovative mechanisms regarding social security 
reform according to their own priorities.
<P>
	A more flexible needs test will allow the provinces to make 
income support and non-monetary benefits more universally 
available to low income earners or to people who were on 
welfare and are entering the labour market. It is for these people 
that we are here. It is for these people that we made these 
amendments. It is these people that each and every politician in 
this House should care about, instead of trying to deceive 
Quebecers with a political adventure creating constant 
uncertainty in a world in great need of more certainty.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	Federal subsidies could be used to support, for example, the 
PWA program in Quebec and other types of income supplement 
programs for low income families and workers. That was not the 
case previously. Also, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development will invite all provincial governments to work 
together, through mutual consent. This means that absolutely no 
condition will be imposed to the provinces. Mutual consent 
means mutual consent. Both parties will have to be in 
agreement. They will meet to develop a set of shared principles 
and objectives that could underlie the Canada social transfer.
<P>
	Through today's motion, the official opposition is trying to 
turn our project, which was so well received by the people in 
Quebec and in all of Canada-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard):</B> -to turn the development 
of a set of shared principles into a contrived issue. These hon. 
members would like the House, Quebecers and Canadians to 
believe that this whole process is nothing but a plot to 
underhandedly impose new conditions, methods or penalties. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to tell you that it is not so.
<P>
	Just in case the Bloc members were daydreaming that day, 
although I do not believe so, let me remind you of what I said 
during the budget speech I delivered on February 27, 1995: ``I 
will be inviting all provincial governments to work together on 
developing, through mutual consent, a set of shared principles 
and objectives that could underlie the Canada social transfer''. 
This is exactly the commitment we are making in Bill C-76, 
without adding or deleting anything.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12035"> 12035 </A></B>
<P>
	Of course, if there are problems, we will introduce 
amendments, but the goal of the government is clear: we do not 
want to impose anything on the provinces, we want to help the 
provinces and the federal government to put their financial 
houses in order and to give provinces a lot more flexibility. This 
is why I am so pleased to confirm today what the opposition 
leader has a little trouble with, which is our commitment to 
propose to the appropriate committee the following 
amendments.
<P>
	To establish interim arrangements to finance social programs 
in a manner that will increase provincial flexibility. The 
amendment reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Maintaining the national criteria and conditions in the Canada Health Act, 
including those respecting public administration, comprehensiveness, 
universality, portability and accessibility</BLOCKQUOTE>
and the provisions relating to extra-billing and user charges.
<P>
	Also, to apply the national criterion stipulated in section 19 
which requires or allows no minimum period of residence as a 
condition for eligibility for social assistance. The amendment 
reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Promoting any shared principles and objectives that are developed, 
pursuant to subsection (3), with respect to the operation of social programs, 
other than a program for the purpose referred to in paragraph (<I>b</I>).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Canada Health and Social Transfer shall consist of, (a) a federal 
income tax reduction in favour of the provinces that would enable the 
provinces to impose their own tax measures without a net increase in taxation; 
and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) a cash contribution not exceeding the amount computed in accordance 
with section 14.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Minister of Human Resources Development shall invite representatives 
of all the provinces to consult and work together to develop, through mutual 
consent, a set of shared principles and objectives for the other social programs 
referred to in paragraph 1(<I>d</I>) that could underlie the Canada Health and Social 
Transfer.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	When I spoke on the budget I made it clear that the 
government's objectives were to clean up the nation's finances, 
to put the country once again on a sound financial footing and, at 
the same time, to give the provinces far greater flexibility in the 
elaboration and the design of a multitude of social programs.
<P>
	We made it very clear we were imposing only two conditions 
on that transfer. The first was that the objectives of the Canada 
Health Act must be respected. It is a covenant of the government 
with the Canadian people. We will never allow that to be taken 
away.
<P>
	Second, the only standard that would be imposed on other 
social transfers would be that no minimum residency 
requirement be necessary for CAP. We would not allow 
provinces to take welfare away from people because they had 
not had a long term residence within that province.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I said very clearly in this House that we had no intention of 
imposing anything else on the provinces, that we had no 
intention of imposing new national standards, that the minister 
simply wanted to sit down with his provincial counterparts to 
discuss freely with them issues such as Canadian values and the 
smooth running of both federal and provincial governments.
<P>
	It is hard to understand that, with all the opportunities we have 
of working together to create jobs for our young people and to 
reduce poverty in Quebec, the members opposite have chosen to 
sidestep this issue. They come here with an artificial problem 
that has nothing to do with the truth and the reality of our 
country and of our budget.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is the official opposition. It has a 
responsibility to Canadians to speak for the nation. Members of 
the Bloc Quebecois talk about having an economic union. They 
talk about working with Canada. Let Canadians understand the 
way members of the Bloc Quebecois see working. Will they 
speak for the nation? No. Will they speak for national interest? 
No. Will they speak for Canadians' desire to have jobs? No. Will 
they speak for those who would take Canadians out of poverty 
and give our children a chance for a decent life? No.
<P>
	What do they do? Day after day they come into the House and 
stand up with artificial questions that have nothing to do with 
the Canadian reality. Day after day they come in, as they have 
done today, and make up a problem. This country has problems.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We do have problems. We do not have to invent them. Why 
not work with us to solve the problems we have as a country? 
Why not join Canadians from all the provinces in saying that the 
real challenges lie beyond our borders? Competition comes 
from Japan, Germany and the United States. Competition is not 
between Quebecers and Albertans, but between Canadians and 
Japanese, between Canadians and Germans. That is where we 
have to look if we want to build a strong future for ourselves.
<P>
	Instead of that, the Bloc Quebecois tried to create a problem 
because it had to find something to discuss on this opposition 
day. It decided that maybe it could mislead the people of Quebec 
by saying that the government wants to impose new national 
standards.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I can assure you and I can assure the leader of the 
opposition that this is not true.
<P>

<P>
	The Leader of the Opposition has been a member of the 
federal cabinet. He knows very well what kind of country 
Canada is, with an outstanding potential.
<P>
	Let me be quite clear. This government is going to stand up for 
the Canada Health Act. There is no doubt about that. It will not 
deviate from that policy. It will also make sure no province 
imposes residency rules that would deprive Canadian citizens of 
social benefits.
<P>
	We have also clearly stated that we do not intend in any way to 
impose national standards on any province through the budget or 
the Canadian social transfer legislation. The minister intends to 
have discussions with the provinces on whether there are other 
values or Canadian goals we should concentrate on.
<P>
	The Leader of the Opposition is sidestepping the issue for 
political reasons that have nothing to do with the day-to-day 
life of our fellow citizens.
<P>
	He and the Bloc Quebecois are once again looking for ways to 
create acrimony and uncertainty. Instead of fostering the 
well-being of Canadians, the Bloc Quebecois is trying to create 
a problem where there is none.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let this country understand that the official opposition 
refuses not only to speak for the national interest but in this 
debate is refusing to speak for the interests of Quebecers.
<P>
	There is no intention to impose anything on any province. 
There is one intention and that is to create jobs. There is one 
intention and that is to give our children a decent future. There is 
one intention and that is to protect the Canada Health Act. There 
is one intention and that is to make sure that residency is not a 
condition for welfare. There is one intention and that is for this 
country to realize every bit of its potential. It is to give this 
country and its citizens the opportunities that it has as a result of 
the tremendous talent that exists within the ground and the talent 
that walks upon it. That is what this country is all about.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The time has come for Bloc Quebecois members to join 
Quebecers who want to build our great country, Canada.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we just heard the Minister of Finance, the one 
person responsible for cuts in this government. He was the one 
who cut unemployment insurance, social programs and transfer 
payments. Then he has the nerve to tell us: ``In the budget 
speech, one can see that the government does not intend to 
impose anything on the provinces''. Has he forgotten already 
that he cut social programs and education by seven billion 
dollars for the next three years? It takes some nerve, Mr. 
Speaker.
<P>
	It takes nerve also to say that the important issue is job 
creation when this government has failed completely in this 
area. This government has done nothing for job creation. The 
only job creating program mentioned in the red book, municipal 
infrastructures, was reduced by 200 million dollars in the recent 
budget.
<P>
	So I believe people will have to be careful to sort out reality 
from inflated patriotic language and repeated protestations. 
Reality is extremely harsh and inescapable; it shows this 
government has taken a turn to the right and has decided to 
attack the unemployed, the have-nots of our society. It did 
impose 100 million dollars of additional temporary taxes on 
banks but, at the same time, decided to take 700 million dollars 
from the unemployed. This government has launched the worse 
attack ever against the have-nots of Canada.
<P>
	So when the Bloc speaks in the interest of those people it is 
talking in true legitimacy. We are very proud to say what we say 
in this House. If we were not here, nobody else would defend 
social programs and the right to strike.
<P>
	What we represent in this House is legitimate all across 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Previously, the Liberal Party and the NDP 
assumed that role, but the former now is the government and the 
later has all but disappeared. We are the only ones left in 
Canada, not only in Quebec but in Canada, to speak in this House 
for the poor, those who are the victims of this minister, the 
victims of this government. No ministerial or prime-ministerial 
speech in this House will make us forget that these people are 
persecuted by the federal government.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Second, we are being told that we are wasting 
the time of the House by discussing Bill C-76. What an 
undemocratic attitude. Have we reached the point-because we 
are sovereignists, elected as such by the people of Quebec, 
democratically, 53 of us out of 75 seats in Quebec when the 
governing party only got 20-where we can no longer express 
the reasons for our being here?
<P>
	Have we reached the point, now that the government is 
imposing new national standards in the context of an unusual 
legislative framework, where we no longer have the right to say 
that this does not make any sense, where we can no longer speak 
on behalf of the provinces or the poor, where we can no longer 
say that, yes, we are here to promote Quebec sovereignty, 
because we believe this is the only possible solution to extricate 
ourselves from the current mess, the kind of deception we are 
witnessing today?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12037"> 12037 </A></B>
<P>
	I can tell you that there is not one member here who is not 
proud to assume this historical role, and we are confident that in 
the fall the people of Quebec will prove wrong those who have 
not yet understood the Quebec reality.
<P>
	I have a question to ask the minister. He knows Quebec and, as 
a rule, he is quite democratic. I do not think his speech today was 
really democratic, but as a rule he is. He knows very well that in 
Quebec there is a consensus on the issue of manpower training.
<P>
	We talk about a lot of things, administrative arrangements in 
every possible area, but there is one thing that everybody agrees 
on in Quebec and it is that manpower training programs and the 
resources devoted to them should be in the hands of the 
Government of Quebec.
<P>
	This would do away with a lot of arguing, would prevent the 
neutralization of efforts and the wasting of energies. We could 
have better designed programs, specifically geared to Quebec 
needs. Everybody in Quebec thinks like this, including the 
leading federalists, including people like Ghislain Dufour, 
president of the Conseil du patronat. There is general agreement 
on this in Quebec.
<P>
	Being a democrat and seeking the best for Quebec, as he said, 
what is he waiting for to convince a reluctant Prime Minister-I 
know he is most reluctant-to convince his government to 
transfer all manpower training activities to Quebec with the 
necessary resources?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Leader of 
the Opposition has just accused me of being undemocratic, of 
accusing him of wasting the time of the House of Commons. Let 
us be perfectly clear: of course, the Bloc Quebecois has not only 
the right but also the obligation to enter the debate on the 
government budget.
<P>
	They certainly have the right to present their views but when, 
instead of discussing the budget, they create a phoney issue and 
make up their own budget that has nothing to do with the one we 
presented, I certainly agree that they are wasting the time not 
only of this House but also of the Canadian people.
<P>
	You see, Mr. Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition is starting 
to change his tune somewhat. Today's opposition motion reads 
in part as follows: ``-by imposing on them new national 
standards for all social programs-'' That is patently untrue. 
The motion goes on to say: ``-through the introduction of the 
Canada Social Transfer, which will enable the federal 
government to interfere even more in such areas as health, 
post-secondary education and social assistance''. That is 
patently untrue, Mr. Speaker. As I said in my budget speech and 
in the budget itself and as I reiterated again today, there is no 
intention of imposing anything on the provinces or to interfere 
in provincial matters.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	To make things even clearer, this morning, I submitted to this 
House the amendments we intend to refer to the committee that 
will consider the budget.
<P>
	Let us set the record straight. The Bloc Quebecois's motion is 
a sidestepping tactic and has nothing to do with the truth. When I 
say that you are wasting the time of the House, it is not because 
you do not have the right to discuss the budget but because you 
are making up your own budget to better attack it. I think that we 
have just received a compliment. You have just shown that it is 
impossible to attack our budget by making up your own budget 
so you could attack it.
<P>
	Second, the Leader of the Opposition raised the issue of 
transfers to the provinces. Let me tell you that when I met with 
provincial finance ministers, they told me, ``Give us notice. Do 
not take us by surprise like the previous government''. So we 
gave them two years to adjust.
<P>
	Third, they told us, ``If you are going to hit us, make sure that 
you will be hit harder''. That is what we did. We made deeper 
cuts at the federal level than at the provincial level.
<P>
	Fourth, these cuts represent less than 3 per cent of provincial 
revenue and less than 20.5 per cent of Quebec revenue. It must 
be said that, at a time when all governments must put their fiscal 
houses in order, we simply fulfilled our obligations.
<P>
	I hope that the Leader of the Opposition will talk to the head 
office, because he obviously exerts a great deal of influence 
there, and that the next time he talks to them he will suggest that 
they bring down a budget designed to put their fiscal house in 
order to create in Quebec a climate that would help the federal 
government create jobs.
<P>
	Since the Leader of the Opposition has so much influence on 
the head office, perhaps he will talk to them about their own 
cuts, because he is blaming us for the cuts they are making in 
money areas.
<P>
	I think that they should not say two different things. But 
perhaps it is possible for the leader of the Bloc Quebecois to say 
one thing and for the leader of the Parti Quebecois to say another 
thing. We face real economic and social problems. We know 
that. We know about the poverty problem and we see how 
painful it is. We know what is happening and we want to work 
together.
<P>
	In closing, I ask the Leader of the Opposition and the Bloc 
Quebecois, instead of creating phoney issues and provoking 
empty debates, to help us tackle the real problems of Quebec and 
Canada.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians watching the debate today are probably not sure 
whether the concern here is political point making or whether it 
is the welfare of the people of Canada. I hope as legislators in the 
Chamber we keep in mind the welfare of the people we represent 
and the people we serve.
<P>
	There are strong feelings on issues that are perhaps unrelated 
to the absolute welfare of Canadians. Perhaps there are agendas 
that would seek to use some of the issues as springboards. 
However it is very important today to focus on what can best be 
done to assist the people and to keep in mind there are needs and 
concerns shared right across the country.
<P>
<B>(1105 ) </B>
<P>
	We need to be honest and point out that governments can only 
do so much, whether it is a federal government or a provincial 
government. To my knowledge there has not been a government 
in history that has been able to eradicate poverty or has been able 
to relieve all citizens from hardship, from difficulty in their 
lives, from the insecurities of life with which we are concerned.
<P>
	Somehow there is a feeling or a belief that governments can 
look after all of us and prevent us from facing hardships and 
difficulties. It is not fair to Canadians to suggest that if we talk 
enough, if we accuse each other enough, if we promise enough 
or if we fight enough, everyone will be looked after.
<P>
	We can direct our minds to working together not only as 
legislators but as fellow citizens, to assisting each other, and to 
doing all we can to help those who cannot help themselves. That 
should be the real focus of the debate today.
<P>
	There is a transition in the country with respect to security for 
Canadians. For quite a few years many security programs have 
been premised on two assumptions that have proved to be false. 
The first assumption is that mother government will, can and 
should look after its citizens, support them and protect them 
from all the difficulties and contingencies of life. The second 
assumption is that government can and should do so by 
borrowing money.
<P>
	We have spoken so often about the dangerous assumptions 
and the wrong headedness of the assumptions that it is 
surprising we do not start from the premise right away. Clearly 
we do not. The reason reductions are being made in the funding 
of programs not just by the federal government but by all levels 
of government is that more and more of our income, more and 
more of our economic product, is being eaten up in compound 
interest accrued on the borrowing we have done to put the 
programs in place. Arguing about who did what to whom and 
whether cuts should be made here or there really obscures the 
central question of how we are to manage the situation we are in 
while making a firm  and proper commitment to help the people 
who are truly needy.
<P>
	My friends in the Bloc have a very legitimate point of concern 
which they have raised today about how the situation is being 
addressed. It is a situation that will not change. We are spending 
more and more of our income on interest payments. We are at the 
point where we cannot continue to fund programs on borrowed 
money. That inevitably leads to spending reductions. The 
question is not whether there should be spending reductions but 
how they should best be managed. If the debate today is intended 
to legitimately and honestly address the situation, it is very 
proper and very needed.
<P>
<B>(1110 ) </B>
<P>
	Quite frankly no plan has been advanced or proposed by the 
government or by the ministers responsible to give us a road 
map, a sense of direction on where we are going in light of the 
realities of the economy and the reality that government cannot 
deliver on the promises that it made in the past to be all things to 
all people and to preserve and protect us in every difficulty.
<P>
	I listened carefully for the visions, proposals and 
recommendations of previous speakers to Canadians who want 
security for themselves in the future. I did not hear any such 
proposal. I heard blame being assigned. I heard denials. I heard 
ridicule of concerns. However I did not hear any leader in the 
House say so far what he intends to do to address the serious 
concerns of the people.
<P>
	In many places of the world the concerns of people in 
difficulty and distress who need relief and assistance have often 
been used as vehicles to promote political agendas. I hope very 
much that will not happen in our country. Promising people 
something that no level of government can really deliver is a 
dishonest approach to a problem that we do not want to duplicate 
in Canada. It also does not address what we should be and could 
be doing to better serve the people of our country.
<P>
	The finance minister is correct when he says that the 
legislation put before the House to implement his budget does 
not impose any new national standards on the provinces. I have 
examined the legislation very carefully and there are no 
proposals for new standards. I do not believe the provinces are 
being required to do any more than they have in the past as far as 
delivery of services are concerned.
<P>
	There are however two concerns which my friends in the Bloc 
have raised that we should acknowledge and address as much as 
we can. One concern is that there is no co-operative plan or 
process to facilitate the development of a co-operative plan to 
ensure the proper, effective and efficient delivery of services 
that Canadians need.
<P>
	The government has said that it would reduce its spending and 
talk about what we will do together later. That is not a good 
service to the people. A far better thing to have done would have 
been to immediately work to facilitate a discussion and a 
co-operative approach to  how services will be delivered instead 
of making unilateral decisions and then saying we can talk about 
it later. All provinces justifiably have concerns about that type 
of process. It could have been managed a great deal better.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12039"> 12039 </A></B>
<P>
	The role of the federal government in the delivery of the 
programs has to be addressed honestly. The federal government 
is continuing to apply its own criteria to how the programs are 
delivered and to make judgments, pronouncements and give 
direction on how things will be structured as far as the delivery 
of programs is concerned. My friends in the Bloc are correct 
when they point out that it is an intrusion into areas of provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1115 ) </B>
<P>
	People look for income support when they cannot provide 
themselves with the necessities of life. Some of these people 
have suffered from a catastrophic illness or they are young 
people who are looking for the training and education needed to 
build a strong future for themselves. I do not think these people 
really care very much about how and at what level of 
government these services are delivered. They simply know 
they need the assistance and programs that will best enable them 
to look after the contingencies in life.
<P>
	Canadians watching the debate today have probably felt quite 
frustrated at the suggestions that you should do this or we should 
do that; that you did not do this right or they did not do it right. 
Quite frankly, Canadians just want to know who is going to do it 
right.
<P>
	The principles outlined by the Reform Party suggest how we 
can best deliver programs and structure the spending of public 
money to give Canadians health and security. The programs are 
most efficiently and effectively delivered by the level of 
government closest to the people being served. I believe the 
people who framed our Canadian Constitution saw it that way as 
well. Clearly, they put these matters into provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	If my friends in the Bloc are suggesting that it should fall 
within the jurisdiction of the provinces to deal with matters of 
post-secondary education, delivery of health care services and 
the support of citizens who are destitute and unable to provide 
for themselves, then Reform completely agrees with them. 
These services are best delivered by the provincial government 
and institutions and organizations in the provinces.
<P>
	It would be the federal government's role to provide 
equalization of the financial ability of each province to provide 
good delivery of those services. It would also work 
co-operatively to facilitate a strong, coherent approach to the 
delivery of those services right across the country.
<P>
	This is a very mobile society. People can now move easily 
from one end of the country to the other and to different 
provinces many times in their lives. We want to make sure there 
are proper services, proper education,  proper health care, that 
we are caring for people to the best of our ability no matter 
where they live in Canada. The federal government does have a 
role which is to ensure the proper co-ordination and proper 
delivery of services across the country.
<P>
	This confrontational approach, the big stick of additional 
funding and threats to withdraw funding if the federal 
government's will is not carried out will simply not be workable 
in the future. We must acknowledge that. We must move to a far 
more co-operative approach where we simply work together as 
legislators at the federal, provincial and lower levels of 
government to simply do our job, which is to serve the people we 
represent and with whose money and futures we have been 
entrusted. We need to work together to do that well.
<P>
	It both concerns and disappoints me when we quarrel and 
fight rather than work together for the benefit of the people we 
are responsible to help and to serve by making good decisions. I 
appeal to my colleagues in this debate to look at the 
practicalities of how best we can achieve the good of all 
Canadians rather than simply using people's legitimate needs 
and concerns to advance agendas which really have nothing to 
do with giving them the help and the kind of government they 
need and deserve.
<P>
<B>(1120 ) </B>
<P>
	We could work co-operatively and we could respect the 
decisions that have been made as to how best to help people. We 
could respect our jurisdictions and the proper roles each level of 
government has. If we could do that, all Canadians would be 
much better served.
<P>
	As members know, the Reform Party has put forward a 
number of proposals to better meet the health care, education 
and social welfare needs of Canadians. We have done this in 
light of the realities we face today, in light of the fact that some 
of the past assumptions simply have not proven to be correct or 
workable. Today is not the time when I will talk specifically 
about those.
<P>
	It should be the will of all of us serving as federal or 
provincial legislators, or as municipal officials, at whatever 
level we are trying to meet the needs and protect the interests of 
the citizens we serve to work co-operatively. We must work to 
find ways where each of us can make the best contribution for 
the good of our citizens, where we can bring our country 
together, where we can work together and build a strong future. 
With that in mind, I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by adding immediately following the word 
``denounce'' the following: ``for the sake of national unity''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	When we work together in a unified way, we will best serve 
the legitimate and very real needs of all the people of this 
country.

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The amendment proposed 
by the hon. member for Calgary North is in order.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I had prepared a speech but, given what I have heard 
here this morning, particularly from the Minister of Finance, I 
will start by replying to the Minister of Finance. I was 
flabbergasted to hear the Minister of Finance say what I heard 
him say this morning, when he talked about employment, 
compassion for the poor, people on welfare, the 808,000 
Quebecers who are currently on the welfare rolls. He said, his 
hand to his heart, that he had done all he could to help these 
people and that it was our turn.
<P>
	He is the one responsible in the first place for the hardship 
experienced by these people in Quebec as well as in the rest of 
Canada. It is his doing. He is the one who, out of compassion for 
the unemployed, cut $7 billion from the UI fund. He is the one 
who pushed some of the unemployed and more to come, with 
their families, onto welfare because of tighter requirements 
brought about by his cuts.
<P>
	Now he has the gall to tell us to call upon our head office, in 
Quebec, to establish real policies to fight poverty when he 
himself, as the Minister of Finance, his government, and his 
Prime Minister in particular, are seriously interfering not only 
with economic recovery but also with improving the lot of the 
most unfortunate families in Quebec and Canada.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	That is dreadful. I will tell the Minister of Finance right away 
that he better stop taking his instructions from the Power 
Corporation head office or that of the Bronfmans and the rest 
and start working for and serving the people who elected him 
instead of his friends, the large corporations, who benefit from a 
tax system of an unprecedented generosity because there are so 
many loopholes in it that it looks like Swiss cheese. The 
Bronfmans, the Desmarais and the rest take advantage of such 
loopholes.
<P>
	I have a hard time containing myself sometimes when I see 
how few measures he takes and consider his personal situation, 
but I will not dwell on that because we, Bloc members, are too 
polite to engage in this kind of thing. But I find it despicable that 
such a man can say that he is compassionate, given that he is the 
one responsible for the hardship of these people.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> He said that instead of creating economic 
uncertainty by talking about sovereignty, we should join them. 
First of all, he is the one creating uncertainty by not proposing 
budget measures. Moody's realized that in February. Moody's 
understood that when it downgraded Canada's rating. We truly 
regret that, but the agency recognized that the Minister of 
Finance had  demonstrated his incompetence over the past year. 
The minister took no appropriate action for a medium-term 
control of Canada's deficit and debt. He is the one creating 
uncertainty. He is the one who is confusing the economic 
situation and leading the country on the road to ruin.
<P>
	So, we urge him to stop talking about uncertainty, to look in 
his own backyard and to ask himself what he has done in the past 
year as finance minister to regain control of public finances, 
what he has done other than to offload his deficit problems onto 
the provinces and plan an eventual transfer of the federal 
government's rating cut. These are the real questions he should 
have asked this morning.
<P>
	Coming back to Bill C-76, the legislation maintains the 
national standards in the health sector, and introduces new 
national standards in the areas of social assistance and 
post-secondary education. If the provinces do not respect these 
standards, the federal will cut their funding as it did to the 
unemployed and welfare recipients, and as it is about to do to our 
seniors. These measures would limit the provinces' autonomy in 
their own jurisdiction and would apply to a sector as vital as 
education for Quebec's cultural identity.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance proved us right this morning when he 
came up haphazardly, in an almost unprecedented fashion in this 
House, with a series of amendments which he intends to 
eventually table. We do not know when for the minister was so 
flustered that he did not tell us. But he proved us right. He told us 
that we were right to fear federal interference in areas which 
come under Quebec's exclusive jurisdiction, such as education 
and social assistance.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance intends to eventually table 
amendments. We will wait for these amendments. So far, 
nothing is official, but the minister felt cornered. He knew that 
the official opposition was right, and is always right, because we 
are dealing with a bill. So, the minister hurriedly came up with 
these things in an off-hand, almost arcane manner.
<P>
	Try to imagine-we are referring to Bill C-76-what it means 
to have Canada's English speaking majority impose education 
standards on Quebec. Do you have any idea of the implications? 
Try to imagine what it means to Quebecers, given our particular 
historical background.
<P>
	Canada-wide standards in education would mean that 
Ontario, Newfoundland and Canada's English speaking 
majority would define, to some extent, Quebec's education 
system, a system which perpetuates our identity and our culture 
from generation to generation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12041"> 12041 </A></B>
<P>
	Can you imagine for a moment Clyde Wells, in 
Newfoundland, and his elected friends in Ottawa, his associates 
and accomplices, defining the content of Quebec's education 
system through the direct use of Canada-wide standards? Does 
this mean that, for post-secondary education, we would only 
have 25 per cent control over decisions, while being constantly 
blackmailed by the federal government regarding the level of 
transfers?
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	Through this bill, the finance minister and his government are 
pursuing two aims: first, to crush the legitimate claims of the 
Quebec government in its own jurisdiction, a fight that has been 
going on for at least 30 years; and second, to hide from people of 
Quebec and Canada the real situation with regard to the cuts in 
the transfer payments to provinces and the impact of these cuts 
for next year in particular but especially two years from now.
<P>
	The government is seeking to hide the real situation about the 
budget transfers as a whole by talking about cash transfers, not 
tax point transfers. The Minister of Finance is confusing the 
population when he says that transfers will not decrease over the 
next few years, because he is talking about tax points and cash 
transfers whereas only cash transfers should be considered. That 
is what the federal government has under its control. That is 
what the federal government can use to blackmail provinces, not 
tax points. Even the government agrees that tax points are there 
to stay. They are provincial entitlements. So he mixes 
everything up, tax points and cash transfers, resulting in a 
distorted picture of reality.
<P>
	Here is the reality. The financial transfers as a whole, 
meaning the federal cash transfers paid to the Quebec 
government, will decrease by 32 per cent-and this is not 
peanuts-from 1994-95 to 1997-98 because of the cuts in 
transfer payments to provinces. It is important to understand 
that these transfer payments are not a gift from the federal 
government but are taken from the $30 billion paid by Quebec 
taxpayers to the federal government.
<P>
	I have to point out that these taxes have increased to such an 
extent since 1982 that it is incredible that the finance minister, 
who has been in charge for 16 months now, has not thought about 
considering the situation with regard to taxation. Since 1982, 
taxes paid by Quebec taxpayers to the federal government have 
increased by 143 per cent, whereas federal transfer payments to 
Quebec, cut year after year, and even more since he became 
finance minister, have increased by only 50 per cent.
<P>
	On the one hand, taxes paid by Quebec taxpayers have 
increased by 143 per cent, to $30 billion at present, and on the 
other hand, transfer payments have increased by approximately 
50 per cent over a 10 year period. That is the situation. It is 
tangible evidence that this system is not working. When taxes 
are raised so steadily while the rate  of growth of transfers is 
being reduced, surely there is a problem somewhere, there are 
inefficiencies of some kind and some chronic malfunction in the 
system.
<P>
	In the coming year alone, cuts announced in the last budget of 
the Minister of Finance will result in losses in revenues of $1 
billion for Quebec. The direct impact of transfer cuts amounts to 
$650 million and the indirect impact, to $450 million. In 1997, 
the shortfall resulting from the federal budget will stand at $2.4 
billion.
<P>
	When we see such things, when we realize the federal 
government wants to quell legitimate aspirations of the Quebec 
government and that, at the same time, it is trying to hurt the 
Quebec fiscal situation and make it even more difficult for the 
Quebec government to prepare its next budget, we see the 
Minister of Finance for what he really is. His lack of 
responsibility becomes obvious. We see his centralist views, 
that are encouraged by his Prime Minister who took part in all 
struggles against Quebec during his whole political life. We now 
see the truth.
<P>
	Through the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition 
and the Bloc Quebecois, we want to restore some order so that 
the government will not get away as easily as it would have liked 
to with the shameful measures it took and the almost 
unprecedented attacks it launched, without warning, against 
Quebec and its jurisdiction.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> If I understand the hon. 
member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot correctly, he is going to 
share his time with one of his colleagues. The remarks of the 
hon. member will be followed by a five minute period for 
questions and comments.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let me point out a small mistake my colleague from 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot made when he said that the finance 
minister had his hand pressed to his heart when he talked about 
his deep compassion for the destitute. To me, it looked more like 
it was hovering over his pocketbook, or more precisely over the 
financial interests of the friends of the government in order to 
protect their pocketbooks. That is how it looked to me.
<P>
	Also, during the speech made by one of the members 
opposite, I heard a statement which is frankly beginning to try 
my patience. We keep hearing that Canada is the best country in 
the world. I am sorry, but enough is enough.
<P>
	This reminds me of a family which was earning a lot of money 
fifteen or twenty years ago. Without thinking, they bought a 
beautiful house, a second home, a nice car for the husband, a 
nice car for his wife, but in these hard times, they find 
themselves crippled with debts. Everyone keeps saying that the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12042"> 12042 </A></B>
<P>
owners live in the most beautiful house in town, that they are the 
richest people in the area, when in fact, behind this facade, the 
owners have to scimp on child care and sacrifice their children's 
education in order to pay their debts. So, this best  country in the 
world is just a facade behind which we can hardly afford child 
care.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me 
first say that I was deeply shocked by the remarks of the 
Minister of Finance.
<P>
	There may be words which are not parliamentary, but there 
are also ideas which can be best expressed by saying that the 
Minister has considerably distanced himself from the truth.
<P>
	This budget, like the measures taken by this government, has 
a centralizing effect. Even though the Minister, before trying to 
discredit us, has made the effort to propose, in a way which is 
absolutely not parliamentary, amendments to a bill which he has 
tabled himself and which was interpreted by the reporters and by 
everybody who has analyzed it exactly as it was by us, he is not 
fooling anybody. Because we can say that the cuts to UI 
proposed last year by this government, by this Minister of 
Finance, have begun to hit people hard, particularly the young 
people who are not entitled any more to UI benefits because they 
have not worked for a sufficient length of time and the women 
who go back to work and who are not entitled to UI benefits 
either. All these workers who suddenly see their benefit period 
shortened and the amount of these benefits reduced have been 
hit hard.
<P>
	People who sometimes watch these debates have experienced 
and continue to experience daily the effect of these cuts and they 
know it. But what they still do not know is that these cuts were 
used this year to accumulate surpluses of more than 3 billion 
dollars for next year and of 5 billion dollars for the following 
years. These surpluses will shelter the federal government from 
the next recession, whereas the provinces where transfers were 
cut dramatically will see their number of people on welfare rise.
<P>
	Imagine, during this so-called period of prosperity, 5,000 
more people each month go on welfare in Quebec. But there is 
more. Not only will the federal government be sheltered, but it 
has also announced a new reform of UI which will impose new 
cuts of $700 million next year, and of $1.5 billion the year after, 
on top of all the other ones my colleagues spoke of.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	These amounts will be put into a new fund which is not 
mentioned in the act implementing the Budget, a fund which 
will be used at the sole discretion of the Minister of Human 
Resources Development. This fund is called the Human 
Resources Investment Fund and can come directly into play in 
provincial jurisdictions. It can focus more on employment 
development services, such as needs assessment, counselling 
services, literacy and basic skills training, training and 
experience in the workplace, child care support, and income 
supplements for people on welfare.
<P>
	The truth is that this government proposes, with this 
discretionary fund, after having starved the provinces, to force 
them to take the heat because of the cuts they will have to make. 
It is Quebec's ministers who are being blamed for cuts which 
were decided by the federal government.
<P>
	After that, the central government will have a fund and say: 
``So, you are having problems? We will-'' As if the money did 
not come out of the same pocket. The central government will 
say that it has come up with a certain amount from UI premiums 
and employers premiums, from amounts which will have been 
cut elsewhere. And then, the government will be able to show 
itself in the best light. Not only that, it will be able to ignore the 
provinces' conditions.
<P>
	For the other provinces of Canada, maybe this is not a 
problem, but Quebec is a distinct people and nation. In 1965-66, 
when René Lévesque was the minister responsible for family 
and welfare, he said that we should regain control over the 
family allowances program in order to transform it into a system 
adapted to our society and to our particular needs.
<P>
	Thirty years later, far from having been able to build a system 
adapted to our own needs, to the particular needs of Quebecers, 
we see ourselves increasingly choked in the jurisdictions where 
the federal government forced us to retreat. Furthermore, the 
federal government keeps funds that are not available to pay for 
services that would conform to its own standards but would 
nonetheless be designed by Quebec so it can use it to intensify 
its direct action by handing out yellow cheques bearing a maple 
leaf.
<P>
	Not only is that a move toward increased centralization, but it 
is a radical reform of the regime where Quebec thought that it 
had a state in which, moreover, it felt it was destinated to realize 
its potential. But the more things evolve, the more that state, 
which seemed to be a given, is stripped of the very means that 
were supposed to serve to protect the interests and the civic life 
of its citizens. From now on, the federal government, which has 
shown itself unable to manage its own affairs, wants to dispense 
all the services directly.
<P>
	On the one hand, it wants the provinces, Quebec, to make the 
cuts and the painful choices that will make them look insensitive 
while, on the other hand, it will keep its spending power, its 
power to add to the debt. By using the unemployment insurance 
premiums paid by workers and businesses, it will be able to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12043"> 12043 </A></B>
<P>
impose not only its standards, but also its own programs, its own 
ways to deal with the needs.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	It goes further than ever. It interferes directly, no longer 
through standards, no longer by requiring-as we have seen in 
the 40s-constitutional reforms because the only constitutional 
reforms this country has ever seen are those which provided for 
the transfer of provincial powers to Ottawa, never the other way 
around. Not content with having done that, not content with 
having starved provinces which had put in place programs 
according to their own requirements, the federal government is 
now preparing to provide these services, in total contravention 
of what seemed to be the beginning of a contractual relationship.
<P>
	The people of Quebec, the nation of Quebec has specific and 
distinct needs. It is a people, a nation according to all national 
standards. It is a people, a nation wishing to control its own 
destiny because, it is unthinkable that under the present 
circumstances-with 808,000 persons on welfare, more than 
400 000 unemployed, young people who have no longer any 
hope-the current situation can continue, and to be told that 
instead of discussing these issues, we should accept the federal 
government's invitation that the finance minister presumably 
sent us, is simply outrageous!
<P>
	It is outrageous! Words fail me; it is senseless! From the very 
beginning the people of Quebec have always wished to obtain 
minimum recognition. Their efforts were always answered with 
a blatant and insulting no. Now, in view of the economic and 
social mess this country is in, a situation we are trying to get out 
of by any means possible, they tell us to co-operate, to 
collaborate. It is an insult, not for us, not for the members of the 
Bloc Quebecois who were sent here to defend the interests of 
Quebec, to protect the future of Quebec, but it is an insult for all 
Quebecers, for all those who are suffering from these policies, 
for all those who can no longer tolerate that Quebec is unable to 
go about it alone.
<P>
	Sure, there is a debt, sure there will still be a debt afterwards, 
but at least we will be able to set our own priorities and to use 
our resources for the development of Quebec and for creating 
hope. Far from being useless, this debate will have given us 
another opportunity to reveal the true face of this government, 
whose only goal is to subjugate the people of Quebec once and 
for all.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Francis G. LeBlanc (Cape Breton Highlands-Canso, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to what the member for 
Mercier and her colleagues said a little while ago. I always find 
it difficult to understand the Bloc's logic, and today is no 
exception.
<P>
	The Bloc is always seeking a little bit more autonomy for 
Quebec regarding federal expenditures. The budget gives 
greater autonomy and flexibility in transfer payments, and the 
Bloc sees in this flexibility less autonomy and more 
centralization. It wants to hold a referendum to separate Quebec 
from Canada, but now that it believes that it might lose it 
because, increasingly,  Quebecers are saying, through polls, 
other media and forums, that they are not interested in the 
proposed separation, it is starting to realize that the referendum 
it decided to hold is doomed; it wants to blame the federal 
government for the fact that it is going to lose the referendum.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member mentioned the need to get our financial 
houses in order, not only at the federal level whose expenditures 
are, for the main part, transferred directly to the provinces, 
including Quebec, through equalization, social transfers and 
other mechanisms offering more and more freedom to the 
provinces. We are looking for ways to co-operate with the 
provinces and with Quebec, but we are accused of always trying 
to centralize. It is impossible to co-operate with someone who 
does not want to.
<P>
	My question to the member is in connection with the motion 
before us today: How does the social transfer give less freedom 
to Quebec to manage its own finances within this envelope? 
What are the new conditions set by the Canadian government in 
this envelope?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, first, my hon. colleague says he 
does not understand. I think this is evident. It is also evident that 
Quebecers have seen over the years that this central government 
does not understand, that maybe it is not even listening, that the 
budget includes some centralizing measures. I spoke about the 
human resources investment fund which is an extremely 
important centralization measure.
<P>
	I will answer the question very precisely and would ask the 
member to refer to clause 48 of Bill C-76, a fundamental part of 
that bill, which says two things; it is a two faced budget and it is 
a two faced clause. On the one hand it says it will increase 
flexibility for the provinces and, on the other, it maintains 
national conditions established in the Canada Health Act and, 
where appropriate, national standards for the operation of other 
social programs. Those other social programs are explained 
later on, in clause 53; they are health, post-secondary education, 
social assistance and social services. So my answer is very 
precise, it comes directly from the bill.
<P>
	If some of us here do not understand, it is the members from 
the other side. I think they have not read the bill or, if they have, 
they feel they must do like the Minister of Finance who thinks he 
has to announce some amendments before he can talk, before he 
can answer. He used an approach which, I repeat, is entirely 
unparliamentary. I wonder if my hon. colleague saw those 
amendments because we read directly from the bill here in the 
House. If we were to listen to what we hear, to what the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12044"> 12044 </A></B>
<P>
government says are its intentions, we would find the 
government has many intentions, which are often contradictory.
<P>
	We are members of Parliament and we work with bills. This 
bill entitles, even forces the Bloc Quebecois to take the 
positions it is taking this morning, on this opposition day. We 
would not be doing our job if we neglected to take such 
positions. The best proof of that is again that the Minister of 
Finance, before speaking to us, felt he had to announce some 
amendments we have not even seen. We are eager to see them.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	Something else also confirms that we are right and that is, I 
repeat, that the minister felt he had to use an unparliamentary 
approach and announce amendments. So I can easily understand 
that he does not understand.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will share my time with the hon. member for Vaudreuil.
<P>
	Since my arrival in this House, I have come to the conclusion 
that the surprises will never end. The opposition, which never 
misses an opportunity to label the government a ``champion of 
the status quo'', has risen today to denounce this initiative.
<P>
	This same opposition which constantly advocates 
decentralization, is today objecting to the government 
transferring greater responsibility to the provinces in the area of 
social security. Although they continually preach that 
federalism is a system that is too rigid, they are now opposing a 
measure precisely intended to allow greater flexibility in the 
application of programs.
<P>
	Because this is exactly what the new Canada health and social 
transfer (CHST) announced in last February's budget is intended 
to do: to give the provinces more latitude in the area of funding 
and management of health care, post-secondary education and 
social services.
<P>
	On April 1, 1996, the new program will replace the Canada 
assistance plan and established program financing for health 
and post-secondary education. Under the new program, the 
provinces will receive block funding for social assistance and 
social services, health care and post-secondary education.
<P>
	It is known that the current Canada assistance plan is an 
obstacle to innovation because of its overly restrictive 
cost-sharing requirements.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Canada health and social transfer will give the provinces 
the flexibility they need to implement innovative approaches to 
social programs so they can be more effective in meeting the 
specific needs of their clients. For the provinces this is good 
news, because it establishes social assistance and income 
security measures, which for all sorts of technical reasons are 
not always eligible for funding under the Canada assistance 
plan.
<P>
	It is good news, in particular, for Quebec, which is always in 
the forefront of innovation in the area of social security. For 
example, Quebec's APPORT program provides wage assistance 
to low income families with children and encourages parents on 
welfare to return to the labour market and helps low income 
parents keep their jobs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Since its inception in 1988, this program has never been 
eligible for cost-sharing under CAP because it was not based on 
needs testing and therefore did not meet CAP requirements. It 
was the same thing with its ancestor, the work income 
supplement program, introduced in 1979.
<P>
	In the 1970s, various social measures aimed at protecting 
disadvantaged children in schools could not be cofinanced under 
CAP either because they did not meet the definition of ``social 
protection services'', which excluded education-related 
sercices.
<P>
	Probation services for young offenders were excluded from 
funding under CAP for a similar reason: the definition of 
``social protection services'' also excluded correctional 
services.
<P>
	Several other progressive measures implemented by the 
provinces were not eligible for funding under CAP because they 
were not based on needs testing or did not meet the definition of 
``social protection services''. This was the case for a number of 
programs aimed at assisting persons with disabilities or 
impairments, such as self administered care programs, 
community-based services and para-transit services.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	All these measures are presently ineligible for funding under 
the Canada assistance plan. CAP's excessive rigidity tends to 
discourage provincial initiatives and innovation. Yet these are 
social programs and services that are effective in meeting 
people's real needs. They provide assistance that is geared to 
specific needs and situations. And all of these measures will be 
eligible for full funding under the new Canada health and social 
transfer.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As a Quebecer I am appalled that my provincial government 
refuses to see any other issue than the separation of Quebec. 
Even today's discussion will be used to fuel its separatist 
arguments.
<P>
	I have before me examples of projects and agreements 
reached between the federal government and the other provinces 
which have taken strong initiatives in addressing the specific 
problems they and their citizens are facing. Unfortunately the 
PQ government has one issue on its mind. As the Prime Minister 
said this past weekend, I am ashamed the PQ government cannot 
look beyond the Constitution and the real problems facing 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12045"> 12045 </A></B>
<P>
Quebecers today, especially the poor in Quebec and in my riding 
of Saint-Denis.
<P>
	The federal government is looking forward while the PQ 
government is looking constantly backwards with public money. 
It is doing it with my taxpayer money. It is using that money to 
fuel separatist sentiments. The PQ government shows no 
leadership at all. There is no creativity or innovation in terms of 
sitting down with the federal government to look at what types 
of programs will help the most disadvantaged and the poor in 
Quebec.
<P>
	This is the type of country members of the PQ want to create, 
where there is one issue only: let us separate. They do not look 
beyond that but place the blame on the federal government. I am 
tired of the same violin story playing all the time. They continue 
to say the federal government is the culprit of all the ills that 
befall Quebec society. That is totally false.
<P>
	Why were many actions taken by the government with other 
provincial governments through negotiation and collaboration? 
I will name a few. The Atlantic provinces have been hit the 
hardest in terms of unemployment and the current economic 
climate. Why were these provinces able to sit down to negotiate 
agreements with the federal government, thereby helping the 
more disadvantaged and the unemployed in their provinces? 
Why did my provincial government not do the same thing?
<P>
	It organized commissions with taxpayers' money, prepared 
documents with taxpayers' money, talked and talked and 
continues to talk and all for one reason, to achieve the dream of 
separation; a dream the majority of Quebecers do not share. 
They do not share that dream yet the PQ government, with its 
friends on the other side of the House, continues to talk about 
one thing. As we all know, it continues to talk about it in 
different languages. Its only concern for the poor, the 
unemployed and the most disadvantaged is to accuse the federal 
government of a lack of vision and a lack of leadership.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	With this new program, the provinces will have all the latitude 
they need to implement and fund pilot projects and new 
employability measures. They will no longer have to submit to 
rigid and restrictive requirements, as they currently have to. If 
they want, they will even be able to combine social assistance, 
health or education measures.
<P>
	In fact, with respect to social assistance, the provinces will 
have to meet only one requirement under the Canada health and 
social transfer. They will not be able to deny social services to 
people who are entitled to social assistance because they have 
not fulfilled a residency requirement.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I repeat the only real national requirement under the Canada 
health and social transfer with regard to social assistance is that 
which concerns health and residence requirements. That 
requirement is not based on the idle whim of the federal 
government. It reflects the wishes and expectations of all 
Canadians. It reflects our desire to preserve the notion of 
freedom of movement within Canada between provinces.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It seems just as contradictory to say that the government 
wants to limit the provinces to a mere consultative role when, as 
I just explained, they will be able to apply the social programs 
they deem most appropriate in whatever manner they see fit, and 
will be the ones in charge in this area.
<P>
	The Canada health and social transfer is an important 
initiative that responds both to today's social imperatives and to 
the fiscal pressures facing government. And it is also a striking 
demonstration of the flexibility of Canadian federalism, which 
allows us, simply by means of legislation, to make major 
adjustments within areas of jurisdiction.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am very disappointed with the remarks made by 
the member who just said that Quebec is the country's poorest 
province because of eight to ten months of Parti Quebecois 
government. This province has been a part of Canada for 128 
years and, before the PQ took office, we had ten years of 
provincial Liberal government, which proves that federalism is 
neither desirable nor cost-effective for Quebec.
<P>
	Furthermore, it is one of the basic reasons why we will 
separate from Canada. It is very important to us to become 
responsible for our own development and to stop relying on 
transfer payments. In this respect, the federal government is 
sending us a most interesting message, saying that it can no 
longer borrow funds at the expense of future generations as it 
has done for the last twenty years.
<P>
	You are trying to hide this behind a transfer of responsibilities 
to the provinces. Try this in any other area, Madam-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I remind hon. 
members that they must always address the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to make a comment to the 
member. Try cutting anybody's budget by 15 per cent and telling 
them that they have all the flexibility in the world to do what 
they want with what is left. There is something wrong with this 
approach, which will inevitably lead to the balkanization of 
Canada.
<P>
	The Council of Canadians, an organization certainly that 
cannot be called separatist, told the finance committee last 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12046"> 12046 </A></B>
<P>
week, concerning this bill, that if the federal government wants 
to impose national standards  without providing the necessary 
funding, it will simply come up against a wall of negativity from 
the provinces.
<P>
	The federal government cannot ask the provinces to maintain 
Canadian standards if they do not have the money to do so. And 
they will not have the money to do so. As the saying goes, ``once 
bitten, twice shy''. How can the provinces, which were 
humiliated once by the oh so wise federal government when it 
decided to hold a forum on health without making sure of the 
provinces' participation, how can they agree to take part in a 
process that is biased from the start?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Bakopanos:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe that I have already 
said that, at any rate, the Government of Quebec does not want 
to participate in the initiatives already taken by the federal 
government. Every province in Canada wants to participate, 
except Quebec.
<P>
	I think that the official opposition should be very careful 
when talking about links with the federal government, because 
we have already proposed administrative agreements. Several of 
them, which could, in fact, have helped Quebecers, were not 
signed by the Parti Quebecois government. Now, the hon. 
member dares to raise such an issue.
<P>
	I think we have to look at what is behind what is happening in 
Quebec, and I think that I put my finger on it earlier, and that is 
that the current government, the Parti Quebecois, has only one 
goal, and that is to bring about Quebec's separation from 
Canada. They have devoted all of their energies, human 
resources and money to this cause, and have taken no other 
initiative in the past six months.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when 
Rome burned, Nero fiddled. He was out of touch with the day's 
reality. Similarly, I find this motion out of touch with reality.
<P>
	The members of the opposition try at all cost, take every 
opportunity, to discredit the federal government, particularly 
with regard to interprovincial and government jurisdictions.
<P>
	The only thing Canadians and Quebecers want from their 
government, be it provincial or federal, is action. Let us stop this 
stupid business about jurisdiction of power.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canada is undergoing nothing short of a revolution. Our 
economy is being transformed from a traditional resource based 
and labour intensive one to one that is globalized, information 
based and knowledge intensive. The effects are being felt by 
business and industry. They are certainly being felt often 
painfully by workers, be they loggers, farmers, fishermen, 
miners or even assembly line workers. They are being felt by our 
teachers and students and they are being felt by governments at 
all levels.
<P>
	Nowadays we warn young people preparing to enter the 
workforce that they will probably change careers several times 
during their working lives; I am talking about not just jobs but 
careers.
<P>
	We have engaged once again in a sterile debate on jurisdiction 
while our constituents, including those of the Bloc Quebecois, 
are looking to their governments to create the environment to 
guarantee continuing jobs and ensure the training to match the 
skills needed for tomorrow's jobs.
<P>
	The Government of Canada is determined to remain steadfast 
to that goal. The government was swept to power with a 
resounding victory and a vote of confidence by Canadians and 
Quebecers who were clearly ready for change. They believed in 
our commitment to create jobs and to prepare people for those 
new jobs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	While the members of the Bloc Quebecois contemplate their 
navel and get lost in jurisdictional discussions, the government, 
fortunately, is not letting Canadians down.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Since the government came into office no less than 454,000 
full time jobs have been created; strong evidence of enough 
employer confidence in the economy to offer stable full time 
employment rather than part time jobs. This job creation 
performance has surpassed even the most optimistic predictions 
including those of the OECD.
<P>
	The OECD predicted Canadian employment growth of 1.2 per 
cent last year. It was almost double the rate, growing at 2.1 per 
cent.
<P>
	I remember a former prime minister said we would have to 
wait until the year 2002 to see unemployment fall below 10 per 
cent. Fortunately she did not get elected and today we are 
enjoying an employment rate of 9.7 per cent. We hope to do 
better. We must do better.
<P>
	The OECD estimates Canada's employment growth for 
1995-96 will be the highest among all G-7 countries, even 
surpassing the United States. Given our track record so far there 
is every reason to suspect these predictions will once again 
prove to be modest.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The members of the Bloc Quebecois should also recognize 
that Quebec has benefitted by Canada's efforts.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the employment figures for the last two months of this year 
Quebec has experienced strong employment growth with a gain 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12047"> 12047 </A></B>
<P>
of 14,000 jobs in February alone. The employment rate in 
Quebec declined from 11.5 per cent, the lowest since 1991.
<P>
	Job creation initiatives by the government directly and in 
co-operation with the province have contributed a significant 
share. Since October 1993 some 120,000 jobs have been created 
and almost 36,000 Canadians were provided with training 
through initiatives of their government such as the 
infrastructure program, youth internship and strategic 
initiatives, to name a few.
<P>
<B>(1215 ) </B>
<P>
	Statistics are very cold. They do not tell us the human stories 
behind the job creation figures. They do not describe how so 
many Canadians have regained their self-respect knowing they 
are no longer dependants but contributors to this fine country.
<P>
	Statistics do not show the efforts of determined people and 
co-operative government action and how they can be made to 
work for the good of all Canadians.
<P>
	Statistics do not tell us, for example, about Le relais des 
jeunes adultes du Sud-Ouest de Montréal. It is a job search 
training organization funded by the federal government in 
partnership with two Quebec departments. Human Resources 
Development Canada provided nearly $800,000 last year. 
Sixty-five per cent of the participants in this program have 
found work.
<P>
	Statistics also do not tell us how 250 people are participating 
in entrepreneurship development jointly funded by Quebec and 
Canada, where 21 entrepreneurs have set up their own 
businesses.
<P>
	Statistics also do not tell us of the federal-Quebec effort that 
arose from the closing of the Hyundai plant in Bromont. Some 
$8 million federal funds helped 556 participants, 80 per cent of 
whom have found work or gone on to further vocational training.
<P>
	I could go on citing such projects. None of them are earth 
shaking in themselves, however they constitute the real story 
behind Canada's good fortune in terms of job creation.
<P>
	The other straight fact to which members opposite have 
turned a blind eye to time and time again is that co-operative 
action among governments, including the federal government 
and Quebec, does succeed in helping Canadians help 
themselves.
<P>
	Canada's economic prospects have not looked this good in a 
very long time. Productivity has surged. Canada's cost 
competitiveness is at the highest level in more than 40 years. 
Our trade surplus is up. All of this is not by accident.
<P>
	From the speech from the throne which formed the 
government's agenda, through to the most recent speech by the 
Minister of Finance, the Government of Canada has introduced 
cohesive and concerted strategies aimed at advancing the 
agenda for jobs and growth.
<P>
	Last October the Minister of Finance tabled ``A New 
Framework for Economic Policy'' which proposed a broad 
framework for policies for economic growth. Then ``Creating a 
Healthy Fiscal Climate'' takes steady aim at the deficit. Equally, 
the Minister of Industry released ``Building a More Innovative 
Economy'', a series of measures and strategies to create a 
climate of economic growth and job opportunities throughout 
the country.
<P>
	In February the budget delivered on the government's pledge 
to get the country's fiscal house in order, restoring investor 
confidence and clearing the way for further employment 
growth.
<P>
	Taken together, these efforts are radically reshaping 
government involvement in the economy. They are already 
producing results. The policy initiatives, coupled with strategic 
partnerships with the provinces, territories, business, labour, 
educators, community workers and committed individuals are 
creating jobs for Canadians.
<P>
	There is a message for all of us in this. Healthy economies in 
today's highly competitive and internationalized world are not 
made without consistent, concerted efforts on the part of all 
citizens, all businesses, all institutions and all levels of 
governments.
<P>
	If Canadians are not up to the competition, job creation will 
simply not continue. We are a small market in global terms. It 
takes the strength of united effort to ensure competitiveness. 
The workers of many nations are quite ready and, in today's 
global economy, quite able to jump into the breech should 
Canadians flag in their efforts.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is the job of governments to do everything in their power to 
ensure the best possible tools are in place in order to develop an 
effective program to create quality jobs and to equip our workers 
to find and, more importantly, keep jobs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It does not serve our constituents well in any part of Quebec or 
Canada to fiddle while Rome burns with petty jurisdictional 
concerns. The Government of Canada is prepared to challenge 
conventional wisdom, to adopt new policies and fresh 
approaches.
<P>
	We have made it clear that the government is willing to work 
closely and co-operate with the provinces and the territories.
<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	A number of new measures from strategic initiatives of the 
human resources investment fund have already been outlined to 
address problems with labour market development. We 
recognize the need for flexibility. Labour market demands vary 
from province to province. Each region of the country has its 
own vision and its own agenda. We understand that and local 
people best respond to local needs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12048"> 12048 </A></B>
<P>
	I suggest to members opposite that their constituents do not 
care what logo is on the letterhead as long as efficient, quality 
service is provided and prospective employment income can 
improve.
<P>
	The federal government must clearly work with the provinces 
to maintain national standards, ensuring that the skills people 
develop are recognized and portable throughout the country and 
keep us competitive with the world.
<P>
	The federal government is ready to go to work. It is confident 
that we can perform this role in a complementary fashion that 
will support and reinforce the labour force development efforts 
of all provinces and territorial governments.
<P>
	In conclusion, I take as proof of our ability to succeed 
Canada's recent record of growth and job creation, the envy of 
every G-7 member. It demonstrates the soundness of the course 
charted for Canada by the government. With less bickering it 
would undoubtedly have been much better.
<P>
	Now is the time for co-operation. Canadians demand it. Our 
task is to explore how we can work together to reform, 
restructure and rebuild our communities and our country to 
ensure that each and every Quebecer, each and every Canadian 
has the opportunity to share in our future prosperity.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
must say I was very surprised to hear the hon. member for 
Vaudreuil accuse the official opposition of playing the fiddle 
while Rome burns. The question is, who started the fire in the 
first place? The hon. member for Vaudreuil should have listened 
to the Leader of the Opposition when he said that what is 
happening in Canada today reminds us of the arsonist who 
blamed the firefighters for doing a bad job, because these fires 
have been burning for a long time in Canada.
<P>
	When we realize that for the past 12 years, the Canadian 
government has cut transfer payments to Quebec by a total of 
$14.4 billion, which means more than one billion annually, is it 
any wonder this would have an impact on the public finances of 
the Government of Quebec? This year, the federal government 
maintained this trend by cutting another billion. Next year-not 
this year, because of the referendum campaign but next year-it 
will be $2.4 billion, reflecting the government's increasingly 
devious plans to make cuts at the expense of low wage earners.
<P>
	I want to commend the hon. member for Mercier on her 
excellent and very instructive speech in which she explained 
that the unemployment insurance fund does not belong to the 
federal government. It consists of the premiums paid by workers 
and employers, but the federal government is appropriating this 
money, so that after bringing the provinces, including Quebec, 
to their knees, it can then say: If you do not have enough money 
for your social programs, we do, thanks to the way we  managed 
these funds which do not belong to us-the unemployment 
insurance premiums paid by workers and their employers.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member for Vaudreuil what he 
thinks about all this, what he thinks about the announcement in 
the budget speech which was mentioned by the Leader of the 
Opposition and what he thinks about this committee that is 
looking into the administration of old age pensions, to increase 
them, of course.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker, Rome is burning. They used 
to talk about the ``beau risque''. Now it is a ``beau virage'', and 
today, we have this separatist mirage Quebecers are being asked 
to embrace, but no one is really interested.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	That is why I said that Rome is burning, or rather that Nero is 
fiddling instead of dealing with the real problems in our society.
<P>
	The hon. member said that the federal government just 
happened to leave out equalization, because equalization always 
benefits Quebec. But if we include equalization, the tax burden 
on the province of Quebec represents only 1.4 per cent of their 
total revenue. That is their tax burden: $350 million. But when 
we talk about money, it is always the same money and the same 
taxpayer.
<P>
	The municipal government takes it out of your left-hand 
pocket, the federal government takes it out of both pockets and 
the provincial government takes it out of your right-hand 
pocket, but the pockets all belong to the same taxpayer. Yes, 
some responsibilities have been passed on to the provinces, but 
they were also allowed some flexibility. Flexibility in how they 
manage their programs and structure them according to their 
needs.
<P>
	This is not a burden on the provinces. In fact, six provinces 
have already brought down balanced budgets. It is now up to the 
Province of Quebec to do likewise before the referendum.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
really, the things you hear in this House. As the critic of the 
official opposition for regional development it is with pleasure 
and interest that I rise during this official opposition day. The 
federal government's attitude, denounced by the Bloc 
Quebecois, which consists in restricting the provinces to a 
strictly advisory role by imposing new national standards 
following the budget of the Minister of Finance in February, has 
a direct negative effect on regional development in Quebec.
<P>
	Bill C-76. an act to implement certain provisions of the 
federal budget for 1995-96, far from eliminating the intrusions 
of the federal government in areas under provincial jurisdiction, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12049"> 12049 </A></B>
<P>
allows it, by imposing national standards, to multiply its 
interventions while increasing the impact of its intrusions.
<P>
	We know that following this budget Ottawa had decided to 
merge in a new ``Canada social transfer'' its whole package of 
contributions to the provinces in such areas as health care, social 
services and post-secondary education. This decision of the 
federal government represents in the short term some savings 
and Liberals call that a fight against the deficit.
<P>
	The fact is that as a result funds allocated to the provinces are 
cut by $2.5 billion in 1995-96 and by $4.5 billion in 1997-98. In 
1997-98 the Canada social transfer envelope is going to be 
allocated among the provinces according to a criterion yet to be 
negotiated. If the chosen criterion is the present mode of 
distribution, which is not very likely, Quebec will suffer a $1.2 
billion shortfall.
<P>
	Rather, the objective of the federal government and its 
Minister of Finance is to allocate the Canada social transfer 
envelope on a per capita basis, so that Quebec will in fact bear 
41.7 per cent of the cuts in transfer payments to the provinces 
across Canada in 1997-98. With this distribution criterion, the 
loss of income for Quebec jumps from $1.2 billion to $1.9 
billion.
<P>
	With the new Canada social transfer and the implementation 
of new national standards, the federal government, while 
relegating the provinces to a purely advisory role and further 
centralizing action, will once again impoverish Quebec and 
threaten regional development.
<P>
	In the last budget and in Bill C-76, we see that the Minister of 
Human Resources Development intends to use the savings from 
unemployment insurance reform-that is $5 billion in cutbacks 
in 1994 plus $700 million more in 1995-to create an human 
resource investment fund.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	This fund will be used, among other things, to finance 
manpower training programs, a power unanimously demanded 
by Quebecers. Clearly, this has a direct impact on regional 
development. With initiatives such as the Canada social transfer 
and the cuts in unemployment insurance, the federal 
government will use all the money it is going to save elsewhere 
for massive, centralizing and discretionary interventions, 
totally disregarding totally the policies of Quebec in the area of 
regional development.
<P>
	In fact, the goal of the measures contained in the February 
budget is to direct the economic development of Quebec, to 
refuse to recognize the distinct character of that society by 
assimilating the evolution of Quebec into the Canadian policies 
on regional development.
<P>
	In Quebec, companies, trade unions, local authorities and the 
co-operative movement no longer fear to take their 
development into their own hands. In forums such as the 
Bélanger-Campeau Commission, they reached a very wide 
consensus and demanded that the government of Quebec be the 
only one to control the economic development of these regions.
<P>
	With the budget measures I already mentioned, there is no 
doubt about the intentions of the federal government. It wants to 
stimulate Canada's gross domestic product by promoting an 
area, an industrial region. So, the economic climate really takes 
precedence over the structural dimension in most of the 
interventions of the federal government in the regions.
<P>
	We know that today, the federal government is interested only 
in small and medium size exporting and technology firms, in 
total disregard of the overall strategic regional structural 
development plans which concern all areas of activity in a 
society. This attitude, and the interference of the federal 
government in regional development, will be harmful, in the 
long run, to the development of Quebec.
<P>
	We have to remember that regional development is not 
covered under the Canadian Constitution, and that forces 
Quebec to enter into endless negotiations to conclude 
agreements or ``agréments'', as the member for 
Brome-Missisquoi says.
<P>
	Those agreements inevitably open the way to numerous 
awkward intrusions by the federal government in regional 
development. Bill C-76 proves that. These are obvious, clear 
and open intrusions. The Quebec regions suffer from the 
numerous interferences in regional development and from the 
lack of consistency of government policies.
<P>
	While dropping its financial involvement in the provinces, 
the central government is leaving its administrative structures 
there. Consequently, duplication and overlap not only remain, 
but are sanctioned. Even if those administrative structures are 
becoming more and more symbolic, they are even more costly 
and hinder the dynamics of regional development in Quebec.
<P>
	The Federal Office of Regional Development is a good 
example of squandering by the federal government. When will 
there be a comprehensive structural reform of the federal 
regime? In spite of the decentralization measures that the 
government announced at the beginning of the year, the Liberals 
have not made any changes. More and more, they are using 
national standards as a means to centralize. Centralization is the 
golden rule of federal Liberals.
<P>
	The objective of the Bloc Quebecois, the official opposition, 
is to make the federal government realize that it has to withdraw 
completely from regional development in Quebec and recognize 
Quebec as the sole master of regional development. For over 
forty years, there has been, in the nation of Quebec, a much more  

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12050"> 12050 </A></B>
<P>
efficient and responsive attitude, in terms of regional 
development, to the needs of peripheral regions. I repeat that at 
present, there is a series of general agreements between the 
government of Quebec and its 16 administrative regions.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	Each region has conducted its own strategic study on small 
business and industrial development. These genreal agreements 
confirm the importance for Quebec to be close to these regions 
and to decentralize within the province, contrary to the what the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec is doing, in 
the light of federal imperatives based on a mythical and 
centralizing vision of what industrial development should be in 
Canada.
<P>
	The new role of the Federal Office of Regional Development 
is merely a duplication and overlapping of jurisdictions. Merged 
with the Department of Industry, it has become a business 
service centre, whereas there is already in Quebec a totally 
adequate information service and strategic assistance analysis 
entity available to small business, including exporting firms. 
The existence of a parallel network of 13 regional offices within 
the Federal Office of Development-Quebec is inappropriate, a 
duplication of services and, ultimately, a waste of public funds.
<P>
	Because of cuts to provincial transfers as the result of the 
Liberals' February budget and Bill C-76 implementing it, 
financial transfers to Quebec will decrease by 32 per cent 
between 1994-95 and 1997-98. That is viable federalism, I 
would even say that is Ottawa's new administrative flexibility 
towards Quebec: cut, cut, cut.
<P>
	It is important to understand that financial transfers are not a 
gift from the federal government, but are funded with our taxes. 
A sovereign Quebec would recover about $30 billion in taxes 
that Quebecers are paying to the federal government. It would 
recover this amount and administer it itself, according to its own 
priorities and its own strategic development plans. But because 
of cuts made by the federal government to provincial transfer 
payments between 1982 and 1993, taxes paid by Quebecers to 
the federal government increased by 143 per cent, while 
financial transfers from the federal government to Quebec only 
increased by 50 per cent. In terms of regional development, this 
situation has had the following effect since 1983: annual federal 
funds for regional development increased by only 50 per cent in 
Quebec, while they increased by 250 per cent in the Maritimes 
and by 300 per cent in Western Canada.
<P>
	In conclusion, as far as Quebec is concerned, this means that 
the Quebec State and its regions should manage their own 
policy. And when Quebecers have decided their political 
autonomy by basing their development on education, 
professional training, dialogue between unions, businesses, 
universities and communities coming from the 16 
administrative regions,  then Quebec will have total control over 
the tools for its own development. There will then be an open 
and happy country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am surprised that 
my colleagues of the opposition would want to debate on a 
motion which says that the federal government will impose 
standards on provinces. I read the document tabled in this House 
by Mr. Martin on February 27, 1995 and nowhere can I find the 
word ``impose''. It only says that the federal government wants 
to start discussions with the provinces in order to establish 
standards and goals, so that there will be minimum standards all 
across Canada.
<P>
	I do not understand why my colleague is so allergic to the 
words ``goal'' and ``standard''. There is nothing different there.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	I would simply like to mention to the hon. member that in the 
<I>Hansard</I> of May 4, 1989, on page 1291, Mr. Bouchard who was 
then a conservative minister, said and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That being said, the best way to guarantee that social programs will be 
preserved is to maintain a strong government that is able to intervene and to 
stand by its commitments to our neediest fellow Canadians.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	So stated Lucien Bouchard on May 4, 1989, page 1291.
<P>
	I agree with what Mr. Bouchard said in 1989 and as a matter of 
fact I-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I simply wish to 
remind the House that as parliamentarians we should always 
refer to one another as the member for such and such riding, the 
minister of such and such portfolio, the Leader of the 
Opposition, but not by our names.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harb:</B> I am sorry, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	I would like to ask my colleague of the opposition if he agrees 
completely with what the Leader of the Opposition said in 1989.
<P>
	I would like my colleague to tell me if he agrees with what his 
leader said in 1989.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, I 
thank the member for his question. I just want to remind him that 
the most vicious aspect of this venture is the use of the words 
``national standards'', and we know why.
<P>
	When the federal government had the power to spend money 
borrowed from future generations, there were no national 
standards. The federal government was spending money and 
interfering in provincial jurisdictions as much as it pleased.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12051"> 12051 </A></B>
<P>
	Now that the federal government must slash its budget, it 
prefers to talk about flexibility rather than spending power. 
However, your government's flexibility is strictly a matter of 
passing the bill to provinces and telling them: ``You will make 
your own decisions while applying our national standards''. 
That is underhanded.
<P>
	Now, regarding the quote you gave us, one of your 
colleagues-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, please. Again, I 
perfectly understand that today's topic is very important and 
members who rise have very strong ideas to communicate. 
However, I would like all the remarks to be addressed to the 
Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, as my 
colleague says, it is a warm exchange of views.
<P>
	Concerning the National Forum on Health, I wish to quote 
comments made by the member for Saint-Henri-Westmount 
when she was a provincial minister: ``The federal government's 
behaviour is absurd''. That is what the Quebec Minister of 
Health, Lucienne Robillard, said in an interview on the phone.
<P>
	``How can we even think of reforming the health care system 
without the participation of the provinces who are responsible 
for delivering the services? It is simply unacceptable''. That was 
reported in the September 27, 1994 issue of <I>La Presse</I>.
<P>
	This is what your colleague said, the one that is now among 
us, your courageous colleague who was not elected but 
appointed as a member of Parliament. A member had been 
democratically elected, but he was given a plum position in the 
Prime Minister's office in exchange for his riding, where this 
courageous minister had to struggle fiercely to be elected.
<P>
	I want to quote this same minister in response to your 
statement. Here is what she said as minister. ``I say things as I 
see them'',-this is what your colleague for 
Saint-Henri-Westmount said-``in Quebec the provincial 
government is still the level the most directly, exclusively and 
inextricably linked to the future of our society. A distinct 
society which, whatever we might think or say, is able to 
conduct its own destiny and prepare its future''. That is what we 
want to do in Quebec-prepare our future by becoming a people, 
by becoming a country''.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I could hardly wait to rise in the House on 
this allotted day to take part in the debate on an issue which is 
crucial not only in Quebec but especially in Quebec.
<P>
	Let me read you the motion, because I think it is important to 
put this debate in its proper perspective, especially since our 
Liberal colleagues seem to get lost in all kinds of 
considerations. The motion put forward reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House denounce the will of the federal government to restrict the 
provinces to the role of mere consultant by imposing on them new national 
standards for all social programs through the introduction of the Canada 
Social Transfer, which will enable the federal government to interfere even 
more in such areas as health, post-secondary education and social assistance, 
all of which come under exclusive provincial jurisdiction.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is under our current Constitution, of course. This is the 
motion now before the House.
<P>
	First of all, I would like to say how stunned I was to see that 
the Minister of Finance was the main spokesperson for the 
government, the individual chosen by the members of the 
government to speak on their behalf at the beginning of this 
debate, even though the motion concerns the Minister of Human 
Resources Development more directly.
<P>
	Where is the Minister of Human Resources Development? 
Why is he not taking part in this crucial debate where we would 
be very pleased to hear what he has to say about the federal 
policies and their impact on areas of exclusive provincial 
jurisdiction? In my humble opinion, I think the Minister of 
Human Resources Development should be called the Minister of 
Human Resources Discouragement and Impoverishment, 
because that is exactly what he is.
<P>
	We are now faced with a government whose main objective is 
to pick on the destitute. They were elected under false pretences, 
because during the election campaign, they said they would 
defend our social programs, the permanence of our social 
programs and the rights of the poorest members of our society. 
Right after the election, in his first budget, the Minister of 
Finance, or rather the minister of provincial impoverishment, 
made cuts in transfers to the provinces and in unemployment 
insurance, and as if this was not enough, he struck again in his 
second budget with even greater force.
<P>
	Last weekend, I was shocked, as were, I am sure, the majority 
of Quebecers, to hear the Prime Minister criticize the Quebec 
P.Q. government and all the sovereignists for focusing the 
debate on the Constitution instead of tackling the real problems 
facing all Canadians and particularly Quebecers, problems such 
as the high levels of unemployment that we are experiencing 
these days.
<P>
	I was shocked because the Prime Minister and several of his 
colleagues are constantly saying in this House and elsewhere 
that if the Constitution is being discussed in Quebec right now, it 
is because of the sovereignists. Nothing could be further from 
the truth. It is sheer hypocrisy. The Liberals who are saying this 
are nothing but hypocrites. They say things that they know are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12052"> 12052 </A></B>
<P>
not true. They know full well that, over the last thirty years,  it is 
the federalists who have fuelled the constitutional debate.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	I will simply cite some figures to demonstrate how much the 
federalists, and not the sovereignists, have negotiated, gossiped 
and wasted time over the past few years on the issue of the 
constitution. Please allow me to cite some very telling figures.
<P>
	Between 1960 and 1992, they held 56 conferences, sessions 
and meetings. It was getting so ridiculous that they had to keep 
presenting them under a different light to try to ensure that the 
population did not realize what was really going on. And I am 
only talking about meetings at the political and not the 
departmental level. I am talking about all of the energy spent by 
the ministers of the federal government in each of the provinces 
to prepare for these meetings and to follow up on them.
<P>
	There have been a total of 19 commissions, committees, 
working and advisory groups, for example, the 
Laurendau-Dunton Commission at the end of the 1960s, the 
Pépin-Robarts Commission in the 1970s, and the plethora of 
consultation panels leading up to the demise of the Meech Lake 
Accord and the breakdown of the Charlottetown negotiations. 
Nineteen commissions since 1965, all of them at the political 
level.
<P>
	Now, on to the cases which have come before the Supreme 
Court of Canada regarding the constitution. A total of 212 cases, 
notices and rulings by the court affecting the federal 
government and a provincial government. That is the result of 
the constitutional debate led by and for federalists. And this 
leads me to conclude that the federalists, particularly the Liberal 
Party, of which the Prime Minister has been a member for at 
least 30 years, and this Liberal government have been and still 
are responsible for keeping the constitution industry alive and 
well. They have sunk billions of dollars into it, which has 
contributed to the enormous debt we now face.
<P>
	That is our real constitutional problem. We sovereignists do 
not want to talk about the Canadian Constitution. We are 
proposing a solution to our current problems. What we want is 
our own Quebec constitution, which is what we were told in 
February by 50,000 men and women across Quebec. They came 
to tell us about the values on which Quebec society should base 
its constitution.
<P>
	There is a very broad consensus on the subject among the 
people of Quebec. We as sovereignists have a way to solve the 
constitutional problem. We do not want to talk about the 
Constitution, about constitutional renewal or fence mending. 
We want to propose a definitive solution.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, in concluding I would like to give an example of 
the impact of the Canada Social Transfer, of what happens when 
the government interferes in areas under provincial jurisdiction. 
Consider post-secondary education, an area over which the 
provinces have sole jurisdiction. According to the federal 
government's  policy, the policy of the Minister of Human 
Resources Development, transfer payments to the provinces for 
post-secondary education will be cut while, of course, certain 
standards will be set, which was unheard of in the past.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	This would include reducing the amounts of bursaries, 
obliging universities to raise their tuition fees and letting 
students borrow more. It seems to me that what the federal 
government, after putting us into debt over our ears, to the tune 
of more than $500 billion, what the Liberals and the Minister of 
Human Resources depletion are suggesting now is to let students 
get into debt individually as well.
<P>
	Now that we are in the hole as a country, they are telling 
students to do likewise. That is the federal government's policy 
and that is what this motion wants to condemn today.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the people of Guelph-Wellington I 
am pleased to speak to the motion of the hon. Leader of the 
Opposition.
<P>
	My constituents have expressed to me their concerns and their 
hopes for the future of social services in Canada. They have 
participated in a number of ways in my constituency. They have 
come to a town hall meeting sponsored by me and attended by 
the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human 
Resources Development. They have written letters and made 
many telephone calls to me. They have completed the booklet 
that was developed by the minister of human resources.
<P>
	They have given me one clear message: they want social 
services that protect those most vulnerable and will ensure that 
Canada and every province in Canada remain prosperous for 
many years to come.
<P>
	The Leader of the Opposition is wrong when he attempts to 
suggest that the Canada health and social transfer restricts the 
provinces to the role of consultants. What we are attempting to 
do is create a genuine partnership with the provinces and 
territories and continue to build a strong and evolving 
relationship in our Confederation.
<P>
	The people of Guelph-Wellington welcome any effort to 
better administer social services and to give the provinces more 
flexibility to allocate the resources where they believe they are 
most needed. They have also asked me to ensure that national 
standards remain and that the federal government not only 
continue to provide funding to provinces but also ensure that 
medicare and social assistance standards and principles remain 
intact.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12053"> 12053 </A></B>
<P>
	They admire the Canada Health Act commitment to public 
administration, comprehensiveness, universality, probability, 
and accessibility. They know that these principles are part of the 
reason the World Health Organization today declared Canada 
one of the world's five healthiest countries in which to live.
<P>
	If this government were to abandon the principles of this act 
we would betray the trust that has been placed in us by all 
Canadians. My constituents have elected me to be a part of a 
government that is realistic and compassionate, one that 
recognizes the changing times, the new realities, and demands 
new solutions.
<P>
	The people of Guelph-Wellington are hard working and 
dedicated to their families and their communities. They believe 
that these principles must remain the foundation of the Canada 
Health Act and health care in our country.
<P>
	The Leader of the Opposition and all members of his party can 
rest assured that Canada's health care system, a system that 
helps define this great nation to itself and to the world, will be 
fully protected by our government.
<P>
	Our country has had a long tradition of compromise and 
dialogue. From the very beginning our Confederation has 
evolved, and the people of my riding have supported this 
evolution. They know that if Canada is to remain the best 
country in the world the government must respond to new 
challenges and work together to secure our future.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development will 
strengthen our social programs by inviting his provincial 
colleagues to work together through consultation and mutual 
consent to develop and improve programs which will benefit all 
Canadians.
<P>
	My constituents have told me very clearly and often they want 
all levels of government to work together. They want our 
confederation to continue to protect them and their families 
from unforeseen and unfortunate circumstances. They know one 
of the reasons we are the best country in the world is that our 
social security network and our health system offer safeguards 
and protection from loss of employment or illness.
<P>
	The Leader of the Opposition encourages unfounded rumours 
that the federal government has singled out the province of 
Quebec and is imposing special standards on the provinces 
under the Canada health and social transfer. This simply is not 
true. The Quebec government has been a leader in developing 
innovative social programs. For example, it has developed a 
program which encourages low income families with children 
on social assistance to increase their employment earnings and 
it inspires low income earners not to fall back on social 
assistance. These kinds of programs are exactly what my 
constituents have asked for; programs which encourage 
independence and build up the human spirit rather than 
programs which encourage the cycle of reliance.
<P>
	In the past programs like these have not been shared under the 
Canada assistance plan. Cost sharing requirements under CAP 
are too restrictive. As well, the previous Quebec government 
came up with proposals for delivering social services for school 
children but these too were rejected because they did not meet 
the definition under the Canada assistance plan of welfare 
services.
<P>
	It is because of these new and innovative programs sponsored 
and encouraged by governments like Quebec that the Canada 
health and social transfer is needed. The new transfer affords 
flexibility and allows the provinces to continue their important 
work in encouraging social service recipients and others to 
better care for themselves and for their families. Under the 
Canada health and social transfer Quebec and other provinces 
will have much greater flexibility; flexibility with 
responsibility to experiment with imagined ways of delivering 
social assistance and social services. What more could we ask 
for?
<P>
	From these examples I hope the Leader of the Opposition and 
his party would be giving full support to the Canada health and 
social transfer legislation.
<P>
	All of us were elected under unique situations and 
circumstances. Each of us in the House is here because our 
constituents were tired of politics as usual. They were tired of 
one level of government blaming the other and they no longer 
wanted to hear excuses as to why their best interests were not 
represented. They have asked us, no matter what party 
affiliation, to make the country better and to make its systems of 
social security and health better.
<P>
	We have a choice. We can move ahead or we can linger in the 
old way of blame and suspicion. My constituents want better 
from me, better from the government and better from the 
opposition. They want us to work together to ensure Canada 
remains the best country in the world in which to live. They want 
positive new ideas. They want innovative approaches. Most of 
all, they want Canada to remain united for their benefit and the 
benefit of Canadians from coast to coast.
<P>
	On October 25, 1993 the people of Canada gave us their hopes 
and their dreams for a better country. They want the provinces to 
manage what they do best and they want national standards 
which safeguard every single Canadian. They know the 
government is not conspiring to weaken the social fabric of 
Canada, but instead is attempting to strengthen it.
<P>
	I invite the Leader of the Opposition to work with us, for his 
constituents and for mine, to build up the weak, to give aid to the 
sick, to protect the most in need and to encourage independence 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12054"> 12054 </A></B>
<P>
to those who rely on government. The people of his riding and 
mine demand no less.
<P>
<B>(1305 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am grateful for the opportunity today to talk about 
medicare and the Canada Health Act. I want to explain how and 
why the government supports medicare and why we on this side 
of the House will continue to support it.
<P>
	The federal budget tabled in February was one of the most 
widely supported budgets in the history of Canada. Some 
people, in particular the Reform Party, say the budget raises 
questions about our commitment to health. They ask whether we 
will continue to have the capacity to maintain a national system 
and they ask whether we will uphold the principles of the 
Canada Health Act.
<P>
	There are no grounds for dire predictions that the federal 
government will not be able to uphold the Canada Health Act or 
that Canada's health care system will disintegrate as a result of 
the budget. Take the new Canada social and health transfer. It 
will not diminish, weaken or erode the strength of our health 
system.
<P>
	On many occasions the Prime Minister and the Minister of 
Health have been quite clear on the matter. Let me remind the 
House how clear the budget speech was on this matter. The 
Minister of Finance said no change will be made to the Canada 
Health Act.
<P>
	The Minister of Health was equally clear when she spoke to 
the Canadian Hospital Association last March: ``There is no 
change in the government's commitment or in my own 
commitment, to uphold and enforce the principles of the Canada 
Health Act''. As the Prime Minister said in Saskatoon, for 
Canadians these principles are non-negotiable.
<P>
	The word health was added to the title of the new transfer 
when the enabling budget legislation was introduced to the 
House. This was no accident. It confirms the government's 
intention to remain active in enforcing the principles of the 
Canada Health Act.
<P>
	The new transfer agreement will be in a block funding 
arrangement. That move may worry some members but let us 
not forget block funding for health care and post-secondary 
education is now 18 years old. The established programs 
financing funding mechanism put in place in 1977 is a block 
funding arrangement. There is no requirement in it for provinces 
to spend money on health. However, what is there and what was 
nailed down in 1984 when the Liberal government passed the 
Canada Health Act is the requirement that provinces deliver 
health care services in compliance with the five conditions of 
the act or face a deduction from money transferred to them.
<P>
	Some worry that under the current thinking about the Canada 
social and health transfer no clear dollar amount will be denoted 
as a health portion. Again it is worthy of emphasis that under the 
EPF funding there was no longer a relationship between what 
was called the health portion and the actual provincial 
expenditures. It was merely a historical artefact based on the 
national averages of some 20 years ago.
<P>
	Nothing in the budget will change the government's technical 
ability to enforce the Canada Health Act's principles. The 
enforcement mechanism remains the same. The deductions from 
transfer payments are necessary; they will be made. Canadians 
can rest assured the Canadian social and health transfer will not 
reduce the federal ability to enforce these principles. We will 
enforce them because the principles of universality, 
accessibility, comprehensiveness, portability and public 
administration are ultimately rooted in our common values; 
Canadian values such as equity, fairness, compassion and 
respect for the fundamental dignity of all. We will also enforce 
the principles of the Canada Health Act because we support an 
economically efficient health care system.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	It is worth reminding opposition members that the principles 
of the Canada Health Act are not just words. They have meaning. 
I want to touch briefly on each of the principles.
<P>
	The first principle of universality is that all residents in a 
province must be insured by the provincial health plan if it is to 
receive federal support. This means we must all have access to 
services. People cannot be deinsured because they might be too 
costly for the system to cover. We cannot be turned away from a 
hospital door because we have not paid our annual tax bill or 
some provincial premium. If we need health care we will be 
treated in the same manner as everyone else.
<P>
	Accessibility on uniform terms and conditions is the second 
principle. It means we should not face any financial barriers in 
receiving health care or extra billing, user charges, facility fees 
or up front cash payments. If the service is medically necessary 
we will get it at a time defined by medical considerations, not by 
the size of our wallet.
<P>
	The next is comprehensiveness. This principle recognizes 
Canadians have a range of health care needs and that those needs 
should be met. If we scratch the surface a little more we will see 
that comprehensiveness again means the practice of fairness. It 
would not be fair to ensure only some medically necessary 
services and not others. I do not believe we should choose at the 
federal level which services are medically necessary. In my 
view we should continue to interpret the Canada Health Act as 
requiring coverage of all medically necessary services.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12055"> 12055 </A></B>
<P>
	The government will continue to take a position that if a 
province insures any part of the cost of a service it is an 
indication it believes it to be medically necessary and all of the 
costs should be covered.
<P>
	Justice Emmet Hall in his original royal commission on 
medicare recommended a very comprehensive package. Liberal 
governments in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s accepted the 
concept of comprehensiveness, although not quite as broad a 
concept as Justice Hall's. Liberal governments in the 1990s will 
not turn their backs on these principles.
<P>
	The fourth principle is portability. It means Canadians 
maintain their health care package when they travel or move. 
The portability principle is rooted in one fundamental element; 
underpinning our federation, it recognizes our mobility. 
Canadians are free to work and travel anywhere in the country 
without fear of losing their health care insurance coverage. 
Portability is what makes our national health insurance system 
truly national. Each separate health insurance plan may be 
provincial in origin but it is recognized nationally in every 
province.
<P>
	The fifth principle is public administration.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	Our health insurance plans must be operated by provincial 
governments on a non-profit basis. In my view these principles 
never seem to get the same attention as others. But they should. 
It is the core of our ability to contain costs in the system and thus 
to deliver quality care at an affordable price. One would think 
that of all five principles our Reform friends across the way 
would certainly be able to relate to this one.
<P>
	Public administration is a means by which to ensure the 
principles. Health care insurance is operated and funded through 
governments. We can guarantee that our health care is universal, 
accessible, comprehensive, portable, and that we have direct 
control over it. It is through public administration that we 
demonstrate our collective responsibility to the health care of 
Canadians.
<P>
	I look forward to further comments this afternoon.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would first like to congratulate my 
colleague on his remarks in which he stressed the principles 
advocated by the federal government, enabling it to impose 
national standards on provincial governments, particularly the 
Government of Quebec, in areas of jurisdiction that are strictly 
and exclusively provincial.
<P>
	The hon. member, my colleague, can therefore convey to us 
the importance of these principles for the federal government, 
how dear they are to the Liberal Party. However, if we look at the 
facts, including Bill C-76, we discover the real principles 
behind the government's wanting to get involved in provincial 
jurisdiction, even though it no longer has the means to do so. 
After getting  us in debt, as I said a few minutes ago in my 
remarks, the federal government, which will have roughly a 28 
per cent share in the cost of the social programs of the 
Government of Quebec, after 1998, still wants to impose, it 
insists on imposing, national standards. But what are these 
principles so dear to the heart of the federal government?
<P>
	Clause 37 of Bill C-76 speaks eloquently in this regard. I will 
take the liberty of quoting it:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In order that a province may qualify for a full cash contribution referred to 
in section 5-</BLOCKQUOTE>
that is, the transfers in health care,
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-the government of the province-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>b</I>) shall give recognition to the Canada Health and Social Transfer in any public 
documents, or in any advertising or promotional material, relating to insured 
health services and extended health care services in the province.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In concrete terms, it is the old ``flag on the hood'' principle, 
so dear to our Prime Minister. We remember the Prime Minister 
when he was the minister responsible for the adoption of the 
constitution in 1982, he was the one who made us swallow the 
current constitution, which excluded Quebec. He said: ``All that 
interests the separatists is a flag on the hood. They like driving 
around in France, in Paris, with the Quebec flag, thus mocking 
their own people, the representatives of the Government of 
Quebec''. Now here we are in 1995 with the ``flag on the hood'' 
principle in the Canada Social Transfer.
<P>
	I would like to hear what my colleague has to say about this 
principle, which we see in black and white in Bill C-76, where it 
says that the Canadian flag must appear on documents, cheques 
and so forth, when the federal government is involved, even 
though it is less and less involved.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Unfortunately, the hon. 
member has very little time to respond to the remarks of the 
member for Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Within no more than a minute I would ask the member to 
respond to the comment and question of the member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Culbert:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will try to respond as quickly as I 
possibly can to my hon. colleague across the way.
<P>
	The number one point I would like to make is that it is called 
responsibility. A responsible government sets a commitment, a 
goal and a challenge. It is prepared to meet the challenges that 
were set in a very balanced and responsible fashion for all parts 
of Canada, including the great province of Quebec which I 
greatly respect.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12056"> 12056 </A></B>
<P>
	As I mentioned in my speech, it should be done with the 
Canadian values of equity, fairness, compassion and dignity for 
all Canadians in mind. That is the way to do it in a balanced 
fashion.
<P>
	If members of the Bloc concentrated their efforts on some of 
the areas indicated in the Prime Minister's speech on the 
weekend, they would be far better off than they are with their 
discussion of separation and dividing the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am glad 
to have the opportunity to speak to the Bloc's motion concerning 
the Canada health and social transfer.
<P>
	While its wording is a little extravagant and its claim 
somewhat exaggerated, the motion's analysis of the CHST that 
it does not go far enough toward the decentralization of health, 
advanced education and social assistance is one that we as 
Reformers could agree with.
<P>
	Like the Bloc, Reform believes that the federal government 
must give the provinces, which have exclusive constitutional 
jurisdiction over the programs, more freedom to design and 
administer social programs. We share the Bloc's belief that 
programs of this nature should be delivered by levels of 
government closest to the people rather than by distant federal 
bureaucrats. Unlike the Bloc, however, Reform differs in how to 
decentralize the powers.
<P>
	The Bloc has only one solution to our nation's problems, 
separation, but we in the Reform Party do not want to destroy 
Canada. We want to build it.
<P>
	Reform believes that the solutions to our problems lie not in 
separation but in legislation and negotiation. Our Constitution 
already grants us the flexibility we need. Over its first 128 years 
the Canadian federation has proved to be extremely malleable. It 
has bent and reshaped itself to meet the needs of the day. Even in 
the absence of full scale constitutional reform I am confident 
our federation will adapt again to the needs of circumstances in 
the next 128 years.
<P>
	In defence of the government, the Canada health and social 
transfer is a modest example of rebalancing the federation 
through legislation. While the government's primary motive in 
creating the Canada health and social transfer was to save 
money. a secondary intention is undoubtedly to further 
decentralize programs. The most promising element of the 
CHST is the government's decision to remove all federally 
imposed restrictions on welfare funding except the residence 
requirement.
<P>
	By shifting to unconditional block funding the federal 
government gives the provinces more freedom to experiment 
and to innovate. It will allow the people of each province to 
decide how best to deliver the services the citizens want. 
Unfortunately this decentralizing thrust is not extended to 
health care and advanced education, the other two components 
of the Canada health and social transfer.
<P>
	The federal government's refusal to amend or reinterpret the 
Canada Health Act and the pooling of health, welfare and 
education funds into a single transfer payment give Ottawa an 
even bigger stick with which to beat the provinces into 
submission. It is a backward step that will make it more difficult 
for the provinces to control their health care costs.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	This aspect of the Canada health and social transfer is a 
perfect example of the federal government trying to have its 
cake and eating it too. In the budget the Liberal government 
unilaterally reduced its cash transfers for health, education and 
welfare by some 40 per cent, yet at the same time it is continuing 
to insist that the provinces play by its rules.
<P>
	This just is not right. If the federal government wants to set 
the ground rules in areas of provincial jurisdiction then it has to 
pay its share of the burden. If it is no longer willing or able to put 
up the dollars, which describes the present situation in Canada 
fairly accurately, it must be prepared to step aside and let each 
province decide how best to provide for its citizens' health care 
needs.
<P>
	The truth is that the federal government cannot afford to use 
its spending power the way it did in the 1960s, the 1970s and the 
1980s. The country is broke. It does not have the funds to deal 
with the programs as it has in the past. The federal debt, as we all 
know, is somewhere around $550 billion.
<P>
	Just as important in political terms, further centralization is a 
non-starter all across Canada, not just in Quebec as the motion 
indicates. People are demanding the power and decision making 
be pushed down to the lowest level of government, to the 
grassroots. The Liberals are strong believers in central 
government. We can believe in rigid national standards but we 
can simply no longer afford them either fiscally or politically. 
Nor are they administratively responsible at this time in our 
history.
<P>
	There is an alternative path we can follow toward a more 
flexible and decentralized federation which will offer provincial 
governments the freedom they need to make the choices they 
want for their respective citizens. To illustrate the alternative 
vision I look at the Reform taxpayers' budget that was presented 
to this assembly.
<P>
	An amazing fact that no one picked up on in the budget is that 
the Liberals, the party of compassion, cut almost twice as much 
from the programs that make up the Canada health and social 
transfer as Reformers recommended in their alternative budget. 
In our taxpayers' budget we recommended reductions of $800 
million in health, $200 million in education and $2.5 billion in 
welfare, for a total of $3.5 billion of expenditure reductions over 
a three-year period. In contrast, the government's budget 
reduces the cash transfer components of the Canada health and 
social transfer by $6.6 billion over the same three years. Who  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12057"> 12057 </A></B>
<P>
has the most compassion in terms of the social needs of 
Canadians?
<P>
	What distinguishes our proposal from the Canada health and 
social transfer is the decentralizing aspects of the taxpayers' 
budget. I would like to talk briefly about one element of the 
decentralizing initiative, the unconditional transfer of tax points 
to the provinces, which the budget of the Liberal government 
denies the provinces and Canadians.
<P>
	The most significant difference between the CHST and our 
own Reform proposal is that we would transfer additional tax 
points to the provinces, whereas the Liberal budget would not. 
This is important for two reasons: first, because it provides 
increased flexibility and, second, because it ensures the stability 
of funding for the provinces.
<P>
	On the first point, we all realize that the federal government 
can no longer continue to spend money it does not have. We in 
the Reform Party have openly acknowledged that and have 
stated publicly that as part of the Reform's deficit elimination 
plan we would cut $3.5 billion over a three-year period in the 
areas of health, education and welfare. Reformers also realize 
that if provincial governments are to absorb reductions of this 
magnitude they will need the freedom to innovate and to 
discover more efficient ways of delivering services.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	That is why our tax point transfer is unconditional, with no 
strings attached. It is designed to provide maximum flexibility 
to the provinces of Canada.
<P>
	On the second point, if provincial governments are to 
effectively provide these services then they must be given the 
resources to fulfil their responsibilities. They must be able to 
count on stable, long term revenue resources. Yet under the 
CHST this security does not exist. The federal government can 
unilaterally, at any time, reduce or alter the transfer to the 
provinces. This provides provincial governments with neither 
stability nor security.
<P>
	Under the Reform's tax point transfer alternative, provinces 
would no longer have to guess how much Ottawa was going to 
send to them; they would know. This would allow them to extend 
their planning horizons, confident that money is going to be 
there. In addition, since the value of the tax points grows along 
with the economy, Reform's proposal would effectively 
increase funding for these programs over the medium and the 
long term.
<P>
	In conclusion, Reform and the Bloc agree on the need for 
greater decentralization of powers to local and provincial 
governments. We also agree that the government's new Canada 
health and social transfer does not adequately meet this need. 
However, unlike the Bloc, we do not advocate destroying the 
country; we advocate rebuilding it. I would hope the suggestions 
we offer as the Reform Party here today, including the concept 
of transferring additional tax points to the provinces, will  mark 
a positive beginning in this rebuilding process in our Canadian 
social fabric.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Wellington-Waterloo, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it certainly is a case of strange bedfellows 
when we see the hon. member for Lethbridge joining forces with 
the Bloc: one is trying to separate us, the other trying to 
balkanize us, a different form of separation.
<P>
	They propose we give all of this money to the provinces with 
no strings attached. Code word: break up the national health care 
program; do not give a standard payment for welfare; shaft those 
who have no consensus from one side of the country to the other. 
Those are the code words they use in the House every day. It is 
not fair to those who can least defend themselves.
<P>
	On the welfare payments, you go to certain provinces and they 
ask you to take the next bus to British Columbia. That is the kind 
of compassion that comes from this kind of proposal.
<P>
	The federal government has a right and a responsibility to stay 
in touch with those in need. When they set a national standard 
they should see that the money they transfer goes to meet that 
standard. That is the case with every program, and that should be 
put in.
<P>
	For those people from Newfoundland to British Columbia and 
those in between it is important to see that their services are 
delivered equally. No one group in Canada should get better 
services than another when it comes to health care.
<P>
	I am sick and tired of hearing remarks like: ``We will give 
them the chance to do whatever they want''. That is a great 
statement. They can do whatever they want with those who 
cannot defend themselves.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, in response to the 
hon. member I want to say this. In this federation we are trying 
to build it is time that we start to trust our partners. The partners 
we must trust are the provinces. The 10 provinces of Canada 
must be trusted to take on responsibilities to meet the needs of 
their citizens, determined by the priorities of the citizens in their 
respective provinces.
<P>
	I have witnessed in my political career for 32 years situations 
where provinces often had a greater care and a greater 
compassion than the federal government with regard to the 
priority needs of the provinces.
<P>
	When I come to this House it is disappointing to hear someone 
who has been around this assembly for some period of time and 
to hear the Liberal government, which thinks it has all of the 
answers and wants to centralize everything in a centralized 
bureaucratic system, tell the provinces what to do. They think 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12058"> 12058 </A></B>
<P>
that under that system they are going to meet the needs of the 
citizens. We will not build federalism with that kind of mistrust.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my colleague from the West mentioned, in his speech, that he 
was committed to keeping the country together. He also stressed 
how important it was to negotiate.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	I would like to remind him that Quebec has long been asking 
in vain for a special status within Canada, in recognition of its 
unique French culture. This is not negotiating. The 1982 
Constitution was forced on Quebec. We did not accept it, we 
tried repeatedly to negotiate. It would appear that the federal 
government is no longer interested in negotiating with Quebec. 
Once again, Quebec is losing. These are two reasons why 
Quebec wants to separate from the rest of Canada.
<P>
	In his speech, the member also said that the federal 
government was bankrupt. Not only is it bankrupt, but as we 
saw, the Liberal government has no vision. It makes cuts 
everywhere. Without any vision, it lacks compassion for the less 
fortunate. This is not reassuring.
<P>
	I want to tell you that another reason why we want Quebec to 
become sovereign, is that we will do better on our own, we know 
what our needs are, and we know how to solve our problems, if 
only the federal government did not interfere. This is why we 
want to separate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, very briefly, 
number one, I would fight and stand shoulder to shoulder with 
Quebec and any other province in this nation so that we are all 
treated equally. That is a very important principle.
<P>
	I had the opportunity over the years to negotiate with the 
federal government and stand shoulder to shoulder with 
ministers from Quebec to fight for our fair share of health 
payments: social service payments, housing grants and moneys 
from the federal government. The province of Alberta and the 
province of Quebec at the negotiating and bargaining table over 
and over again, and I can say this without exception, always had 
the same point of view. We were partners in negotiating with the 
federal government to get our respective share of either federal 
funds or legislation that was required to carry out our 
responsibilities.
<P>
	We were never in conflict with our objectives. That was part 
of the federation that was very important. A part that is often 
overlooked by Quebec and by other people in Canada is that 
Quebec did have allies in Canada fighting for the same cause and 
the same purpose. That should continue in this federation. I 
would be disappointed if it did not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to have the opportunity to address this problem.
<P>
	I had an opportunity to meet with some graduates in my 
constituency last Friday from three classes of high school 
students in three different areas. I asked each one of these 
classes, ``Why do you think health, post-secondary education, 
and welfare are being reviewed in Canada today?`` They said to 
me: ``We think this is a political agenda. This somehow is 
something the politicians must do.''
<P>
	When I explained to them I took from some brand new federal 
documents from StatsCan the following figures. These figures 
are a fascinating indictment of some of the things we have tried 
to do in our country. Servicing the federal government debt will 
cost $1,522 per person in 1994-95. The federal government in 
1994-95 will spend $268 per person on health and $168 on 
post-secondary education. That is $1,522 compared to $268 and 
$168.
<P>
	The students in those three high school classes said to me: 
``Isn't that the problem then? Isn't that the problem for Quebec? 
Isn't that the problem for Alberta?'' My answer is yes, that is the 
problem.
<P>
	It would be very easy to be an opposition member and point 
fingers and blame the Liberal government. I do not think that is 
helpful.
<P>
	In the same report it goes on to say-just in case those in 
Quebec think they can point the finger only at the federal 
government-that the provincial debt in Quebec is the highest in 
Canada, at $8,413 per person.
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	These figures go on to show all the provinces lined up in terms 
of their debt. The next closest is Nova Scotia, with $8,405, all 
the way down to Alberta, at $1,404 per person. I invite members 
to look at these documents. They are publicly available.
<P>
	It is not sufficient to stand back as an Albertan and say it is the 
problem of the federal government. This is a Canadian problem, 
a problem far too big to be pointing fingers at.
<P>
	I have had occasion to try to determine who is leading the 
debate in Canada. My big interest is health care, and I find that 
the public is far ahead of the politicians in this debate. The CBC 
has just done a four-part program on the future of our health 
care system, something that is unheard of in Canada. At the end 
of their four-part program it did a survey and asked Canadians if 
health care, the way it is set up today, is affordable. This 
question was not asked in a political sense; it was asked to 
practical, commonsense Canadians: Can we afford health care 
the way it is set up today?
<P>
	Before I go to the answer, 57 per cent said health care was the 
most important government social program. I agree. However, 
about 90 per cent of Canadians polled in that survey said they 
expected medicare would cover fewer services in the future; 45 
per cent predicted all  necessary services would be retained; 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12059"> 12059 </A></B>
<P>
another 45 per cent said only the most essential services would 
be covered and that most people would have to pay for much of 
the other health care needs.
<P>
	When Reformers stood in the House last Thursday to initiate 
the first debate on health care in the House literally in years, an 
old time parliamentarian said to me: ``Is it not interesting who 
should initiate this debate on health care? There has not been 
such a debate for years.'' When we stood in the House and 
initiated this debate, the press said you cannot talk about this, it 
is a sacred program; you cannot talk about changes to health 
care. However, the public in Canada says otherwise. I think the 
public is ahead of the politicians.
<P>
	Can we trust the government to do what is right? Can we trust 
the party opposite, the government of the day, to do what is 
right? I do not believe that we could hope for anything but. On 
health care, this government will do what is right. Canadians 
value this program so strongly that no one could get away with 
doing what is wrong on health care. Can we trust the government 
to move in the right direction on health care reform?
<P>
	I listened to the Prime Minister say he felt that health care 
needed to return to basics. When my province asked for a 
definition of the basics, the hands went up and the answer came: 
``No chance for that''. A senior medical practitioner in Quebec 
said virtually the same thing. And this is new information. It 
comes from the senior general medical practitioner in Quebec 
who said there needs to be a change in the way health care is 
delivered because ``the Quebec public health care system is on 
the brink of bankruptcy.'' Those are Dr. Clément Richer's 
words, not mine.
<P>
	Is the rhetoric sufficient on social program review? It is not. 
Are promises that were made in the red book 18 months ago 
sufficient on social program reform? They are not. Quebec is 
asking and I believe the Bloc is asking to be treated fairly under 
the new proposals. I support them in that request. They deserve 
to be treated fairly as does every citizen in Canada. Shall we 
blame, argue, point fingers? My advisers say no, we need to find 
solutions.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	The motion the Bloc has presented is well intentioned, 
however, it does not point to any solutions. It seems to me to be 
pointing fingers. Members of the Bloc should look at Quebec's 
own debt. Look at the $8,400 worth of provincial debt. Consider 
that with the $18,000 of debt which is federal. The two go hand 
in hand and are extremely important.
<P>
	I ask the question, what will keep Quebec in Canada? Surely 
that is my desire. Quebecers need the freedom to nourish their 
culture and their language. They need authority over areas of 
provincial jurisdiction. I feel that Quebecers looking at Canada 
as most Canadians look at Quebec, equals working toward a 
common goal. The rhetoric will die out. Practicality will win 
out.
<P>
	I listened to the Minister of Health ask on Thursday, how 
would Reformers coerce the provinces into following national 
standards, and I shake my head. The provinces do not need to be 
coerced into following social program review. They need to 
have the tools. They need to have the information. They need to 
have the co-operation. They need to have the work of every 
single man and woman in these chambers.
<P>
	It is a privilege to be a member of this House. When 
parliamentarians argue and gripe and frown and grimace at one 
another it sometimes detracts from the importance of the job 
that we do here. I dedicate my service to try to make sure that we 
have good social programs in Canada, programs that will 
survive the economic crisis we are in. That service is too 
important to be denigrated by arguing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday I had the 
pleasure of meeting with a representative of a community group 
on Somerset West in my riding of Ottawa Centre. The subject of 
discussion was the Canada assistance plan.
<P>
	Groups have called on the federal government to enter into 
discussions with the provincial government in order to ensure 
that there are standards, objectives and goals and that the 
priorities are set straight. Also, they have called on the federal 
government to ensure that community groups such as the 
organization I mentioned are involved in the process when it 
comes to the delivery of programs or the setting up of principles. 
I support their demands.
<P>
	I bring to the attention of my colleagues section 36(1) of the 
Canadian Constitution. It permits the federal government as 
well as the provincial government jointly to promote equal 
opportunities for the well-being of Canadians to further 
economic development and to reduce disparities.
<P>
	In fact, the federal government has a significant 
responsibility to ensure vertical equity among Canadians as well 
as horizontal equity among the country's regions. That is 
exactly what the government set out to do in the 1995 budget. I 
refer to page 53 of the budget.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance stated that the federal government 
under the leadership of the Minister of Human Resources 
Development will invite all provincial governments to work 
together on developing through mutual consent a set of shared 
principles and objectives that could underlie the new transfer. In 
this way, all governments could reaffirm their commitment to 
the social well-being of Canadians. In other words, the 
government is committed to building consensus among the 
provinces and not imposing it on the provinces.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12060"> 12060 </A></B>
<P>
	The submissions of both opposition parties seem to be 
clashing with one another. They are flying in different directions 
and missing the point of what this government is trying to do. 
What this government has tried to do is to consult with the 
provinces.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	Did the hon. member have any representation from his 
constituency, as I did in mine, on the need for consultation and 
the need for setting minimum standards and goals and objectives 
when it comes to CAP transfers or block transfers to the 
provinces?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can frankly say that I have 
not had any such consultations. In my part of the country the 
general consensus is that the federal government is too intrusive 
and has lost its moral authority. The $1,522 debt that it has 
discharged on every person in Canada has left them without the 
ability to do what they have traditionally wanted to do. 
Therefore there is no sense of that in my part of the country at 
all.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first, I would like to congratulate my Reform 
Party colleague for his presentation. He spoke about the Quebec 
debt being very high, as high as $8,400 per capita, and said that 
Bloc Quebecois members should look at what is happening in 
their own province before they point a finger at the federal 
government.
<P>
	I think there is not one Bloc Quebecois member who rose in 
this House to say that Quebec's debt is unimportant and that we 
should not be concerned, quite the contrary. Members of the 
Bloc Quebecois and of the Parti Quebecois government know 
that during the ten years of Liberal government, the debt has 
more than doubled and that something has to be done about that 
situation.
<P>
	The member also accuses our Bloc colleagues of not 
proposing solutions in this debate. Let me remind him that 
solutions were proposed, again by all stakeholders from the 
Quebec government. I would like to hear what he has to say on 
that point. When we speak about manpower training, there is a 
consensus in Quebec. All stakeholders, whatever their political 
affiliation, want the federal government to withdraw completely 
from that area and let Quebec take over. We ask the same thing 
for health and education. We want the federal government to 
transfer tax points and let us manage those areas. We will do so 
very efficiently.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, as my colleague from 
Lethbridge said, there is a common ground between Quebec and 
many other parts of the country. On this issue where it speaks 
specifically about withdrawing from areas of provincial 
responsibility we do have common ground.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure for me to have a few minutes to participate in this 
opposition day debate on the Canada health and social transfer 
initiative put forward by this government.
<P>
	Many things have been said about the recent budget by the 
Minister of Finance, mostly good things. Canadians have 
significantly expressed their support for this budget in poll after 
poll. On radio and television talk shows they expressed their 
support in vast numbers for the federal government's recent 
budget. This budget, I might add, will no doubt go down in 
history as a significant step forward for this country.
<P>
	As Canadians see this budget as an opportunity to put the 
government's finances back on track after so many years of 
mismanagement, it would seem that the NDP in Ontario see this 
as an opportunity of a different sort. Our Bloc colleagues in this 
House see the budget as a chance to take something away from 
what has become a very positive discussion for Canadians.
<P>
	Let me take a few moments and relate my thoughts on what 
the NDP is attempting to do in Ontario by focusing on the 
federal budget. It is clear that the NDP in Ontario does not have a 
record it can reliably depend on to get it through the Ontario 
election which is now under way. In fact, some of my colleagues 
may have received in the mail a package from the Ontario 
government called ``The 1995 Ontario Budget Plan''. It is a 
small document outlining what the NDP claims to have done and 
will do if re-elected.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I would caution the 
hon. member on the use of accessories or props. If he is going to 
quote from a document, I understand that full well. Otherwise I 
would caution him on the use of props.
<P>
	<B>Mr. St. Denis:</B> Mr. Speaker, the purpose of referring to this 
document is to bring to the attention of my hon. colleagues that 
the NDP has attempted to hang its success on the federal budget. 
I dare suggest to the Ontario NDP that this attempt will fail. 
Canadians have too much respect and regard for their federal 
finance minister to be taken in by a plan such as this.
<P>
	In fact, the Canadian Federation of Students made a 
presentation to the finance committee earlier today. They 
expressed concerns about the budget but they put forward 
positive ideas. I suggest that the Ontario NDP should be looking 
for positive ways to make this country work.
<P>
	Our Bloc colleagues are attempting to use the budget as an 
opportunity to make gains on their own agenda. The agenda of 
the Bloc is quite obvious. There is no need to remind the House 
and Canadians what the Bloc agenda is. As the motion says in 
part, the Bloc is questioning what it alleges to be an imposition 
of standards on the provinces. Nowhere in the federal budget is 
<P>

<B><A NAME="12061"> 12061 </A></B>
<P>
the finance minister or this government imposing standards on 
the provinces which in the first  place are not there, or in the 
second place are standards which Canadians do not want.
<P>
	I know that during my election campaign in the fall of 1993-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleague, of course, will have the floor 
after question period.
<P>
	It being 2 p.m., we will now proceed to statements by 
members.

	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Wellington-Waterloo,

firefighters.
<P>
	This week firefighters from across the country are meeting in 
Ottawa for the International Association of Firefighters fourth 
annual legislative conference.
<P>
	These brave men and women are an integral part of every 
Canadian community. With little regard for their own personal 
safety they battle in the most dangerous of conditions, providing 
Canadians with peace of mind.
<P>
	Their exposure to infectious diseases is a major reason 
firefighting is one of the world's most dangerous professions. 
Firefighters routinely provide emergency medical treatment in 
unsanitary field conditions on patients they know nothing about. 
This results in firefighters being occupationally exposed to a 
variety of dangerous contagious diseases.
<P>
	Firefighters who have been exposed to infectious diseases 
need to be further informed of this fact so they can seek medical 
monitoring and modify their behaviour to avoid further 
transmission. It is my hope that the federal government will 
soon provide this information.
<P>
	I salute Canada's firefighters.

	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
because of a difference in the French and English versions of the 
federal income tax return, French-speaking Canadian taxpayers 
living temporarily outside Canada will pay more income tax 
than their English-speaking counterparts.
<P>
	Line 419 of the French version refers to a 4.56 per cent surtax, 
while the surtax in the English version is only 3 per cent.
<P>
	The Commissioner of Official Languages, Victor Goldbloom, 
was totally justified in saying in his 1994 report that the 
bilingualism policy was still poorly implemented more than a 
quarter century after its adoption.
<P>
	How can the government justify such a lack of rigour where 
the equitable treatment of francophones in Canada is 
concerned?

	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, firefighters 
and paramedics respond when we call 911 for their help. They 
rush to our aid with little regard for their own personal safety. 
Sometimes they are injured. Sometimes they are infected. They 
approach Parliament this week with a simple request: ``Inform 
us if we have a risk of infection''. This proposal will not produce 
new testing, will guarantee patient confidentiality and would 
never result in someone going without the help they desperately 
need.
<P>
	In a sense the firefighters are calling 911 to the Minister of 
Health but she has put them on hold. They deserve better. I call 
on the health minister to act now.

Mr. Speaker, the Minister of National Defence announced the 
Liberal government's acceptance of the proposal to double, 
perhaps triple, the number of low level military flights that take 
place over Innu territory in Labrador and Quebec.
<P>
	The military aircraft fly at 30 metres above the ground, 
disrupt wildlife and imperil hunting and fishing grounds. 
Caribou are often found starved, too frightened to eat. The Innu, 
who live off the land and its animals, worry about the future of 
their traditional way of life.
<P>
	The government is aware that its environmental assessment 
panel admitted the impact on the environment and aboriginal 
rights is unknown and refused to listen to issues raised by 
aboriginal people relating to their land.
<P>
	The Innu have never signed a treaty with the Canadian 
government for the use of their land and the government has 
never asked permission to conduct these military flights over 
that territory. All the Innu people want is a life of peace.

	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on the 
morning of April 17, 1943 a Lancaster bomber with a 
seven-man crew, part of the 83rd Squadron, crashed in German 
occupied France after a raid on Manheim, Germany. The pilot, 
Pilot Officer Glen McNichol, was killed in the crash and the six 
survivors were taken prisoner.
<P>
	Pilot Officer Harold Beaupré, one of the survivors, was 
liberated from a prisoner of war camp in Lubeck, Germany on 
May 2, 1945. Today marks the 50th anniversary of Mr. 
Beaupré's liberation.

	Two months later, on July 2 Mr. Beaupré became a prisoner of

raised four children and continue to run their business, Beaupré 
Stamps, in uptown Waterloo. They continue to contribute to the 
social and economic life of their community.

Mr. Speaker, during the last federal election a political party in 
Canada promised to lower spending on federal administration 
and reduce subsidies to businesses. This party also promised 
cuts to national defence and argued for improved social 
spending by refocusing benefits on those most in need. These 
promises were made by the Reform Party in the blue sheet.
<P>
	However when the Liberal budget delivers and improves on 
these promises the Reform leader calls them dishonest and 
cowardly.
<P>
	Canadians have made it clear that they do not want politics as 
usual. They reject doom and gloom and Reform Party sophistry. 
Canadians want leadership and compassion. That is why in poll 
after poll they continue to support their Liberal government.

<P>
	Professional firefighters risk their lives daily in an effort to 
save the lives and property of their fellow citizens. They are the 
largest providers of field emergency medical care. In the course 
of saving lives firefighters and emergency medical personnel 
are exposed to danger, disease and hazardous materials.
<P>
	The International Association of Firefighters is committed to 
ensuring that all firefighters are provided with the most 
accurate, updated information regarding the emergency

	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs could not resist pulling another dirty trick on 
Quebec at the convention of the Quebec wing of the Liberal 
Party of Canada last weekend.
<P>
	Showing incredible contempt, Quebec's political godfather in 
the federal cabinet said that the referendum report was hurting 
Quebec City's chances of hosting the Olympic Games in 2002, 
even though both the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Prime 
Minister told us that all Canadian diplomats were actively 
supporting Quebec City's bid to the International Olympic 
Committee.
<P>
	We hope that the Canadian embassies and consulates 
responsible for promoting Quebec City's bid will do their job 
without paying attention to their boss's comments.
<P>
	After the Prime Minister said that Quebec City was prevented 
from hosting the G-7 summit because the Canadian flag does 
not fly in front of its city hall, the federal government is once

my province from the United States but it can find millions of

world community is looking to Canada and other industrialized 
nations to set a good example on the pressing issue of climate 
change.
<P>
	Certain gases, most notably carbon dioxide, collect in the 
earth's atmosphere and trap heat. Most carbon dioxide is 
produced in industrial nations from burning coal, oil and gas. 
Thus we must find ways of reducing the consumption of these 
fossil fuels.
<P>
	Climate change is not only an environmental issue, but also an 
ethical issue. If Arctic ice caps melt and oceans rise, the lives of 
millions of coastal and island people around the globe will be in 
danger. It is important that Canadians understand the cause and 
effect of climate change.

to launch a public education and awareness program to explain 
the complexity of this issue.

determination of the Vietnamese community in Canada. This 
past week marked the 20th year since the end of the war in 
Vietnam.
<P>
	The war was not just a convulsive era in world history. It was a 
horrific nightmare for its victims. A Vietnamese proverb 
teaches that if a parent is cruel, the children will choose another.
<P>
	When the war ended it did not bring peace to the people of 
Vietnam. Refugees fled a cruel parent in rickety boats, risking 
their lives to escape. Many of them made it to Canada. In fact, 
Canada has resettled more than 145,000 Indo-Chinese asylum 
seekers since 1979.
<P>
	The boat people, 23,000 of them, came to Canada where they 
faced new challenges, but as part of a welcoming Canadian 
family. These brave people have brought success born of their 
industrious nature. They have also enriched Canada's diverse 
social fabric.
<P>
	On behalf of this Parliament I would like to pay tribute to the 
Vietnamese community in Canada. Vietnam's loss has been our 
reward. I would like to pay tribute to Vietnamese Canadians and

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, early in April, the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
made a discreet trip to Los Angeles, on the very day Seagram's 
took over MCA. He went to Los Angeles accompanied only by 
his executive assistant, without any senior officials and without 
any advance briefing by his department, which is customary 
prior to a minister's trip abroad.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Minister of Canadian Heritage. 
How can he say he did not talk to the people at MCA and 
Seagram's in Los Angeles on April 10, when according to the 
Hollywood Reporter, he was MCA's guest of honour at a dinner 
the day after MCA was acquired by Seagram's?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, it is true I had lunch in the cafeteria or just 
outside the cafeteria at MCA.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Ah?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dupuy:</B> If any details are required, here they are. We had 
chicken and ice tea.
<P>
	I met representatives of major U.S. studios located in the Los 
Angeles area. I was never even remotely involved in any aspect 
of a transaction between Seagram's and MCA. I said it before 
and I say it again, I was there to defend Canadian interests, the 
interests of an industry that is important to Canada-the film 
industry-and I would expect the opposition to support these 
efforts to defend and promote the interests of an industry that is 
Canadian and located in Quebec as well.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I knew that Foreign Affairs was cutting down on 
spending by ministers abroad, but making them have lunch in 
cafeterias is going a bit too far.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> How times have changed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Indeed they have.
<P>
	Will the minister admit that he went to Los Angeles at the 
invitation of Allan Karp, president of Cineplex Odeon which 
belongs to the Bronfman family and MCA and is a party to the 
transaction concluded the day he arrived in Los Angeles?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I have contacts with all players in the 
Canadian film industry, whether they are in distribution, 
production, post-production or movie-theatre chains. So it is 
entirely normal I should have contacts with Cineplex Odeon, 
one of the big chains. However, at no time during  my contacts 
with Cineplex Odeon did I discuss what was happening, in other 
words, the acquisition of MCA by Seagram's.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, would the minister confirm that two of the guests 
of honour at his lunch on April 10, Mr. Wesserman and Mr. 
Sheinberg, the two top executives at MCA, were actually having 
lunch in the room next door with Edgar Bronfman senior and 
junior?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I could not be in two places at the same time. 
I was where I said I was. Where Mr. Bronfman and the others 
were? I was not there. I was not a witness. It is too bad the 
Leader of the Opposition keeps flogging a dead horse.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
recently learned that Cineplex-Odeon, which belongs to the 
Bronfman trust and to MCA, proposed to merge with Cinemark, 
an American company, to create a North American mega movie 
theatre company called Cineplex International. According to the 
<I>Globe and Mail</I>, if the transaction is completed, Americans will 
have a 42.6 per cent interest in Cineplex International, while the 
Bronfman/MCA group will hold 38 per cent of the shares of that 
company.
<P>
	Considering that such a transaction would put 
Cineplex-Odeon under American control, will the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage tell us if he expressed his strong 
disagreement to Cineplex-Odeon's president, Mr. Karp, who 
happens to be the person who invited the minister to Los

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government's red book contains many high-flown 
promises including one to proceed full steam ahead with the 
undefined concept of aboriginal self-government and generous 
interpretation of treaties.
<P>
	Could the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development give us an update on what he and his department 
are doing to fulfil these promises?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is community based 
self-government with about 40 First Nations. There are the 
so-called land chiefs negotiations.
<P>
	In Alberta we struck the first deal for moving gas and oil to 
aboriginal people, probably followed by another four or five.
<P>
	In Saskatchewan there are nine co-management agreements. 
We are starting co-management in Saskatchewan.
<P>
	In Manitoba we have dismantled the whole province. The 
province is now at the table.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> They will be pleased to hear that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Irwin:</B> The member asked a question. I am sure he wants 
to be informed.
<P>
	In B.C. the treaty process is moving. I am pleased to announce 
it is now supported as of the weekend by the Lutheran bishop, 
the Ukrainian Catholic bishop, the Anglican bishop and the 
Roman Catholic bishop for the first time.

	In Ontario we are negotiating with NAN for dismantling and 
moving jurisdiction of education in treaty 3 that is around Fort 
Frances, which the hon. member never gets to.

<P>
	In Quebec we are working with all 10 First Nations plus the 
Inuit.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am sorry to hear the minister is dismantling the 
province of Manitoba.
<P>
	The minister implies that the government is committed to the 
concept of self-government and resolving treaty issues. 
However at the same time the minister's officials are advising 
him in a slightly different direction.
<P>
	I quote from the minister's leaked briefing notes which advise 
the minister to bring the high expectations of the aboriginal 
community to manageable levels so that the federal government 
will avoid being placed in a position of trying to explain why it 
is not keeping its red book promises.
<P>
	My question is for the minister. Why is the minister in his 
public statements raising high expectations with respect to 
aboriginal self-government while being advised in private by 
his officials to reduce high expectations for self-government 
and to avoid red book promises?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, unlike the leader of the 
Reform Party, what I say in private is exactly what I say in 
public.
<P>
	With the aboriginal people I say just this. We have to scope 
out exactly what this means. That is part of the treaty process. If 
the leader of the Reform Party wants to know what I saw in my 
briefing books he should have been at the opening meeting with 
treaty 6 where I said just that. I signed a memorandum of 
understanding with treaty 6 in Alberta and said just that. It is in 
the public speech that was released. He probably got it from one 
of the Calgary papers.
<P>
	We have to scope out exactly what this means. It is exactly 
what we did publicly in the treaty 6 memorandum of 
understanding. It is exactly what we will do with the Iroquois, 
with the Murray treaty in Quebec, always publicly and always 
straight up. We are making progress.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this advice is contained in ministerial briefing notes 
dated April 18, 1995. Many Canadians suspect from the 
minister's past behaviour that he does not read his briefing notes 
or follow the advice from his officials.
<P>
	In the rash statements made by the minister with respect to 
self-government, do we not yet have another instance of an 
impetuous minister operating oblivious to the concerns of his 
officials and making rash statements publicly that he is advised 
against making privately?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern

famous aboriginal policy of the Reform Party. The leader has

done once again what he usually does. When he cannot deal with 
merits, when he cannot deal with compassion and when he

	The minister will announce today the appointment of a

CBC, the National Film Board and Telefilm Canada. Now, the 
Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage should table its

<P>
	How can the Minister of Canadian Heritage rationalize the 
appointment of a special committee chaired by a friend of the

preparing a report on CBC operations?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage,

Mr. Pierre Juneau, who is a distinguished Canadian, one of the 
greatest experts we have in this country, and a French-speaking 
Canadian on top of that. I am outraged at such a disgraceful

my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	Following a Croat offensive against the Serb enclave Krajina, 
Serb forces retaliated by taking 115 police officers and 
peacekeepers hostage. In addition, the UN's special envoy, Mr. 
Akashi, left Sarajevo yesterday without a signed agreement on 
extending the ceasefire in Bosnia.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Foreign Affairs update us on the situation 
of the hostages and can he reassure us that everything has been 
done to protect Canadian peacekeepers stationed in Bosnia and 
Croatia?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, the situation is certainly very serious and we hope 
that the representative of the United Nations, Mr. Akashi, will 
be successful in negotiating with the parties, on the one hand, 
the release of the hostages, and, on the other, a ceasefire which 
would bring lasting peace to this part of the world.
<P>
	I can reassure the hon. member and the other members of this 
House that we are taking appropriate measures, in collaboration 
with the other countries which have contributed to this UN 
peacekeeping mission, to protect the soldiers participating in 
this mission as much as possible.
<P>
	There are risks inherent in being a soldier, by the very nature 
of the work, but we are also aware that we cannot keep troops in 
a situation where the role they are intended to play as 
peacekeepers no longer has its place. That is why we are in the 
process of re-examining the whole issue in collaboration with 
the other governments concerned.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the minister has said a great deal about negotiations. Can he 
confirm that the UN has made no progress during its 
negotiations with the Serbs on the reopening of the humanitarian 
airlift into Sarajevo, and will he admit that he fears that the end 
of the ceasefire marks the beginning of out-and-out war?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, we regret that the parties did not accept to extend 
the ceasefire period. However, we hope that the fact that the 
ceasefire is over does not necessarily mean a new onslaught of 
hostilities. Efforts have been made to bring the parties to use 
restraint and to not resume hostilities, even though they have 
chosen not to renew the ceasefire.
<P>
	We are perfectly aware that the situation could deteriorate. 
That is why we have placed our trust in the representative of the

	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government has recently appointed a chief federal 
negotiator to help interpret the recently recognized 1760 Murray 
treaty. This leaky brief, or should I say leaked brief, of the 
minister states: ``Our participation could not be postponed for 
fear of being perceived as not wanting to discuss the treaty and 
allowing Quebec to take the lead in a tense political climate''.
<P>
	If the government is only participating because of the Quebec 
sovereignist agenda does the federal negotiator have a real 
mandate to interpret the treaties in contemporary terms as 
promised in the red book?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Murray treaty was signed

found themselves on the wrong side of the battle line. It allowed

	How is it possible for the federal representative to negotiate in 
good faith with First Nations in Quebec when he has no 
authority?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern

my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	On April 13, in an unprecedented decision, the federal 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans revealed his plan for managing 
snow crab in 1995, which will deprive Quebec fishermen of 400 
tonnes of crab, which will be transferred to Prince Edward 
Island and Nova Scotia. This improvised transfer will mean the 
loss of 40 plant jobs and over $3 million for fishermen of the 
Gaspé and Magdalen Islands.
<P>
	How does the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans justify his 
decision to transfer 400 tonnes of crab fishing quota from 
Quebec to Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question and 
for his interest in the management of the snow crab fishery in the 
gulf since this fishery is extremely valuable for all of the 
participants.
<P>
	The member will know that literally thousands of inshore 
fishermen, small boat fisherman throughout Atlantic Canada, 
including fishermen in Quebec, have been asking for a share of 
this resource during a time when prices are at a historic high and 
when landings are at a historic high.
<P>
	Therefore, I have taken a decision which gives many 
fishermen in Quebec an opportunity this year to participate in 
the snow crab fishery on a temporary basis when prices and 
landings are high. As those prices and landings turn down, the 
historic share between the provinces in snow crab returns 
exactly to normal.
<P>
	If my friend is telling me, and he may want to correct himself, 
that he does not want anybody but those who already have access 
to the resource, those who already have big incomes, to share in 
the wealth, then perhaps he can tell me that is the position of the 
Bloc Quebecois, but I would be surprised.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard St-Laurent (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the minister talks of sharing, but is he aware that this is the third 
decision by the federal government in only six months that is 
unfavourable to Quebec fishermen?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I cannot absolutely assure the member there 
is no change in the structure, no change in the sharing 
arrangement in access on a permanent basis for those who have 
permanent licences in snow crab.
<P>
<B>(1445 ) </B>
<P>
	If the member's concern is fairness, then I ask him to listen to 
what I am saying. The only change this year is temporary. 
Literally some of the boats in the midshore made $600,000 to 
$700,000 per boat last year. It is to take some of that tremendous 
wealth and for this season with high prices and high quotas to 
share some of the resource.

Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development.
<P>
	I have in my possession a leaked secret document from the 
minister's department which states: ``The fisheries situation has 
become volatile as more and more aboriginals try to exercise 
perceived fishing rights to the detriment of a properly regulated 
fishing industry''.
<P>
	Why does the minister continue to allow the native fishing 
protest on the east coast and why does he continue to defend the 
aboriginal fishing strategy on the west coast when his own 
advisers are confirming that native fishing is not properly 
monitored and has become a severe threat to Canada's fishing 
resource?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would agree with the hon. 
member on one point. There has to be monitoring of any system 
we put in place. As the minister of fisheries made quite clear, we 
have to have  monitoring internationally. We have to know 
figures, so I agree with that.
<P>
	As far as the volatility is concerned, I will tell the hon. 
member why there is volatility. It is because on April 28 on a 
B.C. open line show he called the natives of B.C. 
non-contributors.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Shame.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Irwin:</B> He said: ``Well certainly, Ben, and the whole thing 
that is dividing the native and non-native population is the fact, 
you know, so many people are just not in agreement with 
non-contributors'', referring to the aboriginal people. As long 
as Reform has this attitude there will be a volatile situation in 
B.C.
<P>
	Going back to what I said, the majority of the people in B.C. 
want to do the fair thing with the aboriginal people who live 
there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, consider that these secret documents speak of the 
detrimental effects of native fishing. Consider that millions of 
west coast salmon went missing in 1994. Consider that the 
Fraser River report slams the AFS pilot sales project as not 
being effectively monitored. Will the minister today take the 
advice of his own officials and protect our fisheries resource by 
immediately calling for a suspension of the aboriginal fishing 
strategy?
<P>
<B>(1450 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to respond to the questions about the 
aboriginal fishing strategy which is administered by the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	Let me respond by saying to the member that it is tragically 
easy but patently irresponsible for people to stand and suggest 
that one category of Canadians is responsible for all of the 
problems in the fishery. All of us bear responsibility from every 
community to the fishery. It is transparently partisan in the 
worst sense of the word to single out one community and blame 
it for the problems we have had.
<P>
	There are 35 recommendations in the Fraser panel report. All 
35 recommendations within an hour of being publicly launched 
were accepted by this government. All 35 recommendations are 
going to be implemented. The cost of conservation will be borne 
by First Nations peoples yes, and by everybody else who

recommendations of the environmental assessment panel report 
is a government decision. It is a collective decision. It is a 
decision that was taken in the best interests of all Canadians 
with respect to the obligations we have to our allies as part of the 
NATO alliance.
<P>
	It is one where the economy of Newfoundland and Labrador 
will continue to benefit in excess of $100 million a year. Over 
1,000 people will continue to be gainfully employed, 30 per cent 
of them from the aboriginal communities.
<P>
	To assure those who believe that the continuation and even the 
expansion of the number of flights is perhaps environmentally 
unsafe, we have accepted the recommendation to set up an 
institute for monitoring the environmental concerns. A third 
party will be appointed to make recommendations in the setting 
up of that institute. We fully expect the aboriginal communities 
to be equal partners in the establishment of the institute.

	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, my 
question is still for the indian affairs minister.
<P>
	How can the indian affairs minister, who is letting the national 
defence minister answer for him, be an accomplice in the 
decision taken by his defence colleague, in view of the fact that 
he is the trustee of the rights of the aboriginal people and the 
custodian of their interests throughout Canada? I want the 
minister to answer this question.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Department of National Defence is the lead ministry on this file.
<P>
	In the deliberation on the environmental assessment panel's 
report a number of ministers were involved, including the 
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Environment, my 
colleague from Newfoundland, and of course, the Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development. At all times we were 
very sensitive to the concerns of the aboriginal peoples and in 
particular, the Innu who have some difficulty with the 
recommendations  and will have some difficulty with the 
implementation of this report.
<P>
	We are inviting all aboriginal Canadians concerned, 
especially the Innu, to take part in the institute to absolutely 
assure all of us that the monitoring is done in a proper and safe 
manner so that these flights can continue.

	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we are quoting directly from this leaked document.
<P>
	The minister of fisheries should put his smart remarks to the 
minister of Indian affairs.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
<B>(1455 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, perhaps on both sides we are 
getting more and more into debate rather than questions and 
answers. I would invite the hon. member to please put his 
question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, this document 
from Indian affairs shows over $32 million has been handed 
over to 10 Indian groups to negotiate self-government. To quote 
from the document: ``Central agencies are concerned about cost 
and dispersal of effort on aboriginal files. DFO and health want 
action on treaties to support operational policies''.
<P>
	Will the minister of Indian affairs confirm the tremendous 
significance of this statement that not only does he not know 
what he is doing or what in the world his policy is, but he is also 
dragging down and impeding the initiatives of other government 
departments which are pressuring him to get on with solving his 
problems?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know what category 
the hon. member is talking about. If he is talking about 
community based self-government, this program had gone on 
for about eight or nine years before we arrived back in 
government. If he is not, he will have to clarify it later.
<P>
	As far as what Reform is doing here today, I have this 
reflection. The Reform Party does not care about the 1760 
Murray treaty or the Hurons, the Cree, the Ojibway, or Treaty 6. 
What Reform wants to do is to go to its last issue in B.C. and 
disrupt the B.C treaty process. That is Reform's agenda.
<P>
	We have spent the better part of a year and one-half getting 
120 First Nations to the table. That is something the Reform 
could never do in the millennium. They are negotiating and we 
are committed to the B.C. treaty process, no matter what the 
Reform members do or how disruptive they are.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is very interesting that the hon. member knows the Reform 
agenda. Perhaps this question might help him out a little bit.
<P>
	Since 1991, $4.6 million has been granted to the Siksika first 
nation in Alberta to negotiate a self-government agreement. We 
now learn from this document that the Siksika dropped out of the 
process so it could pursue negotiations from a direction beyond 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12072"> 12072 </A></B>
<P>
the mandate of current federal policy. In fact, we now learn there 
is no federal policy, so is it any wonder it dropped out.
<P>
	Can the minister tell the House if there is any recourse to 
recoup the $4.6 million blunder?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and </B><B>Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, by way of background, in 
Alberta where the Siksika are, the treaty is sacred. They say it is 
sacred and they do not feel we have fulfilled the spirit and intent 
of the treaty.
<P>
	Chief Strater Crowfoot is one of the pre-eminent chiefs in this 
country. He has had a difficult time with his first nation. The 
difficulty is that he wants to establish trust with the federal 
government. We will work with him and hope that he gets back 
into the system.
<P>
	Rather than saying that Strater Crowfoot and the Siksika are 
temporarily out of the process, I want to go back to what the 
Minister of Justice said when members of the House voted for 
gun control. Forty First Nations are still in the process and still 
working toward completion.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the government.
<P>
	As the government knows, the international firefighters are 
having their convention in town, and they are very frustrated by 
the lack of progress with respect to the setting up of an 
infectious diseases protocol. There is wide support for this 
protocol in the House, and I would like to ask whoever is 
speaking on behalf of the government on this issue today why 
there has not been progress. When will there be progress? Will 
the government commit to bringing in this protocol before the 
end of the year?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member should know that 
this government supports that process very much. It is very 
concerned with the health and protection of frontline workers 
such as firefighters.
<P>
	As a result, and because of that commitment, the government 
has assisted firefighters in setting up a meeting in January of all 
the stakeholders to discuss this issue. That will be followed up 
with a meeting in June.
<P>
	The government also has protocols on the agenda for the

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to address a matter of 
privilege today.
<P>
	As you know, Mr. Speaker, a question of privilege is raised 
when an individual member of this Chamber feels that 
something has occurred that infringes upon the ability of that 
member of Parliament to do his or her job.
<P>
	A matter of privilege should be raised at the earliest 
opportunity, and just this morning I received a letter that has 
prompted me to rise today on this matter.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12073"> 12073 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1505 ) </B>
<P>
	The point I wanted to make is prefaced by comments 
concerning a recent Board of Internal Economy decision 
relating to the production of minutes for committees. I feel that 
the Board of Internal Economy provided us with extra support 
when it decided that the minutes of committees could be 
transferred electronically. I supported and I do support the 
decision by the Board of Internal Economy that allowed us to 
have quicker access to committee minutes via the computer 
process.
<P>
	However, the printing branch of the House of Commons has 
interpreted a decision of the Board of Internal Economy in a way 
that I believe jeopardizes my ability to do my job well. That 
decision is as follows. As a result of the minutes not being 
printed by the House of Commons any more and simply put on to 
electronic transfer, individual members of Parliament such as 
myself have to print off the minutes from our computer in order 
to read them, review them, have them handy, carry them on an 
airplane and that sort of thing. The minutes are no longer 
available from the House of Commons committees branch or 
printed anywhere.
<P>
	I have a number of constituents upon whom I rely for advice in 
helping me to understand certain pieces of legislation, certain 
bills and certain matters before the House. When committees 
meet to study those issues I have always had minutes of the 
committee available to circulate among the people within my 
constituency upon whom I rely for advice to do my job.
<P>
	Today, on a request of mine from Thursday of last week, the 
printing unit of the House of Commons refused to print copies of 
minutes reproduced off my computer so that I could then 
circulate that to members of my constituency who would 
provide me with the advice I need to help me do my job. I need 
the feedback from the people in my constituency on the work 
that is going on here in Ottawa to ensure that the work I do here 
represents their interests and also ensures that I understand 
completely the impact of government legislation, programs, and 
policies on the people of my own constituency as well as across 
Canada.
<P>
	Earlier this year, as you will recall, Mr. Speaker, because we 
communicated on this matter, on the firearms legislation I had 
asked if I could print copies of the firearms legislation to 
distribute in my constituency. I was informed that was not an 
option for me to consider.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice has now appeared before the House of 
Commons committee on justice studying Bill C-68, the bill that 
I could not print in order to circulate to my constituency. I 
wanted to reproduce the minutes of the minister's statement to 
the committee, and the printing branch of the House of 
Commons told me that I could not have anything out of 
committees printed. As a result, I cannot service the people in 
my constituency  who want to know what the government is 
saying on these issues.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> With all respect to the point the member is 
making on a point of privilege, I have a little difficulty with 
agreeing, at least in this respect, that it would be a point of 
privilege. However, might I suggest to the hon. member that if 
he could draft a note to the Board of Internal Economy perhaps 
they could get an answer back to the hon. member. If at that 
point that is not acceptable, then we might pursue this not as a 
point of privilege but perhaps as a point of order.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member might consider doing this in the 
interest of getting an answer as quickly as we can for him in this 
particular dilemma.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Mr. Speaker, allow me just one minute to respond 
to your comment and conclude my remarks.
<P>
	When I requested the attention of the Board of Internal 
Economy on the printing of the firearms legislation itself, that 
process served as a delay. I ended up not being able to respond to 
my constituents who had an interest for more than two weeks 
because of the process of the Board of Internal Economy.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	Although I will pursue the matter of a letter to the board, 
because I think the printing branch is not interpreting the 
board's decision correctly, more importantly, I do think that my 
privileges have been breached here, because I am not able to do 
my job if I cannot communicate the work of this Chamber to the 
people I represent. That is a breach of my privileges, and I want 
that considered, despite what the Board of Internal Economy 
does.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I just want to very briefly submit that not being 
able to get an unlimited amount of copies of anything does not 
constitute a point of privilege.
<P>
	Second, I understand that the request in question was for 150 
copies of a particular document produced by a committee. Even 
in the days when those were produced by the House itself, those 
were not quantities usually available to members of Parliament.
<P>
	I think, Mr. Speaker, that your suggestion that this matter be 
brought before the board as a request from the hon. member is a 
good one, notwithstanding the fact that the quantities sought, if 
they were given to all members, would in fact negate any saving 
we have been trying to attempt to achieve with the board over 
the last number of months through our deliberations.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> If we would agree, I think we will proceed in 
this fashion.
<P>
	We have the spokesperson for the Board of Internal Economy 
saying that this will be taken up at the earliest possible time. We 
have the hon. member for The Battlefords-Meadow Lake 
saying that he will indeed draft a proposal or a letter questioning 
<P>

<B><A NAME="12074"> 12074 </A></B>
<P>
the process and  asking for clarification. At this point, I wonder 
if the hon. members would hold this in abeyance.
<P>
	I am well aware of what the hon. member for The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake said with regard to his privileges. 
Of course I will take that all into consideration. If I feel it is 
necessary, I will get back to the House with a decision at that 
time.
<P>
	Is this on the same point?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I gave the hon. member a minute and he was to 
conclude. I would hope that in a few seconds he would be able to 
wrap this up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Yes, I can, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	I must comment on two points the hon. whip made with regard 
to what has happened in the past. He talked about requests for 
unlimited copies. I think the House is aware there are limitations 
on printing, that we all know those limitations and we all live 
within those limitations. That is not a problem. We are not 
asking for unlimited access to printing.
<P>
	Second, the member said this has not occurred in the past. I 
have constituents who have received printed copies of 
committee minutes from me for the past six years. This has not 
been a problem in the past for me.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I thank the hon. member and I will close the 
debate at this point.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion and the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> According to my notes, 
the hon. member for Algoma has five minutes remaining. The 
hon. member for Algoma.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, just 
before we broke off for question period I briefly made the point 
that even though Canadians in vast numbers approved of the 
recent federal budget, we have in the media almost every day 
attempts by the NDP government in Ontario to use the budget as 
some kind of a lightning rod in a desperate hope to win the 
Ontario election. We also see the Bloc Quebecois attempt to use 
the budget to further their own ill-founded cause. In spite of 
Canadian support we see these attempts.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	The Ontario NDP failed to recognize that a recent poll 
indicated that some 72 per cent of Ontario voters supported the 
federal budget. It is putting out its own numbers which are a 
twisting of the facts. The Ontario NDP claims that the federal 
budget, including the Canadian health and social transfer 
initiative, represents a cut of something like 54 per cent to 
Ontario even though Ontario has 38 per cent of the population.
<P>
	This is simply not the case. Even though Ontario has 38 per 
cent of the population, the actual budget impact on Ontario is 
something like 35 per cent. The Ontario NDP has attempted to 
include the equalization payments.
<P>
	Certainly the NDP in Ontario would not be against the better 
off provinces helping those provinces which are less well off. In 
fact, the transfers to Ontario under the Canada health and social 
transfer represent only 2 per cent of the provincial revenues 
forecast for the year 1996-97. The treasurer for Ontario has 
admitted that.
<P>
	Recently the NDP has put out numerous documents in an 
attempt to use the federal budget to further its election cause in 
Ontario but this strategy will fail. The number of phone calls I 
received after the budget against that budget were very few in 
number, barely a handful. Most people I talk to are very 
supportive of the budget.
<P>
	The central theme of the Bloc's motion suggests that the 
federal government intends to impose new national standards on 
the provinces. In fact the federal government is providing an 
opportunity while at the same time it is taking modest measures 
to rein in federal expenditures.
<P>
	The case of Ontario again is typical for the provinces. The cut 
that the federal government is making to its own programs is 
greater than the cut in transfers to provinces.
<P>
	The Bloc motion suggests that the federal government is 
going to impose new standards on the provinces. Canadians 
want standards. They have already accepted and want to keep 
the standards that have been established for many years in the 
health care area. I repeatedly hear from my constituents that 
they would like national standards in post-secondary education. 
These will not be imposed on the provinces.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Human 
Resources Development have stated that any new standards will 
be created in consultation with the provinces. Recent polls have 
indicated that Canadians want to see a strong set of national 
standards in all areas of health, social services and 
post-secondary education. I support that but this will not be 
imposed on the provinces by the federal government.
<P>
	What we see is an attempt by the NDP in Ontario and the Bloc 
Quebecois, in the absence of their own constructive agenda, to 
attempt to use the federal budget as a means to further their own 
cause. I suggest that this is doomed to fail.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12075"> 12075 </A></B>
<P>
	I had briefly mentioned before question period that the 
Canadian Federation of Students had made a presentation to the 
finance committee this morning. One of the recommendations 
of the federation is that Bill C-76 be amended to compel the 
Minister of Human Resources Development to invite all 
stakeholders affected by the Canadian health and social transfer 
to participate in developing a set of shared principles and 
objectives for it. This is the kind of positive thinking and 
leadership hoped for from all quarters. I commend the Canadian 
Federation of Students for that.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, the agenda of the Bloc is obvious. In Ontario, 
the agenda of the NDP is obvious. We look forward to the demise 
of those agendas in the months ahead.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, my 
colleague says that the government does not intend to create new 
national standards, whereas Bill C-76 refers to new national 
standards that will be implemented only ``where appropriate''. 
Does it mean that a consensus from the provinces will be needed 
to implement these new standards?
<P>
	I find it a little strange that we are talking about new national 
standards when negotiations with the different provinces have 
not even taken place. It seems to me that, when we want to 
establish new standards, we first reach a consensus with the 
provinces and then implement them. We are currently doing the 
opposite. We are putting the cart before the horse.
<P>
	So, I would simply ask him this question: What does he think 
about Bill C-76, which does not provide for a consensus with the 
provinces before implementing the new act? We should 
negotiate first.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. St. Denis:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for the 
question.
<P>
	The member is attempting to suggest that the federal 
government is putting the cart before the horse. What we see in 
this motion is an attempt to detach the cart from the horse.
<P>
	If the hon. member would re-read the budget reference to 
national standards it is quite clear that there is no attempt or plan 
to impose standards. Those standards which exist now in the 
area of health care are fixed. There is no negotiation and no 
debate of those standards.
<P>
	However, when the suggestion is made in the budget 
documents that the provinces, through the Canada health and 
social transfer, will have more flexibility, how can that be 
interpreted in any way except that there will be more flexibility, 
in concert with the provinces' national standards in the area of 
social transfer and possibly in post-secondary education. That 
will be looked at in co-operation with the provinces. There is no 
hint whatsoever of the imposition of standards.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when the government dumps some responsibilities on to the 
provinces without also sending them the money to face these 
responsibilities, there is a huge problem. We know that there are 
800,000 unemployed people and welfare recipients in Quebec. 
In fact, there are 800,000 welfare recipients alone. My riding of 
Matapédia-Matane alone accounts for almost 40 per cent of 
them. That is totally unacceptable. My question is: Unless my 
colleague is able to accomplish some great miracle, how can the 
government offload some responsibilities while, at the same 
time, tightening the belt?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. St. Denis:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the member for the 
question. The fact remains that federal money is being 
transferred to Quebec and to all the other provinces and 
territories.
<P>
	The federal government, by and large, has no regime of 
standards with its transfers with the exception of health care, but 
it is transferring vast sums of money. To me it is not 
unreasonable to negotiate with the provinces standards in areas 
other than health care. I believe that goes with the responsibility 
of transferring funds to the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am confused. I am confused 
by the motion because it talks about national standards as being 
things which are not desirable to Her Majesty's opposition. Yet 
last Thursday, on opposition day, the health critic for the 
opposition party, Mr. Daviault said:
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
``In Quebec we have no trouble with the five criteria. As far as 
we are concerned, they represent a minimum consensus''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The other health critic, Mrs. Picard, said: ``We believe in the 
Canada Health Act principles''. Philippe Paré in the debate said: 
``I think there is not one Canadian or Quebecer who questions 
the importance-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>]

	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> I think, Madam Speaker, that members 
cannot be referred to by name in the House, and I would urge my 
hon. colleague to remember this.

	Another member of the opposition party said: ``I think that 
there is not one Canadian or Quebecer who questions the 
importance and value of the five principles set out in the Canada 
Health Act''.
<P>
	The hon. critic again said that the federal government should 
uphold the five principles. Maybe I am not confused, maybe 
members of the opposition are confused.
<P>
	The five principles of the Canada Health Act embody the 
whole concept of what is most important to Canadians. What 
Canadians constantly use to define themselves as a people is 
Canadian medicare. It is an example of how federal principles 
can act in partnership with provincial governments, which 
administer the program, to make things better. The Canada 
Health Act enhances medicare. It continues to tell us who we are 
as Canadians. It binds us together in terms of our values, in 
terms of equity, in terms of fairness and in terms of compassion.
<P>
	In 1984 when the Canada Health Act was introduced it was 
unanimously agreed on by all parties in the House.
<P>
	It makes sense. The Canada Health Act binds the country 
together while at the same time it gives the regions the freedom 
to be able to administer and decide with flexibility what it is 
they require in their region. I would like to use the Canada 
Health Act as a very good example of how we can have national 
standards, enshrine them in legislation and yet give freedom to 
the provinces to administer that act. It has worked extremely 
well.
<P>
	National principles tell us that we have an objective which we 
are all working toward. At the same time we allow the provinces 
to decide how they will meet those objectives, based on things 
such as their economy, the needs of their people, geographic and 
demographic differences. It gives the provinces freedom but at 
the same time it holds the country together.
<P>
	We should look again at what the Canada Health Act has given 
to us. We are one of the few countries in the world that enjoys a 
high standard of living, the best quality of life. The GATT, when 
it looked at the measurement of outcome, which is infant 
mortality, we rank second or third in the world in terms of those 
measures and those outcomes. Obviously national standards 
legislated with provincial jurisdiction to administer has worked. 
Canadian medicare is an example of how well it works and how 
well it can give us flexibility at a time when global 
competitiveness is what we are talking about, when Canada 
needs to be competitive with the rest of the world.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	It makes sense to me that the federal government would 
transfer money to the provinces to administer other aspects of 
social programs, post-secondary education and social 
assistance, in the same way, looking toward a national objective 
that could be competitiveness.
<P>
	The human resource will be the resource of the 21st century. 
Canada's medicare has enhanced our human resource potential. 
It has given us a competitive edge in terms of the fact that 
healthy people work. The less sick days, the less time off work, 
which makes any business profitable and give us an economic 
and competitive edge.
<P>
	If we negotiated with the provinces for a set of national 
standards for post-secondary education and training, we would 
enhance the ability of the country to be competitive and to have 
trained people able to compete with the rest of the world.
<P>
	This makes sense to me. I started off by saying that I was 
confused. I end by saying that this is not the real question. It is a 
political and hidden agenda by a group that does not really want 
to do anything but destroy the country and fragment what it has 
meant.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I was very happy to hear the comments 
made by the hon. member for Vancouver Centre, except for her 
conclusion that the denunciation by the official opposition of the 
federal government's interference in areas of provincial 
jurisdiction is politically motivated and does not meet any of the 
population's concerns. Her speech also suggests that the Bloc 
Quebecois should willingly agree to let the federal government 
interfere, as I said earlier, in areas of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	I will give her an example and I would like her to give me her 
opinion on this. In Quebec, there is a consensus among all the 
stakeholders, that is, the political parties, the unions and the 
employers-where sovereignists are few and far between-with 
regard to manpower training, which is in fact an extension of the 
educational jurisdiction. There is a general consensus to call for 
the recognition of Quebec's exclusive jurisdiction in this area.
<P>
	The federal government, your government, continues to reject 
this demand, which, I repeat, has nothing to do with the 
constitutional options of political parties but which represents a 
consensus. This is an outright rejection by the federal 
government. The same goes for all other areas of jurisdiction. 
That is why we oppose federal government interference. Again, 
we are saying that the federal government should withdraw, 
transfer to the provinces the tax points corresponding to these 
expenditures and let them administer these programs in the best 
interest of their people. I would like to hear what my colleague 
has to say about this.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Fry:</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member suggested that he 
does not understand why I would say this is a political agenda. It 
flies in the face of common sense. That is why I say there must 
be another agenda.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12077"> 12077 </A></B>
<P>
	Surely we are talking about creating a set of principles. As I 
said earlier, principles give us a national objective. We are 
talking about making Canada a competitive country. Nowhere 
else do I see the ability to pull together as a country, to cross 
interprovincial barriers. Then we could have a common 
principle of training and an agenda saying what we aspire to as a 
country. At the same time we could give more autonomy to the 
provinces so they could develop appropriate programs and 
appropriate ways of dealing with their provincial and regional 
needs.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	I do not understand what the hon. member has a problem with 
unless, as I said before, the problem is purely a political one; 
unless, as I also said before, we want to balkanize the country 
into 10 little provinces, 10 little mini-countries and 2 little 
mini-places in the north that we can call whatever we choose to 
call them.
<P>
	Is that what the hon. member aspires to? What he is saying 
does not make sense to me.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, this 
motion tabled this morning by the Leader of the Official 
Opposition is the kind of motion which would bother the people 
across the way, as it makes a major amendment to the budget 
which, as it stands, literally spells disaster for Quebec.
<P>
	The measures contained in the budget, especially for the next 
three years, does neither Canadians nor Quebecers any good.
<P>
	This budget is nothing but smoke and mirrors, the effects of 
which we will see, of course, in two or three years. The Minister 
of Finance claims this is how Canadian federalism can be 
renewed. I think that he is going about it the wrong way. One 
thing is sure in all this: Quebec must get out of this system on the 
double. This government does not have the courage to announce 
before the referendum the specific measures hiding behind this 
budget. It takes advantage of the situation and better enjoy it 
while it can because I suggest this is the last year that a 
government which does nothing good for Quebec will debate to 
help itself to $29 billion of Quebec taxpayers hard-earned 
money year after year after year.
<P>
	Once again, the official opposition is offering the Liberal 
government an opportunity to correct this unacceptable 
situation, a situation caused by one of their own, namely the 
Minister of Finance, who should really be called minister of 
family trusts or minister of large corporations.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance expects this whole budget charade to 
climax after the referendum. Unfortunately for him, there will 
be no time for his scenario to come to a conclusion because, 
after the referendum, Quebec will be a sovereign state.
<P>
	Between 1977 and 1994, Quebec has seen its federal transfer 
payments for health, education and welfare drop from 47 per 
cent to 37 per cent, as Liberal and Conservative governments 
succeeded one another in this place, passing the puck back and 
forth but essentially pursuing the same policies. This year again, 
the Liberal government is continuing the work of the 
Conservatives by reducing social transfers by up to 28 per cent. 
This translate into a shortfall of nearly $2 billion for the 
Government of Quebec. That is unacceptable and wrong.
<P>
	In 1983-84, federal transfers accounted for 29 per cent of 
Quebec's budget revenues. In 1997-98, they will account for a 
meagre 12 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	Although several initiatives included in the budget provide 
for a withdrawal of federal financial support, the federal 
government will interfere even more in the areas of health, 
post-secondary education and social assistance which, as you 
know, Madam Speaker, come under exclusive provincial 
jurisdiction. This is a shame.
<P>
	Once again, the cuts announced in the recent budget will 
directly hit the poor. As is customary for the Liberals, the budget 
measures will not affect the well-to-do, because this would 
harm the Liberals' good financial relations. However, these 
measures will affect those who barely have enough to survive, 
and I mean survive, not live.
<P>
	Quebec's finance minister, Jean Campeau, estimates that the 
cuts in transfers to the provinces will result in the federal 
contribution to social programs going down from 37.8 per cent 
to 28.5 per cent, over a two year period, that is in 1997 and 1998. 
The federal government just keeps offloading on to the 
provinces.
<P>
	Last week, it was also revealed by the Canadian Council on 
Social Development that 17.6 per cent of Quebec families live 
below the poverty line. That rate is the highest in the country. 
This is a concrete result of a sick federalism which simply does 
not want to evolve. Also last week, we learned that 800,000 
Quebecers have to rely on social assistance. Again, this is a 
consequence of federalism.
<P>
	Premier Parizeau himself referred to that all time record as a 
national catastrophe. Why is that? It is because this government 
did not fulfil its red book commitment to create jobs. During the 
Liberal convention held last weekend, the Prime Minister even 
had the nerve to say that unemployment should be everyone's 
priority. However, with the red book, with so many promises, 
including some by the Minister of Finance, absolutely nothing is 
being done. No concrete measure was announced in the budget 
to put Canadians back to work.
<P>
	Even the labour minister does all sorts of things, except find 
stable and lasting ways to allow Canadians to work without 
losing their dignity in the process. In fact, the minister's first 
action here was to pounce on workers. If the government wants, 
once and for all, to tackle the  issues of duplication and 
unemployment, it should immediately withdraw from all areas 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12078"> 12078 </A></B>
<P>
which come under provincial jurisdiction and give to the 
provinces the federal taxes representing the equivalent amounts. 
This is a simple, easy and efficient way of doing it.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, since my time is up, I will conclude by 
saying that the electoral platform of this government included a 
commitment to put Canadians back to work. After 18 months in 
office, it is now obvious that the government is unable to fulfil 
that promise. Consequently, it should leave that responsibility 
to governments which are competent, which are close to the 
public and which can take action. I am referring of course to the 
provincial governments, including the Quebec government.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
I ask all the members of this House to denounce the will of the 
federal government to restrict the provinces to the role of mere 
advisers by imposing on them new national standards for social 
programs.
<P>
	Our constituents sent us here to protect their interests. Let us 
not disappoint them. Let us act, in all conscience, to ensure their 
well-being. Let us say no to this offloading of $7 billion on to 
the provinces.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the official opposition motion before us, with all 
respect, distorts the intent of the federal government's position 
as it relates to the Canada health and social transfer program.
<P>
	It has been known from the beginning from the proclamations 
of the Minister of Finance and the Minister for Human 
Resources Development that this new program, the details of 
which will be negotiated with the provinces, is aimed at giving 
provinces more flexibility to deliver on areas of exclusive 
jurisdiction, in the areas of health, post-secondary education 
and social assistance.
<P>
	The government has said it does not mean a free for all. What 
the Bloc fails to recognize is that three out of every four 
Canadians, according to a poll last year, said they like national 
social programs.
<P>
	When we speak of national social programs they have to be 
national in scope. If they are national in scope, it follows the 
national government has to have a say.
<P>
	The new program is also aimed at ensuring all provincial 
governments acknowledge and affirm the importance of treating 
all Canadians equitably, of ensuring citizens from coast to coast 
have equal opportunity of access to the same standard of living, 
to the same opportunities in education for youth, to the same 
levels of support for the poor, to the same quality of care in 
health for the sick.
<P>
	The new federal transfer program clearly recognizes the 
exclusive jurisdiction of provinces. What the Bloc has failed to 
recognize and refuses altogether to acknowledge is the unity and 
equality of all Canada's citizens.
<P>
	The new program is not about imposing new standards and is 
not an arbitrary one. It is about affirming our national 
commitment to the five principles of medicare to which all 
Canadians subscribe. We know that. It is about reaffirming our 
national commitment to give our youth the best type of 
education and training. It is about reaffirming our national 
commitment to assisting the poor who have become under 
privileged beyond their control wherever they come from.
<P>
	Do the member and his party want one class of poor in one 
province and another class of poor in other provinces? Do the 
member and his party want one class of education for the rich 
and one for the poor? Do the member and his party want 
medicare to be destroyed? Perhaps the ultimate question is do 
the member and his party not want one Canada for all?
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I would like to remind 
members of the official opposition that the period provided for 
questions or comments is five minutes.
<P>
	I recognize the hon. member for Chicoutimi, if he wants to 
respond. He still has two minutes left.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Madam Speaker, of course the official 
opposition does not need the advice of anybody in this House. In 
his comment, the member said that he did not want to create 
categories of people who are more educated or less educated 
than others. Only the provinces can give these kinds of 
assurances to their people and guarantee them that there will not 
be different categories within the system. Everybody should 
clean up their own backyard.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	The Quebec Liberal Party wants a decentralized federalism, it 
wants the federal government to give the provinces, particularly 
Quebec, all the tools they need to govern themselves, whereas, 
in this House, members of the Liberal government are trying to 
stop progress in its tracks. I wonder who in this House wants to 
create different categories. The answer is simple: it is the 
members opposite with a federalism that they are not even 
willing to renew.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
rise in this House to strongly support the motion put forward by 
the leader of the official opposition, on behalf of my 
constituents and all those who will be affected by this bill, 
because these 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12079"> 12079 </A></B>
<P>
are the people who will fall victim to the questionable schemes 
of the current government.
<P>
	In his motion, our leader denounces the will of the federal 
government to restrict the provinces to the role of mere 
consultants by imposing on them new national standards for all 
social programs. He also denounces the interference of the 
federal government in the health, post-secondary education and 
social assistance areas.
<P>
	Federal interference in these areas is not just another 
Constitutional issue, because it will have very real 
consequences on the daily lives of our constituents. Let us 
examine how this will come about.
<P>
	Bill C-76 is the statutory instrument the government intends 
to use to implement its budget. So, it is a very important piece of 
legislation even though it looks daunting at first glance. When 
you analyze it, you realize that it can have a tremendous impact 
on programs. This year, however, the government had quite a 
surprise in store for us. It slipped into Bill C-76 some words 
which will have significant consequences on Quebec and on the 
rest of the provinces.
<P>
	For example, the part concerning the Canada health and social 
transfer deals not only with health and social assistance, but also 
with health, post-secondary education, social assistance and 
social services. This is important. The federal government is 
interfering in areas which, as you all know, come mostly under 
provincial jurisdiction, as defined in the Constitution Act, 1867. 
The federal government must have a reason to act this way.
<P>
	When you read the other provisions found in this bill, you 
realize that this type of interference is pernicious. It allows the 
current government to control provincial activities and 
programs. If a province implements a policy or a program the 
federal government does not agree with, parts, or all, of its 
subsidies will be cut. This is a disgrace, because, as I said 
before, all the areas affected by this bill come under provincial 
and not federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	Under this bill, the government will also have the right to 
determine what represents a good program. That is right, to 
make things a little worse, the federal government will be able to 
decide, all by itself, what is a good program that deserves to be 
financially supported and what is a bad program that deserves to 
be condemned.
<P>
	I remind the House that we are talking about a whole set of 
programs-education, social assistance, social services and 
health-which directly concern the public. We might as well 
abolish provincial governments and let the federal run 
everything.
<P>
	Let me remind the House and my constituents that the 
subsidies about to be cut come from tax revenues and that these 
revenues come from the taxpayers who live in the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	Let us look at the strong possibility that the federal 
government will not like the programs that the Quebec 
government puts in place. In the current scenario, the outcome is 
very simple. The federal government will inform Quebec, and if 
the province does not get in line, deciding, on the contrary, to 
keep its programs, Ottawa will cut its funding. This money will 
have come from the pockets of Quebecers, but would be used to 
fund other provinces' programs because the patriarchal federal 
government will have decided to punish the prodigal son, 
Quebec.
<P>
	Quebecers want nothing to do with a wholesale delegation of 
powers to Ottawa. At the very least, the federal government 
should respect the distinct character of the Quebecois people. 
On this issue, 50,000 witnesses who appeared before the 
commissions on the future of Quebec requested more autonomy 
for Quebec. In concrete terms, this federal invasion is already 
damaging for Quebecers; if Bill C-76 is passed, the situation 
will be even worse.
<P>
	In my riding, 25 per cent of all families are headed by single 
parents. And 79 per cent of the population in my riding lives in 
rental housing, and three quarters of these rental units were built 
before 1960. Of these households, 38 per cent sink over 30 per 
cent of their income into housing costs. In my riding, 29 per cent 
of the families are considered to have low incomes. In the 
downtown core, one person in three lives below the poverty line. 
The life expectancy of people living at the foot of the Côte 
d'Abraham is 10 years shorter.
<P>
	That is reality according to taxpayers, some taxpayers in my 
riding. These people need assistance programs: employment, 
housing and daycare assistance, income supplements. The 
taxpayers in my riding will be taken hostage, despite 
themselves, by a government which has set its sights on job 
training and employment assistance programs which only 
confuse and discourage the unemployed and cost taxpayers a 
fortune.
<P>
	Just think of all of the educational programs which interfere 
with the ministère de l'éducation's mandate. They are legion 
and, above all, cost the taxpayers of Quebec a lot of money.
<P>
	Where did this obsession with controlling everything come 
from? Does Ottawa believe that Quebec is unable to take care of 
its own affairs and its population? If so, it should be said loud 
and clear: it will get a response from the population.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to say to the members of this 
government: ``Hands off, you ultra-centralists. Let the 
provincial governments, which know their populations and their 
needs better than you, handle their own affairs. Until the whole 
issue is settled once and for all, you had better listen to 
Quebec''.

While I do not question the sincerity with which she spoke, I do 
question her understanding of some of the essential elements 
associated with block transfers to the provinces.
<P>
	I am quite surprised she would be against this measure taken 
by the government because it essentially addresses some of the 
concerns she cited in her speech.
<P>
	I will be extremely specific on this issue because sometimes 
facts, figures and proper statistics are missing in debates in the 
House of Commons, particularly when they originate from the 
opposition.
<P>
	As a result of the new transfer we are able to support programs 
like APPORT. Because of the restrictive nature of the Canada 
assistance plan, prior to this transfer we were not able to do that.
<P>
	SUPRET, a work income supplement that preceded APPORT, 
was rejected under CAP. Now because of the new arrangement 
with the provinces that could be supported. The Quebec sales tax 
refund and various social services provided in schools were 
submitted for CAP cost sharing during the 1970s. These were 
rejected because they did not meet the CAP definition of welfare 
services. These are just some of the examples.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member must understand that by having the Canada 
social and health transfer we are responding to the call by 
provincial governments to build in the type of flexibility that

should reflect on.
<P>
	Has the hon. member taken the time to clearly look at all the

the Canada social and health transfer? Will she reconsider her 
position and applaud the government for this excellent 
initiative?

	<B>Mrs. Gagnon (Québec):</B> Madam Speaker, I see the hon.

<P>
	When I look at the provisions in this bill, they propose a 
certain amount of flexibility but then go on to say that the 
federal government may do such and such for the purposes of 
``maintaining national standards, where appropriate-''. What 
happens if the programs proposed by the Government of Quebec 
do not suit you? The bill goes on to say: ``-maintaining 
national standards, where appropriate, in the operation of social 
programs''. This means that if these programs do not suit the 
present government, it will create a national standard.
<P>
	What will happen to the Canada social transfer for education, 
if we consider that Quebec accounts for 25 per cent when 
deciding whether it is appropriate or not and the remaining 75 
per cent will be able to vote on national standards? What will 
happen in the education sector, when we realize that this area 
comes under the jurisdiction of the Government of Quebec and 
we have a francophone majority in Quebec, while you constitute 
an anglophone majority in Canada? National standards might 
not be appropriate to the education system in Quebec.
<P>
	I realize that the parliamentary secretary is exercising his own 
judgment in this debate, but I do not think he has the requisite 
sensitivity to decide which programs could be implemented in 
Quebec.

	<B>Mrs. Gagnon (Québec):</B> Madam Speaker, we are really at 
cross purposes, because the other side seems to confer an 
entirely different meaning on certain words. When you say: 
``We want to be flexible'', well, flexibility means transferring 
the money and telling the provincial governments: ``Do with

	The Bloc Quebecois is simply repeating a position that is 
contrary to fact, contrary to the budget and contrary to reality. 
Accordingly the government will vote against the Bloc's 
motion. The budget underscored our desire to give Canadians 
good government in Ottawa. The budget marked the start of a 
new era and of a new way of managing the federation that is 
simpler, more efficient and more mindful of the provincial 
governments' jurisdiction.
<P>
	The budget gives the provincial governments all the 
manoeuvring room they require to meet the needs of their 
people. We took steps to reform the provincial transfers, and our 
action plan will lead to a system that operates better and is 
financially sustainable. We maintained our commitment to 
equalization payments-one of the pillars of Canadian 
federalism.
<P>
	However, in 1996-97, the other major programs-the 
established program financing for health and post-secondary 
education and the Canada assistance plan-will be consolidated 
into a single block transfer: the Canada health and social 
transfer. It is the block transfer long sought by the provinces, 
which will enable them to be innovative to suit their priorities. 
We instituted this block transfer long demanded by the 
provinces and the members of the Bloc. Why do they oppose it 
now?
<P>
	The new Canada social transfer combines three separate 
transfers into a single transfer, thus reducing administrative 
problems for the provinces. It ensures maximum flexibility in 
the design of provincial programs that suit their needs. At the 
same time, we increased system flexibility by reducing the 
conditions governing these programs to a minimum. As the 
Minister of Finance indicated in his speech this morning, he will 
be proposing amendments to Bill C-76 to the parliamentary 
committee.
<P>
	Accordingly, clause 13(1)<I>(b)</I> will read as follows: ``<I>(b)</I> In 
order to apply the conditions and criteria provided in the Canada 
Health Act with respect to public administration, 
comprehensiveness, universality, portability and accessibility 
and the provisions on extra billing and user charges''.
<P>
	In matters of health, it is very clear that the principles of the 
Canada Health Act valued by Canadians from coast to coast will 
have to be honoured. We often refer to these five principles, but 
what exactly are we talking about? Public administration means 
that the program must be not-for-profit and managed by a 
public authority; comprehensiveness means that the program 
must cover all essential health care services provided by 
hospitals and physicians; universality means that services must 
be available to the whole population; portability means that the 
program must cover all health care services provided to 
residents temporarily outside of the province, territory or 
country; accessibility means that services must be offered on an 
equal basis to all residents,  under the same conditions, without 
a fee or any other constraint that might unduly limit access.

	Within these principles provinces have the flexibility to tailor 
services to their population, allowing innovations such as 
community health centres, les CLSC, in Quebec. With 
flexibility, innovation and commitment costs can be kept at 
reasonable levels while ensuring our health care system 
continues to provide the level of care of which we can be proud.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The bill will be further amended to read as follows under 
section 13(1)(c) and 13(1)(d):
<P>
	``(c) To enforce the national standard outlined in section 19 
providing that no minimum residency requirements can be 
demanded or allowed with regards to social assistance; and
<P>
	``(d) To promote common principles and objectives 
developed in accordance with subsection 3, concerning social 
programs other than the program mentioned in paragraph (b)''.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	In the area of social assistance, the only thing the federal 
government demands of the provinces has to do with residency. 
For example, a Quebecer cannot be refused social assistance in 
Ontario, or in any other province, because he does not meet the 
minimum residency requirement. Certain opposition members 
may be dreaming of depriving Quebecers of this freedom of 
movement.
<P>
	The new Canada health and social transfer gives the provinces 
more freedom to pursue innovation and improve social 
programs so that they better meet the needs of their people. 
Because of cost-sharing and its restrictive requirements, the 
present Canada assistance plan prevented such innovation.
<P>
	The Quebec government is a leader in the area of innovative 
social programs such as APPORT-Parental Wage Assistance. 
However, APPORT and many other innovative programs could 
not be funded under CAP because of the cost-sharing conditions 
it sets.
<P>
	For example, APPORT was deemed ineligible for CAP 
funding because it was not means tested. Many other Quebec 
programs, which were not eligible to cost-sharing under CAP, 
could now be funded by the Canada transfer.
<P>
	Let us mention, for example, the work income supplement, 
the Quebec sales tax rebate and the social services provided in 
schools, including probation services for young offenders. The 
Canada social transfer will now allow the provinces to test 
innovative ways to provide social services and assistance.
<P>
	Post-secondary education, which the opposition talked about, 
is an area of exclusive provincial jurisdiction. You may, 
however, be surprised to learn that the federal government 
contributes 50 per cent of funding for this  sector so that 
Canadians across the country can receive a good education. 
There are essentially 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12082"> 12082 </A></B>
<P>
no conditions attached to post-secondary education, especially 
in Quebec, which in the past 30 years has been free to do what it 
wants in this sector with the money from the Canadian 
government.
<P>
	All these proposals are aimed at enhancing our social 
programs. They will be discussed with the provinces and must 
be approved by mutual agreement before being implemented.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance will therefore amend clause 13(3) to 
read as follows: ``The Minister of Human Resources 
Development calls on all provincial officials to consult with one 
another and work together to come up with a set of common 
principles and objectives regarding the other social programs 
referred to in paragraph (1)(<I>d</I>), which could apply to the 
transfer''.
<P>
	We hope that the provinces and the members of the Bloc 
Quebecois will recognize and share the Liberals' concerns with 
regard to leadership and compassion and their desire to increase 
equity and efficiency. This new, more flexible formula allows 
for much more efficient provision of services to Canadians, 
without compromising quality.
<P>
	That is why the introduction of this transfer in 1996-97 will 
be accompanied by a $2.5 billion cut in the total amount. This 
represents a reduction of only 1.5 per cent in Quebec's budget. 
In comparison, federal spending will be cut by 7.3 per cent in 
other sectors and 18.9 per cent in the sectors included in the 
program review.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	So it is obvious that we treat social transfers to the provinces 
more favourably than our own expenditures.
<P>
	In closing, allow me to state that the budget clearly points to a 
reduction in the conditions attached to social programs. If 
principles are established, it will be by mutual agreement. I 
deeply regret the fact that the opposition is giving people in 
Quebec such misleading information on important issues.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, for 
the past 18 months, the federal government has been trying to 
explain to the House what a flexible federal government is. It 
has also been trying to explain what the status quo is. I think that 
status quo means continuing with the same thing. Also, in trying 
to explain what a flexible government or what the status quo is, 
the federal government is doing exactly what it preaches in the 
cuts.
<P>
	During the sessions of the regional commissions, federal and 
provincial Liberal members did not even have the courage to 
come to Quebec to explain what the status quo and a flexible 
government were. Had they done so, they would have told us 
that they were getting ready to make cuts in health, education 
and professional training programs.
<P>
	Instead of making cuts in each province, the federal 
government decided to become a centralizing government and 
to cut provincial transfers. Because of these transfer cuts, the 
provinces are obliged to cut and transfer some responsibilities to 
municipal governments and also to bear the brunt of these cuts.
<P>
	I would like to remind the minister who just spoke that the 
Quebec government pays $28 billion in taxes to Ottawa and 
sends $2 billion in GST, for a total of $30 billion. Including cuts, 
privatizations and closures, can the minister tell us how much 
money Quebec receives on the $30 billion that it sends to the 
federal government?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Massé:</B> Madam Speaker, first I would like to make a few 
comments about the regional commissions. They have now 
finished their work and what they have done clearly proves that 
we had good reason to refuse to take part in those commissions. 
They were, as we say in Quebec, packed with people who had 
already made up their mind about sovereignty and unfortunately 
those commissions only reflected a foregone conclusion. They 
were absolutely not representative of public opinion in the 
province and, as all the polls showed, they reached conclusions 
that were contradicted by the opinion of a majority of the 
population.
<P>
	Therefore, regional commissions have clearly been a waste of 
money for Quebecers and that 100 per cent of Quebecers, 
including yours truly, have paid for commissions which 
reflected only forty per cent of the public opinion. This is a 
waste of money and the wrong way to use provincial taxpayers' 
money. While poverty continues to increase in Quebec, the Parti 
Quebecois government, supported by its brother the Bloc 
Quebecois, continues to waste taxpayers' money.
<P>
	With regard to the second issue, transfers to provinces, I think 
it was clearly demonstrated in the last budget that total federal 
expenses will be reduced from $120 billion in 1994-95 to $114 
billion in 1995-96 and $107 billion in 1996-97. The federal 
government is reducing its spending twice as much as it is 
reducing transfers to provinces.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	The government obviously had to be downsized and the same 
thing should happen in Quebec. We have faced up to our 
responsibilities and 69 per cent of the population approved our 
budget. I would also like the government of Quebec to face up to 
its responsibilities and start answering the real needs of 
Quebecers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin Cauchon (Outremont, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
first of all, I want to thank the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs for sharing his time with me.
<P>
	Today, I realize something that, in fact, I had already realized 
a long time ago, that there is a policy guideline to be followed. 
At the beginning of this Parliament, I thought that perhaps the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12083"> 12083 </A></B>
<P>
official opposition would be constructive in its attitude. 
Unfortunately, as many other speakers said before, members of 
the official opposition are unable to go beyond pure political 
partisanship. The  motion tabled today by the Leader of the 
Opposition is an obvious and eloquent demonstration of this 
fact.
<P>
	Today, they are trying to speak against the Canada social 
transfer. I must say I am astounded. I am certainly not the least 
of Quebec nationalists. I worked tirelessly for decentralization, 
for more flexibility in the management of programs by 
provinces. I am proud to state in this House that the Canada 
social transfer is a remarkable example of decentralization.
<P>
	This social transfer, basically grouping together the Canada 
assistance plan, post-secondary education and health, is very 
easy to manage. It eliminates a lot of jointly managed areas. It is 
a fiscally responsible system and also a system allowing 
provinces to gain more independence in the administration and 
management of their own social programs, since it gives them 
the means to meet the needs of their citizens.
<P>
	Members speak of national standards, claiming that any 
national standard would penalize a province, whether it is 
Quebec, Ontario or any other.
<P>
	I represented the Minister of Human Resources Development 
when we dealt with the reform. I want to tell the House that, of 
all those who spoke to me, no one was against the idea of a 
national standard. The reason is simple-people want national 
standards if they are established in a concerted way, in 
co-operation. That is what the Canada social transfer is letting 
us do. We establish standards together, as a team. When one 
believes in Canada and in a place for Quebec inside this 
federation, it is possible to reach a consensus as to guidelines 
uniting the provinces from coast to coast.
<P>
	They are trying to have people believe that a national standard 
is a terrible monster that would be in everybody's way. In other 
countries and other regions, people are speaking of 
globalization, union, unification, whereas here we would like to 
confine ourselves to a certain area and to refrain from adopting 
standards that would allow for some liberalization, some 
interprovincial exchanges. We did so in matters of trade, last 
year.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	That is what we are doing at the social level. We are just being 
open-minded, we are just showing some form of 
progressiveness, showing that we believe deeply in Canada and 
Quebec.
<P>
	You know, this debate is about the Canada social transfer but 
we could also talk at length about the human resources 
investment fund created by the same budget. This fund, which 
meets the expectations of the provinces in every respect, will 
ensure that the management of training programs is 
decentralized to the local community level and that 
community-based organizations are empowered to administer 
training funds according to the needs of the community or the 
locality.
<P>
	That is what federalism means to our government. That is the 
way of the future in terms of federalism. That is progressive 
federalism. Still, to achieve this form of federalism, you have to 
be a good player and want to be on the team.
<P>
	I could go on about what our government has done to improve 
and decentralize the federal system. The problem is that, talk as 
we may about a federal system that works, we come up against a 
government in Quebec and, in this place, an official opposition 
which do not want to listen. They do not want to listen because 
they know that our government is a very open one. They know 
that, if they participate in our renewal process through 
administrative agreements, program changes, approaches like 
rethinking the role of the state, it is going to work and, if it 
works, ultimately, this will mean the end of their old dream of 
separation.
<P>
	For my part, I will tell them this: Rise above strictly partisan 
interests and strive to look after the interests of Quebec and fight 
for the people of Quebec. Strive to renew the Canadian federal 
process. This is what we are doing.
<P>
	Earlier, my colleague referred to the national commissions. It 
is pretty easy to figure out what Quebecers want. They want us 
to look after their interests by restructuring the economy, by 
creating jobs and, particularly, by putting an end to these 
constitutional debates. They want to see the economy improve 
and they want us to move forward.
<P>
	It is shocking to see that the report tabled, which cost millions 
of dollars to produce, does not insist on what people said. On the 
contrary, it concentrates on the ultimate objective, which is 
Quebec's separation.
<P>
	In conclusion, what we want is to go on. We want to help 
workers, not only in Quebec, but all across Canada. We want to 
continue to improve the economy. We are getting there: last 
year, we created 433,000 new jobs. We want to ensure 
tomorrow's prosperity by providing our workers with tools.
<P>
	The human resources investment fund is one measure which 
will ensure that our workers have the necessary tools, that they 
get adequate training and that they are able to face tomorrow's 
challenges, including foreign competition on international 
markets. Proud Quebecers and proud Canadians think big, and 
this is why we made that commitment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, since my hon. colleague is talking about workers, on 
behalf of 250 women of my riding, I will read a few sentences 
for his information: ``We live in a rural area where the situation 
keeps getting worse, especially for the last year and a half. Our 
villages are having problems: young people leaving, a deficient 
and deficit ridden economic structure, a saturated job market, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12084"> 12084 </A></B>
<P>
high unemployment, reduced public services and an aging 
population''. Forty-one per cent of the families in  the area are 
poor or very poor, whereas the poverty rate is 28 per cent for 
Quebec as a whole.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	What this government lacks is a vision for society. There is 
absolutely nothing. There was the infrastructure program to 
create jobs, but we do not hear about it any more. It is coming to 
an end. This morning, a deputy minister came to present a 
forestry plan: budget cuts of 57 per cent over a three period for 
the Canadian Forestry Service; downsizing of 410 positions, one 
third of the workforce; closure of 11 regional offices. And then 
they pass on the bill: because there is no work, they cut 
unemployment benefits and the provinces are left to do the dirty 
work.
<P>
	Those women and those men are deeply disappointed. They 
are disgusted. At this point, they say that we lie tothem. We are 
told: ``You sovereignists are blocking things''. Quite the 
contrary, we are part of the federation. Here is my question: Is 
there any way in this country to create jobs instead of forcing 
people onto social welfare, onto unemployment insurance, 
especially in rural areas where things are surely more difficult?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin Cauchon (Outremont, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for his question. First of all, he 
mentioned in his question that this government does not have 
any social vision. I will not tell you that the current government 
has a clear policy and an objective that we set and maintain, 
contrary to the official opposition, but I attended the official 
opposition's convention. One had to witness what happened in 
their workshop on separation to realize to what extent members 
of the official opposition are still looking, after 25 years, for 
some kind of social vision. Therefore we have no lesson to take 
from the official opposition in this matter, quite the opposite.
<P>
	As to the regions, we take to heart the regional problem in 
Quebec and Canada. That is why our efforts have been focused 
on economic and job creation policies. The Minister of Industry 
and Trade presented a strategic plan to ease the conversion of 
our economy. Let us make no mistake about it. Canada's 
economy is restructuring just like that of the rest of the world. 
Tomorrow's markets will be quite different, and the emphasis 
will be on technology. This restructuring of the economy is now 
under way, and we sincerely hope it will be in the best interests 
of all Canadians, including Canadians who live in the outlying 
regions.
<P>
	At the same time, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development is busy planning programs to help workers prepare 
for the challenge of high technology. We are designing programs 
that will be tailored to the needs of outlying regions, because 
Canadians have asked us to do so.
<P>
	I would add, in conclusion, that we will also review the 
unemployment insurance program in order to meet the dire 
needs of Canadian workers. But there is a problem: I would ask 
the official opposition to move ahead, to stop talking of things 
that citizens are not interested in and start working with us to 
help and better serve the population.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I would be 
delighted to respond to the invitation extended by the hon. 
member for Outremont, but I prefer to keep my comments 
relevant to this debate, because today we are discussing a 
motion tabled by the official opposition. I think it would be very 
useful to recall what the motion says.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House denounce the will of the federal government to restrict the 
provinces to the role of mere consultant by imposing on them new national 
standards for all social programs through the introduction of the Canada 
Social Transfer, which will enable the federal government to interfere even 
more in such areas as health, post-secondary education and social assistance, 
all of which come under exclusive provincial jurisdiction.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We are talking about national standards in areas under 
provincial jurisdiction. The Minister of Finance keeps repeating 
that he wants this program to be more flexible, to provide 
greater flexibility than before, but the fact remains that the same 
national standards prevail.
<P>
	To illustrate my point, I will quote from Bill C-76 which 
implements certain provisions in the budget. In section 13, Part 
V, we read the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-a Canada Health and Social Transfer may be provided to a province for a 
fiscal year for the purposes of- <I>(b)</I> maintaining the national criteria and 
conditions in the Canada Health Act, including those respecting public 
administration, comprehensiveness, universality, portability, accessibility, 
extra-billing and user charges; and <I>(c)</I> maintaining national standards, where 
appropriate, in the operation of other social programs.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would also like to recall what was said by the Minister of 
Finance in his budget speech, when he explained that by 
combining all three programs into a single consolidated block 
transfer referred to as the Canada social transfer, beginning in 
1996-97, the provinces, and I quote: ``-will now be able to 
design more innovative social programs, programs that respond 
to the needs of people today rather than to inflexible rules. 
However''-and this is particularly important-``flexibility 
does not mean a free-for-all. There are national goals and 
principles we believe must still apply, and which the vast 
majority of Canadian support''.
<P>
	I was on the Standing Committee on Human Resources 
Development which travelled across Canada last fall and was 
one of the members who visited every province. I listened to the 
testimony of all the groups that appeared before the committee, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12085"> 12085 </A></B>
<P>
a total of 1,200. It is not true that everyone across Canada wants 
national standards for education and social programs.
<P>
	In Quebec, there was a general consensus against this 
principle. For instance, for the second time this year, I think it 
was on February 2, a unanimous resolution was passed by the 
National Assembly. Not just the Parti Quebecois but the Liberal 
Party as well supported it. The resolution was moved by the 
leader of l'Action démocratique, who asked the federal 
government to withdraw from manpower training. This has been 
said time and time again, and the government is still trying to 
give the impression that it intends to be more flexible.
<P>
	I may recall that Bill C-76 does not contain all the measures 
that are to be implemented. Other legislation was passed 
previously. Bill C-28, for instance, which was about financial 
assistance for students and was passed on June 23, 1994. What 
did this bill provide? It was supposed to provide for two things, 
basically. First of all, for appointing the appropriate authority 
that may designate institutions of learning that may receive 
financial assistance from the government. What did it do? 
Instead of leaving this authority with the provinces, with the 
Lieutenant Governor in Council as before, it decided that the 
Minister of Human Resources Development would determine 
the appropriate authority. First point.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	Second point. There were new conditions regarding the right 
to withdraw with full financial compensation. In the past it was 
automatic. However, the bill which precedes this one, but which 
remains in effect with the government's national standard, 
provided that Quebec, or any other province wishing to take 
advantage of this right to withdraw, had to propose a program 
exactly the same as the federal program on all counts, or receive 
no funding. Earlier, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
cited a series of cases in which the Canada assistance plan did 
not fund programs, among others, the current PWA program in 
Quebec.
<P>
	He listed seven or eight others and talked of the current 
situation, saying it would likely change with the amendments 
not yet officially tabled and whose legal scope was still 
unknown. What we are saying is that the federal government 
said very clearly in its budget, and in this bill, as well, that it 
wants to pay less and that it wants to transfer part of its deficit to 
the provinces, but that it wants to continue to impose conditions. 
This is rare. It would be normal to expect that certain conditions 
would be dropped. This, however, seems out of the question.
<P>
	At first glance, when we reduce the expenses in the Canada 
social transfer and combine the three programs, if we take things 
literally and dropped at least 11 clauses from the bill, which 
contains other provisions, national standards, what would this 
mean for the reduction provided for in the budget? It means 
letting three sectors fight for the same money. This is not really 
acceptable. At least set guidelines and let provinces do their own 
thing.
<P>
	Earlier, I felt like putting this to the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, who seemed almost to be talking 
about heaven. In talking about the current situation and federal 
flexibility, he almost seemed to be talking about heaven. 
Everything was fine. What is the real situation, however? For a 
year now, no Minister of Education in Quebec or in the other 
provinces has wanted to support the federal program of the 
Minister of Human Resources Development. No Minister of 
Health has participated in the forum on health. No provincial 
minister responsible for social assistance has wanted to take 
part, because they find the federal program unacceptable.
<P>
	Is this flexible federalism? Is this the flexible federalism that 
is so fine, so positive, that none of the provincial authorities 
want to even take part in it? No, this is simply window dressing. 
As long as we have these national standards and we do not see 
the amendments that the Minister of Finance alluded to this 
morning, as long as the federal government does not withdraw 
entirely from areas of strictly provincial jurisdiction in health, 
education and social assistance and does not give the provinces 
the tax points that would allow them to manage their own 
programs, we will not be able to talk about flexible federalism.
<P>
	Having another minute to go, I will talk about another 
situation. We talk about flexible federalism, but in actual fact 
there were enormous cuts which mean that 5,000 to 6,000 
households more per month are currently requesting social 
assistance. Why? Because last year, in Quebec, on April 17 
precisely, $2.5 billion were cut from unemployment insurance. 
The period of entitlement to benefits was reduced and that has 
meant 40 per cent more welfare cases in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	Is that going to give Canadians and Quebecers greater 
confidence in the flexibility of the federal government? No. I 
repeat, what the federal government wants is to pay less and to 
require more through its national standards.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, thank 
you for allowing me to speak. As the hon. member for Lévis 
pointed out earlier, the federal government has cut transfers to 
the provinces while claiming this would give the provinces more 
flexibility to manage their own affairs.
<P>
	I myself have never seen a government cut funding to the 
provinces while claiming that such a reduction would give them 
more flexibility to manage the departments in question. As the 
hon. member for Lévis explained, the federal government 
gradually increased its interference by setting national 
standards, which it has finally realized are excessively costly to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12086"> 12086 </A></B>
<P>
implement. As has been demonstrated, the federal government's 
accumulated debt now amounts to $600 billion.
<P>
	Now that the federal government has realized that the 
standards it has put in place in the last 20 years cost too much, it 
says it will now transfer responsibility to the provinces by 
reducing funding. Let me give you an example. When the 
Quebec government decided to establish its own health care 
system, the federal government was not very happy about it 
given its strong desire to impose national standards. The federal 
government tried to use that opportunity to impose national 
standards. Quebec and another province were then adamantly 
opposed to federal interference in health care. However, the 
federal government insisted and the provinces backed down, 
provided that it return 50 per cent of health care expenditures.
<P>
	The federal government is now contributing around 30 per 
cent, while the provinces must make up the remaining 70 per 
cent. The federal government is still aying that federal standards 
must be maintained. This puts the provinces, especially Quebec, 
in a tight spot as far as health care spending is concerned. They 
cannot manage health care as they see fit, because they must 
comply with national standards while the federal government 
slashes health care funding in Quebec.
<P>
	That is all I wanted to tell my fellow citizens in Longueuil and 
throughout Quebec. I wanted to inform them that the federal 
government is preventing us from managing health care 
properly. I ask the hon. member for Lévis whether he agrees 
with everything I just said.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Madam Speaker, I think that the last part of his 
comment reflects the extensive parliamentary experience of the 
hon. member for Longueuil. And I will draw from this 
experience to raise the following because, after all, the 
numerous attempts of the Conservative government should be 
mentioned. The member for Longueuil, now in his third term, is 
aware of all the Conservatives' efforts in this respect, including 
at the time of the Meech Lake accord. The previous 
Conservative government may be criticized for many things, but 
certainly not for not having tried to reach an agreement. The 
same thing in Charlottetown.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	Quebecers are aware of the fact that, over the past 30 years, 
numerous attempts were made to reform the federal system. It 
never worked, to the point that, weary of federal inaction, a 
number of members of Parliament-and the hon. member for 
Longueuil is one of them-resigned and, with the current Leader 
of the Opposition, they formed a new federal party, a party 
focusing on the only way to change anything to anything in the 
coming months or year: the Quebec referendum.
<P>
	In this referendum debate, faced with all these failed 
attempts, empty promises and window dressing about possible 
administrative arrangements that never materialize-or when 
they do materialize, it is because the federal government acted 
arbitrarily and unilaterally as usual-the people of Quebec will 
realize that they have no choice but to vote ``yes'' in the 
upcoming referendum on Quebec sovereignty.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is important to discuss Bill C-76, because 
this legislation is very instructive. Indeed, it will enable those 
Quebecers who might still be undecided to understand the 
message conveyed by the current federal government.
<P>
	Several attempts were made to reform federalism. Recently, 
some members of the Quebec Liberal Party still entertained such 
hopes in a document referring to a quiet adjustment. The 
document said that the Canadian federation must be extensively 
decentralized, that it must fully respect provincial jurisdiction, 
and that federal interference must end, particularly in Quebec.
<P>
	We now have the federal government's answer to these 
Quebec federalists who, in spite of multiple but vain attempts, 
may have thought, in good faith, that they could reform the 
federal system. The federal government's answer, Bill C-76, 
seeks to allow systematic federal interference in many areas 
which come under provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	We had national standards in the health sector. Now, we will 
have similar standards for post-secondary education. Quebecers 
fully understand the implications of such a measure. A student 
loan and scholarship program was developed over a period of 25 
or 30 years in Quebec. Although not perfect, that program 
helped several generations of students, while reflecting the 
vision of fairness which prevails in Quebec regarding the need 
to invest in education.
<P>
	Meanwhile, the federal government wants to impose national 
standards in that sector. Last summer, social program reform 
gave us an idea of what this means. It means that provincial 
governments will have to quickly adjust to a national program 
which will significantly increase the indebtedness of students. 
In fact, the only way to avoid that will be to increase the tax 
burden of Quebecers if the province refuses to endorse the 
federal government's vision.
<P>
	If I were a young Quebecer today, I would see Bill C-76 as a 
clear indication of things to come under the federal system. The 
federal government's vision is ``one Canada, one nation'', along 
with national standards and ways of doing things which will 
standardize the way Quebecers will be treated, students in this 
particular case.
<P>
	Assuming they listened to the Minister of Finance this 
morning, when he referred to some vague proposals, how can 
Quebecers and Canadians from other provinces believe for one 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12087"> 12087 </A></B>
<P>
moment that this reform is being proposed in a spirit of 
co-operation with the provinces?
<P>
	Let me give you concrete examples. I am not going back 10, 
15 or 20 years. Take the national forum on health. The federal 
government decided, without first ascertaining the provinces' 
participation, to adopt a rather disjointed approach regarding 
the major issue of medicare. Even this afternoon, the Standing 
Committee on Finance heard officials representing the National 
Federation of Nurses' Unions, who said that the forum does not 
at all meet the needs identified, nor does it solve the problems 
related to Canada's health care system.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	The bottom line is that, if a business in the private sector 
managed the health issue, for example, like the federal 
government does, it would have gone bankrupt ages ago, 
because the government has increasingly been asking the people 
out there on the front, those who have to deal with the problems, 
workers in the health care sector, nurses, auxiliary workers, 
doctors and employees of community service centres to make a 
personal effort and to find creative ways to do more with less. 
But the federal government did not think it was necessary in this 
case to secure the co-operation of the provinces or of the people 
who run the daily operations. A business that worked that way in 
the private sector would not last a year because that approach is 
totally unrealistic and incapable of meeting the needs of the 
industry, and it would find itself in the same situation as the 
government now finds itself.
<P>
	How has the federal government managed to keep things 
running this way for so many years? It has succeeded because it 
has borrowed from future generations. Using slightly artificial 
means, it financed a health care system because that was what 
the people wanted. But the federal government also taxed, and 
Claude Castonguay, who can be called the father of the current 
health care system in Quebec, made this point well in an article 
for <I>La Presse</I>. He said in that article that the federal government 
exerted an irresistible pressure on provincial governments to 
commit themselves to the principles of universality and 
accessibility, by offering to pay for half of the provinces' costs. 
But, now that the system is bankrupt, Ottawa does not propose 
the solution put forth by Mr. Castonguay, which is to co-operate 
to resolve the problem. Instead, Ottawa decided to retain only its 
role as referee, whereby, paradoxically, even though it has 
significantly reduced funding, it will still be able to impose 
national standards.
<P>
	It will be able to treat people like the owner of an apartment 
building who has had a good relationship with a tenant for 
several years and has offered that tenant certain services, for 
free, which he or she could not afford, mostly because the owner 
had extra money sitting around. Suddenly, the owner, this 
endless source of funds, says: For next year, effective tomorrow 
morning, I am reducing my heating subsidy by 15 per cent. I am 
certain that you, as tenants, will all be able to find a way  to 
continue to live comfortably under these conditions and that we 
will continue to get along just fine.
<P>
	Faced with such a situation, the tenants, or the provinces, may 
well try for several years to make the necessary adjustments. 
But, in the mid term, it is inevitable that the federal 
government's choice will lead to a balkanization of our social 
programs. It will have exactly the opposite effect. That is 
because the federal government is no longer capable of 
providing the financial support for which it took responsibility, 
in an artificial manner, in the past. Today, it has offloaded the 
bill for its social programs, without handing over the 
responsibility for those programs as well. That is quite an 
achievement. It has decided that the provinces can make up their 
own minds how they want to finance these programs but at the 
same time, they will have to meet certain requirements that do 
not necessarily reflect their needs.
<P>
	Briefly, Bill C-76 has killed any hope for renewed federalism. 
The federal government is stretched to the limit. It tried to 
finance these programs by borrowing money which, in turn, 
added to our cumulative debt, but today, it is no longer in 
control. It is at the mercy of international lenders, and we now 
find it is unable to provide adequate services. How did we get 
into this mess?
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	How come our system no longer makes sense? The trouble is 
that unlike many other countries, we did not have a chance to 
adjust our constitutional responsibilities to the market situation 
and to what is going on in the real world. This has led to the 
absurd situation we have today, where the federal government 
tables a bill that drastically changes the rules of the game 
without making the constitutional changes that should 
accompany this kind of decision.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Before proceeding to 
questions and comments, pursuant to Standing Order 38, it is my 
duty to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight 
at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for 
Kamloops-health; the hon. member for Fraser Valley 
West-infrastructure; the hon. member for 
Mercier-unemployment insurance; the hon. member for 
Mackenzie-transport.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ): </B>Thank you for recognizing me, Madam Speaker. I 
appreciate this opportunity to comment on the remarks made by 
my colleague, who quite aptly demonstrated that the federal 
government's action in areas of provincial jurisdiction is 
inappropriate. Earlier, the hon. member for Outremont rose in 
this House, offended at the thought that Bloc members could 
question his nationalistic sentiment. From his place, he stated 
loudly that he was not the least nationalistic of Liberal 
members, thereby suggesting that he was certainly the most 
nationalistic one of them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12088"> 12088 </A></B>
<P>
	If that is so, if the hon. member for Outremont is the most 
nationalistic of Liberal members, I understand why the people 
of Quebec voted for the Bloc Quebecois. If, by any chance, we 
did not attain sovereignty in Quebec, I am convinced that we 
would keep being reelected over and over forever, with our 
members whose nationalistic sentiments are as strong as his.
<P>
	I would like to come back on one aspect of the speeches we 
have heard, which my colleague has raised. All day long, Liberal 
members have been telling us that the national standards that 
their government is about to impose on us with its Canada social 
transfer would deal with principles. ``We will give the provinces 
every latitude'', they said. ``They will be free to do administer as 
they please programs which fall under their jurisdiction 
anyway''.
<P>
If that is the case, I would like to know why we can read the 
following-and there was no mention of this in the discussion 
on principles today-at clause 37 of Bill C-76:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In order that a province may qualify for a full cash contribution-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This must be the money.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-referred to in section 5, the government of the province-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Among other conditions, the one listed in (<I>b</I>) reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>shall give recognition to the Canada Health and Social Transfer in any public 
documents, or in any advertising or promotional material, relating to insured 
health services and extended health care services in the province.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	To conclude, because I want to give my colleague the time to 
comment, what does this mean? Does it mean that the federal 
government-as I said this morning, this is the ``flag on the 
hood'' syndrome-absolutely wants every document and every 
thing distributed to taxpayers by the provinces to bear the 
Canadian flag? Does it mean that every hospital bedpan will 
have to be marked to show federal contribution? Is this the kind 
of publicity they seek?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I will recognize very 
briefly the hon. member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Madam Speaker, I am fairly happy with the 
example raised, because, in the end, history is being rewritten. 
For a number of years there was a placard war between the 
federal and the provincial governments. This is one of the main 
causes of the current deficit.
<P>
	To continue with the placard example, let us look at day care. 
In Quebec, we developed a model for day care services. With 
national standards, Canada-wide standards, the efficiency of the 
Quebec system will continually be blocked. And you want 
justification.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	I think Quebecers are fed up. They want full control over their 
future. This is what is going to happen, and this is how Bill C-76 
is so rewarding for all Quebecers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to respond to the motion 
before us which accuses the government of using the proposed 
Canada health and social transfer to damage the interests and 
autonomy of the provinces.
<P>
	This motion and the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition 
in support of it are completely unfounded. Moreover, it is a 
gross misrepresentation of what we in the government have said 
and intend to do.
<P>
	Had the Leader of the Opposition taken the time to read the 
budget, he could have easily ascertained our true intent by 
reading the budget plan released in February in which the 
Minister of Finance announced the new transfer program which 
the hon. member finds so troubling. In that document the 
Minister of Finance states that transfers to the provinces under 
health, CAP and PSE will be structured differently to create a 
system that is both fiscally sustainable, more flexible and better 
suited to the needs of Canadians.
<P>
	This will be achieved by consolidating the three transfers into 
a single new block transfer called the Canada health and social 
transfer. Rather than using it to intrude into areas of provincial 
responsibility or to reduce the role of the provinces to that of 
mere consultants as the opposition alleges in its motion, the 
budget declares the exact opposite.
<P>
	The budget states: ``The new transfer will end the 
intrusiveness of cost sharing under CAP and will reduce the 
federal-provincial entanglement that has been a source of 
irritation with current cost shared transfer arrangements''.
<P>
	This is because federal expenditures would no longer be 
driven by provincial decisions as to how and to whom social 
assistance and social services will be provided. Provinces will 
no longer be subject to rules stipulating that certain 
expenditures are eligible for cost sharing while others are not. 
As a result, the provinces will be free to pursue innovative 
approaches to social security reform without having to worry 
about whether such approaches meet requirements for cost 
sharing. The expense to both federal and provincial 
governments of administering cost sharing will be eliminated.
<P>
	Thus, it is clear the Canada health and social transfer will not 
damage the role of provinces as the hon. Leader of the 
Opposition suggests in his motion. There will be national 
standards for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12089"> 12089 </A></B>
<P>
the new Canada health and social transfer and the February 
budget sets them out quite clearly.
<P>
	No change will be made to the Canada Health Act. Its 
principles will continue to be enforced by withholding funds if 
necessary. In addition, provinces will be required, as they are 
under the rules of the Canada assistance plan, to provide social 
assistance without any minimum residency requirement.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development will invite 
all provincial governments to work together on developing 
through mutual consent a set of shared principles and objectives 
that could underline the new transfer. In this way all 
governments could reaffirm their commitment to the well-being 
of Canadians. The Minister of Health will continue to work with 
provincial and territorial health ministers to renew Canada's 
health system.
<P>
	The Canada health and social transfer represents an important 
step forward for the provinces since it will give them the 
flexibility they need to develop innovative social programs that 
can better address the needs of their citizens. After all, it must be 
admitted that the current Canada assistance plan with its 
restrictive cost sharing requirements too often inhibited such 
innovation. Nowhere have the negative impacts of this 
legislative straitjacket been more obvious than in the hon. 
member's own province.
<P>
	It is a sad fact that many exciting and innovative programs in 
Quebec have been denied funding because of the restrictive 
requirements contained in the rules governing the current 
transfer programs. For instance, APPORT is an income 
supplement program for low income families with children 
which seeks to help such parents make the transition from social 
assistance to the workforce. Since 1988 this program has been 
ineligible for cost sharing because its assessment of need does 
not conform to that of the transfer program.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	Then again, many programs in the 1970s aimed at 
disadvantaged children in Quebec were ruled ineligible because 
they did not correspond to the definition of welfare services 
contained within the act which excludes services related to 
education. Similarly, probation services for young offenders are 
ineligible since the same definition of welfare services also 
excludes correctional services. The list goes on and on.
<P>
	However, I should add that these problems are not restricted 
to Quebec. Virtually every province has at one time or other seen 
worthwhile projects turned down. These have included 
programs in such diverse areas as self-managed care, 
community based services, nutrition programs for children and 
adaptive transportation services for the disabled.
<P>
	The introduction of the Canada health and social transfer will 
make it possible for provinces to proceed with these kinds of 
programs which have been excluded in the past.
<P>
	As well, let me state categorically that the government has not 
and will not use transfer programs as a way to interfere in areas 
of provincial responsibility as this motion suggests. Rather the 
federal government seeks to involve the provinces as full 
partners in the very important work of developing a set of shared 
principles and objectives which might underlie this new transfer 
system.
<P>
	This is why the Minister of Human Resources Development 
will be inviting his provincial colleagues to sit down with him to 
discuss ways in which we can work together in partnership to 
develop a common framework of objectives and approaches for 
the Canada health and social transfer.
<P>
	Canadians of all regions are very proud of our system of social 
programs and they are right to be. These programs flow from the 
shared values of all Canadians and are the result of decades of 
hard work, sacrifice and dedication. This investment of time, 
effort and commitment has resulted in a quality of life which is 
regarded with envy and admiration by the rest of the world.
<P>
	Let me ask this very fundamental question of those who 
intend to support the motion. Would this country have been 
better off if the federal government had not been active in 
transferring funds to the provinces? Think of the achievements 
that these transfers have helped provinces to build in the past 30 
years. Look at the issue of medicare, the envy of the world; 
post-secondary education and colleges, one of the highest 
enrolment rates; the safety net, protection for the most 
vulnerable. These are proud records of achievement.
<P>
	While funding arrangements have served Canadians well in 
the past, federalism is changing. Therefore our transfer 
programs must also change to remain relevant. There is a need 
for a greater flexibility in the way we provide funds to the 
provinces. In hindsight it is clear that some features of our 
current system reflect a paternalistic and prescriptive approach 
which is out of place in the 1990s.
<P>
	Too often restrictions contained within the current system 
have stifled innovation by the provinces and derailed 
worthwhile projects before they even got started.
<P>
	The new Canada health and social transfer will actually result 
in less intrusion by the federal government in the affairs of the 
provinces and not more, as the hon. member suggests. It will 
also result in greater flexibility.
<P>
	We are taking the proper step toward building co-operative 
federalism. It speaks to the type of positive direction in which 
the government is taking the country.

	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill 
C-291, an act respecting a national year of the grandparent, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, the next hour is an opportunity for 
the House to set aside partisan differences, to show our 
appreciation and to demonstrate the value of grandparents in the 
family unit.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12094"> 12094 </A></B>
<P>
	Most of us have had the honour of knowing one living 
grandparent at one time or another. Most of us who have a family 
will have had the pleasure and the reassurance of having 
grandparents for our children.
<P>
	As a very young boy and until I became an adult I had a 
grandfather who was a pillar of my existence. My own children 
had the privilege of having three living grandparents and one 
great-grandfather. The value they brought to our family was the 
same value brought to all families by grandparents.
<P>
	By virtue of their more senior years, grandparents have many 
abilities that young parents do not have and contribute many 
things to the strength of the family. They show the way to young 
children more by example than by the things they say. They have 
an accumulated wisdom they pass on, which young parents do 
not have. Whether we call it osmosis or however it is passed on 
to younger people, it is done by example.
<P>
	Grandparents have experience. Young people can ask them 
questions and they give answers based on experience, very often 
based on more experience than that of their parents. Naturally 
grandparents bring love into the family, the great common 
denominator that binds us together.
<P>
	Grandparents express by example tolerance and teach us 
tolerance as children. That is particularly fitting at a time in 
history when the family unit seems to be virtually under attack 
from every corner. When grandparents are not available to 
provide strength and to provide enrichment, we know the 
results.
<P>
	The grandparents of my children were of tremendous help to 
my wife and I as young parents with a young family. Perhaps we 
utilized their services more than we should have from time to 
time. However, I do believe that they accepted the challenges of 
looking after our family with grace and dignity when we needed 
them. It was always a pleasure and an adventure for our children 
to spend time with their grandparents. They helped a great deal 
to enrich our family and they contributed a great deal to family 
strength.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	I know there is a cliché that has been in vogue for a few years, 
which is the phrase family values. Often family values and what 
they really mean get hackneyed very badly. But if ever there was 
an expression of family values and what that means, and 
certainly what that means to me, it is expressed very much 
through grandparents and what they mean to the family. They 
enrich our lives in so many ways, and we pay them honour here 
today.
<P>
	I would be remiss if I did not pay tribute to the person who 
prompted me to bring this bill before the House. Her name is 
Bubbie Schwarz. Bubbie, as you might know, Madam Speaker, 
is the Jewish term of endearment for grandmother. Bubbie 
Schwarz is a television personality in the Toronto area who has a 
program for senior citizens. It was at her urging that this bill be  
brought before the House to declare 1995 as the year of the 
grandparent.
<P>
	My grandparents are gone now. My grandfather passed away 
in 1963. But the influence he had on my life was as strong as the 
influence of my own father and mother. As I spent time with 
him, in the summers particularly, when school was out, and 
lived with him I was exposed to his code of conduct, his code of 
performance, the way he lived his life. A great deal of it rubbed 
off on me-at least the good parts of it did, I hope; the negative 
parts I created myself.
<P>
	Our children had the benefit of a great-grandfather who 
actually lived with us for a number of years before at the age of 
96 he decided he would go to western Canada and spend the rest 
of his years with his son. Our daughter grew up on his knee for 
the first eight years of her life.
<P>
	We look back on our grandparents and on my children's 
grandparents with great fondness, with great respect, and a 
straight sense of the value they brought to our family. I feel 
badly for people who did not have that experience. Many people 
did not have a living grandparent in their lives and have had to 
be without that special kind of support they provide.
<P>
	It is also fair to put on the record today the fact that because of 
the splitting of families and because of the divorce rate and so 
on, many grandparents are finding it increasingly difficult to 
access their own grandchildren. This is a serious mistake, 
because it denies the grandchildren that opportunity to receive 
the strength by the example they set.
<P>
<B>(1805 ) </B>
<P>
	I hope that by debating this today, as the issue of grandparents 
and access to their grandchildren becomes more of an issue, 
which it is at the present time, we will remember what our 
grandparents meant to us, what they mean to us, and what they 
should mean to their grandchildren, especially those who are 
involved in the break-up of a marriage where custody is given to 
one parent. In Canada there is no joint custody capability, and 
sometimes rancour, division, and bitterness cloud the break-up. 
Grandparents can really make a difference and add strength.
<P>
	I ask the House to consider that. I realize that to speak on a 
subject like this probably arouses emotions in all of us, which 
we are not used to experiencing in a place like this. But they are 
important emotions. It is very important to get the message 
across that we support the completeness of the family and the 
bringing together of all the generations and making sure that 
they are all together. With the stresses we have on family life 
today, I can think of very few more important things to do in 
strengthening the family than to make sure that grandparents 
and great-grandparents and maybe some of the extended family, 
like great-uncles and aunts, are very much revered, honoured, 
and accepted as a part of the family unit. We must be aware that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12095"> 12095 </A></B>
<P>
when we make laws  in this House those laws must reflect that 
respect and desire to keep the family strong and together.
<P>
	It is a great honour for me to say these few words today on 
behalf of grandparents. I thank the House for arranging the time 
for this debate. It is not the most usual issue to be raised in this 
place, but I do consider it very important. I hope this will 
underline our view of the family and our view of the senior 
people in the family, who have done so much and continue to do 
so much for all of us.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I rise in this House to address Bill C-291, which seeks 
to declare, throughout Canada, 1995 as the Year of the 
Grandparent.
<P>
	As the official opposition critic on issues concerning seniors, 
I am very interested in this bill which would grant grandparents 
the status which they deserve. Grandparents develop a special 
bond with their grandchildren, for whom they may represent 
stability in a sometime fragile environment.
<P>
	Many modern families are the result of break-ups. The 
blended family is made up of members who do not all have the 
same biological links between them. There is no model for this 
new family; every member must adjust, so as to ensure his or her 
integration in the new family unit.
<P>
	Grandparents play a major role during the early years, as well 
as during the teenage years of their grandchildren.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	They can provide emotional security and stability to their 
grandchildren, particularly when the parents divorce or 
separate. Grandparents can identify problems, but they must not 
take part in the debate, since such an intrusion can sometimes 
exacerbate the situation.
<P>
	Bill C-291 finally gives recognition to older people, who are 
often perceived as a burden in our communities. This, in turn, 
often leads to social isolation, feelings of uselessness, isolation, 
loneliness, as well as low self-esteem.
<P>
	Older people play a vital role in their grandchildren's lives. To 
that end, grandparents need minimum economic well-being. 
Financial security is essential for the elderly to maintain their 
independence.
<P>
	Seniors represent an increasingly larger part of the overall 
population. It is estimated that, over the next 15 years, the 
number of elderly will increase by 40 per cent. The government 
must respect our seniors and recognize their contribution. Bill 
C-291 seeks to recognize that contribution. It is important that 
grandparents have the necessary tools to provide them with a 
quality of life, so that they can adequately assume their role.
<P>
	Let me give you a brief outlook on how Canadian seniors use 
their spare time. According to a document published in 1993 by 
the National Advisory Council of Aging, seniors participate in 
the following activities. In 1986, 66 per cent of seniors between 
the ages of 65 and 74 went to a theatre or a restaurant once a 
month, while this figure was 50 per cent in the case of seniors 
who were 75 and over. From 40 per cent to 66 per cent of seniors 
purchased sports equipment and related services-for playing 
golf, skiing, camping, home exercising-and equipment for 
leisure activities, including computers, compared with 83 per 
cent of other Canadians.
<P>
	Seniors would prefer to spend money on spectator activities 
like the movies, concerts and sport events, as opposed to 
recreational equipment for the home. However, seniors spend 
less than all other groups on recreational activities.
<P>
	Statistics also showed that 12 per cent of seniors spent money 
on organized holidays, while 11 per cent of younger Canadians 
spent money in this way. Furthermore, 58 per cent of seniors 
travelled outside their community in a given month. Men 60 and 
over watched an average 33 hours of television per week, while 
women in the same age group watched an average of 36 hours.
<P>
	These statistics prove that seniors are not passive and can 
share different types of recreation with their grandchildren. 
However, the Bloc Quebecois has always made it clear that the 
federal government is trying to reduce the deficit at the expense 
of the most vulnerable in our society.
<P>
	According to a report by the National Advisory Council on 
Aging, the disposable income of seniors is broken down as 
follows. In 1989, the average income of single persons aged 65 
or over was $16,316, while the average income of single persons 
under the age of 65 was $23,080. A single person is someone 
who lives alone or in a household where he or she is not related 
to the other members of that household.
<P>
	In 1992, the average income of single seniors was $18,434, 
while that of other single persons was $25,039. Nearly 21 per 
cent of all seniors, in other words, 625,000, live on what are 
considered to be low incomes. The percentage of seniors living 
on low incomes is always higher than in the general population.

	On March 9, 1994, I addressed the following question in this 
House to the Minister of Human Resources Development and 
Minster of Western Economic Diversification, and I quote: ``By 
making alarming statements on the old age security system, is 
the minister preparing to hit seniors with a considerable cut in 
their old age security pensions?''
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12096"> 12096 </A></B>
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development responded 
simply that he wanted to provide a stable, effective, fair and 
honest system for seniors, one that Canada could afford.
<P>
	Bill C-291 should be seen as recognizing the role of seniors. 
However, I would like to point out that I find the choice of year, 
that is 1995, unfortunate, since the United Nations has declared 
1995 a year of tolerance. Accordingly, the Bloc Quebecois 
obviously supports the bill, but feels that 1996 would be a more 
appropriate year. Furthermore, a number of months have 
elapsed, significantly reducing the impact of Bill C-291.
<P>
	I would also like to mention that grandparents are not all 
seniors. Statistics also show an upswing in the birth rate among 
adolescents, resulting in younger and younger grandparents. In 
closing, I would congratulate my colleague for Halton-Peel on 
Bill C-291, because it recognizes the importance of 
grandparents throughout Canada and pays tribute to them.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to rise in the House today 
to speak on Bill C-291, introduced by the hon. member for 
Halton-Peel.
<P>
	During this past year I have spoken with many Canadian 
grandparents, as over a year ago now, March 25, 1994, I 
presented for first reading in the House my Bill C-232 relating 
to amending the Divorce Act to provide grandparents an 
automatic right to standing in the court so they could speak on 
behalf of their grandchildren and thereby protect the right of 
access of the child to his or her family.
<P>
	As my bill is votable, we had many grandparents sitting in the 
gallery for each of the first two hours of debate to see how their 
members of Parliament dealt with this very serious issue. I 
expect that during the last hour of debate scheduled for this 
Thursday, May 4 we will once again see many of our seniors in 
the gallery.
<P>
	Are grandparents still an important section of our society? Do 
Canadians recognize grandparents as a valuable resource, one 
which we as legislators should encourage and work with, 
respecting their years of training, skill, knowledge, experience, 
patience, love, understanding and their willingness to serve, 
help, teach and spend time with our many young Canadians, 
many of these children who just need someone to listen to them 
and care about them?
<P>
	Most of us realize in our present society we have many 
grandparents already raising their grandchildren, not because 
after raising their own family they are anxious to raise another 
generation. Usually it is simply because they are needed and 
their help is asked for.
<P>
	Joan Brooks, a grandmother from Toronto and a member of a 
grandparents' group, said: ``Let the parents parent; we do not 
want to do their job''. It is much easier for grandparents to enjoy 
being grandparents, visiting their families, sharing stories, 
guidance and love with their grandchildren.
<P>
	However, life is not perfect and due to the rising divorce rate, 
split families, substance abuse and financial difficulties, more 
and more of our young children need an extra someone in their 
lives. It is only natural that wherever possible that person or 
persons should be grandparents.
<P>
	In the United States there are over three million grandparents 
raising their grandchildren. We know this because the 
Americans already have protected national legislation to secure 
a child's right to his or her family. Consequently we were able to 
see some real statistics of the true state of society's needs.
<P>
	Some of our Canadian citizens place a very high value on a 
grandparent's role in the family. One grandparent, Abnash Gill 
of Coquitlam, writes:

<P>
	Ray Ali, marriage and family therapist from Winnipeg, states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I was having coffee with a colleague of mine and in the course of our 
conversation we began talking about grandparents. As he talked about his 
loving relationship with them, I envied him that he had grandparents who 
loved him. It was the same type of envy that I experienced as a child when my 
friends would tell me about visiting their grandparents during the weekend. 
Remember the Dick and Jane books when they visited their grandparents at 
the farm? Oh, how I envied them.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Perhaps growing up without grandparents made me realize, even at a very 
early age, that they play an important role in our lives. I did not have anyone 
telling me stories about my parents nor stories about how life used to be. So I 
live my life secretly, envying people like my friend. He had something very 
special- something I never had.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Fortunately the situation is different for my children because they have a 
special relationship with their grandparents. My children are lucky because 
they have both sets of grandparents. If this isn't enough they've adopted 
another elderly couple who are also given the special title of grandparents. 
My children are fortunate but they are far from being unique.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>According to recent statistics 90 per cent of all children have at least one living 
grandparent. If this fact is reliable then it is  indeed unfortunate that many children 
in this 90 per cent are refused access to see their grandparents, often by the custodial 
parent.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Statistics Canada recently published some poignant statistics on 
grandparenting. They report that even though the frequencies of visits 
decrease as children grow older, 40 per cent of adolescents over 15 see their 
grandparents at least once a month.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Secondly, the image that grandparents are old, fragile and a huge financial 
burden to society is clearly flawed. A significant number of grandparents are 
still working and/or volunteering their time. Approximately 40 per cent of 
seniors provide unpaid help to their families in the form of child care, 
transportation and financial support. When called upon they are often there to 
help. Clearly we often overlook the contributions that seniors themselves 
make to others.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Without question, grandparenting is as important now as in any other time 
period. Maybe even more so. Unlike 50 years ago, today's grandparent- 
grandchildren relationships often last more than 20 years. It is quite 
conceivable that we will spend more time in our lives being grandparents than 
parents thus contrary to common perceptions, grandparents can have 
potentially greater influence on our children than they did in years past.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Grandparents want to feel useful but we as a society have done a very poor 
job of tapping into this tremendous natural resource.</BLOCKQUOTE>

they always have that loving touch. My grandma has a beautiful smile each

	Today I have spoken on the wonder of grandparents and their 
positive influence and their needed assistance in Canada's 
future.
<P>
	Bill C-291 tries to recognize grandparents. In a grandparents 
year we could have the ceremonies and activities to recognize 
them. That would be good. We should definitely also have a 
grandparents day so we could recognize them every year. They 
are the unsung heroes of Canada's society. They give everything 
and ask for very little in return.
<P>
	Perhaps Margaret Mead said it best: ``In the presence of 
grandparents and grandchildren the past and the future merge in 
the present''.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am delighted to speak today to 
Bill C-291, an act respecting a national year of the grandparent. 
I take the opportunity to speak on behalf of the government's 
commitment to Canada's grandparents.
<P>
	I have not yet had the fortune of becoming a grandparent. I 
guess my sons have control over that and so I may never become 
a grandparent. I have grandparents. All of us have grandparents.
<P>
	My grandmother was my mentor, a woman who was a feminist 
long before the word feminist was popular. She was strong, 
feisty and she told me that if I did not like how things were I 
should go in there and change them and not complain. She lived 
that. She was always fighting for causes. Like a battleship at full 
steam, she was always there making things happen, changing 
things. She always had courage. She was an outspoken and 
strong woman.
<P>
	My grandmother set for me an example that I have followed. 
If she were alive today I think she would be very pleased and 
proud that I am standing here talking about her role in my life 
and about grandparents as a whole.
<P>
	Grandparents play a vital role in the lives of families and in 
the lives of all Canadians. Whether you have grandchildren or 
not, you can be a grandparent. In British Columbia there the 
Volunteer Grandparents Association. It meets and looks after 
children. As we all know, in society today families can live so 
far away from each other and many families do not have an 
extended family or a grandparent close by. These grandparents 
whose children are not around become grandparents to children 
whose grandparents are not around and they bridge the gap.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12098"> 12098 </A></B>
<P>
	It is interesting to see them at baseball games, to be there at 
ballet recitals and to watch these adoptive grandparents 
enjoying all the things their adoptive grandchildren do.
<P>
	I have to tell members about filling the lives of children. 
Whether you are a young child, an older child or an adult, 
grandparents fill your life. My children's grandparents are very 
far away and they have benefited from volunteer grandparents. I 
think they always needed to know there was somewhere a safe 
haven they could go to when their parents did not understand; to 
go to somebody who had the wisdom and could remind them 
their parents were children once.
<P>
	I remember my children telling me I sometimes forgot I was 
once a child. Grandparents are always there to remind us, to 
assure us our parents were not as perfect as they pretended to be. 
They bring that sense of vulnerability and fallibility into 
parenting, which is good. It gives children something to believe 
in and something to feel strong about.
<P>
	The important role grandparents play in the life of a family 
should never be underestimated. Today where families are 
fragmented grandparents often take up the life of the family and 
carry it by themselves; sometimes only temporarily when there 
is a family crisis or illness and sometimes even permanently 
because of a divorce.
<P>
	That is why we clearly need to support grandparents today. 
We must ensure they remain a stable factor in the lives of their 
grandchildren, regardless of where the parents are. The reason 
they do is that grandparents have a sense of continuity. They 
bridge the past and the present. They bring yesterday into today. 
Grandparents make us feel as if we have always been here as a 
people. That continuity is very important to us. Especially when 
our lives are fragmented and unstable they bring that sense of 
permanence, that sense of tradition, that sense of stability and 
reality which is needed in today's world. It is a sense of 
timelessness, if I may use that word.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	Grandparents are very important because they are 
traditionally wise. They are always wise. Grandparents are a 
source of advice. They are a good source of advice because they 
have stepped aside from being subjective and can offer the 
objective wisdom parents are unable to offer because they are 
too closely linked to their children.
<P>
	Three out of every four Canadians over 65 are grandparents. 
What is interesting is that you do not have to be over 65 to be a 
grandparent. The image of a grandparent as being someone kind 
with twinkling eyes behind glasses and an ample bosom and a 
warm laugh may not necessarily be what grandparents are. 
Grandparents are also now in their forties and fifties. They bring 
a sense of vitality to the family that was not there before when 
grandparents were only supposed to be one age.
<P>
	Grandparents bring a sense of trust as well. They help us to 
feel safe because no matter what happens, they are always there. 
They seem to have a sense of immovability and a sense of 
complete and total stability. They are an anchor for most of us.
<P>
	In many cultures grandparents are historians. Many cultures 
do not have a written history where we can go back and read it, 
especially in our aboriginal cultures for example. In those many 
other cultures where there is no written history grandparents 
bring the stories with them that tell us where we came from and 
talk about our traditions.
<P>
	In many aboriginal societies the elders and grandparents are 
bringing aboriginal people back home, especially today's 
aboriginal people who have been removed forcibly from their 
homes at one point in time, have been severed from their past. 
Today's grandparents are healing in native cultures. They bring 
the old ways back, the sense of spirituality, the sense of 
permanence, the sense of bonding.
<P>
	Health Canada has recognized this and has given grants 
through the new horizons program to assist grandparents in 
aboriginal cultures to bring their young people home. They help 
not just anecdotally but in a real way with issues such as suicide, 
substance abuse and alcoholism. They have been making a real 
difference by bringing back the cultures and helping the 
children. In fact Health Canada's grants send children to camps 
where grandparents tell stories, teach the native language, teach 
them basic survival skills, how to sew, and counsel them on 
issues that are bothering today's young aboriginal people.
<P>
	It is sad to note that despite their important role in society 
some derogatory myths exist about grandparents. Those myths 
continue to be perpetuated.
<P>
	One myth depicts older grandparents as frail and dependent. 
Like their young counterparts actually, the majority of older 
grandparents live active, healthy and productive lives. A 1990 
study showed that one out of every two seniors over 65 provided 
assistance to people outside of their household, such as unpaid 
transportation or financial support.
<P>
	Still another myth suggests that families sometimes neglect 
and even abandon grandparents and many older family 
members. That is not actually true. Studies have found that 
seniors obtain 80 per cent of the help they need from their 
families and that 92 per cent of seniors and grandparents say that 
they feel emotionally close to their families.
<P>
	Half of Canada's senior grandparents live within 10 
kilometres of at least one child. I did not know that fact until I 
looked it up recently. They visit regularly, they telephone daily 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12099"> 12099 </A></B>
<P>
and they offer very clear and strong emotional support to their 
families.
<P>
	I reiterate the fact that the grandparent through all of these 
ways, regardless of what culture, does play a very clear and 
strong role. Grandparents are ageless and timeless; they have 
always been here. They defy socioeconomic barriers. All of us 
have grandparents. Whether we are rich, middle class or poor, 
no matter whether we live in a developed world or in a 
developing world, no matter whether we speak English or any 
other language, we all have grandparents. They are a common 
universal treasure.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	Because of their timelessness, because of their universality, 
because of their holding the family together, grandparents offer 
a sense of stability and a sense of permanence that bridge the 
past and the future.
<P>
	I support the bill because grandparents make us immortal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I speak to Bill C-291, 
presented by the hon. member for Halton-Peel, an act 
respecting the national year of the grandparent which calls upon 
Parliament to designate 1995 the year of the grandparent.
<P>
	I say this not only because I am a grandparent to my grandson, 
Spencer Drew, the most handsome, intelligent, talented and 
clever boy in the whole wide world who will celebrate his first 
birthday next Sunday, but because I believe that anything which 
strengthens the family unit will help to better our society.
<P>
	Through all generations and cultures grandparents have 
generally played a caring, supportive and nurturing role in the 
lives of their families and extended families. The time has come 
for Canada to formally reaffirm the invaluable contribution 
grandparents have made and will continue to make to society.
<P>
	Last year the United States Congress adopted House 
resolution 355 and Senate resolution 198 proclaiming 1995 as 
the year of the grandparent, encouraging citizens to observe the 
year with programs, ceremonies and activities.
<P>
	Having already reached the month of May, it would seem that 
we in Canada have been slow off the mark to honour the family 
and grandparents.
<P>
	Quebec's civil code has enshrined the role of grandparents in 
article 611 which states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In no case may the father or mother, without a grave reason, interfere with 
personal relations between the child and his grandparents.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The intent of Bill C-291 truly goes beyond partisan politics in 
giving grandparents recognition for their important 
fundamental contribution to family and society, love given 
freely with no strings attached. Bill C-291 should receive 
unanimous consent in the House.
<P>
	Grandparents bring a tremendous amount of affection, energy 
and other beneficial things into the lives of children. One thing 
unchanged through all time is that children still require a loving 
and secure environment. Most grandparents are ready, willing 
and able to provide love in abundant quantities and children are 
quick to realize that when in grandma's or grandpa's care they 
are safe, secure and adored. They have a home away from home, 
often with fewer or more lenient rules to follow.
<P>
	Grandparents provide a link to our past, to our roots and to our 
heritage. During every day conversation they share the trials and 
joys experienced during their lives. They pass on knowledge of 
the ways, whys and wherefores of previous generations and give 
meaning to the changes that have evolved over time.
<P>
	Grandparents care deeply for the happiness and well-being of 
these innocent, young, impressionable lives and do everything 
within their power to pave the way for a better and more caring 
tomorrow.
<P>
	Parents can usually depend on grandparents to care for their 
grandchildren whenever help is needed. They are there when 
difficult situations such as illness or problems within the family 
relationship present themselves. Grandparents are there to 
provide stability and continuity for their grandchildren.
<P>
	It is only natural that grandparents should be nurturing and 
caring. After all, they were parents at one time and are now the 
beneficiaries of the experience they gained while raising their 
families.
<P>
	A strong family structure is the best means by which to 
nurture children and society as a whole and grandparents are an 
integral part of the structure. Thus, it is most fitting that 1995 be 
officially proclaimed the year of the grandparent. As 1994 was 
declared the international year of the family, it seems to 
logically follow that 1995 should be chosen to give special 
recognition to grandparents.
<P>
<B>(1840 ) </B>
<P>
	Not too long ago, the nuclear family, including grandparents, 
aunts, uncles and cousins formed a cohesive, interdependent 
unit which helped to provide the basic necessities of life. Small 
communities were self-sustaining and so were families.
<P>
	Today, the economy and times have changed. People have 
moved away from the hometown and have found employment in 
places often far removed from the traditional nuclear family. 
Our society is fast paced, often demanding that people not only 
change jobs, but pick up roots and change careers several times 
over their working years.
<P>
	There is increasing displacement and stress on the family in 
today's environment, with the result that in many cases, the 
reassuring support traditionally given by the family unit is not 
<P>

<B><A NAME="12100"> 12100 </A></B>
<P>
readily accessible nor available to provide immediate support 
when it is needed.
<P>
	More and more homes see both parents working. This 
evolution has impacted on the role of the grandparents by 
restricting their access to their grandchildren. Often it is not 
easy for them to maintain close contact with their grandchildren 
but despite these obstacles, families do remain united, tied by 
their common roots. Grandparents have and always will be an 
integral part of the family because love transcends all obstacles 
and survives the onslaught of modern society.
<P>
	Families are the anchors of a caring society. It is vital to do 
everything possible to preserve the nuclear family unit.
<P>
	Governments should recognize that the family is best 
equipped to provide and inculcate those things which make a 
society strong and caring. Interference or attempts to replace 
positive family influence with questionable or intrusive 
government programs simply erode the strength the family can 
provide to society.
<P>
	Often, grandparents step in to accept the role of primary 
caregiver. In cases of family breakdown, they are usually 
willing to do what comes naturally by simply being available to 
be part of the solution, an option lawyers and courts often fail to 
consider.
<P>
	To have access and be able to provide a continuing, dignified, 
stable, supportive presence in the lives of children caught in the 
middle of an emotional and bitter family dispute is a service 
grandparents are often well suited to assume. Present laws do 
not foster this option.
<P>
	In a time when government is looking for ways to restructure 
social and welfare programs, it should recognize that millions of 
dollars could be saved and a better solution arrived at by 
including grandparents in custody and access hearings. This is 
not only in the best interests of the grandparents but also in the 
best interests of children often caught in the crossfire.
<P>
	The courts should recognize there are other options at least in 
the interim, a neutral third party willing to accept the role of 
caregiver. Most grandparents, if able, are willing to take on this 
responsibility and be part of the solution in what is often a 
highly emotional, indeed devastating time for all parties 
involved. Again, they are needed but often not considered as an 
option or part of the solution.
<P>
	With 1995 designated as the year of the grandparent, it would 
be logical for government to take the steps necessary to amend 
current legislation to allow grandparents to be grandparents by 
providing the care, love and support they are so willing to give.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> There being no further 
members rising for debate and the motion not being designated 
as a votable item, the time provided for the consideration of 
Private Members' Business has now expired and the order is

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HEALTH">HEALTH</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, to add 
my comments to the previous speaker's on setting aside 1995 as 
the year of the grandparent, it is a first class idea. I would have 
liked to have seen that followed through.
<P>
	However, my few moments are to talk about a question I 
raised on April 5 regarding the funding of health care. It is fair to 
say that one of the major factors that distinguishes Canada from 
the United States is our support of medicare. It is an identifying 
feature of being a Canadian and sets us apart from the United 
States.
<P>
<B>(1845 ) </B>
<P>
	We see now the possibility of the health care system and 
medicare system being seriously eroded as a result of the last 
budget, but also the two budgets leading up to it. An integral part 
of medicare is the universality provision. Whether one is a baker 
or a banker one ought to have the same access to health care 
wherever one happens to live in Canada.
<P>
	We have held up with pride the universality of medicare as 
something that distinguishes us from our neighbours to the 
south. I do not have to remind anyone of the serious differences 
in the two systems. In Canada we spend a little less than 10 per 
cent of GDP on health care. In United States, its citizens spend a 
little less than 14 per cent of their GDP on health care. While 
their health care system costs much more, the wealthiest of 
Americans are well served by the system.
<P>
	The average income earner in the United States who has to pay 
somewhere between $5,000 and $7,000 a year for coverage that 
is actually less than that in Canada is adequately covered. 
Somewhere between 30 and 40 million Americans have little or 
no health coverage.
<P>
	As a distinguishing factor, what I was pointing out in my 
question was in recognition of that old adage that ``he who pays 
the piper calls the tune''. When one sees the tremendous 
reductions in funding for social programs including health care 
it becomes quite alarming.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12101"> 12101 </A></B>
<P>
	While there is no direct effect on this year's funding for health 
care, the province of British Columbia alone in its cash 
entitlement under the Canada social transfer will be $371 
million less in 1996-97 and $684 million less in 1997-98 than it 
would have been provided under EPF and CAP funding. These 
amounts are in addition to the $180 million negative impact of 
1994 federal budget on transfers. The net effect of this is that in 
1997-98 the entitlement for British Columbia will be $801 
million less than the province received in 1994-95.
<P>
	In summary, because of these massive reductions in transfer 
funding for health care, we have the likelihood of the health care 
system evolving into a patchwork across the country. We will 
have 12 different health care systems. No doubt some of the 
provinces will be able to withstand the offloading more than 
others.
<P>
	The premier of the province of Alberta has indicated an 
interest in extra billing and privatizing a whole number of 
services based on the American model. It is certainly a direction 
that Canadians will not want to take.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, the gist of the hon. member's 
question is concerned about the issue of universality which 
actually has nothing to do with cost.
<P>
	Universality means that we are all eligible for health care 
services regardless of what is our status in terms of 
employability or whether we have chronic illness, chronic 
diseases or not. Accessibility is the one that talks about ability to 
pay.
<P>
	I understand the hon. member's question which is how can we 
continue to support the kind of medicare system that we know, 
based on the five principles of health care, if we do not put 
enough money into it.
<P>
	As he so wisely pointed out, the United States spends 14 per 
cent of its gross national product on health care. Canada spends 
about 10 per cent and Japan spends about 6 per cent. Japan has 
the highest outcomes in health care in the world today. Canada 
ranks third. The United States ranks somewhere between Cuba 
and Czechoslovakia.
<P>
	If we talk about money spent on medical services being the 
only determinant of outcome of health care, we are barking up 
the wrong tree. Money does not equate to outcomes and good 
health status. Many other things drive health status, such as 
poverty, environmental issues and many other issues with which 
we have to concern ourselves.
<P>
	We are committed to health care. Studies have shown, 
especially the recent one from the University of Ottawa, that we 
can have an affordable, much more efficient health care system 
with better outcomes if we make some very real changes. We 
should look at such changes as moving from acute care to 
community care, looking at care closer to home; looking at 
providing core services for continuing care for seniors, looking 
at prevention and health promotion. Many of these things will 
give us better outcomes. This study has shown that we can save  
$7 billion a year on health care payments as a federal 
government and still come up with very good results.
<P>
<B>(1850) </B>
<P>
	We are talking about a time for looking at how we renew our 
system and how we make our system more effective and more 
efficient. We now know of so many ways to manage our system. 
That is what we are talking about in the renewal of health care. 
Those are the changes we want to see.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, what I have to say today reflects upon the inadequate 
responses I have been getting as far as the Wentworth bypass in 
Nova Scotia goes and the money that was transferred by the 
minister of public works to his home riding.
<P>
	I have asked this question four times in the House now. I am 
still not satisfied that the minister is going to be held 
accountable for this. I want to outline for those folks who are 
interested in this particularly serious problem just exactly what 
went on.
<P>
	In 1992-93 there was a program called SHIP, the strategic 
highways improvement program in Nova Scotia. This joint 
program was to upgrade the 100 series highways, the 
Trans-Canada network highways. Under this agreement the 
federal and provincial governments shared in the improvement 
program.
<P>
	What happened on May 11, 1994, according to the Nova 
Scotia auditor general's report, $26 million of these funds were 
diverted from highway 104 to a tourist highway, the 
Fleur-de-Lis trail, which is not a 100 series highway in the 
minister's very own riding in Cape Breton.
<P>
	It happens that the minister and MLA Richie Mann, who I 
believe was Nova Scotia's minister of highways at the time and 
may still be, were both involved in this discussion. I have given 
quotes in the House which substantiate that instance where they 
were involved. They decided to take $26 million out of this 
project and put it toward the Fleur-de-Lis trail.
<P>
	The difficulty many people in the Wentworth, valley area and 
indeed throughout Nova Scotia have is that it is considered one 
of the most dangerous highways in the country. As a person who 
lives in British Columbia, I can tell you there are a lot of 
dangerous highways in this country particularly in the 
mountains. However, this is considered one of the most 
dangerous highways in the country. There have been 40 deaths 
in the last number of years which I spoke about in this House.
<P>
	They diverted the money from this federal-provincial project 
to a road which is basically a tourist area in the minister's riding. 
What does that say about the process? I guess it is up to the 
minister to be held accountable for what he did, but what it says 
<P>

<B><A NAME="12102"> 12102 </A></B>
<P>
to most folks in the Wentworth Valley and the people who have 
to travel through this area is that you care a lot less about the 
lives of the people who travel this highway than about the money 
in your own riding.
<P>
	There is going to be a toll on that highway which is likely to be 
$7 to $10. It will take an hour to drive through that area. What 
have the people ended up with in this whole exercise? It turns 
out that the minister of public works, not the minister of 
highways who has been answering my questions, made a deal 
with a provincial minister who also benefited from it to transfer 
money. Now the people in Wentworth valley are going to pay the 
price for it through tolls.
<P>
	It is inappropriate. I will quote a Liberal member opposite: 
``This is about principles. It is about money that was 
misappropriated. If an agreement like this can be broken then I 
could go in to lobby for something ridiculous somewhere else. It 
is a matter of trust in cost sharing. Someone has to be held 
accountable''. I ask: Why is the minister of public works not 
being held accountable?
<P>
<B>(1855 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, as the Minister of Transport 
has stated repeatedly and clearly, although maybe not for some, 
highways are a provincial responsibility. However, the federal 
government has a longstanding practice of entering into cost 
sharing agreements to provide some level of service.
<P>
	Multi-year programs are often developed with a tentative list 
of projects referenced in the initial agreement. There are myriad 
reasons why the project lists attached to various highway 
agreements change over the life of the agreement.
<P>
	We cannot forecast what may happen as individual projects 
mature. There may be delays due to design problems, 
completing the environmental assessment, changes in 
provincial priorities or cost changes. Virtually all highway 
agreements administered by the federal government change 
during the course of a year.
<P>
	The project list attached to the Nova Scotia agreement was 
developed in early 1993 as part of an initiative to provide a 
stimulus to spur economic growth and job creation.
<P>
	It is worth noting that several provinces are either 
investigating the option or have implemented public-private 
partnerships as a means of advancing projects comparable to the 
highway 104 project.
<P>
	To answer the question of the member with respect to tolls, 
the reality is that the province of Nova Scotia requested a change 
to reallocate some, not all, of the funds to include an allocation 
for the Fleur-de-lis Trail.
<P>
	There are actually two Nova Scotia highway programs. 
Between them approximately $215 million is allocated to route 
104, not an insignificant amount. Route 104 has received a 
tremendous contribution.
<P>
	Two minutes does not allow me time to rebut every aspect of 
the allegations made by the member opposite. It  is important to 
use the time to set forth the basic facts so that the lack of 
substance to the allegations can be seen for what it is: mere 
opportunism.
<P>
	To be perfectly clear, there are always discussions with the 
provinces on transportation issues and project substitutions do 
occur. The member must understand that the provinces spend 
the money and decide on the priority of projects.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="UNEMPLOYMENTINSURANCE">UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE</A></H3>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, we 
can see that a large number of Quebecers going on welfare every 
month, generally 40 per cent of the 5,000 individuals or so who 
join the ranks of welfare recipients, are young people. These 
numbers have increased since last summer. Why is that?
<P>
	Since the government passed Bill C-17, to restrict access to 
unemployment insurance by increasing the qualifying period 
and reducing benefits as well as the numbers of weeks, people 
are suffering from this decision and many end up on welfare. I 
have asked the Minister of Human Resources Development 
repeatedly if he realized that his cuts to UI had particularly dire 
consequences for young people who then have to rely on social 
assistance.
<P>
	The minister indicated that he wanted to move away from the 
passive assistance provided through unemployment insurance 
and toward active assistance. But one should not prevent the 
other. Nothing prevents us from helping young people who do 
not have sufficient training or helping them find a job, but when 
no jobs can be found for those who are already trained-many 
university graduates came to see me at my constituency 
office-why refuse them access to unemployment insurance? 
Why make their first few contacts with the job market more 
difficult because jobs are too short, because employment is 
temporary instead of being stable? Why force young people onto 
welfare?
<P>
	We believe that the government should amend this clause of 
Bill C-17. It makes no sense, because the first contacts that 
young people have with the work force teaches them that they do 
not belong in it. How are the amounts accumulating in the 
unemployment insurance fund being used? In the last budget, an 
accounting trick allowed the government to use these funds to 
reduce the deficit. To a great extent, it is young people and 
women are the ones paying for this deficit reduction move.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="12103"> 12103 </A></B>
<P>
	This is not acceptable in a society like ours, and it is above all 
not acceptable for Quebec, where young people are considered 
the engine, the vital element, because, among other things, they 
will have families and will make it possible for the people of 
Quebec, which is an endangered species in North America, 
counting for barely more than 2 per cent of the population, to 
survive.
<P>
	And now young people are swelling the welfare ranks because 
we have stripped them of even the glimmer of a hope of ever 
finding a job.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, we would agree with the 
hon. member that the situation of young people in Canada is an 
issue that concerns us all. However, we believe it is incorrect to 
assume that most people who leave UI will go on welfare.
<P>
	Employment gains in 1994 reduced new UI claims by some 10 
per cent from 1993 and helped over 200,000 more people get off 
UI without exhausting their benefits. Data for March shows that 
the unemployment rate for Canadian workers 15 to 24 years of 
age has decreased by 2.4 per cent since the government came 
into power. While that is still not an acceptable figure, we intend 
to continue to work on the situation.
<P>
	We are committed to stimulating the creation of employment 
opportunities for youth and taking concrete action. Summer 
employment programs have been redesigned to reinforce 
programs that provide the best results in job creation. The 
student summer job action program, a package of six job 
creation elements that will target the needs of post-secondary 
and senior high school students, will result in the creation of 
44,500 summer jobs. The continuation of the youth internship 
program funding has been increased to $118 million from the 
1994 funding of $25 million. We intend to continue Youth 
Service Canada, with an expected 17,500 participants over three 
years. The funding has increased to $28 million from $25 
million. In addition, we are creating new funding of $15 million 
for Youth Service Canada. Overall, funds for youth programs 
and services for 1995-96 have increased by $43 million.
<P>
	In Quebec, HRD is opening six Canada Employment Centres 
for students on Montreal Island. Approximately 50 students will 
be working in six Canada Employment Centres and 
approximately 7,000 jobs will be posted.
<P>
	Jobs are what Canadian youth needs and jobs are what this 
government is creating for them.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38(5), a motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
have been adopted. Accordingly, the House stands adjourned 
until tomorrow at 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7.04 p.m.)
