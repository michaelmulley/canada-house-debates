	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (for the Minister of Finance, Lib.)</B> 
moved that Bill C-100, an act to amend, enact and repeal certain 
laws relating to financial institutions, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to launch second reading 
debate on Bill C-100. The legislation offers concrete, well 
considered measures to further enhance the safety and soundness of 
Canada's financial system.
<P>
	These measures are the culmination of an extensive consultation 
process. I take this opportunity to extend the government's thanks 
to the many industry participants and other stakeholders who 
provided constructive insightful advice and to the Senate 
committee for its extensive hearings and report. As well I express 
appreciation to the Standing Committee on Finance for its decision 
to hold advance hearings on Bill C-100 during the summer 
parliamentary recess.
<P>
	The presentations received by the committee were invaluable 
groundwork for effective clause by clause review of this wide 
ranging package. It will ensure that the legislation we approve will 
fulfil the best interests of consumers, financial institutions and 
their stakeholders, as well as the Canadian economy.
<P>
	There is no question that sound, secure financial institutions are 
a fundamental requirement for national economic well-being.
<P>
	Canada is blessed with a world class system. The financial sector 
is very much a part of a world of dramatic, accelerating change 
driven by new technology, by surging globalization, by new 
consumer demands and by heightened competition. That is why we 
are introducing the legislation now rather than waiting for the 
mandate in the 1997 review of financial regulations.
<P>
	As I said in many forums, we are acting now not because the 
system is broken, and it surely is not, but to  maintain a dynamic, 
competitive system. We must do our part to help it evolve with 
market trends and respond to recent experiences. That is why Bill 
C-100, dedicated to safety and soundness, responds to our 
experiences with financial institutions that have recently failed.
<P>
	The changes in Bill C-100 are not patchwork nor band-aid 
measures. They flow from a series of basic principles outlined in 
the white paper we issued last February. They include that the 
ownership of a financial institution is a privilege and not a right, 
that it is preferable to have early intervention and resolution of 
institutions experiencing difficulty, that financial institutions must 
operate with sufficient incentives to solve their problems in a 
timely manner, and that there must be appropriate accountability 
and transparency in the system.
<P>
	The first principle, that ownership of a financial institution is a 
privilege and not a right, is virtually a given, but good principles 
are worth reiterating from time to time. More important, we 
believe the principle leads to an important corollary. In certain 
circumstances it may mean that the interests of depositors, 
policyholders and creditors will take priority over the interest of 
shareholders.
<P>
	This is why we believe it is necessary to provide the Office of the 
Superintendent of Financial Institutions, OSFI, with the new 
powers needed to resolve a troubled firm's problems early on. 
Financial institutions need incentives to manage their risks 
adequately. When an institution fails to manage its risks and 
experiences financial difficulty, it is then to the advantage of 
depositors, policyholders and creditors of the company to have the 
situation resolved promptly.
<P>
	This would not necessarily mean that the institution would be 
closed. For example, the institution could develop a plan to 
implement changes that would solve its problems. The simple fact 
is that early resolution is likely the best way to prevent substantial 
losses to depositors, policyholders, creditors and potentially 
shareholders.
<P>
	The legislation stakes out the clear position that if an institution 
is facing difficulty owners do not have the right to continue in 
business until they hit the brick wall and cannot pay liabilities as 
they come due. This leads to another closely related point. Our 
regulatory approach must recognize that the failure of a financial 
institution does not in and of itself represent a failure of the 
supervisory system.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16764"> 16764 </A></B>
<P>
	In a vibrant, competitive marketplace firms can and do fail. No 
system can forestall every institutional failure unless it is given 
the authority and the resources to oversee all management 
decisions and unless institutions are severely restricted in the loans 
and investments they can make. Canada could not afford the price 
of such a failure safe system, even if it did work. My experience 
of almost 40 years in financial institutions clearly indicates to me 
that it would not. However, even if it did work, the result would 
be to strip the industry from contributing to the dynamism, growth 
and evolution of the economy.
<P>
	One final principle is the need for transparency of the 
supervisory system. It is important that financial institutions 
understand the steps authorities could be expected to take if the 
financial condition of an institution deteriorates. Furthermore the 
supervisor must have a clearly defined role.
<P>
<B>(1010 )</B>
<P>
	A new legislative mandate for OSFI notes the importance of 
OSFI taking prompt action to deal with institutions in trouble. The 
guide to intervention we have also set out clarifies the actions that 
could be expected and the role of OSFI and CDIC.
<P>
	I have highlighted the key principles underlying our proposed 
legislation. Let me now turn to some of the specifics of Bill C-100. 
The legislation includes amendments to what are collectively 
referred to as the financial institution statutes including the Bank 
Act, the Trust and Loan Companies Act, the Insurance Companies 
Act and the Co-Operative Credit Associations Act.
<P>
	A key thrust of the new regime as highlighted is to allow the 
superintendent, where circumstances warrant, to take control of a 
troubled institution earlier than at present including the authority to 
close an institution before its capital is depleted.
<P>
	The function of the Minister of Finance will also be affected. He 
or she will no longer have to come to an independent view of the 
solvency of an institution. The legislation places this responsibility 
more appropriately in the hands of the regulator involved with the 
day to day activities of the instutition.
<P>
	Other changes are being made to move responsibility for 
approving matters of a more technical, supervisory nature from the 
minister to the superintendent. The minister, however, will 
continue to play a key controlling part in the process with final 
responsibility to determine whether or not it is in the public interest 
to close an institution.
<P>
	Increasing OSFI's scope for early intervention provides an 
incentive for problem prevention, not just a means of resolution. 
Under the proposed legislation troubled financial institutions will 
understand that OSFI will take action if its concerns are not dealt 
with promptly.
<P>
	Another important element of Bill C-100 deals with information, 
which is a critical commodity for effective public and regulatory 
decision making. That is why we are amending the statutes to 
facilitate the release by federal financial institutions and by OSFI 
of more information on the financial condition of institutions. I do 
not, however, believe that financial institutions or OSFI should 
disclose information regarding regulatory actions. Doing so could 
create self-fulfilling prophecies with detrimental consequences for 
the institutions.
<P>
	I emphasize that OSFI's role is not and cannot be to mirco 
manage financial institutions. Nor do we deploy an army of 
examiners to scrutinize federal financial institutions. That is why 
we must place constant emphasis on corporate governance. The 
boards of directors are on the frontlines ensuring problem 
prevention and good management. Bill C-100 takes important steps 
to strengthen the effective, independent corporate governance that 
is a vital part of strong, prudential framework.
<P>
	First, the legislation proposes that the superintendent will have 
the power to designate certain directors as affiliated for purposes of 
the requirement that one-third of directors of an institution be 
unaffiliated.
<P>
	Second, the legislation proposes changes that will prevent the 
board of a financial institution from being identical to an 
unregulated parent firm. This will help ensure there are directors of 
a regulated institution who will focus primarily on the institution's 
interests.
<P>
	Third, the legislation will empower the superintendent to veto 
the appointment of directors and senior officers of troubled 
institutions.
<P>
	Legislative amendments are being made for insurance 
companies so that the superintendent can employ the services of an 
external actuary at the company's expense in certain 
circumstances. There will also be a separation of the function of 
corporate chief actuary from certain other executive positions to 
avoid potential conflicts. OSFI will have the explicit authority to 
develop standards of sound business and financial practices for 
insurance companies.
<P>
	Now let me turn to the amendments that Bill C-100 makes to the 
Winding-up Act. As part of the early intervention policy these 
amendments will provide additional grounds for obtaining a 
winding-up order for a financial institution.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	The act is also being amended to provide more flexibility to 
restructure, under court supervision, the affairs of insurance 
companies in liquidation. As a result of these provisions a 
liquidator will have greater scope to enhance the value within the 
estate and improve recovery of assets disposed of by the liquidator, 
all of which will go to the benefit of policy holders.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16765"> 16765 </A></B>
<P>
	The principal changes are designed to provide for earlier closure 
of problem federal financial institutions in cases where this would 
reduce the loss to consumer stakeholders.
<P>
	I will touch on a third area of action under Bill C-100, the 
amendments to the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act, or 
the CDIC act. This is another aspect of our emphasis on the 
principle of incentives for timely problem solving. The act is being 
amended to allow the CDIC to develop a system of varying 
premiums on member institutions based on the risk rating of 
specific firms, reflecting the risk they could bring to the deposit 
insurance fund.
<P>
	The risk rating would provide a clear signal from the CDIC to 
the company's board of directors and management concerning the 
level of risk. More important, such an approach will recognize 
firms for good management.
<P>
	As well, the government is making changes that will allow the 
CDIC to act as receiver of an unhealthy member institution's assets 
and to sell those assets along with a package of liabilities to a 
healthy institution. This should permit CDIC to obtain more value 
than it would if the institution was liquidated and its assets sold.
<P>
	I want to turn to a final important area of change proposed by 
Bill C-100, which is one dealing with transactions between 
financial institutions here in Canada and with the rest of the world.
<P>
	Through this legislation we are proposing a new act, the payment 
clearings and settlement act. It is designed to ensure that major 
clearing and settlement systems for financial transactions are 
designed and operated properly.
<P>
	By the term ``properly'' we are addressing two clear concrete 
objectives. The first objective is to reduce or eliminate systemic 
risk to the Canadian financial system by ensuring that the failure of 
one participant in a clearing system will not lead to a domino effect 
by bringing down other members of a group. Second, it will 
enhance the international competitiveness of Canada's clearing and 
settlement systems.
<P>
	The key components of the legislation are as follows. They will 
give the Bank of Canada explicit powers in the oversight of 
clearing and settlement systems that are potential sources of 
systemic risk. Again I emphasize systemic risk. Systems 
designated by the bank would be subject to bank oversight.
<P>
	Second, they will provide the Bank of Canada with the capacity 
to participate in aspects of these clearing and settlements, such as 
the large value transfer system, or LVTS, as well as to serve special 
functions, such as guaranteeing settlement.
<P>
	Third, they will give statutory recognition to netting 
arrangements in payments and other clearing and settlement 
systems in order to ensure that Canadian  participants in derivative 
markets have greater certainty that their transactions will close. 
This will ultimately mitigate systemic risk.
<P>
	I want to dispel concerns raised by the Quebec government last 
August. Systemic risk is an issue internationally and it is the 
central banks that have led in the development of measures to deal 
with systemic risk concerns in various fora, such as the Bank for 
International Settlements, the BIS.
<P>
	Let me be very clear. The proposed federal legislation is not 
aimed at, nor will it result in, the regulation of securities markets. 
The focus of the Bank of Canada's oversight role is very different 
from that of the provinces. It does not in any way infringe on any 
province's jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1020 )</B>
<P>
	I have talked at some length because this legislation covers much 
ground and deals with important issues. I believe Bill C-100 will 
help Canada's financial sector preserve and improve its world class 
stature to the benefit of all stakeholders and all Canadian citizens.
<P>
	The measures we have proposed strike a critical balance between 
on the one hand, protecting the rights of depositors, policyholders 
and creditors and, on the other hand, facilitating innovation and 
growth in economic activity.
<P>
	Canadians expect the government to ensure that their hard 
earned savings and investments will be well protected. The 
legislation will ensure we have the best and most efficient 
regulatory system, one that recognizes the interests of 
policyholders, depositors and creditors as well as one that promotes 
dynamic economic growth.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise on the subject of Bill C-100, an act to 
amend, enact and repeal certain laws relating to financial 
institutions. Permit me first to say that the Bloc Quebecois 
disagrees with three aspects of Bill C-100.
<P>
	The objectives of the bill are highly laudable, particularly the 
one aimed at reducing the potential for systemic risk-the creation 
of the domino effect-within financial circles. For those who are 
not familiar with these financial terms, there is potential for 
systemic risk when one financial institution is unable to meet its 
obligations and drags the entire financial sector along with it. It is a 
sort of domino effect where one institution is unable to pay another, 
the other cannot pay the next, and so on. In short, we end up with a 
financial catastrophe such as we saw recently in western Canada.
<P>
	Reducing the potential for systemic risk is highly laudable. 
However, when it serves as a pretext to slip through the back door 
into exclusive provincial jurisdiction, and specifically that of 
Quebec, it is no longer acceptable. I refer here to the securities 
sector.  Securities do not escape from the application of the new 
provisions on financial institutions. Under subsection 92(13) of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16766"> 16766 </A></B>
<P>
Constitution Act, 1982, jurisdiction over the securities sector is a 
matter for the provinces, for the Government of Quebec.
<P>
	This jurisdiction, based on the Government of Quebec's 
exclusive powers over property and civil rights, was confirmed by 
the case law of the Supreme Court of Canada, which added 
provincial regulation of the securities market to property and civil 
rights. It has been clear since 1982. Now the bill is directly 
targeting the field of securities.
<P>
	This is strange. We are barely over a constitutional debate, a 
referendum campaign, in which our colleagues opposite argued: 
``Yes, we will make certain changes to the system. Yes, we will 
respect Quebec's jurisdiction. Yes, we will have a good 
understanding in the future''. This is what they told Quebecers, 
they said: ``If you vote no to Quebec sovereignty, things will go 
well, you will see''. A few weeks after the result, Quebec is being 
treated with arrogance and cynicism with the tabling of a bill such 
as Bill C-100.
<P>
	What is more, this bill, in addition to invading Quebec's 
exclusive jurisdiction, accords unheard of powers to the Bank of 
Canada and the Department of Finance.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	I am referring to the provisions on pages 117 and 118 of the bill, 
which stipulate that the Bank of Canada may enter into an 
agreement with a clearing house or a participant, or both, in respect 
of: netting arrangements; risk sharing and risk control 
mechanisms; certainty of settlement and finality of payment; the 
nature of financial arrangements among participants; the 
operational systems and financial soundness of the clearing house.
<P>
	In addition, the Directives section of the bill provides that, and I 
quote: ``Where the Governor of the Bank is of the opinion that a 
clearing house or participant is engaging in or is about to engage in 
any act, omission or course of conduct that results or is likely to 
result in systemic risk being inadequately controlled-the excuse 
of systemic risk, or-that the designated clearing and settlement 
system in respect of the clearing house or participant is operating 
or is about to operate in a way that results or is likely to result in 
systemic risk being inadequately controlled, the Governor may 
issue a directive in writing-not a proposal or suggestion but a 
written directive-to the clearing house or participant requiring it 
to cease or refrain from engaging in the act, omission or course of 
conduct, and perform such acts as in the opinion of the Governor 
are necessary to remedy the situation''.
<P>
	Do you know what this means? It means that the Governor of the 
Bank of Canada could issue directives  not only to clearing houses 
but also to participating institutions telling them how to conduct 
their business. It means that, if the institution is a participant, as 
specified in this provision, the Governor of the Bank of Canada 
could tell this institution what to do; it makes no difference whether 
this institution is a provincially chartered bank or a player in the 
securities industry.
<P>
	Under this bill, the Governor of the Bank of Canada may issue 
directives to a clearing house or a participant. This means that he 
could-he has the authority to do so-issue directives to an 
institution like Fiducie Desjardins, Lévesque Beaubien Geoffrion 
and Leclerc, and Desjardins' central branches for example. These 
are all provincially chartered institutions in the securities industry. 
Such an invasion is unacceptable.
<P>
	I would say that this invasion is even worse than the recent 
federal invasion in the area of manpower training for example. It is 
worse in the sense that it touches one of Quebec's sacred cows. It 
touches an area under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Government 
of Quebec, as recognized in the Constitution imposed on us by the 
current Prime Minister in 1982.
<P>
	It takes a great deal of self-righteousness and cynicism to do 
something like that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Thank you for your generosity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> I can hear my Liberal colleagues, and the Liberal 
whip in particular, scoff at the arguments we are putting forward.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Not at the document, at you.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> I would tell the hon. member that his friend Daniel 
Johnson, in Quebec, Daniel Johnson himself took offence at this 
federal invasion. Daniel Johnson himself wrote to the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, because he found appalling that a bill 
has been on the table since last year to invade one of Quebec's 
areas of jurisdiction.
<P>
	So, Mr. Speaker, when even strong federalists like Daniel 
Johnson, like the government whip who scoffs at the arguments we 
put forward, take a stand similar to ours, this goes to show that 
there is major consensus on this issue in Quebec.
<P>
	It is a unfortunate that the people across the way show this kind 
of an attitude. Instead of listening to our arguments and amendment 
proposals concerning the bill, they poke fun at us. Such an attitude 
is unacceptable in this House, and it has been going on for about a 
month, since the referendum campaign has been over.
<P>
	I do not know if you can do something about it, Mr. Speaker, but 
I would really like our friends opposite to listen to what we are 
suggesting instead of acting like they are this morning, throwing 
arguments without substance at us and mocking us.
<P>
	Can you call for order, please, Mr. Speaker? He is making me 
lose my concentration.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16767"> 16767 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Sometimes the House gets 
somewhat animated and that is understandable. However, 
following the request made by the hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, I am asking for the co-operation of the 
House, so that members who have the floor can speak in an 
atmosphere of mutual respect.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier: </B>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It is rather unusual to see 
a whip get involved at this stage.
<P>
	I was mentioning the powers given to the Bank of Canada 
regarding clearing and settlement houses. Let me quote the brief 
recently submitted by the Quebec securities commission: ``The 
powers given to the Bank of Canada regarding the clearing and 
settlement system would constitute an infringement on the 
authority given by the Quebec legislator to the securities 
commission. Most of the powers given to the Bank of Canada are a 
replica of those delegated to the Quebec securities commission 
more than 10 years ago. The only difference is that the Bank of 
Canada's authority, as provided in the schedule to Bill C-100, is 
based on a desire to control the systemic risk by invoking the 
national interest, while the authority of the commission relates to 
the overall market regulations''.
<P>
	If we look at the bill, we see, given the schedule and the new 
powers delegated to the Bank of Canada, that the bank, through its 
authority to give directives to a clearing house and a participant, 
does exactly the same as the securities commission. For example, 
under Bill C-100, the Bank of Canada would exercise powers 
which are an integral part of the authority given to the securities 
commission, such as giving clearing houses and their participants 
directives akin to an order to do or not do something. Such power is 
given to the Quebec securities commission through its 
incorporating act.
<P>
	``Since the Bank of Canada should be informed of any change in 
the internal regulations and rules of operation of the clearing 
houses, this means that it exerts a supervisory power over these 
changes. The Commission des valeurs mobilières also has the 
power to approve these modifications. Finally, the Bank of Canada 
is empowered to inspect clearing houses, which duplicates the 
power assigned to the Commission''. This is a quote from the 
Commission des valeurs mobilières.
<P>
	Not only, then, is there encroachment on an area of jurisdiction 
that belongs exclusively to Quebec, but they have also taken the 
luxury of creating duplication and overlap in times of austerity 
budgets, after all we have heard from across the way in that 
connection. After hearing the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs, the Prime Minister himself even, saying that action will be 
taken to reduce duplication and overlap, now we are presented with 
a bill that does exactly that, creates a double structure, a double 
role, which encroaches on an area of Quebec jurisdiction, which 
makes institutions  such as the Bank of Canada duplicate the work 
of others. It is inadmissible and nearly unbelievable on the one 
hand, and on the other it creates flagrant inefficiency through 
overlapping of resources in the area of financial institutions.
<P>
	As for systemic risk, as I have said, we agree with the objective 
of reducing it. It is a most praiseworthy objective and one shared by 
all nations throughout the world. It is, however, a false pretext for 
giving such a broad and powerful mandate to the Bank of Canada, 
particularly in an area of jurisdiction that belongs exclusively to 
Quebec, securities.
<P>
	All that the government could do to reduce systemic risks would 
be to improve what is called the large value transfer system, by 
putting into place an electronic clearing system which will ensure 
the final character of the clearing transaction, and will make it 
possible to pay out, perhaps not immediately, but within the day. If 
the Secretary of State is familiar with such a system-and I am not 
convinced that he is all that familiar with it, judging by the 
responses he gave to the finance committee, but let us assume his 
familiarity-this was specifically one of the recommendations by 
the internationally renowned group of 30. This was precisely what 
they said in 1989, that it was necessary to implement and perfect a 
large value transfer system, so as to reduce the systemic risks on 
the financial market.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	This recommendation by the Group of Thirty was so good that 
the Governor of the Bank of Canada, speaking to members of the 
financial community this summer before he appeared before the 
finance committee on August 15, acknowledged that it was enough 
to improve the large value transfer system in order to reduce, and in 
fact, if I remember correctly, he did not say reduce, he said 
eliminate, in referring to the most ambitious risk taking that went 
on, more ambitious than most people are prepared to undertake. In 
other words, to eliminate systemic risks, all we had to do was 
improve the large value transfer system.
<P>
	There is no need to intrude in the jurisdictions of the 
Government of Quebec. There is no need to give the Governor of 
the Bank of Canada extraordinary powers to issue directives to 
provincial chartered institutions involved in the securities sector. 
There is no need to create unnecessary friction between the federal 
government and the Quebec government. All we have to do is 
improve the large value transfer system. That is all.
<P>
	So why does it again boil down to encroaching on one of 
Quebec's jurisdictions? Why give the Governor of the Bank of 
Canada considerable powers and take away from the Government 
of Quebec its power to control the development of the securities 
sector? Why?
<P>
	Again, I put this question to the Governor of the Bank of Canada 
on August 15, but I did not get an answer. I  asked him about the 
difference between the speech he made before the finance commit-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16768"> 16768 </A></B>
<P>
tee and the one he made this summer, when he said: ``I do not need 
additional powers; all I need is a better large value transfer 
system''. The debate became very political, and I agreed with the 
Governor of the Bank of Canada that his role was not that of a 
politician. However, I think everyone realized that the federal 
government was again trying to centralize all powers, including 
prerogatives explicitely recognized under the Constitution Act, 
1982.
<P>
	In fact, as I pointed out earlier, this is not sovereignists against 
federalists, it is simply a matter of common sense and respecting 
the prerogatives of Quebec as conferred on the province by the 
Constitution. So much so that on February 16, 1994, when the 
federal government's intentions with respect to financial 
institutions were already known, and the bill was already on the 
table, not the bill as such but the proposals to invade the securities 
sector, Daniel Johnson, the Premier at the time who was to be 
Premier for a short while yet, wrote to the President of the Privy 
Council and the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, the hon. 
member for Hull-Aylmer, to tell them that he disagreed with the 
bill.
<P>
	With your permission, Mr. Speaker, I will quote what he said: 
``Perhaps I may remind you, first of all that the Government of 
Quebec has never supported an expanded federal role in the 
securities sector, which is the exclusive responsibility of the 
provinces''. This is not Mr. Campeau or Mrs. Marois but Daniel 
Johnson when he was Premier of Quebec. I will continue: ``In fact, 
it has regularly indicated it was opposed''-strong language for 
Mr. Johnson-``to federal initiatives in this respect, as were several 
other provinces regarding the recent reform of federal legislation 
on financial institutions, which came into force in June 1992''.
<P>
	I will continue this quote from Mr. Johnson's letter: ``In the 
quinquennial report she tabled in the National Assembly last 
December, the minister responsible for finance reiterated Quebec's 
concerns about the federal bill to regulate the securities sector 
which would be part of this legislation. She stressed that federal 
regulations would be inappropriate, both constitutionally and from 
the point of view of efficiency''. This still according toMr. Johnson, a staunch federalist, who in this letter warned the 
federal government against meddling with the securities sector, 
which is Quebec's exclusive responsibility.
<P>
	To continue with the letter from Mr. Johnson, who is still a 
federalist today: ``Such regulations would mean duplicating both 
existing regulations and the supervision involved and would 
inevitably add to the administrative and financial burden on 
issuers, investors and intermediaries''. Mr. Johnson goes on to say 
the following: ``If the purpose is to reduce duplication and improve 
efficiency, it seems to me it hardly makes sense to create a new 
structure and additional regulations''.
<P>
	As I said before, if the Bloc Quebecois and Daniel Johnson 
agree, it is because a broad consensus exists in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	The federal government must amend its bill in order to withdraw 
from the area of securities which is a field of exclusive jurisdiction 
for the Quebec government. This is the unanimous feeling in 
Quebec. It must not invade this area. It must not give the Governor 
of the Bank of Canada and the Minister of Finance new powers to 
issue directives not only to clearing houses, but also to 
participating institutions or establishments.
<P>
	It must not give the Governor of the Bank of Canada powers to 
issue directives to the Fiducie Desjardins, for instance, or Lévesque 
Beaubien Geoffrion and Leclerc, or the Caisses centrales 
Desjardins. This is none of its business. This is the Bloc's position 
in this matter.
<P>
	The Quebec finance minister is still waiting for an answer to a 
letter he sent the Minister of Finance on August 15. No abuses. The 
Quebec government does not need the kind of abuse it got from the 
Minister of Finance the day after he received the letter. All the 
Quebec government wants is explanations, assurances and changes 
to Bill C-100.
<P>
	To this day, these basic requests have remained unanswered on 
the part of the federal government. This is not normal, especially 
since federalists claim to be open to reforms and willing to foster 
greater harmony between Quebec and the federal government, and 
eliminate inefficiencies and duplications. Between words and 
actions, there is a big gap, not to say a huge discrepancy.
<P>
	There are two other aspects of the bill which annoy the official 
opposition. The second aspect of Bill C-100 with which Quebec 
has a serious problem is clause 133, the clause dealing with the 
Winding-up Act. The notion of insolvency is broadened-we 
acknowledge that it is an area of exclusive federal 
jurisdiction-but by widening it, once again the federal does not 
take into account the role of a major player in Quebec, namely the 
inspector general of Quebec financial institutions.
<P>
	I can hear them laughing and mocking on the other side. This is 
the kind of reaction we have been getting for the last month 
whenever we tell the truth. the pretence of wanting to increase 
stability and reduce uncertainty in the financial sector, they added a 
player and thereby added the possibility for dispute by institutions 
which could be found wanting by Quebec's Inspecteur général des 
institutions financières.
<P>
	That opens the door to disputes which could go all the way to the 
Supreme Court. Let me give you an example. If the inspector 
general sees that an institution is not fulfilling its obligations and 
issues directives that it must follow, and then that institution, given 
the new bill, the new provisions respecting the Winding-up Act, 
decides to  ignore these directives, it will have the possibility to do 
so because the bill adds some ambiguity, it adds another player 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16769"> 16769 </A></B>
<P>
whose objectives and powers are exactly the same as those of the 
Inspecteur général des institutions financières.
<P>
	Therefore, they say they want to increase the predictability of the 
financial market, that they want to eliminate uncertainty and 
reduce systemic risk, but they are adding another element which 
could interfere with the decisions and the orientations of Quebec's 
Inspecteur général des institutions financières.
<P>
	If that is what they mean by reducing uncertainties, increasing 
stability, we are no longer on Earth. We are on another planet. With 
this bill, the federal government is stretching the notion of 
insolvency, it is creating uncertainty on the financial market and 
ambiguity in the evolution of institutions in the financial sector 
which could adversely affect the proper operations of these 
institutions.
<P>
	This will not improve anything, this bill does not propose 
improvements. What the bill proposes, I tell you, is quite harmful. 
At a time when financial institutions, as everybody knows, need 
stability and certainty, a federal bill is adding uncertainty to the 
market. It is adding a nebulous provision which will deny the 
Quebec Inspecteur général des institutions financières his 
exclusive role, his directives will no longer be exclusive. Which 
directives will financial institutions abide by? Those of the Quebec 
inspector general or those issued by the federal government under 
Bill C-100?
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	The financial sector can do without such ambiguous situations. It 
is hard enough to manage in this sector without possible challenges 
over the role of the Quebec Inspecteur général des institutions 
financières and without added uncertainty.
<P>
	There is also a third aspect of the bill which raises questions, and 
this will be my last point. It is on page 11 of the bill where it says: 
``from now on, premiums payable to the Canada Deposit Insurance 
Corporation will be based on a risk factor assessed by the 
institutions''. The principle may be excellent, but once again, they 
are disregarding a Quebec institution in the area of securities called 
the Régie de l'assurance-dépôt du Québec, which did not consider 
necessary to implement this kind of system and was never 
consulted on the rating system that the federal government is trying 
to implement through the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation.
<P>
	We have mixed feelings about this new rating system which will 
set the rate which will apply to a given institution following a risk 
analysis. Let us take for example Fiducie Desjardins; it is just an 
example, but let us take this one. About 95 per cent of its deposits 
are from Quebec and only 5 per cent from the rest of  Canada. With 
this bill, the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation would be 
empowered to give Fiducie Desjardins a bond rating on 5 per cent 
of its deposits on a Canadian basis. It would issue a rating on only 5 
per cent of its deposits.
<P>
	By issuing a rating on 5 per cent of deposits, this rating becomes 
a signal for all financial markets, including in Quebec. This signal 
can be as private as the one given by ratings from agencies such as 
Moody's, Standard &amp; Poor, Dominion Bond Rating and Canadian 
Bond Rating. If this rating becomes public-and there is a risk that 
it will-, that would mean that Fiducie Desjardins, which would 
have been rated according to the risk associated with 5 per cent of 
its deposits, would be given this rating for all its deposits. In other 
words, that would become a risk signal for 100 per cent of 
Desjardins' deposits. And that risk is very real.
<P>
	These are the three aspects that I wanted to underline and for 
which we did not get a satisfying answer from the government 
when Bill C-100 was tabled this summer. We hope that the analysis 
that the official opposition has just made will result in valuable 
answers from the government and that, when Bill C-100 is 
examined clause by clause, the government will propose 
amendments to assure us that, first of all, Quebec's exclusive 
jurisdiction, that is its securities sector, will be respected.
<P>
	Second, that no extraordinary powers be granted to the Governor 
of the Bank of Canada just to reduce the systemic risks of issuing 
guidelines to the clearing houses and the participating institutions. 
So, that no new powers be granted that would directly infringe 
upon the powers of the Quebec Securities Commission.
<P>
	We should also get rid of the new role given to the Deposit 
Insurance Corporation that could lead to an increase in financial 
market concentration and also to a rating that would apply to all 
deposits made in Quebec institutions, but not to the deposits made 
elsewhere in Canada.
<P>
	Third, that the extension of the concept of insolvency should not 
be used to disregard the role of the superintendent of financial 
institutions in Quebec.
<P>
	So, these are the three provisions that bother us and we will try 
hard to urge the government to amend them. We hope that the 
government will respond to these three objections made not only 
by the official opposition, but also by the Government of Quebec 
and even the leader of the opposition at the National Assembly, 
Daniel Johnson.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	If the government does not amend the bill in this manner, we 
shall move, during clause by clause consideration of the bill, some 
amendments to Bill C-100 that will meet respond to these 
objections.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
expressions of the Bloc member are an absolute classic example to 
the House and to all Canadians that Her Majesty's Loyal 
Opposition fundamentally represents or thinks that it represents 25 
per cent of the people resident in Canada.
<P>
	I took particular note of the fact that the prairie provinces, 
British Columbia, Ontario and the Atlantic provinces somehow 
were completely apart from any concern of the so-called official 
opposition. I find that exceptionally unfortunate.
<P>
	For the duration of this Parliament the Reform Party has been the 
national opposition. I will be responding to the bill in light of our 
concern on behalf of all Canadians no matter where they live, 
including in the province of Quebec.
<P>
	I should like to put on the record the Reform Party understanding 
of the bill. It brings amendments to the Bank Act, Co-Operative 
Credit Associations Act, Insurance Act and Trust and Loan 
Companies Act dealing with first, the disclosure of information; 
second, the elimination of appeals in relation to certain matters; 
third, the disqualification of persons from becoming officeholders 
in an institution; fourth, the taking of control of an institution by 
the Superintendent of Financial Institutions; and, fifth, changes to 
the duties of the superintendent.
<P>
	There are also amendments to the Winding-up Act respecting, 
first, the circumstances and procedures for winding up an 
institution and, second, a revised part III dealing with the 
restructuring of insurance companies. There are also amendments 
to the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act. It is this area that 
I will be addressing in the balance of my speech.
<P>
	Continuing with our observations, the amendments to CDIC 
concern, first, the business affairs of the corporation; second, the 
restructuring of institutions by means of vesting of shares and the 
corporation becoming a receiver; third, the assessment and 
collection of deposit insurance premiums; and, fourth, the 
enforcement of the act.
<P>
	As I mentioned, the amendments to the Canada Deposit 
Insurance Corporation Act is the primary concern of the Reform 
Party. The bill is as a result of the government's review of the 
safety of financial institutions. It follows upon failures of a number 
of financial institutions and is the government's response to 
concerns regarding financial institutions. We also note that the bill 
is a prelude to the Bank Act review scheduled for 1997 that 
promises to be much wider in scope.
<P>
	I have been approached in my office by a number of people with 
respect to the Bank Act review. There is much concern on the part 
of businesses with respect to  the encroachment or the potential 
further encroachment of the chartered banks into the insurance 
business. I look forward to the review in 1997.
<P>
	As I noted at the start of my speech, the Bloc Quebecois is being 
irresponsible in its position as official opposition in that it is very 
myopic in taking a look at the concerns of only 25 per cent of 
Canada's citizens, but I would be remiss if I did not make some 
comments about the government.
<P>
	The bill we are speaking to today is important. It concerns the 
fundamentals of controlling money or at least the affairs 
surrounding money. Money as the medium of exchange whether it 
be in Canada or around the world must have government control. 
We respect that the act is of some value. However, in the context of 
all other legislation or non-legislation the government has been 
bringing forward and the way it keeps taking us as parliamentarians 
through a void of any meaningful legislation, the act although 
important to Canadians is yet another way of getting around the 
fact that we should be getting on with other affairs that are 
important to Canadians rather than simply wasting time on 
housekeeping issues.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	I do not suggest that the act is a waste of time. I am just saying 
that it falls into the context of avoiding any review of UI, for 
example. There are all sorts of leaks to the press about what will be 
happening with UI and about items promised by the government 
over the last two years about which nothing has happened.
<P>
	Speaking specifically to the bill, there is a very little difference 
between the thought processes of the Liberals and the 
Conservatives. Liberal, Tory, same old story. The same kind of 
thought processes would come from the either of the old line 
parties. The Liberals are trying to engineer results of the gain. With 
the act, particularly as it relates to the Canada Deposit Insurance 
Corporation, they are continuing to attempt to interfere in the 
natural process in the marketplace. Liberals, as was the case with 
the Conservatives, want to engineer the results of the gain. They 
want to make the rules of the game such that they can ensure what 
the results will be.
<P>
	Basically this imposes external and extraneous pressure on an 
international commodity such as the trading medium of money. It 
brings values into the marketplace that would not be there if it were 
not for blatant government interference, as is shown in its 
proposals relative to the CDIC.
<P>
	It makes me think a lot of the way that the Liberals and their 
predecessors, the Tories, have gone about interfering in the 
marketplace in the area of regional development and regional 
development grants. There is an absolute parallel between regional 
development and the way they are looking at the CDIC 
amendments.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="16771"> 16771 </A></B>
<P>
	In regional development we see countless Canadian dollars 
going into marketplaces under western economic diversification, 
FORD-Q, ACOA or any other program. The Canadian taxpayers' 
money squandered through these programs basically ends up 
distorting the marketplace. Why? It is because most frequently 
they end up supporting non-competitive companies that cannot 
make it on their own. There is no natural cleansing process to the 
marketplace. The biggest problem that creates is distortion or 
disadvantage for the firms that are competitive.
<P>
	It is tremendously ironic that the competitive, healthy firms are 
paying the taxes. Their taxes are being taken in by big government, 
by the Liberals, and in turn are being put into firms that are less 
competitive, thereby creating competition for the firms that are 
competitive. The bottom line is that it costs taxpayers lots and lots 
of money.
<P>

hon. member, but it being 11 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 30 
the House will now proceed to Statements by Members pursuant to

Speaker, we learned this week that the leader of the separatists will 
soon be leaving the House to become the anointed premier of 
Quebec. Constituents in my riding will be happy to see his 
anti-Canada rhetoric exiting the House.
<P>
	Meanwhile, the other 52 Bloc members appear to be in for the 
long haul. After all, they did vote in favour of the MPs pension plan 
and they are very comfortable sitting here receiving their federal 
salaries and their federal perks at the expense of the Canadian

<P>
	Most Canadians are sickened at seeing the separatists continue to 
sit in the House. They have every right to feel that way, because the 
Bloc is committed to the destruction of Canada.

<P>
	Regrettably, the regiment failed to receive honours for the unit's 
final two battles when scrolls were presented to Canadian military 
units in 1951. The oversight was recently detected, and scrolls 
citing exceptional conduct and courage at the Battle of Kusten 
Canal in April 1945 and the Battle of Bad Zwisehenahn in May 
1945 were presented at a reunion for veterans.

	Seventy-two men of the regiment died and approximately a 
hundred more were wounded in these two campaigns. These two 
scrolls recognizing the regiment's efforts in these two very intense 
battles during the closing days of the war are proudly placed on the 
armoury wall beside 16 others.

	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, CP Rail's 
move enlightens us on the lack of ethics shown by the no side 
during the referendum campaign. They told Quebecers that a yes 
vote could lead to a move by CP Rail when the decision had already 
been made for business purposes only. And two days ago, the 
Prime Minister added insult to injury when he blamed 
sovereignists for the move of CP Rail's head office.
<P>
	To have the Prime Minister tell us that Quebec's economic 
problems are caused by the sovereignist movement is an insult to 
all Quebecers who work hard to build a strong Quebec.
<P>
	The Prime Minister should stop playing politics on the back of 
Quebecers and support them by addressing the real problems. After 
all, he is the Prime Minister of all Canadians, including the 49.4 per 
cent of Quebecers who voted yes in the referendum.

	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the government spoke with pride about what a 
great price it is getting for CN Rail shares and how selling them in 
foreign countries helped to increase that price. What really helped 
to increase the share price was the amount by which the 
government reduced CN's debt.
<P>
	In committee the government talked about reducing CN's debt 
by approximately $1 billion and that very little if any would 
actually come from the Canadian taxpayer. In reality, the 
government reduced CN's debt by $1.4 billion, and all of it came 
from the taxpayer except for what can be realized from the sale of 
non-rail real estate assets with a book value of $235 million and no 
appraisal to the contrary.
<P>
	This pay-down may well have contributed to the enhanced share 
price. However, if the government is going to use Canadians' tax 
dollars to enhance the value of shares, should it not have offered 
the first chance of those shares to Canadians? As it now stands, 40 
per cent of those shares are being sold outside of Canada, despite 
the fact there appears to be sufficient interest inside Canada. If this 
government is going to continue to run huge deficits, at least let 
Canadians be the beneficiary of that debt.

The lack of a comprehensive forestry policy has resulted in sit-ins,

week long demonstrations, and lawsuits. Surely this has to be a 
wake-up call that all is not well.
<P>
	The only positive thing that can be said about the federal 
government's handling of this issue is that its ineptness has 
managed to unite the politicians of all parties, First Nations, 
loggers, and a very large percentage of the population. It should do 
so well on national unity.
<P>
	Northern affairs has managed to introduce casino logging by 
calling three lotteries for timber permits and then cancelling them. 
It has not instituted the promised forestry advisory committee on 
reforestation and has caused unnecessary expenditures by both 
First Nations and taxpayers for failing to foresee the possibility of 
legal action.
<P>
	The minister of Indian and northern affairs must take charge, do 
a full review of the management of northern affairs in Yukon, and 
institute immediately a full and public review of forest policy.

	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, recently the industry committee and Canada's major 
banks agreed to a set of small business lending standards that will 
benefit all Canadians. This represents progress for the small 
business men and women in this country. It is an example of what 
can be accomplished  when industry officials and federal 
politicians work together to achieve change.
<P>
	Small business constituents can now insist their lenders adhere 
to a code of conduct. They can take advantage of an alternative 
dispute resolution system. They can take complaints to an internal 
ombudsman, and if they are still not satisfied they will now have 
access to an independent industry-wide ombudsman as well. 
Finally, every three months parliamentarians will see the banks' 
small business borrowing statistics. These standardized statistics 
will be our tool to monitor progress.

	To paraphrase a famous quote, this is not the end of ensuring that 
the banks will live up to their responsibilities. It is not even the

stated that the quality of the material makes it acceptable for 
on-land use as aggregate, but it is not acceptable for open water 
disposal. The proponent will be separating and saving the larger 
grain size material, while discharging the fine silts and clays back 
into Lake Ontario. In our view, this is open water disposal. 
Environment Canada also found that the sediment plume 
modelling, as conducted by the proponent's consultants, was

other hand, these transfers account for only three per cent of the 
provinces' revenues.
<P>
	We made deeper cuts to our own expenditures on goods and 
services than to transfers to the provinces. Saskatchewan and New 
Brunswick have been able to balance their budgets while taking 
into account the new federal transfer payments. The Quebec 
government is lagging behind, because of all the energy it is putting 
into separation plans and referenda. In view of the fact that the 
transfer cuts contemplated amount to only a few percentage points 
of provincial revenues, is it fair to say that actions taken by the 
federal government are solely responsible for provincial cuts to 
come?

<P>
	May I ask today before we begin that hon. members cut back a

INTERGOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the phoney 
committee that was set up in a mad rush to save the face of a 
government that is incapable of keeping the Prime Minister's 
promises, this phoney committee headed by the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs has now started its work and apparently 
has sent a progress report to the Prime Minister's office.
<P>
	Since this report is supposedly essential to the survival of 
Canada, does the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs who chairs 
the phoney committee intend to release this report, so that 
Canadians can look at the recommendations?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I am delighted with the interest the hon. member for 
Roberval has shown in this committee, which is of course a 
contradiction of his preliminary remarks since, as I said before, the 
ultimate phoney committee is the regional commissions that were 
set up in Quebec for the benefit of partisan members only.
<P>
	In this case, we have set up a committee of ministers who report 
to the Prime Minister and whose statements are confidential. If the 
Prime Minister feels it is appropriate to publish the 
recommendations, he will do so.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, here is my 
supplementary.
<P>
	Are we to understand that the minister refuses to release any 
recommendations or clarifications of any kind with respect to the 
proceedings of this committee? Perhaps he prefers not to embarrass 
his friends on the No committee, the provincial Liberals who are 
meeting in Quebec City on the weekend and who would otherwise 
realize that the minister and the government have strictly nothing 
to offer Quebecers.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, last Tuesday, the Leader of the Official Opposition was 
asked this question:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
``Is it even theoretically possible that premier Bouchard could sign 
any deal which would see Quebec remain in Confederation?''
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Bouchard replied: ``No, that is impossible, I am a 
sovereignist''.
<P>
	In that case, I fail to see why the official opposition or the hon. 
member for Roberval would ask about the ways in which we are 
trying to deal with the current problem, since they have already 
said that, in the circumstances, they are not interested and that their 
only objective is to destroy the federation.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Again, my dear colleagues, I would ask you to use 
the title of the member to whom you refer during question period.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is so 
obvious. A cabinet minister tries to find reasons why they should 
not keep the promises made by the Prime Minister, and it is not 
their fault. I have never seen anything like it.
<P>
	Is it not true that the purpose of the phoney committee headed by 
the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is merely to play for time 
so that the government can slowly but surely downgrade its 
commitments to Quebec and ultimately make them compatible 
with the interests of its Canadian friends?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, we must recognize the facts. The Prime Minister repeated 
in the House what he said in Verdun, and I mentioned both 
statements yesterday to show they were consistent. However, it is 
also time to realize that the Leader of the Official Opposition and 
the members of the official opposition are neglecting the duty they 
have, as the official opposition, to defend the interests of their 
constituents. They have now stated they do not intend to co-operate 
with the federal government at all, and consequently, their only 
goal, as their leader said, is to achieve sovereignty. Their only goal 
is to destroy Canada and consequently, their questions no longer 
have any credibility because they are not trying to improve the way 
the government operates but are only trying to achieve their goal, 
which is to destroy Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> So, Mr. Speaker, we can 
say we are protecting the interests of our constituents when we ask 
questions of the government in order to discover its intentions 
toward Quebec.
<P>
	What they want to know, precisely, is the federal government's 
intentions with respect to commitments it made less than a month 
ago, in the last days of the referendum campaign. It is obvious that 
the deliberations and recommendations of the phoney committee 
are a well kept secret.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16776"> 16776 </A></B>
<P>
	Can the minister at least tell us whether, in the interim report 
transmitted to the Prime Minister, the option of a simple House 
of Commons resolution on the distinct society is the one favoured 
by that phoney committee?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I feel obliged to repeat once again what the Prime 
Minister said, which is that to ensure the change and modernization 
of Canada, no change is excluded. And what he said in the House 
on Wednesday, which is:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I said we were going to make changes to the federation, constitutional changes, if 
necessary.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Thus there is no contradiction between the two statements. What 
we are doing in the unity committee is preparing a series of 
recommendations for the Prime Minister. The recommendations 
the group of ministers make to the Prime Minister are confidential, 
as they must be, because the person who makes decisions on behalf 
of the government is the Prime Minister. Once those decisions have 
been made, he will make the announcement.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, can the 
minister at least confirm to us that one of the hypotheses selected 
by the phoney committee regarding administrative decentralization 
is based on the principle set out by Pierre Elliott Trudeau two 
weeks ago, namely that no decentralization toward the provinces is 
possible without an equivalent transfer to the federal level, which 
would mean increased centralization of economic powers at 
Ottawa?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, to use the same vocabulary, this is a phoney question, 
clearly void of content.
<P>
	We repeat what we have said: the Prime Minister's promises are 
correct. And as long as the opposition continues to ask phoney 
questions like this one, when its goal is the destruction of Canada, 
it does not deserve an answer.

	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we are pleased with the recent peace agreement signed between the 
governments of Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia. This is a welcome step 
toward peace in that troubled region.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Frazer:</B> Yesterday the Prime Minister stated that Canada 
would commit troops and also promised a debate in the House to 
acquire Parliament's approval.
<P>
	To date however the government has paid only lip service to the 
principle of consultation. On September 21 last year the debate was 
only nine days before the renewal. This year on March 29 the 
debate was only two days before renewal and then the commitment 
was extended by two months without any reference to Parliament.
<P>
	Will the government commit this time to having the debate on 
Canadian forces deployment to the former Yugoslavia after the 
details are known and before any cabinet decision is taken?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister signified yesterday that it would be his intention for 
Parliament to debate the potential deployment for the NATO force. 
That debate will be scheduled in the next week or so after 
consultation between House leaders.
<P>
	This is a further example of how the government has restored 
Parliament's role in the debate of major foreign engagements.
<P>
	The hon. member has criticized only the matter of timing of 
these debates. The fact is that members of Parliament have been 
able to express their views before commitments have been made 
and that is the course that will be followed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
that is all very interesting but in my previous question I asked if we 
would debate after the details are known. I suspect they will not be 
known next week and we will not know what we are debating.
<P>
	The Minister of National Defence yesterday stated that because 
the successful formation of the NATO force will depend on 
American troops being committed, we will have to await the 
decision of congress. It is reported that the Americans are talking 
of a commitment of one year.
<P>
	Does the minister think the mission will be accomplished in one 
year and will he consider proposing a specified period for any 
Canadian commitment with a declared intention to withdraw 
Canadian forces at the end of that period?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, with great 
respect, these are all questions and ideas that should be raised in a 
parliamentary debate.
<P>
	The government would be quite interested to know from the 
Reform Party and other members the degree of commitment we 
should make, the numbers that we should be sending and in what 
proportion. All of those questions really are matters the govern-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16777"> 16777 </A></B>
<P>
ment will be  interested in before the government makes its final 
commitment to NATO.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it seems that the government will not commit to having a realistic 
debate on the commitment of Canadian forces.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Frazer:</B> I am concerned that Canadian troops have already 
been stretched past the limit by their commitments in the former 
Yugoslavia. Some soldiers are in their fourth and even fifth tours of 
duty and this is cause for great concern.
<P>
	I recently read a report from a chaplain who wrote: ``We do not 
know the emotional ramifications of psychological layers being 
built up by these repeatedly rapid deployments''.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister consider other options, such as offering 
NATO an air squadron rather than a land unit, in order to lessen the 
burden on our under equipped and over taxed land forces?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have been 
discussing with our NATO allies the requirements for this kind of a 
force. Next week at the Defence Planning Board meetings in 
Brussels these commitments will be examined in greater detail.
<P>
	I will take the hon. member's comment as a representation that 
Canada should offer air support. That will be very interesting. 
Other members may have a different view but we want to hear the 
views of all members before we decide.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	The hon. member also talked about the overstretching of 
Canadian forces. He knows that was a legitimate argument to make 
18 months ago. As a result of the deliberations of the committee of 
which he was a member, the white paper signalled an intent to put 
more people into the sharp end of the army. We are now recruiting 
so that we have more people available for such duty.
<P>
	I also underscore the fact that with the pullback from Croatia, 
Canada now has significantly fewer people in the field than we had 
six months ago. The criticisms the hon. member has been making 
this morning are not fully justified by the operational facts today.

	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	The recently published public accounts reveal that the Minister 
of Canadian Heritage awarded a grant of $5  million to the 
Bronfman Foundation to fund historical vignettes on Canada's 
heritage for television broadcast. His own officials recommended a 
grant of only $1 million.
<P>
	How does the minister explain his decision to give the Bronfman 
Foundation five times the amount his officials recommended, when 
he is cutting subsidies to francophone associations outside Quebec 
and everywhere in the area of cultural development?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is not clear in my colleague's question whether he 
feels these minutes of heritage were badly done and did not warrant 
funding. In my opinion, they provide an excellent look into 
Canadian history, which may be of no interest to him, but which 
interests me.
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister 
is not answering my question. We are not talking about product 
quality, but, rather, the fact that it cost $5 million when it was 
supposed to cost $1 million.
<P>
	As my supplemental, I would like to know whether the 
minister's sudden generosity was intended as an unobtrusive 
injection of several million dollars worth of propaganda on the eve 
of the recent referendum campaign?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, if our colleague believes Canada's history is 
propaganda, he should not be sitting in this House. Our history is

of them.

Canadians were justifiably shocked to learn that the 
Communications Security Establishment is eavesdropping on 
Canadian citizens.
<P>
	In response, the defence minister said that he would not

clearly stated that CSE did not have a mandate to spy on Canadians. 
Not surprisingly, the Prime Minister said that he did not know what 
CSE was doing.
<P>
	Does the Minister of National Defence know what CSE is doing 
and who gave CSE authority to invade and violate the privacy of 
Canadians by intercepting private communications?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and

Canadian citizens is an offence under part VI of the Criminal Code. 
How dare the government spy on its own citizens?

charges laid against those CSE agents who have broken the law?

<P>
	In announcing budget cuts, the President of the CBC explained 
that between 600 and 1,000 positions would be eliminated before 
March 1996. According to him, the exact number of jobs to be cut 
will depend on whether or not the federal government decides to 
contribute to the funding of Radio Canada International.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	Can the Minister of Canadian Heritage confirm that his 
government has decided to stop funding Radio Canada 
International?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, as our colleague must know, the international 
component of the CBC's mission is outlined in its current mandate.
<P>
	We will review the CBC's entire mandate, including this 
component, in light of the mandate committee's recommendations. 
The whole mandate will be reviewed, and the status of Radio 
Canada International will be determined at that time.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since Radio 
Canada International is Canada's international showcase-
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> Are you interested?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Debien:</B> Since Radio Canada International is Canada's 
international showcase and helps promote Canadian culture 
abroad, does the minister not feel that it would be irresponsible to 
stop funding this service, and can he give us advance notice of his 
intentions in this regard?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, allow me to correct the preamble to our colleague's 
question. Radio Canada International is a vehicle that promotes 
Canada around the world. I just got back from TV5, through which 
francophone Canada has gained international renown. Radio 
Canada International is not the only broadcaster to further our 
country's interests.
<P>

the cart before the horse. We have to make a decision on the CBC's

<P>
	In our red book there is a promise calling for the creation of

I thank the hon. member for raising a very important question on an

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what a 
joke. Speak of praising, I have had personal conversations with the 
justice minister about this issue over a six-month period. I have a 
fat file on it. One patronage appointed lawyer is unprepared and the 
charges are dropped. Another patronage appointed lawyer does not 
show and the charges are dropped. Another patronage appointed 
lawyer mishandles the charges and the charges are dropped.
<P>
	How far does this have to go? The Parliamentary Secretary to the

<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I ask the hon. member to put his question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> If the firms are not incompetent, if the justice 
department is not incompetent, if the justice minister is not 
incompetent, why do we end up with all these cases screwed up on 
Vancouver Island?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Minister of Justice has had all his appointments screened by 
officials before they were made and he is confident that these are 
very competent lawyers. The confidence is reflected in the fact that 
22 of the 42 firms appointed in B.C. are reappointments. Half the 
agents were appointed by the previous government.
<P>
	There have been isolated difficulties on Vancouver Island. The 
minister admits that fact. Preliminary reports suggest that the 
failure of certain former agents to co-operate with the new 
appointments may have contributed to the problem. The hon. 
member should be encouraging the former agents to co-operate 
with the new ones instead of carping and yelling in the House every 
day about the odd failure that occurs. These people are competent 
and they will do their jobs.

for the environment and had to be refloated.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, does the minister not realize that the public is 
concerned that, in opting for the cheapest solution under the

she started a process which could end up costing taxpayers a lot 
more than anticipated because of the bad decisions she made?

	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of

	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister

and file natives have kept that promise for him while the minister, 
his officials and band and council on the reserve sit in their ivory 
towers. Once again, who in this weak-kneed government is going 
to stand up and stop this environmental pillage?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find it hard to believe that 
the member accuses the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development of not being close to the grassroots. In fact, over the 
last two years he has met with more band members, more chiefs 
and more aboriginal people than certainly has the entire caucus of 
the Reform Party.
<P>
	I would underscore that the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development has the full confidence of the aboriginal 
peoples unlike their view of the Reform Party which is certainly 
not their greatest ally.

	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
would appear that the Minister of Environment has finally seen the 
light on the <I>Irving Whale</I> issue.
<P>
	Last week, she showed some common sense when she 
announced an investigation by the RCMP into possible criminal 
activities, as well as a new environmental impact review.
<P>
	Can the minister assure us that the public servants and other 
individuals who are being investigated by the RCMP will not take 
part, either as witnesses or as commissioners, in the new 
environmental assessment she has ordered?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, obviously, the government 
rreferred this issue to the RCMP so that it can investigate at every 
level.
<P>
	This being said, the PCB assessment will take into account 
everybody's public testimony and, obviously, those who are being 
investigated will be excluded from the process.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
would the minister not agree that, now that she has recognized the 
existence of criminal activities surrounding the refloating 
operation of the <I>Irving Whale</I>, the only way to give credibility to 
the process would be to strike a totally independent expert panel, 
one that has ho connection with her department?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the member's allegations 
are false. Moreover, if he wants the investigation to be conducted 
properly, it must not be interfered with.
<P>
	But if he means that an investigation should be conducted 
independently from the Canadian government, Environment 
Canada has the responsibility to carry on environmental impact 
assessments, and we do not want to avoid our responsibilities, we 
want to take them the same way we did when we became the first 
government to tackle this ecological time bomb.
<P>
	I would like to point out that the RCM of Îles-de-la-Madeleine,

we will be true to our fiscal commitments and operate within the 
established targets.
<P>
	True, more people than expected indicated that they want to take 
advantage of the government offers. This simply shows that there 
will be more spending in the beginning, but we will be able to make 
up for all that.  True, this could amount to almost $2.3 billion, but

	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when the 
Minister of National Revenue amalgamated Canada customs and 
taxation he claimed the department would become more efficient 
and more effective. The auditor general disagrees. In his report last 
week the auditor general points out that taxpayers are now waiting 
26 days longer for disputes to be resolved and that Revenue Canada 
missed collecting $17 million in interest charges on overdue 
accounts.
<P>
	How can the minister claim this reorganization in his department 
has been anything but a failure?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Secretary of State (Parliamentary 
Affairs) and Deputy Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister of National Revenue 
answered that question when the auditor general's report came out.
<P>
	If the member looks closely at the report, he will see the auditor 
general acknowledged the changes the Minister of National 
Revenue introduced and the savings that have been realized. 
Naturally, the time period is not of sufficient length for the auditor 
general to draw any conclusions. If the member reads the report 
very carefully he will see that at the moment the auditor general is 
being complimentary. He encourages the department to continue 
and it will continue in this manner.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, with all due 
respect, I believe the parliamentary secretary is out of touch with 
this department.
<P>
	Over the last couple of months I have received evidence that 
there are questionable management practices. There is evidence of 
racism. The morale is low and there is a lack of fulfilment in the 
department.
<P>
	The minister of revenue and taxation has to do a better job of 
controlling the department. Tax time is coming up. Budget time is 
coming up. We know the friction between taxpayers and Revenue 
Canada collectors.
<P>
	When will the people responsible for the department improve the 
image of national revenue and taxation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Secretary of State (Parliamentary 
Affairs) and Deputy Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe the member did not have 
a supplementary prepared and just went on a rampage of making 
allegations. If the member has evidence of specific cases of 
wrongdoing by people working in the department, he should come 
forward and give them to the minister and make them public. Then 
the minister will definitely look into the matter.
<P>
	Since 1993 when this government took office we have made the 
necessary changes in the department. Canadians are receiving their 
tax refunds faster than before. The amalgamation of the two 
departments has created savings in the millions of dollars and this 
will continue.

<P>
	Yesterday, David Peterson, a former premier of Ontario, 
submitted a brief to the heritage committee, on behalf of the 
Canadian Booksellers' Association. Mr. Peterson predicted that the 
impending arrival of two mega-booksellers from the United States, 
Borders, and Barnes and Noble, would have disastrous 
consequences on the book market in Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	Before the Minister of Industry allows American booksellers to 
invade the Canadian market, will the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage undertake to set up a committee of experts to assess the 
economic and cultural impact of the arrival of these two 
booksellers on the Canadian market, like it did for <I>Sports 
Illustrated</I>?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
let me advise the member clearly of what the existing book policy 
is of the government.
<P>
	The policy prohibits the establishment of a new retail book 
selling business by non-Canadians. Non-Canadians may only 
engage in book retailing as minority investors in Canadian 
controlled joint ventures. Any proposed joint venture that may be 
brought forward will be carefully examined under the existing 
powers under the Investment Canada Act to ensure that control in 
fact is exercised by the Canadian investors.
<P>
<B>(1155 )</B>

policy in favour of any proposed investment. I believe the interests 
of the Canadian booksellers will thereby be truly protected.

half of them being native or Metis. Another 30,000 work on 
trimming, storing and creating garments with fur and selling them.
<P>
	As a former trapper myself, I would like the Minister of 
International Trade to explain now that native trappers have 
convinced the European Union to postpone for one year its ban on 
furs caught with leghold traps, how will the government use that 
one year reprieve to ensure that an EU ban on Canadian wild furs 
never takes place?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are aware that we 
have one year within which to work out the proposition. We are 
quite encouraged by the European Union decision to grant us the 
extra year. We are going to work with the industry, the provinces 
and all of the interested parties. We hope to be able to come up with 
what is believed to be a proposition which is in the best interests of 
everybody, including the people who are benefiting from trapping 
in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is not as if this is a new problem. The European Union 
now buys about 75 per cent of Canadian fur.

taking to broaden the market for Canadian wild fur and reduce our 
dependence on the European buyers?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are quite concerned 
about this issue. Thousands and thousands of people depend on 
trapping for their survival.

community which worked extremely hard with  our government, as 
well as with governments in Europe, to ensure that our position is

	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
1993 the Liberal Party promised to expand child care in Canada by 
50,000 spaces each year that follows a growth of 3 per cent. Last 
year real growth was just over 4 per cent and still the government 
has not lived up to its commitment. It has broken its promise to 
Canadian families.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary responded to an earlier question that 
the government is working on this matter. I therefore ask the 
Deputy Prime Minister, exactly how many child care spaces-and I 
presume it will be at least 50,000-will the government create this 
year to maintain its promise?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I thought I answered that question earlier on. I will take the 
opportunity to outline other measures the federal government has 
taken to not only address child care, but to also address the issue of 
child poverty.
<P>
	Campaign 2000 recently released a report card which did not 
take into account some very positive news which occurred last 
year. Last year for the very first time in a long time, the average 
family income increased by almost 2 per cent. This speaks to the 
fact that the jobs and economic growth agenda the Liberal 
government has introduced over the past year is not only creating 
jobs, but is helping the issue of child care and child poverty.

federal government this year in keeping with its promise?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister

we have increased the gross domestic product, we will continue to

	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Wellington-Waterloo, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have a two-part question for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have heard more and more concerns about the Canada 
pension plan. Last week a leading actuary maintained that we are 
unable to pay even the pensions of those already retired.
<P>
	Can the minister tell the House if the Canada pension plan is in 
danger and what he intends to do about it? The second part of my 
question is what does he think of the Reform plan?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the chief actuary did 
indeed raise a number of very important concerns relative to the 
Canada pension plan. The departmental officials from the federal 
government and from all the provincial governments, because this 
is a joint responsibility, are indeed meeting to address those plans.
<P>
	The Canada pension plan is not in danger, but it does require 
modification, it does require change. We will bring those changes 
in to ensure that the Canada pension plan is there for young 
Canadians when their time comes to retire.
<P>
	The fundamental flaw in the Reform plan is that while there are 
interesting things in the margin, it makes sure that the rich are 
richer in retirement and the poor are poorer in retirement. This 
government will never accept that.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-100, 
an act to amend, enact, and repeal certain laws relating to financial 
institutions, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I know 
that with the wonderful words of wisdom I was expressing to the 
House prior to question period, the Speaker will recall that I was 
speaking about the fact that the Liberals and Tories all seem to 
enjoy the process of interfering in normal natural processes within 
a marketplace. The proposed bill is a classic example of exactly 
that.
<P>
	The Liberals have an opportunity under the Canada Deposit 
Insurance Corporation Act to make some substantive changes that 
would continue to protect Canadians while giving Canadians a 
responsibility for their own lives, their own affairs.
<P>
<B>(1210 )</B>
<P>
	It makes me think a lot of an occasion when I was in my 
constituency in the town of Invermere a few weeks ago. There was 
a gentleman who was the park warden from Glacier National Park 
in the United States, which I am sure members will recall is 
considered to be part of the Peace Park. It is right across the border 
from Waterton Lakes National Park. They have a wide swath cut 
from mountaintop down through the valley up to the  other side of 
the mountain approximately 60 feet wide to designate the border.
<P>
	The superintendent was saying it does not really make any sense 
for us to have this wide swath out in the middle of the wilderness. 
Here we are talking about this being a peace park, about how there 
is this desire on the part of Canadians and Americans to come 
together in the Peace Park, so why do we have this 60-foot wide 
swath? He was going to be proposing to the powers that be that this 
wide swath be permitted to simply regrow. What it would mean is 
that no longer would there be vegetation-destroying chemicals put 
into the area. It would save money. Above all, it would make sense.
<P>
	At that point I put up my hand at the back of the room and he 
acknowledged me. I told him he had a serious problem: you are 
proposing to the governments of the United States and Canada 
something that makes sense and saves money; you do not have a 
chance of this passing. Unfortunately, in spite of the fact that I said 
that with tongue in cheek, it is exactly this kind of problem we have 
with the old line parties, with this government. If it saves money 
and makes sense we can count on the fact that the Liberals are 
going to reject it.
<P>
	What am I referring to specifically? We propose a different way 
of handling the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation. We call it, 
as it is called in the industry, co-insurance. This bill rejects deposit 
co-insurance.
<P>
	Since the introduction in 1967 of 100 per cent deposit insurance, 
that is up to the maximum value, 30 financial institutions have 
failed, with 20 failures in the last 10 years. This has cost the CDIC 
about $5 billion as of March 1994.
<P>
	Before 1967 there were no bank failures. Governments over the 
years have exhibited a reluctance to institute market based 
measures of reform such as co-insurance instead of opting for more 
regulation and oversight.
<P>
	The use of the market through the implementation of 
co-insurance and market based criteria as early warning signals 
would alleviate the problem in the financial system in a less costly 
yet more effective manner than proposing further regulatory 
change. Regulatory attempts to mimic the efficient results only 
achievable by the free market will always be more costly for all 
parties involved and will rarely, if ever, achieve the same quality of 
results.
<P>
	Under the proposed system, depositors are only encouraged to 
seek out the best rate, regardless of the risk profile of the institution 
in question, since they know that they will be fully compensated by 
the CDIC in the event of a failure. This facilitates the entrance, 
growth and eventual failure of risky and recklessly managed 
institutions. It also discriminates against healthy, strong, financial 
sector players who minimize risk by conservative lending and 
borrowing policies. The act does set the stage for risk based CDIC 
premiums.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16785"> 16785 </A></B>
<P>
	It makes me think a lot, in terms of the government interference 
the Liberals and Conservatives have always practised, of a Canada 
Cup hockey game between Team Canada complete with Wayne 
Gretzky and all the rest of the superstars against Team Jamaica. 
The government would not set the rules for the game. It would 
set the rules for the result. It would probably make the Canadian 
goal the goal line, that is from side to side on the ice, and make 
the Jamaican goal the size of a shoebox. That way we could know 
what the results of the game were going to be. That is the attitude 
that has consistently, without fail, been the approach of both the 
Liberals and the Conservatives in the way they have governed 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	We have to realize that money is a medium of exchange. Money 
has no morality nor does it have nationality. We must restore 
balance in the marketplace, which is what this bill is about.
<P>
	I am referring to making the depositor take some responsibility 
because what is going on right now is that the solid financial 
institutions are being basically penalized. The people investing in 
those solid financial institutions are being penalized by people who 
know they can invest up to the limit covered by CDIC and bear no 
risk as long as those deposits are guaranteed by CDIC.
<P>
	The 100 per cent coverage creates a situation parallel to the 
situation I described with regard to regional development grants, in 
that it shifts the responsibility away from the depositor and on to 
the backs of (a) the larger, more responsible financial institutions 
that have a long track record and (b) ultimately the taxpayer.
<P>
	Let us get government interference in the marketplace under 
control. Maybe that is too much to expect from the Liberals. We 
can only hope. But above all, I ask the members of the government 
side to consider this. Canada has to be prepared to compete in the 
real world. This issue of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation 
is just one small indicator of the kind of government interference 
that is distorting an orderly marketplace. It is reflective of the real 
world and of that marketplace. As long as we continue to shift 
responsibility ultimately from the people in that marketplace, we 
are not doing anything to create any health, vibrancy or cleansing 
within the marketplace.
<P>
	It is for that reason, the fact that the government refuses to 
consider the prospect of co-insurance, that we will be voting 
against this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Murphy (Annapolis Valley-Hants, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to participate in the debate today on Bill 
C-100. I am pleased to have the opportunity to express my support 
for this legislation which will enhance the safety and soundness of 
the Canadian financial system.
<P>
	I would like to focus on the issue of early intervention when an 
institution is experiencing financial difficulties.  It is an area where 
Bill C-100 establishes a dramatic shift or enhancement in the 
philosophy of financial institution regulation. It is a reform that I 
believe all consumers should applaud.
<P>
	As the hon. secretary of state pointed out earlier, the logical 
underpinning for early intervention in problem situations begins 
with the principle that ownership of a financial institution is a 
privilege, not a right. This reflects the absolute vital role in terms 
of economics and public confidence that such institutions play in 
an open market economy.
<P>
	The legislation before us takes this principle to a natural and 
essential conclusion. It recognizes that when a financial institution 
is experiencing difficulty, the owners do not have the right to 
continue business until the bitter end. In other words, the 
obligations of management include a duty to depositors, 
policyholders, creditors, as well as shareholders. This means that 
an institution's owners do not have a natural authority to carry on in 
the hope of some miraculous turnaround, until capital is depleted or 
they cannot pay liabilities as they come due.
<P>
<B>(1220 )</B>
<P>
	Bill C-100 translates this view into concrete measures. It makes 
clear that if early intervention in and resolution of institutions 
experiencing difficulty need to occur it can occur. This is 
specifically recognized in a new mandate for the Office of the 
Superintendent of Financial Institutions. This mandate is given 
bottom line reality to changes in the statutes to permit this 
institution to obtain a winding-up order for problem firms earlier 
than this is warranted.
<P>
	I should point out that this new mandate represents an important 
clarification of the mission statement of OSFI. Prior to Bill C-100, 
this institution was guided very informally by the objectives to 
maintain public confidence in the Canadian financial system.
<P>
	However the bill provides the regulator with a detailed, 
legislative mandate which recognizes OSFI should contribute to 
public confidence. It will do so by recognizing the interests of 
depositors, policyholders and creditors of Canadian financial 
institutions.
<P>
	Prescribing such a mandate more formally in legislation is an 
important step. This will give the regulator greater accountability 
for its actions. It also lets institutions and other stakeholders know 
that the regulator will deal with them in an expeditious manner 
should problems arise.
<P>
	Greater transparency with respect to the role of the regulator 
provides all financial institutions, healthy or troubled, with a 
greater incentive to monitor their affairs more prudently.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16786"> 16786 </A></B>
<P>
	I firmly believe the very fact that the early intervention is a clear 
and concrete part of the OSFI mandate is in itself an incentive 
for better management.
<P>
	Bill C-100's mandate for this institution extends beyond simply 
requiring the regulator to take immediate action with institutions 
experiencing financial difficulty. OSFI has a broader responsibility 
to promote the adoption by senior management of financial 
institutions of sound policies and procedures to control their risks. 
After all, financial institutions must bear a greater responsibility to 
their stakeholders for managing their exposure to risk adequately. 
This is consistent with the principle that ownership of financial 
institutions is a privilege and not a right.
<P>
	Supervisory systems must be designed in such a way to create an 
incentive for corrective action by financial institutions themselves 
to set right and salvage firms where possible.
<P>
	However, earlier resolution alone cannot ensure that a troubled 
financial institution will not fail. In an open market environment, 
especially in today's increasingly competitive global arena, firms 
may fail. Therefore it is extremely important, when closure of a 
financial institution is imminent, the supervisory system be 
prepared to shut down an institution in a manner that protects the 
interests of all stakeholders.
<P>
	In this regard, Bill C-100 provides the regulator with sufficient 
scope to close down a troubled institution before the value of the 
firm has been fully depleted.
<P>
	The legislation includes amendments to the winding-up and 
restructuring act which provides OSFI with additional grounds for 
obtaining a wind-up order for a financial institution. The act is also 
being amended to provide more flexibility to restructure, under 
court supervision, the affairs of insurance companies in liquidation. 
This should provide protection for stakeholders if closing down is 
required. The liquidator will have greater scope to enhance value 
within the estate and improve recovery on assets deposed of by the 
liquidator to the benefit of all policyholders.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	Again, the interests of financial consumers stand to be 
recognized under Bill C-100 revised closure policy. I believe this 
legislation acts on the aspects of good regulation and good 
management, fairness and openness.
<P>
	In other words, there is a fundamental need for transparency of 
the supervisory system. If we are to encourage the most positive 
attitudes and behaviour within institutions, it is essential that they 
understand the steps that the authorities can take if the financial 
situation deteriorates. We must be prepared to deal with situations 
where firms make mistakes and face difficulty.
<P>
	We must have a more transparent system in place so that 
messages to the company management are clear.  That is why the 
secretary of state is proposing a guide to intervention that clarifies 
the actions that can be expected, a guide that clarifies the role of 
OSFI and the CDIC, the Canadian Deposit Insurance Corporation.
<P>
	This guide sets out four stages of intervention. Each stage makes 
clear to institutions what type of regulatory action will be taken. It 
includes a number of fairly technical supervisory measures that 
may be measured and used by OSFI in recognizing the interests of 
stakeholders.
<P>
	It also spells out actions by CDIC in fulfilling its legislated 
objectives to control risk to the deposit insurance fund and 
minimize its exposure to loss.
<P>
	These regulatory actions range from the initial stage one 
situation, where the regulator takes a number of small steps when 
the institution is experiencing difficulty. At this stage, OSFI could 
require the external auditor to expand its work. If the company 
continues to decline, there are two other stages of more direct 
action that can be taken by the regulator, where a more hands-on 
approach is taken. By stage four, firm action is required because 
insolvency is imminent.
<P>
	The institution approaching this stage will have warning that 
unless it improves its situation it will be shut down. Bill C-100 
provides that in such a scenario, OSFI could seek a winding-up 
order while the institution still has positive capital.
<P>
	This is clearly to the benefit of the depositors, the policyholders, 
the creditors and other stakeholders. It is consistent with the 
institution's mandate.
<P>
	The legislation before us is largely technical in content. It does 
not have the drama of some other high profile issues, but this 
should not obscure its vital importance, nor its real benefits to our 
economy and to the security of millions of Canadians.
<P>
	Consumers have come to expect that regulatory authorities take 
prompt action to deal with the problem of financial institutions. A 
sound, dynamic financial system is important to all Canadian 
consumers and an essential component to economic strength, the 
strength that ultimately, as we know, produces jobs.
<P>
	The legislation enhances the soundness that Canadians expect 
from their financial system. A sound, dynamic financial system is a 
fundamental foundation for personal financial security and public 
confidence. The legislation before us will ensure that such 
confidence is fully justified.
<P>
	I urge all hon. members to approve this legislation. It is in the 
interest of all our constituents and our nation as a whole.

<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise in this House as a member of the Bloc Quebecois to address 
Bill C-100, an act to amend, enact and repeal certain laws relating 
to financial institutions.
<P>
	I listened closely to the previous speakers' speeches, especially 
that of the parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Finance, who 
explained a number of guidelines followed by the government in 
the drafting of this bill.
<P>
	First of all, he told us that the purpose of the government was to 
regulate in the best possible way certain aspects of the financial 
system in Canada, certain financial institutions, so that Canadians 
who put their trust in these financial institutions and deposit money 
in them will not have their trust betrayed because of a shortcoming 
in the regulations or abuses from the financial institutions 
themselves.
<P>
	Seen from this angle, any Canadian or Quebecer would think that 
the federal government is fully justified in introducing the bill now 
before us.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary also mentioned global issues, 
changes in the global financial system, new technologies, the 
diversification of financial needs, competitiveness, everything that 
makes up globalization. He told us Canada must act to make sure 
that our financial system will react adequately if financial 
institutions have problems that could put at risk the money 
deposited by Canadians and Quebecers.
<P>
	Seen from this angle, one would think that all is well, that the 
government must indeed take action. Later on, I listened to the 
official opposition financial critic, my colleague from 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, who stressed other aspects of the issue. 
He said that, yes, the government was justified in taking some 
measures but that, while doing so, it must respect the provinces' 
jurisdictions. I would say that the hon. member clearly underlined 
different aspects of the bill which infringe upon the jurisdiction of 
provinces such as Quebec.
<P>
	During his speech, I was looking at government members and 
thinking that they were elected to the House of Commons to 
represent their constituents. In a sense, they are forced to listen to 
arguments which tend to become repetitive, because, no matter 
what bill is being debated in the House, the official opposition will 
criticize it in terms of federal and provincial jurisdictions. Of 
course, it can be tiring for hon. members, who are elected to 
represent their constituents honestly, to see all their bills come 
under attack from a particular angle by Bloc members.
<P>
	I understand that, but they must also recognize the position of a 
member from Quebec. I was reading a letter sent by Mr. Johnson, 
the former Quebec premier, to a  federal minister concerning the 
bill, in which he was generally using the arguments presented by 
the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot. In other words, he 
was arguing that Quebec's jurisdiction should be respected. So it is 
not just a sovereignist member's point of view that has been put 
forward, but the point of view of a member from Quebec who 
wants to represent his constituents well, as is proper under the 
constitutional traditions of Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	Once again, at the risk of displeasing some colleagues, I will tell 
you why a piece of legislation like this one, which at first glance 
appears fully appropriate and normal under the circumstances, is 
questionable.
<P>
	It is questionable, first of all, from the standpoint of the 
Constitution. It is all very clear in the Canadian Constitution that 
private property and the Civil Code are under the Quebec 
government's jurisdiction. It is clear and it is there for all to read. 
This means that any laws or moves the federal government makes 
to regulate to some extent private property or items covered by the 
Civil Code are, in and of themselves, unconstitutional. It is with 
some hesitation that I use the word ``unconstitutional'' because it is 
a fairly strong word, but the fact remains that those laws or moves 
are intrusions by the federal government into another level of 
government's jurisdiction.
<P>
	The Quebec government is not alone in saying this, as we saw 
last summer, when the chairman of the Ontario Securities 
Commission made the same argument, saying that the draft 
legislation put forward at the time-it was being considered by the 
committee-flew in the face of provincial jurisdiction over 
securities regulation.
<P>
	Of course, when the representative of the Ontario Securities 
Commission showed up before the committee which was 
examining this bill last summer, he had changed his mind and said: 
``Look, maybe it is important that the federal government legislates 
in this area''. At that time, we were about to embark upon a 
referendum campaign and the people of Canada who sincerely 
believed that Canada should not be divided and should remain 
united after a referendum were sticking together. That is why he 
changed his tune a little bit.
<P>
	But you have to understand that, at the outset, he had examined 
his powers and the provincial jurisdiction and had noticed that this 
bill would infringe upon this area of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	This all goes to explain why this is the first concern of hon. 
members from Quebec-and I am not only talking about 
sovereignist members of Parliament-when they examine a bill. Of 
course it may not cross the mind of the members from the Yukon, 
from British-Columbia or from Ontario when they examine a 
federal bill. But it is a reflex that we, the politicians of Quebec, 
have developed over many decades. We have done so since  
Confederation, under the governments of Duplessis, Lesage, 
Lévesque, and the Johnsons, both father and sons. The elected 
representatives of the people of Quebec have always been especial-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16788"> 16788 </A></B>
<P>
ly careful to remind the federal government that it must respect the 
various areas of jurisdiction.
<P>
	Again today, the elected representatives of the people of Quebec, 
as the official opposition, want to remind everyone of this basic 
rule of the Canadian federal system, which is the existence of 
various levels of government, with different areas of jurisdiction 
under the Constitution that ought to be respected.
<P>
	On the very face of it, this bill does not respect the Quebec 
government's power to exercize jurisdiction over securities, 
because securities are private property. If private property and the 
Civil Code come under provincial jurisdiction, then securities also 
fall under provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	What is the purpose of Bill C-100? It grants the Bank of Canada 
jurisdiction over securities clearing houses, which, as I amply 
demonstrated-I believe-at the beginning of my speech, are 
already regulated by the provinces. The bill gives the federal 
government powers which go beyond its jurisdiction under the 
Canadian Constitution.
<P>
	It even goes as far as giving a power to issue directives to 
clearing houses and their participants. Therefore, for a Quebec 
representative, this is not right, this is unacceptable. That is why we 
are condemning it.
<P>
	The second aspect mentioned by my colleague had to do with the 
whole issue of so-called systemic effects. This referes to a situation 
where a financial institution that is in difficulty because it is unable 
to meet certain obligations would endanger another institution, 
creating a kind of domino effect where a weaker financial 
institution can doom other financial institutions perhaps better 
administered or more prosperous. A schedule was added to this bill 
for the purpose of controlling this phenomenon.
<P>
	It is clear that, in the context of globalization, governments must 
closely monitor such phenomena. We read from time to time in the 
newspapers that the problems of a bank in Hong Kong can affect 
another bank in England, which happens to have interests in 
Canada. This situation can in turn create problems for that bank's 
branches and institutions in Canada and in Quebec. I understand 
that those things have to be regulated.
<P>
	But under the pretext of having to regulate such situations, Bill 
C-100 encroaches once more on provincial jurisdictions, in areas 
which are presently regulated by the Commission des valeurs 
mobilières du Québec. This agency has opposed passing of the bill 
in its present form precisely because it saw that the federal 
government,  mainly through the Bank of Canada, was encroaching 
upon the mandate it received from the Government of Quebec.
<P>
	Indeed, the schedule of the bill dealing with clearing and 
winding up empowers the Bank of Canada to issue directives to 
clearing houses and participant institutions, without regard for the 
charter of the institution. As we know, some institutions have 
federal charters. We can understand that the federal government 
must regulate such institutions, but there are also institutions with 
provincial charters. Quebec has many. There are ten trust 
companies, 25 personal insurance companies, 60 damage insurance 
companies and 1 300 credit unions with a provincial charter in 
Quebec. That is a lot.
<P>
	It is a lot and credit unions are a special concern to Quebecers. 
You are all familiar with the success of the caisses populaires 
Desjardins in Quebec. They gave Quebecers from humble 
backgrounds the opportunity to found institutions based on co-op 
principles, so that there are now 1,300 caisses populaires 
throughout Quebec. These institutions were built in parishes and 
villages and really represent a major achievement for Quebecers.
<P>
	We can see that, through this bill, the federal government is 
giving itself some powers over these provincially chartered 
institutions. We are against this.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	We are not against the fact that we must protect ourselves against 
systemic risk that an institution could endanger another at some 
point. We disagree, however, with the federal government's 
approach. Instead, the government should have fine-tuned the large 
value transfer system, as a group of international experts, the 
Group of Thirty, proposed in 1989. The Governor of the Bank of 
Canada admitted as much last summer when questioned on the 
issue of systemic risk in the financial sector.
<P>
	Of course, by the time he appeared before the finance committee 
last summer, the Governor of the Bank of Canada had changed his 
tune, as did the Chairman of the Ontario Securities Commission.
<P>
	We think that he changed his tune for political reasons. That is 
not surprising. I can appreciate that, given the situation last 
summer before the Quebec referendum, those who believe in 
federalism and want to maintain this system in Canada may have 
agreed to certain things and qualified their previous proposals or 
statements so as to avoid embarrassing the federal government.
<P>
	But the fact remains that, had the proposal to improve the large 
value transfer system by streamlining it been approved by the 
federal government, the government would not have felt compelled 
to give itself powers that I would describe as outrageous over 
Quebec financial institutions that are well managed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16789"> 16789 </A></B>
<P>
	Not one single financial institution in Quebec has declared 
bankruptcy in the last ten years. Some insurance companies have 
merged in the interest of their shareholders and policyholders, but 
there has not been any bank failure among Quebec credit unions, 
trust companies or major insurance companies in over ten years.
<P>
	Of course, there have been problems in Canada. There have been 
problems in Western Canada and the government had to intervene. 
It think its probably did what was best for the people of Canada and 
Quebec at the time, but, just the same, the federal government 
cannot justify invading one of Quebec's areas of jurisdiction by 
saying that, over the past ten or twenty years, Quebec has not been 
taking its responsibilities with respect to regulating the securities 
industry or financial institutions.
<P>
	Again, this is seen by members from Quebec as typical of the 
kind of insensitivity Canada has displayed toward what could be 
called Quebec's unique view of federalism.
<P>
	When I spoke in this House yesterday on Bill C-96, establishing 
the Department of Human Resources Development, I put forward 
the same arguments. It is all fine and well for the Minister of 
Human Resources Development to ensure that the moneys spent 
for communities and individuals in Canada are spent as efficiently 
as possible. But this is one more intrusion-let us say it as it is, a 
federal intrusion-in areas of provincial jurisdiction: occupational 
training, manpower, and so on.
<P>
	Today, the Bloc Quebecois would like to once more condemn the 
federal government's approach in regulating financial institutions. 
Rest assured that, in committee, our members will do their utmost 
to ensure that these clauses, which obviously are not in keeping 
with a harmonious federal system, are deleted from the bill.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, first I want to thank the hon. member for Jonquière, 
who in my estimation made a good analysis which, along with the 
one made this morning by another Bloc member, clearly illustrates 
the problems with Bill C-100. There are several problems which 
affect Quebec but, more importantly, this bill is yet another 
example of federal interference in an area of exclusive provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	The hon. member pointed out that, almost every time a bill is 
introduced in the House, Bloc Quebecois members rise to condemn 
the fact that it infringes on an area of provincial jurisdiction. This is 
a rather recent phenomenon here. Indeed, in the last 15 or 20 years, 
there have been Quebec MPs in this House who were not Bloc 
members but who rarely got up to condemn federal interference in 
areas which come under Quebec's jurisdiction.
<P>
	This is explained by the fact that, whenever Quebecers were 
represented here, it was by Conservative or Liberal members who 
were in a minority position and who had to toe the party line within 
their caucus. Since their caucus was formed by a majority 
representing the rest of Canada, they had to defend the interests of 
Canada before those of Quebec. This applied even when there was 
an obvious consensus in Quebec, that is when federalists and 
sovereignists of all political colours were of the same opinion.
<P>
	The hon. member just mentioned the fact that Daniel Johnson 
sent a letter to the minister, in which he described precisely our 
position. Therefore, there is obvious consensus on Bill C-100, 
among federalists and sovereignists alike in Quebec, with respect 
to this intentional intrusion on matters of provincial jurisdiction, 
and I hope that the government will take this into account.
<P>
	Another obvious example of consensus in Quebec being ignore 
by the government is the fact that manpower training and 
everything connected with manpower training should be handed 
over to Quebec. Every political party and all of the stakeholders in 
Quebec, be it management or labour, obviously agree on this, yet 
the federal government is not responding. We in the Bloc 
Quebecois have every right to defend these positions.
<P>
	It is a well known fact that movements such as the Parti 
Quebecois and the Bloc Quebecois were born as a result of the 
realization that we were a political minority. And when we played 
the power game, whether within the Conservative Party or the 
Liberal Party, we remained a minority and, as such, had to defend 
Canada's interests. This the origin of the emergence of the 
sovereignist movement in Quebec; we realized that we were caught 
in an ongoing process of being reduced to a political minority.
<P>
	My question to my colleague, who has studied several pieces of 
legislation similar to Bill C-100, is: does he not realize that, for 
several years now, we have tried to explain to our fellow citizens 
what being a political minority means, and that, to a certain extent, 
being a political minority leads to becoming an economic minority, 
and that, when we deal with Quebecers, we should add this 
dimension to our debate?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caron: </B>Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies for his question.
<P>
	It is obvious that politics has an impact on the economy. Indeed, 
I mentioned at the beginning of my speech that the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Finance had partly justified the 
introduction of this bill by the government by putting it in the 
context of some sort of globalization.
<P>
	He spoke of global issues to justify that the bill is written in such 
a way as to regulate or influence  securities throughout Canada and 
to insure that Canada has a single voice among other nations with 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16790"> 16790 </A></B>
<P>
regard to securities regulation, in order to avoid negative impacts 
from outside the country.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	If we, in Quebec, are not careful, the arguments of globalization, 
of competitiveness, of the need for the economy to adapt to the 
global context will be presented every time that the government 
wants to make Canada stronger, more visible, more efficient and 
more aggressive at the international level, bacause to be strong, 
efficient and aggressive, we must speak with one voice.
<P>
	Faced with this reality, Canada wants to speak with one single 
voice. However, Canada forgets that there is a major voice in 
Canada, albeit a minority voice, as my colleague has remarked; 
there is Quebec's voice, which has represented a nation, a people, 
since the beginning of the Canadian Confederation. This voice has 
always made itself heard. Today, considering the globalization of 
economies and the fact that Quebec feels somewhat threatened by 
this globalization from the economic viewpoint, and not only from 
the viewpoint of its culture and its language, the economic 
argument becomes an important one for nationalists in Quebec.
<P>
	In the past, we wanted to achieve sovereignty in order to 
maintain our language and our culture. That is fine, and that is still 
the most important reason, at least as far as I am concerned. 
However, in the last ten years or so, we have come to realize that 
the economic argument is gaining increasing importance. 
Quebecers realize that they too must speak with one single voice if 
they want their people, their nation, to continue developing in a 
global context.
<P>
	I agree with the representatives of Canadian federalism that, in 
the global context, we must speak out loud and clear, with a single 
voice, and that timing is a major consideration. It is also one of the 
reasons why sovereignists in Quebec have been saying for many 
years that sovereignty should not be achieved only to preserve our 
language and our culture, but also to give Quebec the economic 
health and vitality it needs to maintain its place in the international 
community.
<P>
	I thank my colleague for his question. It allows me to 
demonstrate, although I recognize the merit of our federalist 
colleagues' arguments from a Canadian viewpoint, that the 
sovereignists' arguments are also of an economic nature. I hope 
that some day, in a newly defined partnership with Canada, we will 
be able to accommodate both sides so that both Canada and Quebec 
can get what they want economically as well as play a leading role 
in the world economy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Peterson (Willowdale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in this 
debate concerning Bill C-100, once again we see the separatists 
grabbing at an opportunity to attack a Canadian bill, not because it 
is a poor one, but simply  because it is one that would be good for 
Canada. In other words, if a bill is good for Canada, they are going 
to attack it.
<P>
	What they have told us today is that Bill C-100 is an 
encroachment into provincial jurisdiction, in other words one more 
intrusion by the federal government. But that is not true in the least. 
What is it? This is not a bill aimed at regulating co-operatives in 
Quebec or elsewhere in Canada. It is a bill that will reaffirm the 
vital role played by the Bank of Canada in protecting all Canadians 
and all Canadian institutions against systemic risks that may 
originate anywhere in the world.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	We have witnessed the collapse of Barings Bank, which could 
have caused many problems in our country. What we are proposing 
in this bill is to give the Bank of Canada the power to guarantee 
transactions between financial institutions, either in Canada or 
elsewhere.
<P>
	This means that if a Canadian banking institution or even a credit 
union had received a cheque, say for $100 million drawn on 
Barings Bank and had deposited that cheque, but Barings Bank had 
gone bankrupt before the cheque cleared, while in the meantime, 
counting on the $100 million, the institution had paid some of its 
debts, that institution would have sustained a heavy loss.
<P>
	What we need to do from the time a cheque is received by a 
Canadian institution, is to be sure that it can be counted on. But 
they do not want this. Why do they not want a system which would 
entitle all Canadian institutions to certainty when financial 
transactions are concerned?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The fact that the Bloc members are complaining about an 
intrusion in their constitutional domain is typical of what they will 
do with every bill we see in this House that is for the good of all 
Canadians, including Quebecers. They are going to try to find some 
way to knock it down so that they can say that Canada does not 
work. Their agenda is not the better working of Canada, it is the 
destruction of this very country. Canadians are not going to be 
fooled; Quebecers are not going to be fooled.
<P>
	Let us get down to some of the essences of Bill C-100. Part of the 
genesis of it was the failure of Confederation Life which shook all 
Canadians. We had not expected it; a great financial institution 
went down.
<P>
	The insurance industry put in place an institution called 
CompCorp where it contributes funds to protect the policyholders 
when there is a failure of an insurance institution. The government 
was concerned that perhaps there was not enough federal regulation 
in terms of CompCorp, that maybe some of the interests which we 
needed to have on the table, acting for all Canadians, were not 
going to be there.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16791"> 16791 </A></B>
<P>
	The minister proposed a new type of institution using the 
insurance companies but also having a greater federal presence. 
The insurance industry came back to us and said it did not like 
our federal proposal, but it recognized that there were some 
improvements it had to make in the way CompCorp was run. The 
industry said it would make the changes in order to respect the 
needs of all Canadians.
<P>
	This was a remarkable process. The minister put out a challenge 
and the industry responded on its own. The government is not 
involved in yet another program that could cost it funds, but the 
industry has assumed this responsibility in a way that will even 
strengthen the protection available to policyholders.
<P>
	I commend the industry for coming up with this solution. It is the 
way we have to work. It was the spirit in which all of the measures 
in Bill C-100 were addressed.
<P>
	One of the other issues which came before the committee was 
addressed by my colleague from the Reform Party. His party will 
not be supporting the bill because it believes we should not have 
Canadian deposit insurance which covers every last cent owed to a 
depositor up to $60,000. Reformers want a system of co-insurance 
so that if someone deposits funds in a financial institution which is 
regulated by the federal government, the depositor cannot be 
guaranteed 100 cents on the dollar to the first $60,000 he or she 
deposited.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	There is a rationale for what the Reform members say and it does 
have some merit. The merit is that if I as an individual am 
responsible for part of the risk on that $60,000, I will be more 
prudent in selecting the institution in which I deposit my funds. I 
will investigate whether it is credit worthy. I will look around with 
due diligence before I make that deposit.
<P>
	In theory that makes a lot of sense but in practice I wonder 
whether it would really work for the vast majority of Canadians. 
How many of them have the opportunity to investigate on their own 
whether a financial institution is really solvent, whether it is really 
solid, whether it is going to pay back their deposit within five years 
if it is a term deposit for that amount of time?
<P>
	Can we really look five years down the road if we are making a 
term deposit, even if we have access to all of those financial 
documents? I am not really sure it is reasonable to expect everyone 
who deposits in a bank or a financial institution to do that, and most 
people do have deposits. Is it reasonable to expect all Canadians to 
undertake this with due diligence? Even if they do undertake it, is it 
reasonable to expect that they can look five years down the road 
when their deposit is to mature?
<P>
	I like the idea of Canadians taking a greater role in looking at 
their returns and not just going for the highest return. If somebody 
is paying more than the going rate,  perhaps there is a reason for it. 
Perhaps they are desperate for the funds and they will take them at 
any price. I suspect that what we have to do as a federal 
government is make sure through our federal institutions that the 
deposit taking institutions are solvent. Through the Superintendent 
of Insurance and other federal agencies we have undertaken that 
greater role of making sure those institutions to which we have 
given the privilege of taking deposits will hopefully be safe in the 
future.
<P>
	This is why I believe it is important in order to protect the vast 
majority of individual Canadians that we continue to maintain the 
full level of deposit insurance. This does not mean we cannot look 
at this issue in the future and perhaps look at other ways in which 
we can achieve the same results.
<P>
	I want to go back to the process by which we looked at Bill 
C-100 and how it evolved. It can serve as an example for other 
federal legislation.
<P>
	The Secretary of State for Financial Institutions put out a white 
paper last spring. He gave the industry about three months to 
respond to it. The industry studied it and came back with its 
considerations. The minister took those considerations into mind 
when he introduced the bill which came down last spring.
<P>
	The finance committee sat in the month of August and heard 
testimony on the bill. The committee did not wait for the House to 
give it this reference. The bill has not even achieved second reading 
yet. It had just been tabled in June but we thought it important to 
get feedback from the industry again.
<P>
	The finance committee held two very intensive days of hearings 
here in August. About 15 recommendations for modifications to 
the bill were made. The industry was very enthusiastic that we had 
accepted what it had proposed for CompCorp which was the major 
issue, to try to protect policyholders of our insurance companies in 
the future.
<P>
<B>(1310 )</B>
<P>
	The industry came back with some concrete and constructive 
suggestions as to how Bill C-100 could be improved. We have 
noted those suggestions. The vast majority of the recommendations 
made at the hearings were very constructive.
<P>
	We are now at the stage that even before the bill has been 
officially given to the committee by the House, we are looking at 
the recommendations made by industry. We are having discussions 
with officials, and we are continuing discussions with members of 
the industry. I am sure by the time the bill sees the light of day 
again it will have a number of constructive amendments attached to 
it. The amendments will not be arrived at through confrontation nor 
by saying: ``Here it is; take it or leave it''. It will be through the 
constructive, co-operative efforts of those of us here in Ottawa, of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16792"> 16792 </A></B>
<P>
the officials who  are knowledgeable and of those from the industry 
who are concerned with achieving a proper legislative result.
<P>
	I commend the minister for this approach. I commend the 
industry for the very constructive role it has taken. There is only 
one sour note we have seen in this whole bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It was when the committee sat during the month of August. The 
separatists tried to attack the bill on the grounds that it was a 
federal intrusion in a provincial jurisdiction. That was not the case 
at all. It would have been ultra vires for the federal government to 
do so.
<P>
	What we did was give the Bank of Canada the power to provide 
better protection for all Canadian institutions, including the caisses 
in Quebec and all the co-ops and banks, against major risks, the 
systemic risks in the financial system as a whole.
<P>
	The separatists themselves asked to keep the Canadian dollar. So 
would they prefer to ignore a better way to protect financial 
institutions and the dollar? Even if Quebec were an independent 
country, it would be necessary to protect the large value transfer 
system and prevent systemic risks.
<P>
	However, they do not want it now and never will. We all know 
that the Bloc strategy, the separatist strategy is to attack us every 
time we do something good for all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I note our hon. colleague has just said, and, very much 
to the point, I think, that the aim of the bill was never to invade 
Quebec's jurisdiction, and I believe him. I do not think the 
ministers opposite and our Liberal colleagues spend their time 
trying to think of ways to create bills to invade Quebec's 
jurisdictions.
<P>
	That is absolutely true. I think their aim is probably to come up 
with good bills that will apply to all Canadians, in Canada's best 
interest. I am not questioning this, but the effect of the bill is to 
invade Quebec's jurisdictions-there is no way round it. Even 
Daniel Johnson, a Quebec federalist, agrees.
<P>
	All this, because, on the whole, Canada is pursuing an orderly 
and intelligent course of development, which obliges it to 
centralize its powers. Mr. Trudeau recently stated that Canada 
cannot be decentralized any more than it is, because it is the most 
decentralized confederation.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	Clearly, in order to become a strong country, Canada must 
centralize its powers in Ottawa, and this is in fact what the 
government is doing.
<P>
	The effect of this centralization of powers in Ottawa is to rob 
Quebec of its powers. This is Canada's big problem. We have two 
sets of jurisdiction pursuing  different interests for the most part. 
This has not been so obvious until now, because the Quebecers we 
sent to the House were lost in parties like the Conservative or the 
Liberal Party, where they were in the minority and where they were 
entitled to speak in the House only to toe the party line.
<P>
	Now there is the Bloc Quebecois, which truly represents the 
interests of Quebecers and is truly in keeping with Quebec's 
history. This position is being defended not only by the 
sovereignists, but has been defended by events in Quebec since 
1950 and earlier. The position has been defended by Quebec's 
premiers, whatever their political stripe-federalist or 
sovereignist.
<P>
	There was Maurice Duplessis, who said, on Quebecers' behalf, 
``Rendez-moi mon butin à Ottawa'', calling for the return of the 
province's powers, and he got them too. There was Jean Lesage, 
who started the Quiet Revolution, and talked of ``Maîtres chez 
nous''. What did he mean? He realized we did lack some of the 
tools we needed for our development. Then there was Daniel 
Johnson, Sr., who said ``Égalité ou indépendance'', and yet he was 
not a sovereignist. Toward the end of his term of office, he realized 
that it was absolutely necessary for Quebec to retain its powers 
and-if possible-obtain new ones for its economic and political 
survival. In this ever-changing political environment, René 
Lévesque managed to launch the sovereignist movement. This 
movement is still influential; it has led to the presence in this 
House members of the Bloc Quebecois, which is representative of 
Quebec.
<P>
	Of course, there are representatives of Quebec within the Liberal 
Party. But these are isolated cases. Quebec is represented by the 
Bloc quebecois. I know that Canada needs to centralize its powers. 
I would like to ask my colleague a simple question. Does not he 
think that it is time-I know that the Prime Minister has said or at 
least implied, maybe not to us, but to Quebecers, that he might 
decentralize Canada or some minor services, when we know 
perfectly well-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> No, no.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> Yes, as a matter of fact. Well, there will be no 
decentralization, but the fact remains that the Prime Minister 
indicated to Quebecers there would be some decentralization.
<P>
	Does my colleague not agree basically, if we consider the 
situation in a simple and rational manner instead of an emotional 
manner, that Canada needs to have all his powers in Ottawa, that 
Quebec feels that its powers should be centralized in Quebec City, 
and that any attempt to transfer powers from Ottawa to Quebec is 
bound to fail?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peterson:</B> Never, Mr. Speaker, will we give the provinces 
power over our monetary system.
<P>
	The Bank of Canada's powers are based on its responsibilities 
for guaranteeing large value transfers, to  create a safer, more 
responsible system for all Canadians, including Quebecers. Why 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16793"> 16793 </A></B>
<P>
decentralize? Destroy what? Our monetary system, the Bank of 
Canada system? That would be stupid, and the hon. memberknows it.
<P>
	Why, during the referendum campaign, did they ask for the right 
to use the Canadian dollar? Were they afraid of using another 
monetary system? Of course they were. Why did they spend so 
much money to support the Canadian dollar when the markets were 
almost predicting Quebec's separation? They were afraid. That is 
why the Bank of Canada must be able to control and guarantee 
transfers as provided for in Bill C-100.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	I will not get into a debate on the other powers that could be 
devolved to the provinces. There is certainly a great deal of overlap 
and duplication in powers. Our Prime Minister said that it would be 
better to work together with all the provinces to better serve 
Canadians in reducing spending, red tape and duplication.
<P>
	As far as manpower is concerned, almost a year ago, the minister 
wrote the Quebec government in an attempt to negotiate something 
in the sector mentioned by the hon. member. He never received an 
answer. This shows the hypocrisy of the Bloc in this House. They 
want to get powers, money and independence without contributing 
to the debate affecting all Canadians. They will continue to do so, 
but we will not be fooled. Even without the Bloc's co-operation, we 
will continue to build with all the other members of this House a 
more effective, more profitable, more generous, more prosperous 
country. And we will do so in spite of the separatists.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I applaud 
the comments of the member for Willowdale. I agree completely 
with everything that he said. The opening comments of my speech 
on this issue were reflective of that.
<P>
	Getting to the issue at hand, co-insurance is very important. It is 
important because there has to be accountability in the marketplace 
and a responsibility if we are going to have monetary controls, if 
we are going to be able to give people any sense of comfort.
<P>
	We must end in a way with the small depositor in particular, 
having some form of protection. As I pointed out in my speech, the 
difficulty of having 100 per cent protection and not having 
co-insurance is that the government then has to step into the 
monetary market to an extent that the small investor is absolved of 
responsibility for his or her investment decisions.
<P>
	That is bad because money is not moral, money is not national. 
Money is neither of those things. Money is a way of exchanging 
value within the entire world community. To isolate depositors to 
federally controlled institutions from the reality of that is to 
introduce into  Canada a system of insulating us from the reality of 
trading money.
<P>
	I point out that there is an almost universal consensus for 
co-insurance. In spite of diverse interests, the banks, the insurance 
industry, both the present and the past superintendents, the 
chairman of the CDIC, the Canadian Institute of Actuaries, 
academics, including most recently the Public Interest Advocacy 
Centre which studied the issue from the consumer's point of view 
and the Senate banking commission, have supported co-insurance.
<P>
	In light of this virtual universal acceptance of the idea of 
co-insurance, would the member who is the chairman of the 
Standing Committee on Finance support an amendment put 
forward at report stage by the Reform Party to seek co-insurance, 
instead of what is currently proposed in this bill?
<P>
<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Much to the regret of the 
House, the hon. member will not be able to respond because the 
time for questions and comments has lapsed. As much as the 
member for Willowdale might like to reply, time has run out.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the 
opportunity to add my voice to those of my hon. colleagues in the 
government in support of Bill C-100.
<P>
	The government has taken the position that the state and its 
officials should not try to do what others can do better. This is 
particularly true when it comes to the world of business and when it 
comes to making sure that we do not stand in the way of private 
sector dynamism. Furthermore, never in Canada's history has it 
been so important to control the cost of government. Our fiscal 
situation demands it and so do Canadians, who are suffering from 
tax fatigue.
<P>
	I raise these points because they represent important 
underpinnings for some of the measures before us: specifically, the 
actions that Bill C-100 will implement regarding corporate 
governance.
<P>
	Underlying the changes to the governance framework is a very 
basic assumption. The simple fact is, no system can forestall any 
financial institution failure unless it is given the authority and 
resources to oversee all management decisions and unless 
institutions are severely restricted in the loans and investments 
they can make. However the price of such a failure safe system, 
even if it did work which I doubt, would be to strip that industry 
from contributing to the dynamism, growth and evolution of our 
economy.
<P>
	This is where the issue of cost also raises its head. To try and 
implement greater micro-management of the financial sector will 
<P>

<B><A NAME="16794"> 16794 </A></B>
<P>
require a veritable army of additional auditors and regulators. This 
is the approach used in the United States. However, at a time when 
governments  must downsize, I do not see this as an option anyone 
here wishes to embrace.
<P>
	The alternative is to take a governance oriented regulatory 
approach by putting greater onus for the well-being of financial 
institutions on the management and the board of directors of 
financial institutions. This is an approach employed by the United 
Kingdom regulators.
<P>
	Whether either approach could be characterized as a more 
efficient system of governance is difficult. Each system functions 
at opposite ends of the spectrum and it would be difficult to 
advocate that one approach was somehow foolproof in preventing 
failure, or better than the other, given the global environment in 
which institutions must operate.
<P>
	As the Secretary of State for International Financial Institutions 
has argued so well, and I concur, our supervisory and regulatory 
systems cannot be positioned as a mechanism or regime dedicated 
to preventing an institutional failure. If we tried to do that, we 
would limit the potential well-being of the financial sector and its 
ability to serve the economy and Canadians. Rather, any specific 
supervisory approach should be built around the fiscal, business 
and economic environments. It is important that the regulatory 
tools be responsive to changes in these environments.
<P>
	The changes in Bill C-100 to the governance for financial 
institutions strike a balance. They are not intrusive. Rather they 
clearly recognize that the role of the Office of the Superintendent 
of Financial Institutions is not, and cannot be, to micro-manage 
financial institutions. They give OSFI due authority but not 
excessive authority to intervene in the governance of financial 
institutions but only when circumstances warrant.
<P>
	I should also highlight that the changes in Bill C-100 build on 
and enhance changes introduced in the wide ranging reform of 
financial statutes of 1992. It was during the 1992 reforms when the 
statutes were revised to require that no more than two-thirds of the 
directors could be affiliated with a financial institution. In other 
words, at least one-third of the directors would have no relationship 
with the company and as a result, would not in any way be 
beholden to management.
<P>
	The 1992 reforms also implemented the requirement that 
important board committees, such as the audit committee, be 
comprised of a majority of unaffiliated directors. These were valid 
and valuable changes, but they left some unfinished business that 
Bill C-100 will complete. They enhance the balance which would 
place onus on management and directors for their own governance 
and yet allow the regulator to intervene where circumstances 
warrant.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I regret to interrupt the hon. 
member, but it being 1.30 p.m. the House will now proceed to the 
consideration of Private Members' Business as listed on today's 
Order Paper.

	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the Parliament should adopt specific 
measures to enable and ensure access by members of Parliament to all judicial, 
quasi-judicial and administrative hearings held under the provisions of the 
Immigration Act, the Young Offenders Act and the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, the motion exhorts the government to put 
in place measures that would allow members of Parliament access 
to what are now closed door procedures under three separate 
federal statutes. The exhortation is for access, not a procedure for 
making submissions or representations. It is merely for access, 
presence or entry into procedures which deal with the rights and 
liberties of Canadians behind closed doors.
<P>
	I have three short anecdotes gained from my several years of 
experience as a member of Parliament where, as have all of us in 
the House, I confronted barriers to access for members of 
Parliament when fulfilling our duties.
<P>
	The first anecdote has to do with an Immigration Act refugee 
hearing about five years ago. Someone came to me to ask for my 
assistance in gaining a visitor visa for a brother. I did what I could. 
In the end after two or three interventions and a lot of work a visa 
was issued. The brother came and in complete disregard of all that 
had happened and the good faith of the family, he made an 
application for refugee status. I knew the man was a liar. I also 
knew he had put forth false information. I knew that the applicant 
would be presenting that false information at a refugee hearing.
<P>
	Therefore I followed it very closely, particularly because what 
had happened was an abuse of my office and collectively involved 
the offices of all members of Parliament. I owed a duty to my 
constituents and to Canadians to make sure that my MPs office was 
not abused.
<P>
	I went to the hearing where to my surprise I found that it was a 
closed door hearing and I could not be admitted. As things turned 
out, the hearing was adjourned. I made an application for access 
and it was granted. I was allowed to be present at the hearing but in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16795"> 16795 </A></B>
<P>
the end I did not have to present evidence. The application was 
denied and the man was deported. Under a federal statute a  hearing 
can take place and under a law enacted by the House MPs do not 
have access. That case worked out reasonably well but it caused me 
concern.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	There were two subsequent cases, one involving the prosecution 
of a young offender charged with murder under the Criminal Code. 
In that case I did not need to have access at the time, but I did take 
note of the provisions of the Young Offenders Act that can exclude 
individuals or groups from young offender hearings. A little light 
went on and I thought it was not healthy to have a statute enacted 
by the House excluding members of Parliament not specifically but 
generically. That was another case.
<P>
	A third case involved parole hearings. Under current legislation 
there is no provision for access by any of the public to those 
hearings. In one particular Parole Act statute, and I do not know 
when it was repealed, MPs and senators were given access to parole 
hearings. Under the current Corrections and Conditional Release 
Act there is the absence of any provision to provide access to MPs 
or to allow the public access to those hearings.
<P>
	I was at the Warkworth Institution about four years ago and had 
the benefit of attending a hearing, thanks to the decision of an 
inmate and his solicitor. It was useful to walk through the process 
at the time. There is hardly a member of Parliament in this place 
who will not be called upon at some point in his or her career to 
address issues involving hearings under the three statutes. My 
motion raises the issue for consideration by the House.
<P>
	We are accountable to our constituents for the effectiveness and 
fairness of every procedure under all federal statutes. We are 
responsible to ensure the collective rights and liberties of our 
constituents are protected and are not abused by the procedures. We 
enact the laws and we are accountable to our constituents for them.
<P>
	We are legislators but as history has evolved members of 
Parliament are also ombudsmen. That second role means that we 
must have as much access and freedom as an ombudsman in any 
provincial government, in any municipal government or at the 
federal government level. At the moment in the three federal 
statutes there are barriers to that access.
<P>
	To the extent that MPs are unable to access the procedures, we 
run the risk of impairing our role as ombudsmen. The purpose of 
the motion is to get us all thinking a bit about our roles in particular 
under the three statutes. We must consider what we do when we 
enact statutes in the House and roll back to some degree the present 
barriers.
<P>
	For the sake of the record I will cite the sections of the three 
statutes. In the Young Offenders Act it is subsection 39(1) and 
subsection 39(3). In the Corrections  and Conditional Release Act it 
is subsection 140(5). In the Immigration Act it is subsection 69(2).
<P>
	I wish to make a few comments about how the role of members 
of Parliament has evolved over the years. I have mentioned the 
legislator role and the ombudsman role. Parliament has evolved 
over the years, but in terms of the newer role of ombudsman it has 
not evolved sufficiently. Our ombudsman role is carried out in part 
based on the privileges of members of Parliament which are fairly 
well articulated, constrained and referred to directly and indirectly 
in the Constitution, in the Parliament of Canada Act and in the 
common law handed down to us when Parliament was created 128 
years ago.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	I do not have to go over them but I will point out that in every 
session of Parliament it is important for MPs to resubmit our 
request to the Sovereign for confirmation of our privileges in the 
House of Commons. The words read somewhat archaically but in a 
real way:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We humbly claim all of our undoubted rights and privileges especially that 
they may have the freedom of speech in their debates, access to Your 
Excellency's person at all seasonable times, and that their proceedings may 
receive from Your Excellency the most favourable construction.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As obscure as some of those words are, they are the request for 
the body of privileges and rights we collectively have in the House 
of Commons. We need them for the most important modern roles 
we have as members of Parliament, legislators and ombudsmen.
<P>
	I was somewhat shocked about two months ago to read a legal 
opinion submitted to a committee by a body created by the House 
for the purpose of assuring Parliament and Canadians of the rights 
and liberties of Canadians in a particular field. The opinion was 
essentially that the body appointed by a statute enacted in 
Parliament did not have the obligation to answer questions put to it 
by members of Parliament at committee. It is a very serious issue 
for members of Parliament and has been for hundreds of years.
<P>
	The legal opinion appeared to me to be completely ignorant of 
parliamentary law, which as I stated earlier is part of the 
Constitution. It verged on being contemptuous of parliamentary 
law. I simply put that on the shelf and say that hopefully there will 
be more on the issues of privilege and disclosure to 
parliamentarians in the new year.
<P>
	There are two ways to address our role as ombudsmen. First, we 
could expand our privileges. Some of us believe that is not a great 
way to go, that there are more effective ways of addressing the 
problems. However we need to ensure our rights and privileges are 
vital, responsive and evergreen in what we need to do in our job as 
members of Parliament. Second, we can be vigilant when enacting 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16796"> 16796 </A></B>
<P>
legislation to ensure that our role as MPs is not impaired in 
connection with procedures under the  statutes. The motion before 
us today is attempting to roll back barriers that we have placed in 
the statutes.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	Canadians want to know that their MPs are equipped, fully aware 
and conversant to deal with all of the procedures under federal 
statutes. We enacted them, so we had better know what is going on 
under those procedures. In order to know fully what is going on on 
behalf of our constituents, I say that access is fundamental.
<P>
	When I say access I am not saying that we have to change the 
procedures to allow MPs to make representations, submissions, 
arguments, and get involved in the process; I am simply saying 
access. We should not close the door to ourselves in fulfilling our 
work as MPs.
<P>
	I ask my colleagues, the officials of government, and the 
ministers to take note of this important issue.
<P>
	I will not close without putting on the record what should be to 
all of us in this place self-evident. In our system of government the 
ministers sit in the House. They have burdensome responsibilities. 
I am sure they live 26-hour days. However, in doing their work they 
would be more likely to be ministers of government and less likely 
to be parliamentarians working for Parliament. Their job as 
ministers is to work for the government. They sit in Parliament. I 
suppose that most of them are good parliamentarians, but in terms 
of addressing the parliamentary agenda, very few of them would 
take the initiative to address matters directly on behalf of 
Parliament. That is somebody else's job. Whose job is it? It is not 
the ministers', it is the parliamentarians' job. It is the job of every 
member of Parliament and every senator who sits in Parliament.
<P>
	In dealing with this issue we must not look to government. We 
must not look to ministers. We must look to ourselves. Hopefully 
the ministers will acquiesce in the constructive, positive things we 
do for Parliament.
<P>
	Everything we do for Parliament will be handed down to our 
children and their children. We must not let this place atrophy. We 
must ensure that Parliament and its procedures are responsive to 
and vital for Canadians. It is our job to do that.
<P>
	I leave this motion with the exhortation that it is our job to do 
this. Hopefully there will be support for this type of initiative, not 
just in this motion but as we pass legislation in the future.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
speak today to Motion M-39, moved on January 18, 1994, by the 
hon. member for Scarborough-Rouge River, which reads as 
follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the Parliament should adopt specific 
measures to enable and ensure access by Members  of Parliament to all judicial, 
quasi-judicial and administrative hearings held under the provisions of the 
Immigration Act, the Young Offenders Act, and the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This motion refers to three acts. As a general rule, court hearings 
are public. In camera hearings are the exception. It is not very hard 
to understand that confidentiality may be required when the life, 
freedom or security of a person could be put at risk by public 
hearings.
<P>
	In immigration matters, the court that rules on refugee status 
claims is the Immigration and Refugee Board, the IRB.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	The IRB is made up of three divisions: the Refugee Division, 
where proceedings are normally held in camera; the Appeal 
Division, where normally proceedings are public; the Adjudication 
Division, where normally proceedings are public also.
<P>
	Section 69(2) of the Immigration Act provides that: ``Subject to 
subsections (3) and (3.1), proceedings before the Refugee Division 
shall be held in the presence of the person who is the subject of the 
proceedings, wherever practicable, and be conducted <I>in camera</I> or, 
if an application therefor is made, in public''. This is the provision 
the member's motion deals with.
<P>
	Subsection (3.1) adds that: ``Where the Refugee Division 
considers it appropriate to do so, it may take such measures and 
make such order as it considers necessary to ensure the 
confidentiality of any hearing held in respect of any application 
referred to in subsection (3)''. The legislator has therefore 
established the confidential nature of hearings before IRB 
commissioners, since the refugee claimant may have to give details 
about his life and the dangers he had to face. Sometimes, as is the 
case with rape victims, they have to describe intimate situations 
and circumstances that the public does not have the right to know.
<P>
	On the other hand, confidentiality is not needed in appeal cases 
dealing mostly not with facts but points of law. Thus, sections 
80(1) provides that ``Subject to subsections (2) and (3), an appeal 
to the Appeal Division shall be conducted in public''. This is the 
general principle.
<P>
	The exception is covered by subsection 80(2). It reads: ``Where 
the Appeal division is satisfied that there is a serious possibility 
that the life, liberty or security of any person would be endangered 
by reason of the appeal being conducted in public, the Appeal 
Division may, on application therefor, take such measures and 
make such order as it considers necessary to ensure the 
confidentiality of the appeal''.
<P>
	As for the Young Offenders Act, it states, under subsection 39(1) 
that: ``Subject to subsection (2), where a court of justice before 
whom proceedings are carried  out under this Act is of the opinion 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16797"> 16797 </A></B>
<P>
(<I>a</I>) that any evidence or information presented to the court or 
justice would be seriously injurious or seriously prejudicial to
<P>
	(i) the young person who is being dealt with in the proceedings,
<P>
	(ii) a child or young person who is witness in the proceedings, or
<P>
	(iii) a child or young person who is aggrieved by or the victim of 
the offence charged in the proceedings, or (<I>b</I>) that it would be in the 
interest of the public morals, the maintenance of order or the proper 
administration of justice to exclude any or all members of the 
public from the courtroom, the court or justice may exclude any 
person from all part of the proceedings if the court or justice deems 
that person's presence to be unnecessary to the conduct of the 
proceedings''.
<P>
	This provision is very clear as it relates to young offenders. This 
piece of legislation is based on the principle of rehabilitating young 
offenders. While the need for punishment is recognized, the focus 
is on rehabilitation into the community to preserve the public 
peace. That is why it strongly protects the young offenders' 
identity, disclosure of which to the media, as well as the disclosure 
of any fact that could give away their identity, being forbidden.
<P>
	Also, the presence of observers is controlled to ensure fair 
treatment to all. There is a strict procedure governing admission to 
hearings, and it is difficult to see why these measures ought to be 
changed. Once can easily imagine what impact the presence of a 
member of Parliament in the courtroom would have on a young 
offender. And what use would this information be to the member, 
since none of it can be disclosed in any case?
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	The third statute referred to in the motion is the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act. Subsection 141(4) of that act provides 
that: ``The commission may, to the extent deemed absolutely 
necessary, prevent the communication of information to an 
offender, if it has reasonable grounds to believe that such 
communication would be against the public interest, would 
jeopardize the safety of a person or of the penitentiary, or would 
jeopardize the holding of a legal inquiry''.
<P>
	Looking at the three above-mentioned statutes, I think that 
Parliament was right, in the specific cases that were mentioned, to 
allow in-camera proceedings and to protect confidentiality of files, 
as well as the right to privacy of individuals.
<P>
	I realize that the hon. member for Scarborough-Rouge River 
seeks to facilitate the job of parliamentarians by, among other 
things, ensuring that they can attend any judicial, quasi-judicial or  
administrative hearing, if only to verify the administration of 
federal statutes.
<P>
	However, there are other ways of assessing the effectiveness of a 
piece of legislation. Let us not forget that separating the legislative 
and judicial powers is a basic principle to ensure a sound 
democracy. In that sense, the presence of a member of Parliament, 
who is a symbol of political power, would not always be a good 
thing in the situations targeted by the hon. member's motion.
<P>
	The Immigration Act best exemplifies the negative impact that 
the presence of an MP could have on a refugee claimant, who may 
never have appeared before a court in his country of origin, and 
who does not really know Canada's rules and policies in that 
regard. Such a presence could often be intimidating for the 
claimant. This is especially true if the claimant knows that the MP 
is not particularly receptive to his claim. This is sometimes the 
case, as in the Malik affair, which took place in Toronto, in 1991, 
and to which the hon. member for Scarborough-Rouge River just 
referred.
<P>
	These three statutes all authorize in-camera proceedings or 
public hearings. At certain stages of the process, they require that 
some restrictions be applied, so as to ensure protection of, among 
other things, the right to privacy. Why should members of 
Parliament be allowed to violate these rights, and what use would 
they make of the information obtained?
<P>
	This is the real issue. For all these reasons, I oppose Motion 
M-39.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in my short period as a member of Parliament this will be 
the third private member's bill I have had the pleasure to speak to 
and in favour of. The first two were from the member for York 
South-Weston and the member for Hamilton-Wentworth.
<P>
	I am happy to see a motion such as this with the common sense 
attached to it the Canadian people have been talking about for 
many years, with government not listening. I am dismayed that 
common sense motions that reflect the mood of the Canadian 
people have not been forthcoming from the government and the 
ministers themselves. They primarily come through private 
members' motions.
<P>
	I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to Motion No. 39 
today put forward by the member for Scarborough-Rouge River. I 
understand the intent of the motion. It is a terrific motion. It is long 
overdue.
<P>
	The motion seeks to open up judicial and quasi-judicial hearings 
to members of Parliament. The member is quite right when he talks 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16798"> 16798 </A></B>
<P>
about how an MP's daily role now takes on the form in many cases 
of an ombudsman. We are elected to represent our constituents. 
The people  come to us with many concerns they want us to help 
them with.
<P>
<B>(1400 )</B>
<P>
	A number of constituents have asked me what is wrong with the 
system. Why is this person in the country when he has such a 
terrible criminal record in the country he came from? Does no one 
know about these things? What goes on in those hearings?
<P>
	The case the hon. member was involved with, the Malik case, 
was an example. It was not, as I understand it, criminal activity, but 
the individual had entered Canada under pretences. I understand he 
applied for a visitor's visa and the member went to bat for him on 
it, and then when the person arrived as a visitor he promptly 
claimed to be a refugee. Without the knowledge of this the refugee 
board would have no idea about the deceptive method by which the 
person came to Canada.
<P>
	I disagree with the member for Bourassa when he said that this 
person's position could have been prejudiced. Truth never 
prejudices anything. Truth is always what we as MPs should be 
looking to see prevails in every case.
<P>
	In his motion the member refers specifically to such hearings 
held under the Immigration Act, the Young Offenders Act, and the 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act. As members know, in 
our lifetimes we have been absolutely frustrated and bewildered at 
times by some of the decisions that have come out of these three 
institutions.
<P>
	We ask how the parole hearings can possibly release this person 
into society. We may never know why some of these things happen. 
We would never know unless somehow we as MPs, as the 
ombudsmen for our constituents, had some form of access. I am 
sure the member is not talking about intervener status or advocacy 
status. I believe that in the bill he is simply talking about automatic 
observer access to hearings, so that when he as a member of 
Parliament, a representative of the Canadian people, sees that 
something is going on that is simply not right, he will be better able 
to speak about it in the House of Commons and maybe in some 
legislation to try to correct the wrong that is being done or the 
interpretation of the rules that is not conducive to what the 
Canadian people feel.
<P>
	Certainly the three institutions the member lists are the very 
three I have had the most trouble with in my lifetime with regard to 
their decisions. I support the member's bill with regard to these 
three institutions.
<P>
	I am aware that particular members of my own party, the Reform 
Party, have been involved in the process and have experienced first 
hand some of the barriers that face MPs when they attempt to 
attend some of these quasi-judicial hearings. I am referring to the 
members for Fraser Valley West and Calgary Northeast.
<P>
	The member opposite thinks this is a joking matter. But the fact 
is in these two instances a refugee had committed some serious 
crimes in Canada and the immigration people were trying to get 
this person out of the country. The person went before a hearing 
and the member for Fraser Valley West was in fact prevented from 
attending it. The member had personal firsthand knowledge of 
some of the things that may not have been brought out there. He 
was not allowed to present them. I understand that; that is proper. 
But the members of this quasi-judicial committee were not 
regarding this case in the fullest sense of the circumstances.
<P>
<B>(1405)</B>
<P>
	This was of great concern to the member for Fraser Valley West, 
because he had the protection of society as his first thought in 
mind. There was the very real possibility that if this individual had 
been granted refugee status he would have been a threat to the 
public safety of the citizens of British Columbia. He had a lengthy 
criminal record, including a charge of rape. However, as these MPs 
found out, the safety and the rights of victims are secondary to the 
rights of a criminal before a quasi-judicial body.
<P>
	I know that the member for Scarborough-Rouge River has had 
personal incidents where he has run up against the same type of 
situation, where he was barred from attending a hearing. Motion 
M-39 would seek to change this situation by permitting automatic 
observer access to these hearings. Based on the member's own 
experience, I can fully understand the intent of the motion.
<P>
	There are a couple of things we have to be very clear and very 
careful about. I am sure the member in his motion does not imply 
this in any way, but we have to be careful that MPs are not 
permitted to interfere in any way with the operations and decisions 
of these hearings as a participant. Nor should an MP be permitted 
to put pressure on the people who are conducting the hearings.
<P>
	I suppose the motion-and perhaps the member for Bourassa has 
taken this opinion-could be interpreted in such a way that an MP 
would have some sort of official status or presence in the hearing. I 
do not think that is the intent of the motion. The wording should be 
examined very carefully: specific measures should be adopted to 
enable and ensure access for MPs. The word that needs to be 
clarified is ``access''. This could be taken to mean a whole range of 
things. I agree with the hon. member for Scarborough-Rouge 
River that his meaning of this is very specific and narrow. 
However, it could be interpreted, as it was by the member for 
Bourassa, as being perhaps prejudicial to any of these hearings.
<P>
	Time goes quickly when speaking on a bill of such importance, 
and so I will close. Although this bill will certainly enable the MPs 
to do their job as ombudspersons for the people they represent and 
it will  go a long way to helping us, I really believe that ultimately 
this government will have to take a look at the legislation that 
covers these institutions and make major reforms to them so that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16799"> 16799 </A></B>
<P>
the Canadian people once again can have some confidence in these 
quasi-judicial bodies that are supposed to protect our society.
<P>
	My party and I will support the member's motion. We wish him 
success in this motion, wherever it may travel from here.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
proud to live in a country that is seen around the world as being 
kind, compassionate and welcoming as a nation. Over the past few 
decades we have opened our hearts to tens of thousands of 
refugees. We have been a safe haven in a world of hunger, death 
and tribulation.
<P>
<B>(1410 )</B>
<P>
	A key element of our refugee determination system is the 
Immigration and Refugee Board. The board was established in 
1989 to allow refugee claimants the right to an oral hearing. These 
hearings are usually not open to the public. There are a number of 
very good reasons for this.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A number of applicants are worried that what they say during 
their hearing with a view to obtaining refugee status might reach 
the ears of groups involved in persecution in their country of 
origin. Even if they are safe here in Canada, they fear that relatives 
and friends may be exposed to reprisals for their statements.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We may have difficulty imagining that possibility from here in 
Canada. It is sometimes hard to imagine that there are regimes 
where you could be arrested, tortured, or killed for your beliefs or 
for the beliefs of your friends and associates. We must remember 
this. If we want the truth, and that is what the refugee hearings are 
all about, we need to make sure the claimant feels that he or she has 
the full opportunity to be heard.
<P>
	We are also concerned with having a system that is open to the 
public. Accountability is a vital and cherished cornerstone of our 
governing system. That is why we have struck a balance between 
the right of the public to know and the right of the claimant to 
protection and security.
<P>
	It is a principle of Canadian law that judicial and quasi-judicial 
decision making take place in an open and transparent 
environment. The hearings held by the immigration appeals 
division, for example, are held in public. But as I have said, 
sometimes there must be limits on that openness and transparency. 
That kind of limit is indeed even enshrined in the Canadian Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms in section 1, which talks about reasonable 
limits prescribed by law that can be demonstrably  justified in a 
free and democratic society. The balance provided in the 
Immigration Act between the rights of the claimant and the rights 
of the Canadian public was intended to respect the competing 
charter concerns.
<P>
	There are two ways in which an individual or the news media can 
gain access to the hearing: either the claimant can consent to the 
presence of the individual, or the hearing panel can, in response to 
an application, declare the hearing open to the public. In the latter 
case, the burden is on the claimant to establish that the life, liberty, 
or security of any person would be endangered by a public hearing.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It would be very worthwhile for members to let their constituents 
know what really goes on in these hearings. It would be very 
difficult to understand an applicant's objecting to the presence of a 
representative of the Canadian Parliament, except in very unusual 
circumstances.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Is an amendment needed to achieve this level of access to the 
hearing process? Are lawyers and other counsel advising their 
clients to resist access by parliamentarians to the hearings? Are 
members of Parliament being left only with the recourse of 
litigating the issue of access before the refugee division and the 
courts? No, they are not.
<P>
	Accountability is a hallmark of good government. The Canadian 
government has always held the public's right to know to be 
sacrosanct. It is a principle we will never abandon. Liberty, justice, 
and freedom demand this. Sometimes the need for individual 
security demands privacy. An individual's right to safety and 
protection is another cornerstone of our society. It means we often 
have to strike a delicate balance. I believe our system does this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of Motion No. 39. I 
congratulate the member for Scarborough-Rouge River for 
having introduced the motion.
<P>
	He touches on something even deeper than what he remarked on 
in his own speech. That is, while we all agree that judicial 
processes should be as transparent as possible, this is particularly 
important when it comes to order in council appointments.
<P>
	One of the things he failed to touch on in his speech is what we 
are dealing with here are boards and tribunals of a quasi-judicial 
nature, which may have officers of the judicial body who are 
appointed by government. The motion is very important in this 
regard, for if you have a quasi-judicial body that consists of 
government appointees and you do not have a mechanism whereby 
the deliberations of that body can always be monitored by a 
<P>

<B><A NAME="16800"> 16800 </A></B>
<P>
representative of the elected people or by the public  in some way 
or another, then you have a very dangerous problem.
<P>
<B>(1415 )</B>
<P>
	I looked at the Immigration Act where it describes the conditions 
for in camera proceedings. I also noted the remark by the member 
for Bourassa who said that only the refugee status hearings were 
the ones held in camera. I submit that the refugee status hearings 
are precisely those hearings where all the action takes place. This is 
where we measure whether or not the quasi-judicial body is doing 
its job. This is where we measure whether or not the people 
appearing before it should be granted refugee status.
<P>
	When it comes to the role of the opposition and the role of all 
members of Parliament in all this, I would expect that opposition 
members and government members would be extremely interested 
in how a refugee board or a parole board was performing. This is 
exactly what we should be doing. The member for 
Scarborough-Rouge River has a very good point that at the very 
least if we cannot open these hearings to journalists and the public 
at large, a member of Parliament should be able to attend them 
freely.
<P>
	This is no worse a level of entrusting confidentiality than we 
would to a minister, a priest or any other person who has a 
particular position of confidence and importance in the public eye. 
Who could be more important, if I may say, in the public's eye than 
someone elected to represent the people?
<P>
	The question that follows is whether the elected member will 
hear something he or she should not hear. The member for 
Bourassa was citing examples where there might be descriptions of 
personal abuse. I expect members on all sides of the House would 
respect the reasonable confidences of the innocent people whose 
testimony they may hear.
<P>
	On the other hand, members hear independently the performance 
of the judicial board. For example, it is very important in the 
interests of democracy to make sure that order in council 
appointments are not gross patronage. We want to know that the 
people appointed by the government are people of quality who can 
do the job. How can we do that unless a member of Parliament 
from either side sits in on the proceedings?
<P>
	In the final analysis, the MP has an important role in all of this 
quite apart from checking the quality of the job done by the 
members of the tribunal or that justice has served the person 
appearing before the tribunal. The member of Parliament has the 
ultimate responsibility because he or she is the law maker. We are 
the law makers. We cannot make laws unless we can see clearly for 
ourselves in person that the laws are working. If there is any area of 
government whatsoever where the law maker, the member of 
Parliament, cannot go in and see  whether the laws are working, 
then we have a very serious problem.
<P>
	I congratulate the member for Scarborough-Rouge River for 
raising this matter because it is a very large and important issue. I 
would suggest to the members of the Bloc that they should consider 
this very carefully. They are always saying they believe in the 
parliamentary system, parliamentary democracy and the need for 
transparency, and I believe them. I would suggest they reconsider 
this motion and give it their full support.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria-Haliburton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to stand and support Motion No. M-39 on behalf of 
the member for Scarborough-Rouge River. This is the second 
private member's motion brought forward by the member to which 
I have had the pleasure and privilege of speaking.
<P>
	The member for Scarborough-Rouge River is once again 
bringing to all members of the House a problem that requires very 
little effort to rectify. However it may cause members of 
Parliament to be left in a difficult position when it comes to giving 
proper representation to cases involving the Immigration Act, the 
Young Offenders Act, and the Corrections and Conditional Release 
Act. Members of Parliament must be allowed to represent the 
people who elected them to the full ability they are given under the 
law and to ensure that they have access to all information 
concerning the aforementioned acts.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	At the present time an immigration hearing is off limits to 
individual members of Parliament. This is a problem particularly if 
the member is privy to information which may better represent the 
truth than the story being presented.
<P>
	If a family promotes a visitor to Canada through the assistance 
and help of a member of Parliament and assures the member of 
Parliament that the person will return to their native land on a 
specific date, and if the visitor then applies for refugee status upon 
arrival and asks for welfare in the interim, that is a direct abuse of 
the system. It may well be that the member of Parliament is the 
only person aware of the original application and the promises 
which were made at that time. Therefore, why is the act very 
specific in section 69(2), which reads that the proceedings before 
the refugee division, et cetera are to be conducted in camera?
<P>
	Members of Parliament are elected both to serve as legislators 
and to act as de facto ombudsmen. In cases where the member of 
Parliament has an interest and where he or she feels there may be 
an injustice, they should be allowed observer status automatically. 
That is not to say that any member of Parliament can attend any 
closed door meeting going on at any time. The member must be 
allowed to attend the meeting in which he or she has an interest and 
may be in a position to dispel some  of the myths which are present 
at a number of these closed door meetings.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="16801"> 16801 </A></B>
<P>
	In the case of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act of 
which I am well aware from my experience on the parole board, the 
parole board may decide at its option to exclude anyone it wishes 
from the hearing. In other words, it may decide that no witnesses 
are allowed: no family, no friends or character witnesses who may 
help the person to gain parole or in fact lose parole. That is allowed 
under section 140(5) of the act.
<P>
	Once again a member of Parliament is removed from the role 
even as observer status in a hearing which may affect the 
community into which the person could be released on a parole 
pass, even though the member of Parliament may have important 
knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the release of the 
offender.
<P>
	The hon. member for Scarborough-Rouge River is not asking 
for a huge change in these acts. It is a change which can be 
accomplished with the stroke of a pen if the motion is passed. It is a 
necessary item of business which requires very few administrative 
dollars. It opens up the system and makes it transparent. It will help 
all members of Parliament to function in a more complete manner 
for the people who have elected them.
<P>
	I urge the support of all members for Motion No. M-39 
sponsored by the hon. member for Scarborough-Rouge River. Let 
us open up the closed door meetings of these agencies and allow 
members of Parliament to further serve their electors in an effort of 
fairness for all.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hon. member for 
Scarborough-Rouge River, under whose name Motion No. M-39 
stands, has asked the Chair if there would be unanimous consent to 
grant him under right of reply one minute to close the debate. It 
must be clearly understood that no one can speak after his 
intervention.
<P>
	Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as we wrap up debate on this motion I would like to thank 
all members for their interventions.
<P>
	I confirm that the intent of the motion is not to open up closed 
door hearings completely and not to disclose confidences of 
witnesses and parties to hearings. It is not to embarrass anyone. It 
is to facilitate the work which we all do as MPs from time to time. 
It is to ensure that in the future our legislation is sensitive to and

federal system of government.
