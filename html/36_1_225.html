</I></B></P><P align=left>The House proceeded to the consideration of Bill C-72, an act to 
amend the Income Tax Act, to implement measures that are 
consequential on changes to the Canada-U.S. Tax Convention (1980) 
and to amend the Income Tax Conventions Interpretation Act, the 
Old Age Security Act, the War Veterans Allowance Act and certain 
acts related to the Income Tax Act, as reported (with amendment)

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, in the time allotted to me 
this morning, I will provide some context for the thinking behind 
the 1998 budget and then highlight some of the measures that were 
included in this particular bill which forms the income tax side 
of the 1998 budget itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the 1998 budget reconfirmed our balanced approach to 
building a strong economy and a secure society.  The federal 
books are balanced.  We have put an end to credit card 
government.  We indicated in the 1998 budget and have continued 
to reduce Canada's debt burden through a two-front strategy of 
stronger economic growth and a concrete debt repayment plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As government members, we have always said and we recognize that 
a healthy bottom line is a means to an end, not an end in itself. 
In the 1998 budget we have also included the Canadian 
opportunities strategy, which included the millennium scholarship 
program, as well as other programs.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1998 budget represents the second stage of a three part plan 
that we put together in 1994.  The Minister of Finance said that 
this plan was not simply a theme for one budget or one year.  It 
has defined our approach from the beginning and will define our 
approach in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, as in the previous budgets, we reduced the deficit.  With 
the 1998 budget we balanced the books and have begun the process 
of debt reduction.  In future budgets we will stay the course. 
The 1999 budget proved these words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we have invested in the future.  Over 80% of the 
spending in the 1998 budget reflected two of the highest 
priorities of Canadians:  access to knowledge and skills, and 
support for health and education through increased transfers to 
the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we reduced taxes initially in the 1998 budget in a 
targeted way.  As soon as the country's resources permit we will 
broaden and deepen the process.  As we saw in the 1999 budget, 
that is exactly what the government did.  Collectively, the 1998 
and 1999 budgets provided $16.5 billion of tax relief to 
Canadians.  This is an approach that is delivering real benefits 
for Canadians today.  It is certainly a robust outlook for Canada 
as we start the new millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I go through and highlight some of Bill C-72, I will take a 
moment and comment on what members will probably hear from the 
Reform Party, the Bloc and other opposition parties. These 
parties will say that the government is off track.  We will argue 
that we are not.  The true test will be what Canadians think. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we conclude our prebudget deliberations from year to year, 
and we are about to start in June and into the fall for the 
upcoming budget, over and over again Canadians reflect on our 
approach.  We have taken a balanced approach in both the 1998 and 
1999 budgets, which is what we will continue to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me highlight some of what is included in Bill C-72.  When 
the finance minister presented the 1998 budget, he noted that 
these measures represent the first steps toward general income 
tax relief.  Each of the budgets have provided targeted tax 
relief where it would be most beneficial.  With the deficit 
behind us, the government is now in a position to introduce broad 
based tax relief while adhering to the principle that such relief 
must not jeopardize our regained fiscal health or impinge on the 
priorities like health care and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>General tax relief as indicated in the 1999 budget will speak 
for itself.  The measures in the bill reduce taxes for low and 
middle income Canadians, those least able to pay.  Two of the 
measures in the 1998 budget provide general tax. For low income 
Canadians, the amount of $6,456 that can be earned tax free is 
increased by $500 effective July 1, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most people will ask, as I am sure the hon. member for Elk 
Island has asked before, how this can actually work.  It was 
explained to the member in committee.  He seems to understand the 
technical matters of this particular bill so I will leave the 
member to refer to the report from committee.  The spousal and 
equivalent to spousal maximums of $5,380 were also increased by 
$500. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this mean?  It means that single taxpayers with 
incomes under $20,000 can earn up to an extra $500 tax free; for 
a family earning under $40,000, the maximum increase would be 
$1,000 tax free.  As a result of this measure, 400,000 low income 
individuals will be removed from the tax rolls and another 4.6 
million taxpayers will pay less income tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1999 budget was a follow up on the 1998 budget and in fact 
continued on the same track.  The 1999 budget extended this $500 
increase to all taxpayers and raised it by a further $175, 
increasing the basic exemption by $675.  Canadians are now able 
to earn $7,044 tax free in 1999 and $7,131 in the year 2000.  In 
addition, the maximum spousal and equivalent to spousal amounts 
will increase to $6,055.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These measures will benefit 600,000 low income Canadians, 
400,000 will pay no federal tax as a result of Bill C-72 and 
another 200,000 will disappear from the tax rolls because of the 
1999 measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second measure providing tax relief in the 1998 budget is 
the elimination of the 3% general surtax for people earning under 
$50,000 and a reduction in the surtax for those with incomes 
between $50,000 and $65,000.  Members may recall, and there may 
be people in the gallery who will recall, that when the 
Conservatives were in office they put in place a 3% surtax to pay 
for the deficit.  What we have always said is that once the books 
were balanced the 3% surtax would be the first tax measure we 
would deal with, and the 1998 budget did so in a targeted 
fashion.  The surtax has been eliminated for almost 13 million 
filers and it has been reduced for another one million Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1999 budget is very much intertwined with the 1998 budget. 
In 1998 we targeted the reduction of the 3% surtax to those 
earning below $50,000 and in the 1999 budget we will have 
eliminated the surtax completely for 15.1 million Canadian 
taxpayers as of July 1, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In every budget our government has provided targeted tax relief 
where the need was greatest and the benefits most substantial. 
The 1998 budget was no different.  It introduced the Canadian 
opportunities strategy which was designed to ensure that all 
Canadians have an equal opportunity to participate in the 
changing economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members know that many students have limited access to 
post-secondary education because of financial barriers.  Bill 
C-72 implements several measures which will financially benefit 
students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, for some students a federal tax credit of 17% of 
interest paid on federal and provincial student loans was 
introduced, which will provide tax relief for about one million 
students.  A student with a $25,000 loan, which is the average, 
would typically see a federal-provincial tax reduction of $530 in 
the first year alone.  The new credit would mean about $3,200 in 
tax relief over a 10 year pay down period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  You're keeping me awake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  The hon. member says that I am keeping 
him awake.  I am thankful, and I am sure his constituents are 
very thankful, that he is staying awake.  It is not often that 
the member stays awake in this Chamber.  I thank him for the 
compliment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This tax credit complements other student assistance measures 
announced in the 1998 budget, such as graduated interest relief 
and extended loan repayment periods which will assist a further 
100,000 students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To help Canadians upgrade their skills through full time study, 
often difficult for those in the workplace, Bill C-72 includes 
measures such as tax free RRSP withdrawals for lifelong learning. 
It is not uncommon, as I am sure hon. members across the way and 
certainly members on this side of the House are aware, to find 
that there are constituents back home who find themselves in a 
job, in a position, they are employed.  They have been able to 
put away some money in RRSPs, but they need to upgrade their 
skills and they find themselves unable to access money to do 
that.  Much like the homeowner program which utilizes the 
registered retirement savings plan, this program would allow 
Canadians to access tax free RRSP money for lifelong learning in 
order for them to upgrade their skills and to further their 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An individual who is enrolled in full time training for at least 
three months can withdraw a maximum of $10,000 per year from 
their RRSP up to a limit of $20,000 over four years.  The money 
must be repaid to their RRSP program over a 10 year period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another measure in Bill C-72 extends the education credit to 
many part time students who are trying to balance work, family 
and other commitments.  Students can claim a credit for each 
month they are enrolled in a qualifying course which is at least 
three weeks in duration and meets a minimum of 12 hours per 
month.  That also facilitates lifelong learning for about 250,000 
part time students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure members will recall that in the 1998 budget the 
government made some improvements to what is known as the 
registered education savings plan.  The 1998 budget introduced 
the Canada education savings grant. 
I have received a number of calls and a number of constituents 
have contacted me to find out about the program.  I am sure the 
same is true for hon. members across the way.   They include 
grandparents, parents, aunts and uncles who want to contribute to 
their niece's or nephew's, grandson's or granddaughter's 
educational savings program.  The government has provided a 20% 
grant on the first $2,000 put into a registered education savings 
plan for children under 18.  That is a maximum of $400 per year 
that the federal government will contribute to that program to 
help young Canadians access post-secondary education.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-72 also proposes additional changes to RESPs.  It is 
important to note that disabled part time students will now be 
eligible for educational assistance payments from RESPs for the 
first time.  Families whose children do not pursue higher 
education would be able to transfer up to $50,000 from their 
registered education savings plan to their registered retirement 
savings plan.  That is an increase of $10,000.  That creates a 
bit more flexibility in the registered education savings plan 
which will encourage more Canadians to contribute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the new caregiver credit which provides Canadians 
caring for an elderly parent or a disabled family member a tax 
reduction.  This credit will assist about 450,000 caregivers who 
are not normally eligible for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important measure which was included in the 1998 budget, 
and I am hopeful that members opposite will draw attention to it 
because many of their constituents will benefit from it, will 
benefit self-employed Canadians.  As a result of the 1998 budget 
self-employed Canadians will now be able to deduct health and 
dental insurance premiums from their business incomes.  We have 
allowed that particular measure to go forward.  I know that the 
Canadian Federation of Independent Business was a big promoter of 
that measure, as well as a number of members opposite.  Members 
on this side of the House have consistently fought for 
self-employed Canadians.  This is an example of an initiative 
that will help that sector of the business community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Volunteer firefighters, under previous legislation, received 
$500 tax free for their volunteer efforts.  In the 1998 budget we 
have increased it to $1,000 and will extend it to other emergency 
service volunteers such as ambulance technicians and search and 
rescue volunteers.  There is also a recognition of volunteerism 
in the 1998 budget because we know that individuals, like 
volunteer firefighters, give of their time and contribute to 
their communities.  This is a way for the federal government to 
provide some tax free moneys to them as reimbursement for 
expenses they incur in the work they do for their community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1998 budget continued the government's policy of providing 
targeted tax relief and began the process of ensuring general tax 
relief, starting with low and middle income Canadians.  The 1999 
budget builds on these measures and is part of a long term 
strategy to reduce taxes.  Of course members opposite will simply 
say “Cut taxes at any cost”.  They do not understand that the 
commitment the government has made is to remain in balance.  We 
have provided targeted tax relief in the 1999 budget.  We have 
provided $16.5 billion in tax relief and we have never said that 
this is the end of our tax strategy.  We have always said that 
this is the beginning of our tax strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Together the 1998 and 1999 budgets set us on the track for tax 
relief and will continue to provide tax relief to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. member:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  I see the Conservatives at the other end 
of the Chamber hollering across the way.  I think they are 
hollering in support of Bill C-72. 
The hon. member for Kings—Hants is yelling at a number of 
individuals on the Liberal side.  I would assume he is merely 
saying that he is supportive of Bill C-72 and finds that the tax 
relief is quite adequate as a starting point.  It is certainly 
something that we on this side of the house agree with and we 
will continue to provide tax relief. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1125"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT5"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT5"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1125

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, for a moment, the hon. member for Kings—Hants could pay 
attention to what is going on, then he would understand what tax 
policy is all about and be able to provide some constructive 
suggestions in the debate.  However, I am not sure if that is 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-72 is essentially in line with the government's 
principles of tax policy.  We feel that its relief measures are 
fair.  The initial focus for broad based tax relief is on 
personal income taxes, where the burden is the greatest.  The 
government has said continually that personal income taxes are 
where relief is needed first and that is what the 1998 and 1999 
budgets have provided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most importantly, especially in the context of a lot of rhetoric 
that goes on in the House, given that there is an Ontario 
election campaign on right now and there is a lot of talk about 
tax relief, the measures for tax relief in the 1998 and 1999 
budgets are not financed with borrowed money.  It is the first 
time in decades that a government is providing tax relief to 
Canadians and is not borrowing to provide that relief.  In 
essence, what we have is a reduction in tax relief.  We do not 
have an increase in the deficit.  We do not have an increase in 
the debt.  What we also do not have is what most— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point 
of order.  I was listening to the comments of the parliamentary 
secretary and I would like to advise members to move away from 
him because I am sure lightning is going to strike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The hon. parliamentary 
secretary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member probably 
understands that when one has young children one actually engages 
in discussion about mystic knights, Thor and all of the other 
myths.  In fact, when lightning strikes it is actually supposed 
to be a symbol of good luck, so I would thank the hon. member 
across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess he was taking exception to the point that I was making, 
in essence saying that the government is not borrowing money to 
finance these tax cuts.  Obviously the Reform Party has some 
difficulty with that.  I could point to some previous platform 
documents in which the Reform Party indicated that we, the 
government, should first balance our books before engaging in any 
sort of tax relief.  Obviously today that is not much of an issue 
because it feels the wind is blowing toward tax relief and that 
is where we should be going.  Regardless of whether we put 
ourselves back into a deficit position or increase the debt, 
Reformers are just promoting tax relief for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only reiterate that in every pre-budget consultation I 
have participated in Canadians have consistently said they are in 
favour of tax relief, that they want tax relief, that the burden 
of personal income taxes is too high, but that they are not 
prepared to pay the price of a reduction by decreasing the 
quality of health care or education, or by increasing the deficit 
or the debt.  We very clearly and carefully listened to Canadians 
and that is demonstrated in the 1998 and 1999 budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would reiterate that both the 1998 and 1999 budgets, and 
certainly Bill C-72, represent the starting point for the process 
of ensuring general tax relief.  The 1998 budget started with low 
and middle income Canadians.  The 1999 budget broadened that tax 
relief to include all Canadians.  As we move forward in budgets 
to come we will continue to provide a very balanced approach, one 
that includes investing in Canadian priorities, continuing to 
bring down the tax burden for Canadians and ensuring that we stay 
in balance. 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, ordinary members rise in the House to describe how proud 
or pleased they are to speak to a particular bill.  However, 
today I can only say that I am disappointed with the thrust of 
Bill C-72.  Actually, it is more of a short stab in the dark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary talked in glowing terms of long term 
tax relief.  The bottom line is long term.  Will anybody live 
long enough to actually see tax relief? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My disappointment arises from what is not in this bill, as much 
as what is.  We do not oppose certain measures such as the 
reinstatement of the $5,000 credit for investments in labour 
sponsored venture capital funds.  That simply brings it back up 
to where it was before the government tinkered with it.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand the finance minister cut that amount in 1998 
because certain funds were not doing what they were supposed to 
do.  Fair enough.  But in some regions of the country these funds 
are performing a valuable service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We realize that we cannot simply open the floodgates on 
investments and accept accountability and viable opportunities 
for every dollar that is offered. That is why the Reform Party 
has long advocated increased competition in the financial 
services sector and a removal of foreign asset restrictions on 
RRSP accounts.  This country needs a diverse pool of investment 
money and the widest possible range of opportunities for that 
investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth of the matter is there are clauses in this bill that 
can be commended in principle.  The life learning plan allows 
Canadian residents to take money out of their RRSPs to pay for 
full time training for themselves or their spouses which is 
basically a good idea.  I do not know if everyone in that 
situation can afford full time training—and that is the 
loophole, the catch—as opposed to something a little more 
flexible, but it is a noble effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are aware that RRSP contributions have fallen off in the last 
two years. People just do not have the cash to buy those RRSPs. 
There is something like $126 billion in unused contribution room 
outstanding.  As I said, it is a noble effort and let us hope 
there are a few Canadians out there who can actually afford to 
get retrained and plan on using that training here in Canada 
rather than being forced to go to other lower tax jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That same analysis applies to another program concerning part 
time education.  Eligible part time students can use education 
tax credits and child care expense deductions to go back to 
school.  I presume that helps young single mothers in particular. 
There is a lot of merit in doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can characterize this as a housekeeping bill.  We are a few 
days late in getting the parliamentary rules in place.  Revenue 
Canada's cutoff was about a week ago, but we still have not made 
into law the restrictions and so on that are actually in place 
for last year's Revenue Canada forms.  It is a cart before the 
horse scenario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not fill out the skeletal legislative agenda with bills that 
show vision, imagination and courage rather than something that 
is last year's business?  I guess we would be treading on the 
Liberal's electoral secrets for success:  say little, do less, 
keep your head down.  This is a major disappointment for 
Canadians who are poised to grab their share of the future and 
find themselves regulated to death by their government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we do not see in Bill C-72 is any admission by the finance 
minister, his bureaucrats or any of the Liberal members of the 
finance committee that their tax system is out of control.  We 
see a clause that reduces the individual surtax by a couple of 
bucks.  Who on the government side would dare stand up and defend 
putting taxes on taxes in the first place?  This goes on year 
after year and Canadians still wait for the government to wake up 
and straighten out the mess in the complex tax code it has made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 5% surcharge which remains untouched falls on incomes as low 
as $60,000, not a lot of money in today's economy. There are 
thousands of workers in high tech industries or specialized 
manufacturing who easily make that much, and what do they do? 
They take their skills and their incomes and they maximize them 
south of the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals maintain their punitive tax structures while 
Canadian artists, entrepreneurs, doctors and scientists head for 
friendlier climates. Worst of all, they table bills like this one 
to announce all over again what Canadians already heard about and 
paid for in last year's budget.  They are so hungry for any 
positive PR spin that they keep talking about all the good things 
that really do not add up to any dollars at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard the finance minister claim that the country can 
only afford this style of nickel and dime tax adjustment, that it 
costs the government to give people their own money back.  What a 
ludicrous premise.  We know what it costs because year after year 
the finance minister announces that his programs will cost the 
treasury so many billions of dollars, and he goes ahead and 
subtracts that amount from the nation's books or the taxpayers' 
pockets, whichever is handier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another reason for my disappointment.  This government 
bill takes the opportunity to fiddle with the tax act, but 
instead of simplifying it or even simplifying the language, it 
merely piles more complexity on to the impenetrable pile it 
started decades ago.  Members have risen in this House and read 
out passages from this bill, or have referred to this and other 
bills as being as thick as phone books.  I have said that if the 
tax code was piled up it would be taller than any individual.  I 
can also say that the tax code when piled on the back of a 
taxpayer can drive him to his knees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does Bill C-72 address the complexity or incomprehensibility of 
the tax code?  No it does not.  It merely carries on the age-old 
tradition of defining the taxpayers' responsibility to the 
government and not the government's duty to lighten the burden of 
taxes and to reveal clearly why they are needed and how they will 
be spent.  Accountability, quite a concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the revised explanatory notes that accompanied this bill and 
which were published in March, there are several pages of 
anti-avoidance rules that chase taxpayers into their home offices 
to make sure they are rendering unto Caesar what Caesar decides 
is his. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1135"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT7"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT7"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1135

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ironically, they also include exceptions which allow clever tax 
lawyers to again avoid the taxes that are being chased in the 
first place.  We know from the auditor general's report that 
billions of dollars in potential taxes continue to elude 
governments.  We are aware that despite promises there are still 
loopholes for the well to do to cart off family trusts to lower 
tax regimes around the world.  So much for our complex tax codes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have made it clear that they believe the myth that 
high taxes result in high revenues and that excessive spending 
leads to better service.  We would not have to dig too deep to 
expose how this logic breaks down in the real world.  It is human 
nature to resist when being pushed where we do not want to go. 
When the price of a good or service rises, we look for a bargain 
or reduce our consumption of that article.  If taxes become too 
much of a burden, we seek relief any way we can either by 
avoidance or by going where a more enlightened tax regime offers 
a better deal for our tax dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lower taxes are not the only thing that influences people but it 
starts a cycle of prosperity that solves many other issues. 
Increasingly higher taxes reduce economic activity until there is 
less and less to tax.  Governments see decreasing returns and 
cannot afford the services they claim to uphold.  We have seen 
those cuts to the bone in health care.  This is the opposite of 
what some in the House will say.  They are convinced that high 
taxes alone provide a foundation for services.  They follow this 
logic to its faulty conclusion, a complex tax code, taxes on 
taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand lower taxes do not lead to a lack of services 
for the following reasons.  Given a limitless amount of money to 
spend, it is also human nature to continue to demand limitless 
services to go along with it.  It is human nature for bureaucrats 
to continuously try to satisfy those demands.  What we have seen 
in the last three decades or so is the explosion of government 
spending in an effort to micromanage every aspect of our economic 
and social lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government is everywhere trying to be all things to all people 
and failing at most.  It tries to be charitable but ends up 
subsidizing self-defeating behaviour.  It tries to stimulate a 
business on one side of the street while putting another one out 
of business through higher taxation and artificial competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government creates monopolies and then finds itself in an 
endless process of paying inflated sums to keep the market under 
control. The old adage is if it moves tax it.  If it moves again 
tax it some more.  If it stops moving the government subsidizes 
it so it can tax it when it starts to move again.  That seems to 
fit in very well with this logic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1999 budget we saw an increase in the child tax benefit 
and an admission by the finance minister that the clawback 
provisions are a disincentive for parents to earn more money. 
According to the C.D. Howe Institute, even with the tinkering, 
single earner families with two children with earnings in the 
$20,000 to $30,000 range, which is right around that poverty line 
that has been arbitrarily set, would keep less than $35 from an 
additional $100 earnings. This is true of the worst provinces.  I 
define those as the ones where there are so many overlapping 
federal and provincial programs that Canadians have no choice but 
to sit and wait for the government to tell them what their income 
is going to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-72 we see the same tinkering at work.  The child care 
expense deduction has been increased to $7,000 but it only 
applies to parents who hire people to take care of their kids. 
This has become a fairly common situation in Canadian households. 
Many people are of the opinion that one of the strongest reasons 
for this is that the government takes too much money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian couples should have the decision as to how they are 
going to raise their children.  It has been snatched from their 
hands and placed in the cold dead grip of a disinterested 
bureaucracy with its own social agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxpayers' money not only goes to finance programs to relieve a 
situation that governments create, but it also goes to finance 
lobby groups to perpetuate the myth that Canadian families would 
be in stress without the government rather than because of it. 
Even so, tens of thousands of brave parents make the courageous 
decision to re-order their lifestyle to fit what is best for 
their young children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-72 fails to address another situation that is obvious to 
everyone except the Prime Minister.  On May 3 the Prime Minister 
got up and said the government wiped out bracket creep by 
increasing the personal exemption by a whopping $50 a month.  He 
failed to mention several facts of which the government should 
rightly be embarrassed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only should the basic personal exemption be in excess of 
$8,000 a year, but the Liberals are only going to phase in their 
tinkering over the next two years. It will only go to a maximum 
of $7,131, not nearly enough in today's economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They like to brag on the other side that somewhere between 
400,000 and 600,000 Canadians have been pushed off the tax rolls 
with their generosity.  They fail to mention that 1.4 million 
people have been added back on through the back door to these tax 
rolls because the Liberals have not got around to adjusting the 
tax brackets for inflation.  We call that bracket creep.  That is 
according to the OECD study. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1140"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A KPMG study, and we know how much the finance minister likes 
those when they are in his favour, has shown that the low to 
middle tax bracket of $29,590 should be almost $37,000, an 
increase of over $8,000.  If anybody in the finance department 
had bothered to keep up with the times, the higher tax bracket of 
$59,180 should be over $73,000 just to keep up with inflation. 
That might convince many of our valuable scientists, engineers 
and skilled workers to stay here and add that value to our 
country and our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals would tell us that they cannot afford real tax 
cuts, only the nickel and dime stuff they have been feeding 
Canadians.  In Bill C-72 there is another instalment of surtax 
reduction, although we always hear that it is $500 a year when in 
fact it was $250 last year and $250 this year.  Again, the 
numbers are better when we add them altogether. I wonder if many 
Canadians will actually notice that change in April 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a tax credit for interest paid on student loans which 
is a good thing, but it only applies to the federal government 
student loans, not to the bank student loans.  There is a real 
disparity.  The students who are still going to school can write 
off the federal government part but not the bank loans.  As the 
federal government withdraws from programs such as that, these 
same students find themselves caught on the horns of a dilemma. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder how much better off we would all be if the finance 
minister had not wasted time with the millennium scholarship fund 
and simply had gone to the source.  That was really the 
taxpayers' hard earned surplus in 1998.  If he had turned the 
money back to students who really need it, I think we would have 
got a lot more bang for our buck. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eliminating bracket creep for instance would have put a $900 
million ding into the finance minister's slush fund but would 
have put hundreds of dollars back into the hands of low and 
middle income Canadians, right where they need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also see provisions for people to use their RRSPs for 
something other than a hedge against government incompetence in 
mismanagement of the CPP fund.  People can withdraw money for 
education, which is good.  But since it is their money anyway, it 
is a bit of a shell game as to what they should be able to do 
with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come back to the question of why the government cannot do 
anything more substantial or imaginative than this tinkering we 
see in Bill C-72.  This government will try to use two excuses. 
It will say that it will not cut taxes and it will not tax us 
back into a deficit the same way it taxed us into the high 
spending it did in the first place.  It will also say that it 
wants to be fair to the poor or maintain services that Canadians 
are so proud of, part of our Canadian mosaic, or that it 
apparently represents what we are as a people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen government spending go up the last three years and 
projections that it will continue to do so.  This is hardly a 
prudent way to manage the future.  Our fundamentals are 
supposedly right, but in our minds they are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also seen the insatiable desire of this government to 
hold control of every aspect of health care and social spending 
in its grip, even in the face of the Liberals' proven 
incompetence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said before, we have the cart before the horse with this 
legislation.  We are working with provisions in this bill that 
were actually implemented last year.  The funding was set aside 
last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary in his address earlier this morning 
talked in glowing terms about people below $20,000 being in a tax 
free zone.  I ask what is the big deal?  That is still well below 
the poverty line that is arbitrarily set in Canada, so that is 
really not a whole lot to crow about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in Canada are looking for real tax relief.  The industry 
minister, with supporting statistics from his own department, 
Industry Canada, has acknowledged the realities of a high tax 
system in Canada and what it is doing to our economy here, our 
productivity, as it were. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again the parliamentary secretary talked about the RESPs.  As I 
said before, if we are talking to finance people, a trust fund is 
far more manageable in the RRSP portion of it.  It gives us lots 
more flexibility.  Students can do different things with that. 
They do not have to go to the same type of college or facility 
that the RESPs would direct them to.  It is much more easy and 
much more flexible to put that money into a trust fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The caregiver tax credit of $400 that he so eloquently spoke of 
appears at $11,000 worth of income.  It is nickels and dimes 
again.  It does not go anywhere.  As a caregiver, $400 a year 
does not begin to cover a week's cost when one is caring for an 
invalid or a handicapped person.  It is an insult to these 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary talked in glowing terms and his 
words were that the winds of tax relief were blowing across the 
country.  I would say that the reality is it is not even a gentle 
breeze.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak this morning for the last time on Bill C-72, 
which implements certain measures set out in the 1998 budget 
brought down by the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some hon. members will most certainly recall, and I will take it 
upon myself to remind the others, that in 1998 when the Minister 
of Finance released his budget, we in the Bloc Quebecois had 
some years previously encouraged the government to include 
certain measures that were included in that budget.  Minor as 
they may have been, they were, in our opinion, a step in the 
right direction. 
Our position has not changed fundamentally with respect to those 
highly specific measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally speaking, however, given the broad range of 
possibilities presented to the Minister of Finance in 1998, 
which were included in the latest budget for 1999-2000, we did 
not feel the Minister of Finance had gone far enough.  He 
claimed otherwise, however, concealing the real figures on the 
state of the public purse.  With those real figures, we were 
able to state that the Minister of Finance could have go much 
further with the broad range of possibilities available to him, 
if he had any real compassion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the budget measures from 1998 that we find today in 
Bill C-72, which we had encouraged and applauded at that time, 
and still do today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the $500 increase in the basic personal credit.  We 
supported this measure, although the Minister of Finance could 
have gone even further beyond the tiny step he took. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the surtax reduction for individuals, to a maximum of 
$250.  This too is positive, but does not go far enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the home buyers' plan for the disabled.  Finally, after 
several years of battles, the plan is now in place.  We worked 
on this.  A number of my Bloc Quebecois colleagues worked very 
hard representing associations of the disabled from their 
ridings so that special measures such as the home buyers' plan 
for persons with a disability could become a reality.  We 
applauded this measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are the tax credits for interest on student loans. 
Students too deserve support in their efforts to acquire 
knowledge and to enter the labour market.  In this case too, the 
government has not gone far enough in supporting students in 
Quebec and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an increase in the child care expense deduction.  This 
is a good thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As regards the lifelong learning plan and the matter of tax-free 
withdrawal of funds invested in a registered retirement savings 
plan, here again, when the Bloc Quebecois made public a few 
years ago an analysis of a possible and positive reform of 
personal taxes, we were the first to ask the Minister of Finance 
to use the funds invested in RRSPs for purposes other than 
retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rate of unemployment, as we have seen, has remained fairly 
high. 
We could also see that there were urgent needs, particularly in 
the case of middle income families, and that we should either 
think about using the funds invested in a registered retirement 
savings plan to create self-employment, to allow taxpayers to 
create their own jobs, or about helping them return to the 
labour market, through continuing education programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were happy to see that measure included in the 1998 budget. 
In fact, we supported that initiative when the Minister of 
Finance made it public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we do not agree with the minister—and he is certainly 
not deserving of any praise regarding this aspect of his 1998 
budget—when he says he could not do more than the few positive 
measures found in Bill C-72, because this is utterly false. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Minister of Finance brought down his 1998 budget, he 
claimed there would be a zero surplus for each of the following 
three years. However, we were quick to react and set the record 
straight regarding the 1998-99 figures and the anticipated 
results for 1999-2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998-99, the surplus will exceed $15 billion. We are talking 
about a $15 billion surplus for the fiscal year that ended on 
March 31. In the next fiscal year, the surplus will be $20 
billion.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance is still claiming there is no money 
available. But he forgets to mention that, under the Financial 
Administration Act, all the unexpected surpluses in the previous 
fiscal years were automatically used to pay off part of the 
debt. Last year, over $20 billion went directly to pay back part 
of the capital on the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have nothing against paying off the debt. That is not the 
point. However, when one has a surplus, one must make a number 
of decisions as a good manager of the public treasury. 
Instead of using a portion of the surpluses from last fiscal and 
a portion of the surpluses from this fiscal to help out middle 
income families, he could have provided more assistance for 
unemployed workers and students, given the precarious economic 
situation in which many families have been living in Quebec and 
in Canada since 1997-98. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, the Minister of Finance presented an inaccurate picture 
of the state of the nation's finances.  He then used this 
picture to make his argument that it was impossible for the 
federal government to provide any more assistance to middle 
income families, who have been having a hard time for several 
years now because of him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What could the Minister of Finance have done during fiscal 
1997-98, fiscal 1998-99 and the current fiscal year?  He could 
have done something we have been asking him to do since the 1993 
election, which is to devote some of his precious time to 
federal fiscal reform.  Since 1993, the Bloc Quebecois has come 
up with two possible scenarios for reforming federal taxation, 
one for individual taxpayers and one for corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we released our two reports, the Minister of Finance even 
congratulated us on our good work, but he has done nothing about 
reforming federal taxation since. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, would you please ask the members 
opposite to withdraw if they have matters to discuss?  The 
environment is not conducive to productive exchanges, 
particularly not during a speech on something as basic as the 
future of families in Quebec and in Canada.  Would you please 
ask them to continue their conversation elsewhere? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> I do not think the other 
members were being too noisy.  They were merely chatting, but I 
understand your point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, there was nothing petty in what I 
said. 
It is rather tiresome to be speaking and hear the whispers of a 
Liberal MP over there.  Out of mere courtesy, perhaps out of 
respect for this House, if there is a need for private 
conversations, they should be held in the lobby.  Moreover, the 
Chair has often stopped conversations of that nature in order to 
ensure that the institution operates as it should.  That was all 
I was asking for.  I see that my colleague has finished his 
discussion, so I can now continue my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was saying that, in 1998-99, the Minister of Finance could have 
done great things.  He had choices to make.  The same thing goes 
for 1999-2000, but since Bill C-72 is connected with the 1998 
budget, I will limit myself to that budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He knew he had a surplus of $15 billion.  He could count just as 
we could. 
If we in the Bloc Quebecois were able to determine that the 
surplus for fiscal year 1998-99 would range between $12 billion 
and $15 billion, he could have done the same with the whole gang 
of public servants, specialists, and the amazing prediction 
machine at his disposal.  But instead he concealed the real 
figures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been calling for tax reform for years now.  The Reform 
Party did exactly the same recently.  The Minister of Finance 
prefers to focus on economic conditions rather than taking a 
serious look at the tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is certainly a major undertaking, because the last tax 
reform was in 1968, with the Carter report.  That report led to 
the implementation of certain measures which resulted in some 
marked improvements to the tax system, ones which were of 
considerable significance.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But it is work.  It is true that the time he spent on reforming 
the tax system he would not spend promoting his candidacy for 
the leadership of the Liberal Party of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance must have the interest of the public 
more at heart than his own interests, and, until he convinces me 
otherwise, I think he has worked more for his own interests, and 
he has displayed a certain laziness not found among his 
predecessors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He could have done extraordinary things. 
When he felt the lid on the pot was beginning to lift, he 
decided to establish an empty working group that produced an 
empty report.  Some considerations were correct, but most did 
not relate to the needs for significant change, particularly in 
the area of personal income tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mintz working group, which he set up in order to reform 
taxes, focussed on corporate taxes only.  What did the Minister 
of Finance do with the report Mr. Mintz submitted?  He took it 
and he put it on a shelf.  He applied none of its 
recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He did not deign to work on reforming personal income taxes, 
which would be easy to do. 
As I mentioned earlier, the reports the Bloc Quebecois produced 
were applauded and welcomed by the Minister of Finance.  But 
there has been no follow up.  There really is a lack of 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What could the Minister of Finance have done without racking his 
brains and compromising his race for the leadership of the 
Liberal Party of Canada?  He could have fully indexed the tax 
tables and all the parameters of federal taxation.  He could 
have done it very simply.  I will illustrate my remarks in this 
respect in a few minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what happens without indexation.  Since 1986, the 
government has not taken inflation lower than 3% into account. 
When the rate of inflation is such as the one we have been 
experiencing for several years, the federal government gets tax 
revenues that increase every year, without having to impose any 
direct tax increase or specific tax measure. So, by not fully 
indexing tax tables, the Minister of Finance is quietly getting 
more money, every year, in the federal treasury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When inflation is high, taxpayers must pay more for goods and 
services. They must pay more for food, housing and even in 
taxes. They pay more indirectly because no adjustment, or only 
partial adjustment, is made by the federal government to the tax 
tables and the various federal tax components, to take into 
account the cost of living increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government fully took inflation into account, it would 
lower federal tax rates for certain income categories, or it 
would allow a tax rate that is currently low and that applies to 
a specific income category to apply to a higher income category. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of doing that, the government decided it was just too 
easy to get more money. It was just too easy to fully index tax 
tables and components. Instead of helping middle income 
families, the Minister of Finance decided to maintain the unfair 
system that has been in place since 1986. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the result of all this? I tried to illustrate how it 
affects taxpayers, particularly middle income earners, who 
account for 70% of all taxpayers. 
On the first $29,590, the federal tax rate in 17%. If the 
government had fully taken inflation into account since 1986, 
and had also fully indexed federal tax brackets, taxpayers would 
now be paying 17% not on the first $29,590 that they earn, but 
on the first $36,918.

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This makes a difference.  Because taxes are not fully indexed, 
taxpayers are paying 17% on the first $29,590 of earnings 
instead of on the first $36,918.  This has a negative impact on 
families' disposable income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are told that families' disposable income has continued to 
fall since the late 1970s.  This is a measure that reduces 
disposable income.  Disposable income is what is left over after 
taxpayers have paid all their taxes.  It is what they have left 
to buy goods and services and to make investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When tax brackets are not indexed, it starts to add up: 17% on 
the first $36,000 rather than 17% on the first $29,590 starts to 
add up to thousands of dollars a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $29,591 to $59,180 federal tax bracket is taxed at 26%. 
After that, it goes up.  Normally, with full indexing, the 26% 
tax rate would have kicked in between $36,000 and $73,800 
instead of between $29,000 and $59,000.  This becomes important, 
because the first $36,000 earned would be taxed at only 26% 
instead of 29% or 30%, which is quite a difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance preferred instead to continue with this 
unfair system, to allow the economic situation and inflation to 
continue unchecked so as to provide him with additional revenue, 
rather than impose any unpopular measures like raising income 
and other taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind hon. members that some 72% or 73% of taxpayers 
fall within the category of the two taxation levels I referred 
to, of 17% and 26%, for incomes of between $29,000 and $59,000. 
So not having fully indexed tax tables, tax levels and other tax 
parameters since 1986 has cost the majority of taxpayers very 
dearly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an illustration of what not having full indexation 
can represent for a resident of Quebec and a resident of 
Ontario. 
For example, for a family with one wage-earner and two children, 
with a 1986 income of $25,800 and a 1996 income of $35,400, the 
lack of indexation of the tax tables and other tax parameters 
has meant a loss of between $7,000 and $10,000 since 1986.  That 
is a considerable amount of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking about a family with millions in income, but a 
family with one wage earner and two children, whose income was 
$25,800 in 1986 and had risen to $35,400 by 1996, as a result of 
inflation and promotions.  The lack of indexation of the tax 
tables and other tax parameters has meant a loss of $7,000 since 
1986.  That is a considerable amount of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people do not have any money to throw away.  They are not 
taking vacations in Acapulco every year. 
Since 1986 they have seen between $7,000 and $10,000 in net 
revenue taken out of their pockets.  They could have invested it 
in their children's education.  They could have used it to 
improve their general situation.  They also could have perhaps 
put it toward buying a house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maintaining such unjust situations is a serious matter.  We have 
a family with one wage earner, a family of two adults and two 
children, losing between $7,000 and $10,000, if their present 
income is $35,000 or $36,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what lies behind the inaction of the Liberal government 
and the laziness of the Minister of Finance .

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not for the fun of it that we have been asking him to 
reform taxes since 1993 and keep asking him to do so.  They 
could have done something else to improve people's situation. 
They should have reformed taxes years ago.  It needs to be done 
soon.  It needed to be done in 1993, when there were one million 
poor children in Canada.  Today, in 1999, there are 1.6 million 
poor children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This man, rising every week with his hand on his heart and 
speaking of his compassion for poor children, is helping make 
the parents of these children poorer. 
This category of middle income earner, representing 70% of 
taxpayers, makes the greatest contribution to the employment 
insurance fund. The Minister of Finance is literally stealing 
the surplus from it, to the tune of $6 billion or $7 billion a 
year, rather than take this money and give it back to workers in 
the middle class and employers in SMBs or give a significant 
part of it back to the unemployed who are excluded from the 
application of the employment insurance plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Human Resources Development, who says that he 
too has great compassion for those worst off, cut the plan and 
tightened eligibility criteria with the complicity of the 
Minister of Finance.  The Minister of Human Resources 
Development is a kind of sherpa for the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Middle income earners paying because the tax tables and brackets 
are not fully indexed are also paying in terms of the money they 
take—and I am being polite—the money they rob from the 
employment insurance fund.  These people pay double, and this is 
the fault of the Minister of Finance.  If we look at the 
category of the public servants, these are the same middle 
income earners whose pension plan surplus will be taken by the 
President of the Treasury Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has just introduced a bill that will establish the pension 
investment board for the main pension plans.  He also announced 
that he expects he will use the $30 billion surplus accumulated 
in the plan as he sees fit, without consulting anyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a curious style of management, in which money is taken 
from middle income earners, because there is no tax reform. 
More money is taken from them when the government helps itself 
to the surplus in the EI fund. And moreover the same thing is 
happening to federal public servants, as the government is 
grabbing the surpluses in their pension funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was going to say something unparliamentary, but I will 
refrain.  I am casting about for a word that is parliamentary 
but conveys my meaning.  It begins to look like the federal 
government is systematically misrepresenting the numbers, using 
money that does not belong to it, wasting this money on measures 
designed more for the visibility, such as the millennium 
scholarships, the Minister of Canadian Heritage's Canadian flag 
operation, or the Council on Canadian Unity.  This is no way to 
manage taxpayers' money and the public knows it.  The public 
should not be underestimated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we travel throughout Quebec, as I often do, people, not 
necessarily hard-liners, tell us that the federal government's 
management of taxpayers' money and the type of hypocrisy we see 
here make absolutely no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1996, the Minister of Finance has been promising 
legislation to eliminate tax loopholes that mostly benefit 
Canada's millionaires and billionaires.  We have not seen it 
yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People will remember the auditor general's criticism in 1996, 
following our denunciations that went all the way back to the 
1993 election campaign of the family trust system for 
millionaires—not for middle income earners, but for 
millionaires—that lets them use tax loopholes for tax planning 
purposes instead of the purposes for which they were originally 
intended, such as providing a life annuity for a permanently 
disabled child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have a situation that was denounced by the auditor 
general, a situation where officials from the Department of 
National Revenue, the Department of Finance and the Department 
of Justice got together of an evening one December 24 a few 
years ago and came up with an advance ruling allowing a family 
of billionaires to transfer two family trusts totalling $2 
billion completely tax free to the United States.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was unprecedented. At least, we were not aware of any other 
similar situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a public outcry and the Bloc Quebecois strongly 
condemned what had taken place. I must say that the public 
servants who were present when that advance ruling was made and 
who appeared before the Standing Committee on Finance and the 
Standing Committee on Public Accounts found it to be most 
uncomfortable to say the least. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following that incident, the Minister of Finance announced that 
he would table a bill to make taxpayers accountable in the case 
of such transfers by providing a certain amount to pay taxes to 
Revenue Canada when assets are transferred abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three years ago, when the minister announced his intention to 
eliminate that loophole, what did these millionaires and 
billionaires do? They came up with all sorts of schemes to 
immediately transfer their trusts to tax havens abroad, by 
taking advantage of the precedent created by that advance 
ruling. They took advantage of the situation. In 1999, three 
years after alerting robbers, the Minister of Finance has yet to 
table his bill to eliminate the tax loopholes available to these 
millionaires. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hardly surprising. In the last budget, the most 
significant tax reductions are for those with incomes of 
$250,000 and up. Based on the proposed tax reductions, these 
people, who do not have a hard time making ends meet—unlike a 
family of two adults and two children with an income of 
$36,000—will benefit from tax savings of $3,800 as early as this 
year. 
On the other hand, those earning between $25,000 and $50,000 are 
not going to benefit from a tax saving of any more than $80 to 
$350. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason is obvious.  We see where the friends of the Liberal 
Party and the friends of the Minister of Finance fit in.  They 
are not families with one wage earner, with two adults and two 
children, and an income of $36,000.  They are millionaires and 
billionaires.  Moreover, what came out yesterday or the day 
before about the key contributors to the Liberal Party of 
Canada's campaign fund is most revealing.  There are many banks, 
trust companies and family trusts.  No change there. 
Join the dots between a $35,000 or $45,000 contribution, even 
$100,000, from major companies to the Liberal Party coffers, and 
then ask yourself whether the Liberals will end up with their 
hands tied afterward when it comes to tax reform, to blocking 
the loopholes for millionaires, for preventing the banks from 
doing certain things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is so ridiculous that I recently cut out an article on this 
subject, which I found most instructive.  In 1993, when I first 
came to this House, I said we would be fighting to block the 
gaps in the taxation system, the so-called loopholes.  These 
loopholes enable people who are far from being in need to do tax 
planning, to do all sorts of tricky tax moves, with the blessing 
of the Minister of Finance, in order to find themselves 
tax-exempt in foreign tax havens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the newspapers in 1993, there were classified ads that read 
“Come and plan the retirement of your dreams with us”. They were 
talking about tax havens.  At that point, the Income Tax Act 
permitted millions and millions of dollars in taxes to be saved 
through various means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was looking at a paper last week again, and it made no sense. 
There was another classified ad, which read in English and 
French, “Come and see us, we have ways for you to save hundreds 
of thousands if not millions in taxes, depending on your 
income”.  No family earning $36,000 a year will be able to take 
advantage of the advice on how to save money in tax havens.  One 
has to have money to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Six years later, nothing has changed, with tax havens. With 
permissive federal taxes and the federal Income Tax Act, the 
situation is similar to that of 1993, in which millionaires and 
billionaires paid no taxes and 70% of Quebeckers and Canadians 
pay most of the taxes, that is, the average income earners. Yet 
the Minister of Finance still has not introduced a bill to put 
an end to this scandal.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-72 contains some positive measures.  They are the ones we 
praised in the 1998 budget.  The Minister of Finance could have 
done so much better that it is ironic he is getting off so 
lightly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the options available to him then and now, he could have 
helped improve the situation of people in this country, of 
middle income families that have been struggling for years. 
Some of them have sunk into poverty because of the measures of 
the Minister of Finance and of the Minister of Human Resources 
Development in the area of employment insurance.  He could have 
done a lot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still, this bill is a small step in the right direction, and we 
would not want to tell taxpayers “These incomplete measures 
would save you a few dollars, and we could not oppose the bill 
simply because it really did not go far enough”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, we will support this bill, but we will continue to 
condemn this rip-off of middle income families and the fact that 
the Minister of Finance has simply let economic—and 
political—conditions dictate his course of action for several 
years, not assuming his responsibilities as he should have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who knows, perhaps he will make it and become Prime Minister 
some day, but I certainly do not wish it on Canada. As for us, 
we will be gone; we will have left and probably have achieved 
sovereignty a few years earlier. 
Canada deserves better than a minister like this one, a minister 
who did not take his responsibilities when he was in a position 
to effect social change, but chose not to.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am quite delighted to speak to Bill C-72 
today in this closing round of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My first question would be to the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Finance.  What is it about bracket creep that he 
likes so much?  We hear an awful lot about bracket creep.  I know 
it is something that my friend feels very strongly about because 
he just refuses to let it up.  He wants to hold it close to his 
chest as though this is his special bracket creep and no one is 
taking it from him.  I will get back to this point in a moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to give a balanced approach, I have to say that there 
are a number of things in the legislation that are actually quite 
helpful; for example, the increase in tax breaks for caregivers. 
Who can stand in the House and say it is not a good idea for the 
government to come up with an extra $400 per year for people 
taking care of people in their homes?  This is going to make a 
tremendous difference.  Something like $35 will really be noticed 
by people who are caregivers.  Quite frankly, it is the ultimate 
in baby steps in terms of tax reform but it is at least a slight 
lean in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have also been increases in the registered education 
savings plan, the homebuyers plan, the part time education 
deductions, the child care expense deductions, and, as I 
mentioned already, the caregiver tax credit which provides, as it 
states here, a new refundable tax credit up to $400 per 
caregiver.  This will make a major difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of changes that we would support in 
principle.  However, they are the most infinitesimal changes that 
one could imagine occurring to the tax act of Canada.  If we sat 
down and asked what the absolute minimalist approach we could 
take to tax reform and what would be the least we could get away 
with and still sound like we are doing okay, that would be what 
Bill C-72 is all about.  However, to say that none of this is 
worthwhile would obviously be silly. There are a number of 
important gestures.  I perhaps would use the term gesture more 
than anything to indicate that we are moving in the right 
direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, what on earth am I going to say at report 
stage and third reading on this particular bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I got up early this morning and reread all the weekend papers to 
look at what they were saying about taxes, tax changes, tax 
reform and so on.  We have all filled out our tax returns in the 
last few weeks.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all have a sensitivity about the tax system.  I was curious 
to know what the editorial writers, reporters and others were 
saying.  The general theme was that the tax rate and the tax 
burden should be reduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we have seen this movie before.  I remember reading in 
the newspapers a few years ago that the fundamental requirement 
to achieving economic prosperity in the country was to reduce the 
levels of inflation.  The levels of inflation were simply too 
high.  We had images of Prime Minister Trudeau wrestling this 
phantom inflation to the ground and pinning it down.  Once this 
was done the economy would turn around.  I can say with some 
pleasure that we did that.  We wrestled the old inflation to the 
ground, pinned it down for three counts and it was down and out. 
Now, for all intents and purposes, we have no inflation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did that significantly change the way the economy was 
functioning?  Did we become more productive?  Did employment 
levels come down substantially?  Unfortunately the answer is no. 
There was no significant shift. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government then admitted it had made a mistake.  It felt 
that if it could get interest rates down then that would 
stimulate the economy back into high gear.  We went through all 
sorts of contortions and interest rates finally came down to 
relatively recent historic lows in the 4%, 5% and 6% range for 
people borrowing money.  However, that did not have the big hit 
that we had anticipated either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government then said that it was not just inflation and 
interest rates, that it was really the size of government. The 
President of the Treasury Board then said that 55,000 federal 
civil servants would have to be laid off.  The government laid 
off 55,000 people across the country, one of the largest layoffs 
ever in Canadian history.  Did that achieve the results?  No, 
that did not have much of an impact in the end either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government had laid off 55,000 people and inflation and 
interest rates had gone down but now the problem was the deficit. 
It then began cutting programs and the deficit went down.  As a 
matter of fact it was wiped right out.  The deficit is history. 
It went the way of the dodo bird. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Things, however, did not change a whole lot or turn things 
around.  The government then said it had a new problem called tax 
cuts.  It felt that if taxes were cut it would get the economy 
moving and into high gear.  My friend from the Conservative Party 
agrees with me.  It is a mantra for people to get up in the 
morning and say “Please God, lower tax rates and the economy 
will get into high gear”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is going to say that we should not do that?  I am not going 
to say we should not lower taxes.  It would be almost suicidal to 
say that.  However, I have seen this movie before.  Getting 
inflation down, the deficit down, downsizing the government and 
cutting taxes does not work.  It has not worked in the past.  I 
am not sure this is the answer.  Where is this call coming from? 
Is it widespread across the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my Conservative friend and the Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Minister of Finance will recall the questions we asked 
Canadians when we toured the country during our prebudget 
consultations.  We asked Canadians what they thought should be 
done, and what their priorities were for the budget in terms of 
the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can say without any hesitation that some people said that tax 
cuts were not a priority.  They said that health care, education 
and training were priorities, but that tax cuts should come after 
the health care system is back on its feet and after a decent 
educational system is in place from kindergarten to 
post-secondary.  If some of my colleagues who were on the 
committee feel differently, then I think we should hear from 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes people were pushed and pressed and said they wanted 
tax cuts, but when the question was asked whether they wanted to 
see tax cuts or health care left the way it was, the answer was 
no.  The same answer came back when they were asked about 
education.  Most of these people, who were experts in their 
field, admitted to our committee that they did not want tax cuts 
as a top priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps we should set that aside because it would appear that 
tax cuts are not really the top priority.  It really is a major 
issue.  When a poll was conducted recently asking Canadians what 
should be done in terms of the federal budget, 45% of Canadians 
felt that health care should be a priority and only 7% said that 
taxes were the most important issue facing Canadians. 
I wonder who those people are?  We have heard some of them speak 
out.  We heard Paul Desmarais say that taxes were too high, 
particularly for wealthy people.  Jimmy Pattison, on the west 
coast, said that taxes were too high for wealthy people. We have 
heard others make the case that taxes are too high, resulting in 
a lot of Canada's best managers, high tech workers and scientists 
going to the United States.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no denying that many people are being attracted to the 
United States, but I suspect that the tax rate is only one of the 
attractive features.  I suspect the offer of perhaps twice as 
much money to leave Canada and go to the United States to work in 
Texas, Michigan, Florida, or wherever is probably as crucial as 
any in the decision making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is perhaps even more important to some of the high tech 
workers and the scientific community is the fact that they will 
have decent lab supplies and decent labs to work in.  Having the 
funds available for their research also attracts some of our best 
researchers to go to the United States.  I suspect that taxation 
is far down on their list of points when they make that decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying that reduced taxes is something we should not be 
concerned about.  We obviously should, but is it a priority? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect that if we were to press the issue we would find that 
most Canadians are fed up with the taxes that they pay because of 
two things.  I think most Canadians filling out their tax returns 
and either writing a cheque to the Receiver General of Canada or 
have been writing cheques over for the last year, depending on 
the nature of their income, are fed up with the high taxes they 
are paying because they think they are not getting a good deal 
for their taxes. They think their taxes are being spent on some 
questionable priorities of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think Canadians are that far out.  I remember a big 
deal that happened in the House when we found out that $3.3 
million was being spent to improve the image of the other place. 
Is it a national priority for Canadians to improve the image of 
the other place?  Some people think it is, but I suspect that, 
other than a handful of senators, we would be hard-pressed to 
find a single Canadian who would say that he or she wants his or 
her tax money to go toward enhancing the image of the people who 
inhabit the other place across the hallway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does anyone remember the $98,000 spent for a book on dumb blonde 
jokes?  I took that personally being somewhat of a blonde myself. 
Is it a national priority to give someone $98,000 to write and 
publish a joke book about blondes?  Is this something that 
taxpayers want to see their hard-earned tax dollars going to pay 
for?  I doubt it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the $500,000 canoe museum up in the Prime 
Minister's constituency.  I know many of us are very fond of 
canoes.  A lot of us have canoes and we paddle them.  A canoe is 
a great Canadian image-maker, but I do not know if it was a 
priority to spend $500,000 of our hard-earned tax money on a 
little canoe museum in the Prime Minister's riding.  I will 
listen to my Liberal friends opposite as they stand up and say 
that having a dumb blonde joke book funded by the taxpayers was a 
good way to use taxpayers money, or whatever.  Let us face it, 
the list is endless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I am trying to make is that most Canadians do not 
begrudge the fact that they have to pay taxes.  That is why in 
the past we have had a very good health care system.  That is why 
we have a whole variety of programs that differentiate us as a 
country from most other countries of the world.  However, there 
is a feeling that their taxes are not being wisely invested or 
wisely spent, that there is a lot of frivolous and unnecessary 
spending going on without a proper accounting. As 
parliamentarians, I think we all have to admit that there is not 
a proper accounting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember that when I was first elected the big time of the 
year was when we went through the estimates.  We would sit down 
in our committees, whether it was the agriculture committee, the 
foreign affairs committee, the finance committee, or the health 
committee, and spend days and days going through the estimates so 
that members of parliament would at least have some inclination 
as to what the department was spending the money on. The minister 
and the parliamentary secretary would be grilled. The secretaries 
of state and the departmental representatives would also be 
grilled.  At the end of the process we had a general feeling that 
the moneys being invested were at least identified as to where 
they were going.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether we agreed with them or not, we at least knew they were 
being spent here and being invested there, they were going to 
build this or they were going to try to get that thing happening 
in that part of Canada, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the whole process of dealing with the estimates has 
essentially been thrown out the window.  Committees really do not 
deal with the estimates in the same vigilant way they did in the 
past.  In many cases they do not go over the estimates at all. 
They are deemed to have been discussed, deemed to have been 
passed and that is the end of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When taxpayers feel that their elected representatives do not 
represent them in going through how taxes are being used it is 
absolutely true.  There is a good reason the taxpayers of Canada 
feel a little uneasy at this time of the year when they are 
writing their cheques to the Receiver General of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair to say that most Canadians, may I say all Canadians, 
feel that some people get a better deal than others because of 
our tax system.  Some people benefit from our tax system where 
other people pay too much.  Let us face it.  Some are in a 
category where they can hire a tax accountant, or they have a 
good tax adviser or lawyer, and they use the part of the tax act 
of Canada, the Income Tax Act which is annotated with 
explanations beside some of the points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My guess is that if they can afford a tax lawyer, or their 
affairs are in such a way that they have a good tax accountant or 
a good tax adviser, they can probably take advantage of 
provisions in the act that will enable them to either pay very 
little income tax or in some cases pay absolutely no income tax 
in spite of the fact that they might have had substantial income 
during that year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a fact of life that a lot of people pay very little income 
tax.  As a matter of fact I know lots of people in this country 
who are proud of the fact that they have used this book.  They 
have good advisers and have arranged their financial affairs in 
certain ways that they do not pay any income tax all.  That is 
the way it is.  They are not doing anything wrong.  They are not 
doing anything illegal or unethical.  They are simply using the 
provisions of the tax act that most Canadians are unable to use 
because their income tax is deducted at source.  For Canadians 
who work in a plant or a factory, or in an office, somebody 
deducts their income tax and that is it.  They do not have any 
real deductions that other people obviously have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is this feeling that the tax act is haywire, unfair, 
unjust and that it is biased in favour of certain Canadians who 
tend to be wealthy, and larger corporations, compared to the 
average small business.  That is simply a fact of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going ask that we pause for a moment or two while I read 
from the bible of taxation.  It has come that time of the day 
when it behoves us all to set aside a few quiet moments to 
contemplate what the tax act actually says. I will not read much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have chosen for today's reading chapter 127, verse 11, 
subsection (b)(vi).  I think all members of parliament will get 
quite a thrill when they listen to this part of the bible.  It 
may even be inspiring.  Let us put ourselves into a state of 
meditation for a moment or two while I read from section 127, 
verse 11 of the tax act. It goes like this:

the hell that is all about?  Nobody.  I doubt if there is a tax

is all about.  They practise the grey area of taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in the sixties the Carter commission went from coast to 
coast and spent a great deal of time analysing the tax act of 
that period. It made a number of recommendations.  Now is the 
time to have Carter commission two and to re-evaluate our tax act 
from top to bottom to ensure for the future that it is a fair and 
just piece of taxation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK12"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I have to 
comment.  I was truly warmed at the reading by the minister, and 
he is not the minister; I was thinking of minister in the 
ecclesiastical sense.  It warmed the cockles of my heart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said something about tax breaks not having an effect 
on the economy.  I want to challenge his thinking about this and 
I would like him to respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether one taxes or not does not really destroy any money.  All 
it does is change who gets to spend it.  It is my understanding 
that when we are taxed, our earnings are simply put on a train or 
now on the electronic highway and they are shipped at a million 
miles a second to Ottawa.  Politicians and bureaucrats spend the 
money which the people have earned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is certainly true that some government spending provides 
people with jobs.  We know that is true for all government 
workers as it is true for other people as well who contract for 
government jobs.  I do not think we would totally discount that 
taxes are an active player in the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most studies I have read or read about imply very strongly that 
if we leave the money close to the people who earn it, they 
actually invest it in a better way than most governments spend 
it. The member indicated some of the waste government is involved 
in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to comment on why it is in his view that 
reduction of taxes would not help the economy.  It certainly 
would not hinder it. I think it would help it because the people 
would spend it more wisely than the politicians and bureaucrats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Madam Speaker, as usual I appreciate my 
friend's intervention.  He always has a thoughtful point to make. 
Once again he has made a thoughtful point. I agree with him in 
part and I will explain the part. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT20"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT20"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1240

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us would agree that government expenditures in health 
care and education are probably tax dollars well invested.  I do 
not think anyone would deny that.  Tax dollars spent on canoe 
museums or dumb blond joke books and so on are probably moneys 
not well invested.  Let us agree that there are useful public 
expenditures and unuseful public expenditures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point my hon. friend makes is if there is a tax cut, is this 
not good for the economy. There is a lot of talk about tax cuts 
these days in the provincial election in Ontario.  The so-called 
winners of the Ontario provincial tax cuts which were introduced 
previously resulted in someone earning $15,000 will save $160 a 
year and someone earning $250,000 will save $5,000 a year.  In 
other words someone making a lot of money is going to save a lot 
more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can call our economic system a capitalist system, a market 
driven system or whatever, but it depends on people buying goods 
or services.  As long as people are buying a lot of goods and 
services our economy heats up.  When those consumer dollars are 
not being used our economy weakens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we give a tax break to low or middle income earners, they 
will likely spend every nickel of that tax break. They will go 
out and spend it either on buying a new car, on clothing, on 
food, on whatever.  They will spend all that extra money they 
have in their hands.  An upper income earner will take that money 
and invest it in the international stock market.  They may set 
money aside for investment at another time and they may even 
start a business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I want to make is that it is more likely that middle 
and low income earners will spend their money than will a 
multimillionaire who gets a tax cut.  They may not spend the 
money.  They may, but they may not.  They may not even spend it 
in Canada.  They may prefer to buy a condo in Florida, the Cayman 
Islands or wherever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to get the maximum bang for our tax reduction, can I 
suggest to my hon. friend that we give some thought to cutting a 
tax that would be felt the next morning by every single citizen, 
from a child to the most elderly taxpayer or consumer, and that 
is a reduction in the GST.  That would be felt from top to 
bottom. Every single person would benefit, as opposed to having 
selected tax cuts for the benefit of certain people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B> Madam Speaker, I hate to dominate the debate 
but I did give others the opportunity to stand before I stood for 
the second time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I need to get my head around this.  There is certainly the view 
that some Canadians may spend it outside the country.  The fact 
is that if it is earned in Canada, it is taxed in Canada.  Surely 
the member is not going to be in favour of passing laws that say 
people face some financial penalty if they invest their money 
outside the country.  I am sure he would not be contemplating 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make a comment and again have a response with respect 
to how people spend their money.  I am quite convinced that a 
member of the NDP would certainly favour reducing the money that 
flows from the poor to the rich.   What is happening is that not 
only collectively as taxpayers and as citizens do we owe a lot of 
money to the big financiers and the large financial corporations, 
but also as individuals.  People are loaded with debt like they 
have never been before.  It could just be that with a tax cut 
those individuals would be able to reduce their debt and 
certainly we should reduce it as a country so that we end up 
transferring less of the earnings of those in the middle to lower 
income class to the rich class. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the hon. member should be in favour of that.  I would 
like his comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Madam  Speaker, what I am about to say I 
say with all the respect possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that those who are calling for a tax cut as the only 
element of major tax reform are being a bit narrow in their 
thinking, to be fair. 
I would like to use a harsher term than that, but I will just say 
narrow.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that what we require in this country is tax reform. 
If we have decent tax reform that is fair and just and honest in 
approach we would find that most middle income Canadians would 
get a tax break.  The taxes would be lowered for the average 
middle income earner and those at the higher end would perhaps be 
paying slightly more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that we have to close some of these loopholes.  I 
know the government has closed a few little ones, but if we close 
more of the large tax loopholes that exist, have a complete tax 
reform as we saw during the Carter Commission period, then we 
would have a better tax system and a fairer distribution to those 
who pay the taxes of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For decades and decades the system has become so out of whack, 
so convoluted, so biased, so unfair, so unjust that it has caused 
most Canadians to enter the underground economy whenever they 
have an opportunity.  I know that what happens underground is 
illegal, by and large, but we understand why people do it.  They 
do it because they know that their taxes are not being wisely 
invested.  They know that a lot of people are getting tax breaks 
that they do not get and cannot get.  Therefore, they get 
whatever tax breaks they can by operating in the underground 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general did us a service in his last report by 
suggesting that it is in the range of about $40 billion worth of 
transactions.  I would guess that is very conservative.  He is a 
conservative individual.  His methodology is always conservative. 
I suspect it is much larger than $40 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could imagine that if that $40 billion was on top of the 
table, the amount of debt reduction and program expenditures that 
exist in our economy that could be financed just from that would 
be quite substantial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it behoves us to go beyond our rhetoric and our 
discussion of simple tax cuts to talk more about a decent 
overhaul of our whole tax system. 
<P><A NAME="LINK13"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
before I begin my comments I would like to commend my colleague 
from the New Democratic Party on his comments today on tax reform 
as opposed to tax cuts.  I think that is a very important 
distinction that needs to be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problems we face as a country are perhaps more complicated 
now than they have ever been.  The challenges that we face change 
more rapidly now than we have ever seen before.  We are in a 
rapidly changing, globally competitive environment.  Within that 
context, Canada now, more than ever, needs significant holistic 
tax reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague referred to the Carter Commission which travelled 
the country formulating public policy in the 1960s.  I believe 
those tax reforms were implemented in 1971.  The next tax reform 
that was significant was in the late 1980s, I believe 1988, when 
there was a significant broadening of the bases and decreasing of 
the number of brackets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, we will remember the GST in 1993, a significant tax 
reform which resulted in significant political reform, most of 
which, politically, was not positive.  That being the case, the 
impact of the GST, I would argue, ultimately has been quite 
positive.  It replaced the manufacturers sales tax, which 
pummelled Canadian enterprise in a global environment, and 
replaced it with a consumption based tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increasingly that is what tax experts and productivity experts 
are calling for, a movement from taxes on capital, from taxes on 
income, to a more fairly based consumption tax, which could in 
fact be progressive.  It need not sacrifice progressivity as an 
expense to a tax system that fosters competitiveness.  I 
appreciated his comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are exciting times that we live in today in Canada.  It 
took 14 years, from 1984 to 1998, to eliminate the deficit.  In 
fact, the leader of the Reform Party in this House said that 
deficit reduction in Canada really began back in 1984. 
At that time, when the Progressive Conservative government was 
first elected, the deficit as a percentage of GDP was around 9%. 
Over the next nine years it was reduced from 9% to around 5%.  At 
the same time program spending growth was reduced from 15% per 
year to zero growth by the time that government left office 
rather suddenly in 1993.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since then efforts to reduce the deficit have continued, largely 
abetted and aided by the policies implemented by the previous 
government.  Those policies were free trade, the elimination of 
the manufacturers sales tax, the introduction of the GST, and the 
deregulation of financial services, transportation and energy. 
Those structural changes in the Canadian economy made by that 
government were credited by the <I>Economist</I> magazine in 1998 
as being pivotal and important for the reduction and the ultimate 
elimination of the deficit in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I mention this very important period of time in 
Canadian history in terms of fiscal policy and economic policy is 
because I believe that as we enter the new millennium, as we 
enter a period where change is going to be more rapid and the 
challenges facing Canadians are going to be ever more complex, we 
need a government that is more than a caretaker, more than a 
stewardship short of government, a government that basically has 
inherited some strong economic policies but really has not done a 
whole lot to create new economic policies or made the types of 
visionary changes that are necessary to lead Canadians proudly 
and prosperously into the next century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now, when the challenges are so great, we need the type of 
government that would engage Canadians in the kind of dialogue 
and the type of visionary public policy creation that would 
produce in the long term the types of policies that will attach 
the hands of Canadians to the opportunities of the 21st century. 
Tax reform is a very important part of that.  Arguably, tax 
reform, particularly in the early 21st century, will be very 
important as an economic development tool.  We are seeing that 
around the world, whether it is in countries like Ireland which 
have very aggressive corporate tax strategies, the tax policies 
that we are seeing in the U.S., for instance, or within our own 
country.  We are seeing provinces jockeying for position to 
reduce provincial taxes in order to attract industry and create 
increased levels of job growth and prosperity within the 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax reform is going to become more and more important.  In this 
environment it is going to take more than tinkering around the 
periphery of taxes.  It is going to take a significant, mature 
and holistic approach to what are systemic problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government's approach to taxation policy is anaemic.  The 
government has refused to deal with some of the root difficulties 
and some of the distortions we have within the tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some individual elements of Bill C-72 and some 
individual initiatives that are difficult to disagree with in 
terms of their general direction.  For instance, the increase in 
the personal tax credit of $500 is positive.  We agree with the 
general trend to increase the personal tax credit.  The PC party 
is calling for an increase, not just to $7,000, but to $10,000. 
It is unconscionable that in Canada we are taxing people who make 
as little as $7,000 per year.  We believe that the personal 
credit should be raised to $10,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is saying that by increasing the personal credit 
by $500 it is taking 400,000 Canadians off the tax rolls.  What 
the government fails to mention is that since 1993, due to 
bracket creep, this government has actually dragged 1.4 million 
low income Canadians, kicking and screaming, on to the tax rolls 
for the first time. 
It is hardly fair for the government to say that it is taking 
people off the tax rolls when in fact it is putting more people 
on the tax rolls, and bracket creep continues to cost Canadians a 
lot.  We are calling for the elimination of bracket creep and the 
re-indexing of tax brackets, particularly in the post-deficit 
environment.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw the reduction of the 3% surtax, which was a deficit 
reduction surtax.  Seeing that it has played a role in reducing 
and ultimately eliminating the deficit, we would call for the 
government to eliminate the 3% surtax, which has been the trend, 
but also to eliminate the 5% surtax.  The government is calling 
it the high income surtax.  That is one of the issues we have 
from a competitiveness perspective because the government treats 
people making over $60,000 as though they were rich. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada the highest marginal tax rate is hit at around 
$60,000. In the U.S. the highest marginal tax rate is not reached 
until the individual hits a threshold of about $412,000 Canadian.

degree in commerce, according to <I>Maclean's</I>, who is entering 
the financial services sector in investment banking, is $72,000. 
In the first year out of university these bachelor of commerce 
graduates, or business administration graduates, are making 
$72,000.  Immediately, in the first year out of school, with 
student loans and everything else, the government is taxing them 
at the highest marginal tax rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is little wonder that we are chasing from Canada some of our 
best and brightest young people who are seeking opportunities, 
particularly south of the border, in what is frequently referred 
to as the brain drain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government sometimes says that it is not really a personal 
income tax issue, that that is not the biggest reason; the fact 
is that U.S. companies are also paying more money.  The fact that 
U.S. companies are paying higher salaries is partially due to the 
fact that U.S. companies are paying lower percentages in 
corporate tax rates.  The general compensation trends have been 
toward salaries combined with stock options.  In that type of 
environment our capital gains tax plays a significant role in 
reducing incentives for Canadians to stay here.  This is 
particularly pervasive within the high tech sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to be competitive in the 21st century it is 
particularly important that we be competitive in the high tech 
sector and that we be competitive in the service sector as 
opposed to simply focusing on the traditional manufacturing and 
resource based sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The challenges and the opportunities we have now are very 
exciting.  In the post-deficit environment tax reform is a very 
viable and, I would argue, important initiative that the 
government should be pursuing more aggressively; not just 
tinkering with, but offering significant broad-based reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a pre-deficit environment, without a fiscal surplus, tax 
reform is more difficult because whenever there is tax reform the 
government stands the risk of creating winners and of course 
losers.  It is dealing with a zero sum issue.  It is not possible 
to give more to one group without taking more from another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in a post-deficit environment it is possible to 
implement significant, important and innovative tax reform 
without hurting any group within society.  Tax relief can play an 
integral role in tax reform.  When one group is provided with 
more through a simplification of the tax code, it need not mean 
that another group receives less.  The surplus environment 
provides an opportunity for ameliorative tax relief that would 
compensate for any detrimental effects of tax reform.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian workers and taxpayers have played a significant role in 
the elimination of the deficit.  As I said earlier, it took 14 
years from 1984 to 1998 to accomplish that.  Canadian taxpayers 
have seen an increase from 1993 to 1998 from $112 billion in 
federal taxes to about $150 billion in federal taxes, a growth in 
federal taxes that far outstripped the growth in the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Douglas Porter, senior economist and vice-president 
of Nesbitt Burns who was a witness before the finance committee 
last week, disposable income has fallen significantly in Canada 
primarily due to the high tax burden, particularly relative to 
the U.S.  The fact is that in the U.S. over the past few years 
there has been a significant increase in personal disposable 
income and during the same period there has been a decrease in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personal debt rates are at an unprecedented high in Canada. 
Personal bankruptcy rates are higher than they have ever been. 
The government may boast of being in the black, but the fact is 
that because of the government's high tax policies Canadians are 
in the red at an unprecedented rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the seventies and eighties Canadian disposable income was 
around 80% of the U.S. level.  By the end of 1998 Canadian 
disposable income had fallen to 50% of the U.S. level.  Part of 
that as well is related to the lower dollar in Canada and that 
whenever our dollar is weakened it represents to a considerable 
extent a pay cut for Canadians in the global environment in terms 
of what we can consume.  It is a corporate tax issue.  It is a 
personal tax issue.  It is a productivity issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interestingly on the productivity question, which we have been 
studying in the finance committee, most witnesses indicated that 
high taxes in Canada had played a role.  Some said it was a very 
significant role.  Some said it was a smaller role. Almost all 
the witnesses attributed, at least in part, our low productivity 
growth in Canada to our high tax regime and the secular decline 
in productivity over the past 30 years to taxes which are simply 
too high and make us uncompetitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue that comes up frequently at the finance committee 
productivity hearings is investment.  In jurisdictions where 
investment is high, typically productivity is higher.  The 
Canadian government tendency to tax capital and income on capital 
reduces incentives to invest.  When one reduces investment one 
ultimately reduces productivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly members on the government side would like to debate 
the whole notion of productivity and spend a lot of time trying 
to define productivity in a rather esoteric or arcane 
intellectual argument.  The government does not seem to realize 
that productivity is one of the greatest challenges facing 
Canadians in the 21st century in terms of our ability to build 
wealth in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a huge number of factors.  Tax policy is very 
important.  Social policy can play a role in terms of innovative 
social policy.   While the government claims that innovative or 
forward thinking tax policy or tax reduction cannot coexist with 
innovative social policy, the fact is that the government is 
wrong on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One witness before the finance committee was Dr. Fraser Mustard 
who has done an immense amount of work on innovative social 
policy and on investing in young people and children, 
particularly in preschool, and what is known as head start 
programs or early intervention programs aimed at children in high 
risk situations.  Many of these studies have been done in inner 
city communities where the need was greatest, but they would 
apply almost anywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One dollar invested in preschool children in high risk 
situations would provide a societal benefit of about $7 by the 
time the child reached the age of 25. 
It is a very innovative social policy aimed at those first three 
years of early childhood development, the first three years of a 
child's life during which 90% of the child's cognitive adaptive 
skills close off.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the one area where we do not have any real government 
policy.  We have a post-secondary education policy which is 
primarily provincial but with some federal co-operation through 
things like the millennium scholarship program.  We have a 
secondary and primary education system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have absolutely not strategy for the area during which we can 
have the most significant and positive impact on the lives of our 
young people and on the future competitiveness of our country 
through augmenting our human capital for those first three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will argue that we cannot have tax reduction, tax 
reform and innovative social policy.  That is not true.  This is 
a government that cannot walk and chew bubble gum at the same 
time.  The fact is that we can have both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We spend more on health care in Canada than the U.S. government 
does on a per capita basis.  I would argue that the U.S. health 
care system is very inefficient due to the lack of a single tier 
system, the insurance industry and the litigious nature of U.S. 
society.  By the same token, the U.S. spends more on health care 
than we do in Canada on a per capita basis and has a defence 
budget that is mammoth on a per capita basis relative to ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can actually have the type of tax reform Canadians need, the 
type of social policy reform Canadians need, but it will take 
vision, leadership, courage, a depth of knowledge of global 
issues which Canadians have not had since the previous 
government, and innovative policies like free trade, reducing or 
eliminating the manufacturers sales tax, and deregulation of 
financial services, transportation and energy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately it seems that Canadians will have to wait until 
after the government has left office before they get the 
meaningful broad based tax reform they need to compete and 
succeed in a global environment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
listened with interest to my colleague from the Conservative 
Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He brought one point forward when he said an investment of $1 in 
early childhood would give dividends.  He used the figure of $7 
at age 25 as being the benefit to Canada, which is an extremely 
positive feature.  I would like him to take into account the high 
tech brain drain we are seeing from the country.  We probably 
will lose the $7 with that brain drain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now there is a new proposal coming from the finance minister 
with reference to giving tax breaks through stock options for 
high tech industries.  What would the member's point of view be 
on this kind of tax break?  Would that be the way to go, or would 
a comprehensive tax reform for every Canadian be a better way to 
go? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Madam Speaker, the member raised the 
very important issue of the significant investment in Canada in 
social infrastructure aimed at producing bright, talented young 
people who ultimately choose to live in other jurisdictions if we 
do not reduce our tax burden.  That represents a huge loss of 
potential and a huge loss of investment for Canadians and for 
Canada.  If we take into account the cumulative effect over the 
person's life of the bright young talent that we lose, it is 
immense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the member.  We have to address tax issues if we 
are to benefit from the type of social investment we spoke of. He 
referred to the same studies, Dr. Fraser Mustard's studies on 
early childhood intervention, which is very important and very 
innovative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of a tax break which would benefit specifically the 
high tech sector, I agree with the hon. member that we do not 
need a more complicated and Pavlovian tax code that encourages 
one behaviour and discourages another. 
We need significant broad based tax reform aimed at providing all 
Canadian industries and individuals with a heightened level of 
competitiveness.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess in Canada all sectors are high tax sectors, but we 
should be fostering and supporting our high tech sector.  I would 
argue that the tax system should not be used to encourage or 
discourage one type of behaviour or another.  I am in complete 
compliance and agreement with the hon. member that we need broad 
based tax reform effort aimed at reducing corporate and personal 
income taxes, at simplifying both of them, and at moving our tax 
bases from the taxing of capital and income on capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a global sense and in a competitive sense we have to move 
toward a consumption tax base.  We can have a consumption tax 
base that is progressive.  There are ways to ensure movement 
toward a consumption tax which need not sacrifice the 
progressivity that is important to Canadians as part of our tax 
code. 
<P><A NAME="LINK15"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I listened with interest to my friend's 
thoughtful presentation which he always gives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for him regarding the GST.  I know the GST is 
a friend of his and he likes the idea of the GST.  However, would 
he not agree with what many tax people tell us?  It was the 
introduction of the GST, setting aside the rationale, explanation 
and need for it, which was the straw that broke the camel's back 
when it came to the underground economy?  People said it was too 
much, a rotten tax and therefore moved as much of their 
operations underground as they could.  I do not mean that to be a 
critical point directed to my friend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my colleague agree that perhaps the people's perception of 
the GST, as accurate or inaccurate as it may be, was what lead to 
an acceptance of the reality of the underground economy as a 
reasonably legitimate way to do business in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Madam Speaker, the GST was arguably the 
straw that broke the government's back.  I am not sure of the 
camel to which the member referred, but the government seemed to 
be ignominiously humped from office at that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty the government faced at that time in selling the 
GST, which replaced the manufacturers sales tax that pummelled 
and punished Canadian export industries, was that only 18% of 
Canadians were aware that there was a manufacturers sales tax. It 
was not a good news story.  People were not aware by and large 
that there was a manufacturers sales tax.  This new tax was a 
very difficult sell. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of weeks ago I participated in the Canadian Tax 
Foundation annual meeting on a weekend.  That is what I do with 
my weekends; I go to tax foundation meetings.  I am a pretty 
exciting guy.  At that meeting over and over again tax experts 
suggested that the baby step movement in Canada with the GST to a 
consumption base was very important for Canadian competitiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They argued that we need to move further toward a consumption 
base and away from income based taxation and taxes on capital and 
income on capital.  Those types of taxes, whether they are on 
capital, income from capital or personal or corporate income, 
make Canadian industry and Canadian individuals less competitive. 
They hurt our productivity, reduce the potential for Canadians 
and companies to grow jobs, and hurt our potential to keep 
Canada's best and brightest young people in Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A consumption tax, and there are ways to effect progressivity 
within a consumption base, would provide a more broadly based 
system which should not and would not increase the degree of the 
underground economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The numbers used by people in terms of the degree to which we 
have an underground economy in Canada vary significantly.  It is 
much harder to get around paying GST than it is for people to use 
high priced tax accountants and get away with paying less income 
tax.  As the member indicated earlier in his speech, there is an 
inherent regressivity in the tax system.  People at the higher 
income levels can afford to hire tax experts and pay less income 
taxes, corporate taxes or whatever.  With a consumption base it 
is much harder to get around that.  I would argue that it would 
ultimately reduce in the long run the degree to which there is an 
underground economy if we are serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue that exists is that it is much easier today to 
have significant tax reform than it would have been in 1993 
because we are in a post deficit or surplus environment.  We need 
not improve the tax situation for one individual by reducing or 
hurting another individual with the tax system.  It is not a zero 
sum game any more.  We can combine tax reform with tax reduction. 
I would argue that to maximize the potential of either we need to 
implement both.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to join in the debate.  I was not planning to do so 
until I heard my colleague's remarks about productivity and the 
discussion about the brain drain during the questions and 
comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It brought to mind that part of the 1998 budget which dealt with 
investing in young and older Canadians to make them more 
productive and more effective citizens.  I am referring to the 
various measures under the Canadian opportunities strategy, a 
co-ordinated group of measures specifically focused on creating 
opportunities for Canadians.  I want to mention one or two 
aspects of that co-ordinated strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first one is the establishment of the Canadian millennium 
scholarship foundation which is now beginning to provide 
scholarships to Canadians across the country.  The focus of the 
scholarships is on qualified students who have problems dealing 
with the steadily increasing tuition fees found in universities 
in virtually every province in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem of accessibility to university and college has 
become a serious national problem.  It was very appropriate at 
that time, as it still is, for the Government of Canada to look 
at the causes of the decrease in accessibility as provinces and 
universities increase their tuition fees, a serious problem for 
many students, and to try to deal with it directly through the 
millennium scholarships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that a couple of provinces very sensibly kept their 
tuition fees down.  Even so, students will benefit directly from 
that aspect of the 1998 budget which deals with the productivity 
of Canada and of all Canadians and with the brain drain mentioned 
by my colleague in the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second area of this co-ordinated set of measures to create 
opportunity by expanding access to knowledge and the skills 
needed for better jobs that were built into that budget is 
substantially increased support for advanced research and 
graduate students. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1320"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT28"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT28"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1320

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government supports research in Canada, particularly 
through the grants councils, the Social Sciences and Humanities 
Research Council, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research 
Council, and the Medical Research Council.  In 1998 there was a 
substantial increase in the funding of those councils. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At one level it would appear to be funds which are going into 
creative research projects in the social sciences, in 
engineering, in the natural sciences, and in the environmental 
sciences and so on across the country.  However the other aspect 
is that those grants provide income directly to graduate students 
at various levels of their careers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The increase in funding to the grants councils can almost be 
thought of as a job creation program, a very rapid and effective 
job creation program for highly educated young people who are 
seeking to become more educated.  In effect they use those moneys 
to support themselves and to continue their education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say again to my colleagues that in the 1998 budget there 
was a focus on research and on improving research to make Canada 
more productive.  However through the grants councils the focus 
was on providing funds for graduate students who are the future 
of all kinds of science research in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dealing with the same problem, the access to university and 
college which I mentioned with respect to the millennium 
scholarships and the question of graduate students receiving 
funds to support themselves through school, there were measures 
in the budget to help students manage debt loads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is popularly known now that our students because of increases 
in tuition are faced with much greater student loans to pay off 
than was the case previously.  In the budget, dealing with the 
productivity again, tax relief was provided for interest on 
student loans.  The Canada student loan program was improved to 
help students deal with the debt loads which they are 
unfortunately facing when they graduate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out to my colleagues that in the same package of 
material each item is directly tailored to dealing with improving 
research, improving the quality of our students, our future 
teachers and researchers, and helping to encourage students to 
stay in school, which we know is the way to go for jobs and for 
productivity nowadays. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be remembered that the government provided in the 
budget for tax free RRSP withdrawals for lifelong learning.  That 
is important.  We pay lip service to it now that we have to learn 
and relearn throughout a career.  Before it was possible to go to 
school, to do an apprenticeship and be set for a career.  Now 
that is no longer the case.  People not only have to go to school 
when they are young.  They have to go to school when they are 
less young. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the budget it is now possible for Canadians to upgrade 
their skills throughout their working lives because they can make 
tax free withdrawals from their registered retirement savings 
plans, specifically when those withdrawals are for lifelong 
learning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same budget there was an extension of the education tax 
credits and the child care expense deduction for part time 
students.  All those measures were aimed at productivity and 
ultimately at the brain drain which my colleagues opposite were 
discussing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the budget as a part of a very focused package there was the 
Canada education savings grant.  In our educational system we 
often think there are no grants— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  There is a brain drain going on now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  My colleague points out there is a drain 
of brains occurring now.  I will try to speak more slowly and 
perhaps more will stay.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stress that the Canada education savings grant is a grant.  It 
is often thought that grants no longer exist in our system.  For 
very low income students there are still grants.  For certain 
specific identified groups of students there are still grants as 
well as the student loans they can obtain in various ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, as a result of the budget we are discussing today 
families can better save for their children's education through 
the Canada education savings grant.  That means people who invest 
in RRSPs obtain a grant of 20% on the first $2,000 of annual 
contributions to registered education savings plans in addition 
to the tax benefit from that investment.  There is actually a 
grant up to a maximum amount per child which families can obtain 
and retain until they take those moneys out of the plan and 
invest them in their child's education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Continuing with the group of measures built into the 1998 
budget, the focus of our discussions today, there was an EI 
premium holiday for youth at risk.  Support for youth employment 
was provided by more than doubling funding for youth at risk who 
lack basic education and job skills and by providing employers an 
employment insurance premium holiday for additional young 
Canadians hired in 1999 and 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are no longer dealing with students who are faced with 
problems of getting into college or staying in college or 
university.  We are dealing with those who lack basic education 
and job skills.  Those provisions are extremely important for 
young Canadians.  Through 1999 and 2000 they and their employers 
get considerable encouragement so that jobs are created for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last measure I want to mention in this group of co-ordinated 
measures is designed to create opportunity by expanding access to 
knowledge and skills needed for better jobs and higher standards 
of living in the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This package of budgetary measures was designed to focus on the 
area of increased funding for SchoolNet, community access and the 
Canadian network for advancement of research, industry and 
education, the acronym for which is CANARIE.  The purpose of 
these investments is to bring the benefits of information 
technology into more classrooms and communities across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk first about SchoolNet.  It is very common to say 
that education is a provincial jurisdiction.  Of course it is. 
The federal government has no interest in running elementary 
schools, except in certain special cases which exist across the 
country.  However we have great interest and a great 
responsibility in elementary schools and high schools if in the 
national interest there is concern about the quality of education 
across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the federal government should do something about it. 
SchoolNet is as good an example as I can think of.  Under the 
SchoolNet program, one of the focuses of the 1998 budget, the 
federal government linked every elementary school and high school 
to the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It started in the rural areas and the more remote parts of the 
countries and gradually moved into the cities.  Today all our 
young people, our elementary school and high school students, 
have access to the Internet many years before all students in the 
United States will have access to the Internet.  If this is not 
an investment in productivity, I do not know what is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned researchers and university professors getting 
increased funding.  I mentioned graduate students getting 
increased funding.  I mentioned through the millennium 
scholarships undergraduate students getting increased funding. 
I mentioned their families getting support to allow students to 
go to college and university.  I mentioned the increased support 
for people who want to go back to school.  Now I am talking about 
our elementary schools.  If we are to have a truly productive 
society, if we are to stop the brain drain, not just today or 
next week, but forever, the federal government has to think about 
the whole pyramid.  If we were to fix one part of the pyramid so 
that, for example, university faculty would be better off, 
important though they are, in the end, if we were not producing 
people to replace those university faculty through the elementary 
and high schools and undergraduate programs, our system would be 
of little use.

productivity, thinking about accessibility to colleges and 
universities, and doing something in every elementary school and 
every high school in Canada.  That is the way a federal 
government should think, nationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, except in the House, I have never heard a protest 
from the provinces about interference by the federal government 
in their jurisdiction with respect to SchoolNet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also mentioned, in that same section, the community access 
program, which does the same thing.  It links people to the 
Internet, but in this case, in my riding for example, it links 
libraries, township offices and other public places to the 
Internet so that people who are not in elementary school and high 
school can link and interact with the great virtual world of the 
Internet.  The Canadian Network for the Advancement of Research, 
Industry and Education, CANARIE, does the same thing.  It links 
research organizations across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is that the discussion we have had about productivity 
is not simply a matter of manipulating taxation, although in the 
measures I mentioned there were some taxation changes; it is a 
matter of the fairest possible and most effective tax system we 
can have, but also positive investment in areas which encourage 
productivity such as those I have mentioned.

vote, and I suppose in a way I do not blame it, since we have 
already filed our income taxes which concern this bill.  I do not 
understand exactly what the government is doing. 
We thought we would be using the day to debate this issue, to 
talk about taxes and the measures the government is using, and 
here we are with a very flagrant motion to stop the debate and to 
basically shut off our discussion on this whole topic.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish that people in Canada knew what was going on in the 
country.  We have a lot of members who are very upset.  I am 
talking about members of our society, our citizens and taxpayers. 
They are very concerned because we have a government that 
insists on taxing them to death.  At every turn there is another 
tax.  There is a tax on a tax.  The governments of the past 30 
years have not done a thing about this.  They have simply been 
riding roughshod over taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Liberal government has brought in a bill to implement parts 
of the Income Tax Act provisions from the 1998 budget after the 
provisions have already been put into practice.  That probably 
puts the thumb on the whole issue of why we are in such trouble 
in this country.  These Liberals want to pass themselves off 
across the country as having been successful in bringing our 
fiscal house into order.  That is what they keep crowing about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that we have more debt than we did 
when the Liberals first took office, about $180 billion more.  We 
have higher interest payments on the debt as a result, even 
though we are blessed these days with low interest rates.  We 
have an endless stream of taxes and user fees.  The average 
Canadian family has at least $3,000 less than it had when the 
Liberals took office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the way parliament works is the root of the 
problem.  We have no mechanism by which the taxpayers can be 
represented here, no mechanism at all.  Many members over there 
would argue that is not true.  The Liberal government represents 
the government and its wishes.  Liberals vote the way the Prime 
Minister or the finance minister directs them.  They will 
acknowledge that they do not represent the people, that they vote 
on these issues the way they are told to.  Surely it must be the 
role of the opposition to represent the people here.  That is 
fine, but the frustration is that we on this side get up to speak 
on behalf of taxpayers, we speak on behalf of students, we speak 
on behalf of those people who are laying on cots in hospital 
hallways, we speak until our voices are hoarse, but no one 
listens.  No one does anything about it.  Then, when it comes 
time to vote, we are routinely outvoted simply because we do not 
have quite enough members here yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am looking forward to the day when we have members in this 
House of Commons on the government side who, in contrast to the 
Liberals and the Conservatives, are dedicated and committed to 
representing the people who sent them here, to representing the 
taxpayer and the call for lower taxes, for fairness in taxation 
and decency in the way the government spends our money, not the 
flippant kind of spending that we see over and over again from 
this government.  It is really atrocious that the government 
keeps doing these things and not listening to taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will refer briefly to a newspaper clipping, the headline of 
which indicates that 85% of Canadians are upset by the tax bite. 
I suppose that no one would really ever say that they love taxes. 
If I earn money and someone has the legislative right in this 
country to take it away from me, I suppose, no matter how good 
the cause, there is going to be a certain degree of resistance to 
that. 
However, we ought to pay attention when the headline says that 
85% of Canadians are upset.  In the text of the clipping it says 
that these people are very concerned about taxes.  They are upset 
by them.  In that scale of question, half of Canadians said they 
were very upset or extremely upset.  The reason is twofold.  The 
total tax bite is too high.  Together the different levels of 
government take too great a proportion of our earnings.  It is 
around 50%.  It takes until July 1.  Maybe that is why it is 
called Canada Day.  We work from January to July just to pay our 
taxes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is little wonder that the proportion of families who have two 
earners instead of only one is being increased so much, against 
the will and the choice of many Canadians.  They simply have to 
do that in order to pay their taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have mentioned in the House before that my wife and I decided 
she would be a full time mom.  What did I do?  I had to get an 
evening job to supplement the income.  I used to tell people that 
I worked on Tuesday night for Trudeau and on Thursday night for my 
family.  Back in Trudeau's time it was already that bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has it been alleviated?   Did nine years of Conservative 
government solve the problem?  I think not.  We had a massive 
increase in our national debt under that administration.  Have 
the Liberals solved the problem?  They want people to think they 
have.  I suppose reluctantly we ought to say, thank goodness, at 
least they did not spend the surplus that was dumped into their 
lap through lower taxes, particularly in Ontario and Alberta, and 
more competitive and better trade because of the free trade 
agreement.  The Liberals were against it, but it has been a bit 
of a saviour for our country and our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is incredible that these people want us to believe they have 
done anything.  I insist that the budget is balanced these days 
despite the government.  If we had not had this government we 
would have been way further ahead now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it atrocious that the government has absolutely no plan 
to reduce the debt.  Over 30% of our tax dollars go to pay 
interest.  That is a direct transfer of wealth from ordinary 
Canadians who are earning it to the pockets of the bankers and 
the rich people who have more money than they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have poor people who are hardly able to make ends meet.  They 
have to pay atrocious rates of taxes, one-third of which go to 
interest payments on the debt.  Does the finance minister or the 
Liberal government have any plan to reduce that debt?  The answer 
is no, they do not have a plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a copy of the figures taken from the budget.  This 
happens to be the 1999 budget, but the comments are still 
appropriate, even though we are talking here about the 1998 
budget.  It is the same thing.  I am looking at the net public 
debt numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that the deficit has gone down, but what has happened 
to the public debt?  What is the plan?  The net public debt in 
1998 was $579.7 billion.  What is the plan for 1998-99, which 
is the budget we are talking about?  It is right in the document, 
$579.7 billion.  It is exactly the same number.  What is the plan 
for 1999-2000, the budget which the finance minister gave several 
months ago?  It is $579.7 billion. 
In that document, for the year 2000-01 what are they projecting 
for the debt?  It is $579.7 billion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the change in the debt?  Zero.  Because the government 
has no plans to pay off the debt.  Instead it is saying it has a 
contingency fund and if it does not need it, of course it will be 
used to reduce the debt.  Meanwhile the government is using all 
sorts of chicanery in its budgeting process, in its documentation 
and in its communications and says “We are going to take this 
money and put it into a fund.  We will be able to use it so that 
Canadians will think we are doing something”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this budget which we are talking about today, and the debate 
on which has now been shut down, there is a motion about the 
millennium fund. The parliamentary secretary, for whom I have a 
lot of personal respect, read a departmental speech and referred 
to the millennium scholarship fund.  That is atrocious.  It is 
against accounting rules.  It is against everything that makes 
any sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government in the 1998-99 budget is costing out money that 
will not be available until the year 2000 so we can celebrate the 
year 2000.  It is taking money year by year, budget by budget, 
and socking it away for the big Liberal re-election fund which 
coincidentally will happen within a year of the millennium 
celebration.  That is atrocious.  The way the government is 
trying to spin it is absolutely shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a son who is a student and is really having trouble 
making ends meet.  He has to look after his family while he goes 
to classes.  He is trying to earn money so that he can pay his 
tuition and provide food and housing for his family. He has to 
make enough money so that he gets close to having to pay taxes. 
If he actually earned enough so that he could get by without 
having to borrow, he would have to pay taxes. As it is now, all 
the Liberal government does is force him into debt while it is 
saving up for its election fund with this big high power 
millennium scholarship fund for students in the future.  The 
government is ignoring those who have a genuine need today. The 
1998-99 budget ought to deal with the issues of 1998-99 first and 
foremost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not against the government saying it projects in subsequent 
budgets that this will be done and there is room for long term 
planning, but to actually budget it out is contrary to the rules 
of accounting.  It is contrary to what the auditor general says 
is acceptable and those guys are doing it anyway.  They are 
running roughshod over the rights of Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of the ways the government mismanages and misspends 
money.  My hon. colleague from the NDP brought some of these to 
our attention already.  It keeps spending money and wasting money 
on things no Canadians would support if they were actually given 
an opportunity to vote on them.  Instead the government is just 
wasting our money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member mentioned the dumb blond joke book for $98,000. 
There are people in my riding who make $15,000 a year and pay 
taxes.  If I asked them if they were happy about the fact that 
the taxes they are paying are going to supplement the publishing 
of such a book, they would really get upset and I would not blame 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other things which are just ridiculous.  There is one 
in Hamilton which is using $60,000 of taxpayers' money, which I 
suppose is the money that 60 middle income taxpayers have to earn 
in a month. Sixty taxpayers will be sponsoring a trail in 
Hamilton so that visitors can stroll along and discover old 
factory buildings.  That is totally absurd. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to leave the money in the hands of the people who earn 
it.  Sure we can justify taking money out in the form of taxation 
for reasonable expenditures, but this type of thing has to stop. 
I am committed to making it stop.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a millennium project under way recreating the Calgary 
town hall with the original bell for $1.1 million.  Why can the 
locals not do that?  It is because the federal government is 
taxing them to death.  They have no choice in these matters.  The 
whole country has to fund this. It is absolutely ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. I have been listening attentively for the last 12 minutes 
to the member for Elk Island.  I look at Bill C-72 and I see 
things which deal with supplementary personal tax credits and the 
homebuyers plan.  I have not heard the member talk about anything 
pertaining to Bill C-72. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am sure the hon. 
member for Elk Island will make his speech pertinent to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, of course the member is 
totally wrong. The millennium fund was announced in the 1998 
budget and the member knows it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  This bill, Bill C-72. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, Bill C-72 deals with the 1998 
budget and that is what we are talking about.  We are talking 
about the whole issue and what should have been in this budget. 
We are talking about what should have been in Bill C-72 to fix 
the budget to make it right.  Instead we are being fed all this 
garbage.  I think it is time that we looked at the way the 
government does these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Income Tax Act is pages and pages of convoluted words that 
only add to the distress of Canadian taxpayers. There are several 
ways to reduce taxes but all of them require the use of 
professionals.  Gone are the days when ordinary taxpayers making 
$12,000 or $15,000 a year could do their own tax forms. Canadians 
have to hire professionals.  They know that this government will 
screw them out of another couple of thousand dollars unless they 
have a paid professional. Whether Canadians pay the government or 
the professionals, their money is being stolen from them. It is a 
shame and the government ought to be ashamed of itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does Bill C-72 say about health care?  It is what it does 
not say.  It is a fact that budget after budget is a shell game 
on how we are going to communicate.  We have a government that 
talks about an education budget.  All the government does is it 
arranges for students to have a maximum amount of debt.  The 
government gives them no real help.  It taxes them.  Sure the 
government gives a little deal with a tax break on the interest 
on student loans. Thank you very much but that has to be the 
correct kind of loan. Bank loans are not covered.  Is that not 
shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some students cannot get enough money from their student loans 
to go to school, especially mature students with families.  They 
do not have enough money from the basic student loan to attend 
school.  They have to get a bank loan.  Can they deduct that 
interest?  No.  They pay taxes and interest on the money that is 
left after the tax bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is how the government operates.  It takes money over and 
over again from those who are unable to pay a great deal because 
of their low income levels.  Not to mention the fact that our 
dollar has slid down to almost zero because of the tax and grab 
scheme of the federal government. I think it is atrocious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have tax changes that are supposed to increase the 
non-refundable personal tax credit for the individual surtax. 
Once again the spin doctors and the communicators announce a 
number, $500.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it was 1874. 
The North-West Mounted Police, only one year old, was dispatched 
from Manitoba to points further west.  The primary goals were to 
establish friendly relations with the aboriginals and to maintain 
peace as settlers arrived.  Two hundred and seventy-five men, 114 
ox carts, 73 wagons, 93 cattle, field artillery and agriculture 
tools were on their way to Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now 125 years later this trek west is being re-enacted as a part 
of preserving the history of our proud police force.  Saturday, 
just two days ago, the first contingent left Emerson, Manitoba. 
The northern contingent of this trek is expected to arrive in 
Fort Saskatchewan in my riding on July 23. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are proud of our history and the RCMP which had its 
beginnings 125 years ago.  Congratulations to the organizers and 
participants in this historic re-enactment.  We look forward with 
enthusiasm to the excitement of this celebration throughout the 
summer.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
after a year and a half of talking about a national children's 
agenda, the federal government has released a brightly packaged 
piece that talks a lot about vision but demonstrates very little. 
In fact, this supposed blueprint for children is only a starting 
point for public consultation, which in turn will lead to a 
vision document in the fall, which may or may not lead to 
concrete action a year from now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us put things in perspective.  In the time it has taken for 
the federal government to come up with this discussion paper, 
thousands more children have slipped below the poverty line. Why? 
Because Canada now has the dubious distinction of having cut 
more on social programs than any other G-7 nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Poor Canadians are suffering because the federal budget has 
directed not one single federal dollar to families on social 
assistance since 1985 and because of broken promises on a 
national child care program.

call on the government to fast track this process to ensure that 
it is children who benefit, not Liberal policy wonks and

</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government under the national strategy on community

run a project called the diversion protocol.  This project will 
assist and support members of the Kitchener community who have 
mental health problems and who have been involved in the criminal 
justice system. The objective of the diversion protocol is to 
assist individuals and provide them with the necessary resources 
for managing their mental illness and ensure they do not become 
involved in a cycle of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mental health problems affect more Canadians than does any other 
illness.  In Ontario approximately 1.5 million people have some 
form of mental illness.  It is therefore important that this

organizations to ensure that Canadians with a mental illness have 
access to the programs and services they require.

proportions and the Liberals choose to fund lobby groups to fight 
crime rather than deal with the drug tragedy.  The effects of a 
government devoid of a drug strategy led this weekend to a riot 
at the Kent maximum institution in British Columbia where inmates 
high on heroin went on a $50,000 rampage. Add heroin to inmates 
already known for violence and escape and you have a recipe for 
this kind of carnage.

conditions of the five conditions we put forward was the end of 
the violence and the security of Kosovars returning to their 
homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The partial withdrawal will probably not satisfy the goal of 
making sure that the refugees can go back in total security.  At 
this moment it is better than having no offer at all.  My view is

the conditions of the 19 countries, but in terms of implementing 
them there will be some discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an element too that we have to keep in mind.  There 
will always be a minority of Serbs in Kosovo who will need 
protection.  There is a group of Kosovars who would like to gain 
the independence of Kosovo through an armed struggle.  We have to 
ensure that there will not be war there.  That is why there are

framework agreement. I should point out that there are now half 
a million more Canadian children living in poverty than there 
were in 1989. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister have the courage to admit that if there 
are 60% more poor children than in 1989, it is largely because 
of his government, which made very deep cuts to the Canada 
social transfer and to employment insurance? 
<P><A NAME="LINK72"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
set up new programs such as the credits for poor children, which 
will total $2 billion as early as July 2000. This means there 
are new programs. Other new credits have also been put in place. 
I am convinced that our programs will prove helpful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for transfers to the provinces, the provincial governments

<P><A NAME="LINK73"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is a 
classic scenario. First, this government cut funding, thus 
putting pressure on the services, and then it got involved in 
jurisdictions in which it has no business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the Prime Minister is: Could it be that his 
government is about to get publicity at the expense of Canada's 
poor children? 
<P><A NAME="LINK74"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have provided child benefits since 1946, if I am not 
mistaken, when the Constitution was amended to allow family 
allowances in Canada. Therefore, such benefits do come under 
federal jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We changed the tax credit formula, so that those who do not need 
such credits do not get them, thus leaving more money for those 
who need it. This is the system that is in place and that was 
negotiated a few years ago with all the provinces agreeing. 
<P><A NAME="LINK75"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have no 
problem with the federal government talking with the provinces 
about the problem of poverty.  But in Quebec the government has 
begun implementing various components of a comprehensive family 
policy. Federal interference that might be detrimental to this 
policy and this approach would not be welcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs tell us whether 
there will be discussions with Quebec, like those with the other 
provinces, regarding the right to opt out with full

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for 
Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, one excellent example of federalism has to be the 
national child tax benefit. It was designed to allow each 
province to set up its own programs, while the federal 
government focuses on helping the children of poor families 
within its own constitutional area of jurisdiction. This has 
provided most of the funding for Quebec's five-dollar day care 
program. 
<P><A NAME="LINK77"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Quebec did 
not sign the social union framework agreement because it does 
not want the federal government interfering in our areas of 
jurisdiction and undercutting what we do by making direct 
transfers to individuals. 
Either the federal government will impose its new programs on 
Quebec or it will give Quebec the right to opt out with full 
compensation.

At this moment, reports from our ambassador indicate that no

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
bill on young offenders is not short on contradictions. For 
example, the French version of the statement of principles in 
Bill C-68 alludes to the positive perspectives and social 
reintegration of adolescents, while the English version refers 
to the meaningful consequences of the crimes committed by young 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering the fundamental contradiction that exists between 
these two principles, could the minister tell us which version 
will guide the courts: the French one or the English one?

that there is a problem with the form of expression in either 
the English or the French text of Bill C-68, I would be more than 
happy to discuss the matter with him in committee.  If changes 
need to be made we will accommodate them.

the minister's colleagues in the Senate are saying the same

issues as they develop their land code.  If they would just read 
the bill they would see the answer.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Now farm organizations want a grain freight rate costing review 
because recent efficiencies within the system appear to be 
favouring CN and CP by about $200 million a year.  Two hundred

</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the Minister of Transport is, when he meets with

Estey's report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are looking at a process that would facilitate an 
implementation of Justice Estey's report.  The government feels 
that Justice Estey has put together a reasonable group of

review transportation costs in any comprehensive way.  The

stand ready to help the minister in this costing review.

heartened by the fact that the four western provinces have been 
united in their support for a more competitive grain 
transportation handling system, including the Government of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, one 
of the very negative consequences of the downloading of social 
housing and co-op housing by the federal government has been the 
confusion around the management of co-op housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister of public works knows there has been a very 
spirited campaign from the co-operative housing federation for a 
third sector agency.  The minister has agreed to this in Ontario, 
but there is also a campaign in B.C. to have the same kind of 
arrangement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister respond in the affirmative to the request from 
the co-op housing movement, and when will he make an announcement

will deal with it every time we negotiate with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of British Columbia as soon as negotiations start we 
will definitely discuss them.  The same arrangements that were 
given to the Ontario co-ops can definitely be offered to the

for the second time in a week a Sea King was forced to make a 
precautionary landing due to a gear box problem.  According to 
experts a gear box failure could be catastrophic.  With all the 
problems with our 35 year old Sea Kings the minister's comment in 
scrum was “let's not exaggerate”.

<Question No. 195—<B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the preparation of the budget presented on 
February 16, 1999: (<I>a</I>) what expenses were incurred by the 
Minister of Finance and the Department of Finance for outside

services; and (<I>b</I>) what steps were taken to ensure that outside 
consultants were not able to use budget information for 
commercial purposes? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK188"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> As in previous years, the Department of Finance 
enlisted private-sector expertise to assist in the preparation of 
the 1999 federal budget and, more particularly, the government's 
efforts to communicate to Canadians the budget's contents and its 
possible impacts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover and again as in previous years, strict measures were 
put in place to ensure that those whom the department contracted 
were unable to use their pre-release knowledge of the 1999 
budget's contents to realize commercial and/or individuals gains. 
Specifically, those contracted with knowledge of the budget's 
contents prior to its release are legally bound to adhere to the 
provisions of the Official Secrets Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those contracted to assist the government with the prepqaration 
and communication of the 1999 budget and the xpenses incurred for 
said assistance were: Principium Inc., $44,000 for speech writing 
services performed for the months of December 1998 through 
February 1999; Earnsciffe Strategy Group, $60,000 for strategic 
services and advice provided from November 1998 through February 
1999; HyperActive, $11,541.61 for on site technical support in 
February 1999 for the creation of interactive Internet 
presentations; and Magma, $17,575 for provision in February 1999 
of an outside of government server used to broadcast the live 
budget speech over the Internet in real time. Magma did not have 
access to any budget inormation previous to its release. 
<Question No. 213—<B>Mr. John Herron:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regards to the Department of Fisheries and Oceans 
announcements on June 19, 1998, of a $100 milion program for 
measures to protect and rebuild salmon fish habitat on Canada's 
west coast is there a similar program available in Atlantic 
Canada that has the same four components of (1) establishing a 
permanent fund for habitat initiatives, (2) developing community 
based stewardship programs aimed at protecting habitat from 
further damage, (3) extending community restoration and 
partnership programs, and finally, (4) increasing public 
awareness of the problems affecting salmon stocks and, if so, how 
much money is spent in Atlantic Canada on this type of program? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK189"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
The $100 million program to rebuild west coast salmon 
habitat announced June 19, 1998 was part of a $400 million 
comprehensive program to rebuild the resource, restructure the 
fishery, and help people and communities adjust to the changing 
fishery.  That same day the government announced $730 million for 
restructuring and adjustment measures for the Atlantic groundfish 
fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the west and east coast initiatives are both aimed at 
ensuring stable sustainable fisheries, they have been 
individually tailored due to the differences in the nature of the 
fisheries issues on each coast.  On the west coast the major 
commercial fishery, salmon, is particularly dependent on healthy 
and productive fish habitat in freshwater streams which are more 
susceptible to the impacts of human development.  For this reason 
a large portion of the west coast program is devoted to habitat 
conservation and enhancement.  On the east coast, production for 
habitat is not a key limiting factor with respect to groundfish 
fisheries.  As a result the adjustment measures are focused on 
reducing industry capacity trough licences retirement; adjusment 
measures to help current and former TAGS, The Atlantic Groundfish 
Strategy, recipients become self-employed, get work experience, 
develop new skills or relocate; extra help for community and 
regional economic development, to be provided to Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency for co-operative initiatives with provinces 
and other partners; and a cost shared early retirement program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On July 17, 1998, the government announced $1.16 million in 
funding to support volunteer groups in their efforts to improve 
and restore local waterways.  The funding is to be provided under 
the Canada-Nova Scotia co-operation agreement on economic diversification. 
<Question No. 222—<B>Mr. John Duncan:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For each of the last two fiscal years, with the last fiscal year

</I></B></P><P align=left>*Full-time equivalent, FTE 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of National Revenue is constantly updating the 
way it does business in order to improve client service and 
increase efficiencies. One example of such change is e-file for 
the electronic filing of personal income tax returns, which is 
now being used by over 25% of Canadians. Changes such as e-file, 
telefile and corporate e-file will reduce the workload in all of 
the department's processing centres. Rather than allowing these 
workload reductions to occur across all centre and suffer the 
resulting reduction in efficiency, the Department of National 
Revenue is redirecting the work from the Ottawa Tax Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As announced in October 1996 the Ottawa Tax Centre has assumed a 
new role as a specialized technology site with a national call 
centre, as well as scanning and imaging systems. The processing 
of personal and corporate tax returns previously handled by 
Ottawa is being redistributed across the seven other tax centres 
located in Surrey, Winnipeg, Sudbury, Shawinigan, Jonquière, St. 
John's and Summerside. This will require some boundary adjustments 
for all centres. This change will ensure that the Department of 
National Revenue's processing operations remain efficient in 
processing the reduced number of paper returns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The total number of personal income tax returns being redirected 
nationally is 3.9 million and the total number of corporate returns 
is 231,000. This year the total number of returns that 
are being redirected to Shawinigan from Ottawa and north eastern 
Ontario is 695,000 personal returns and 28,000 corporate returns.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to what my colleague had to say and 
I would like to ask him a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is his view of the way the government actually does its 
accounting?  Perhaps he could elaborate on that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that gives me carte blanche, 
does it not?  What do I think of the way the government does 
accounting?  I think it does not do it right.  It is disobeying 
the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the auditor general has said as much.  It is not 
permitted under the rules to charge expenditures from one year's 
budget to different years' budgets.  The government is doing this 
continuously.  According to its numbers it has put $11.5 billion 
into health care.  That is the number its spin doctors like to 
put out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the details, we see this one time payment of $3.5 
billion being available to the provinces any time they want it. 
When most ordinary thinking Canadians hear that they think it is 
$11.5 billion plus $3.5 billion because that is the way it is 
communicated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not explicit so I checked it out.  The accounting methods 
are totally unacceptable.  In the 1999 budget the government 
charged $3.5 billion against the 1998 budget even though it was 
already past.  That is not acceptable.  It cannot backload 
expenses.  No business can do it.  The government should not be 
able to do it.  Then it forward loaded expenses like the 
millennium fund, about which I have already spoken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to finish off on health care, if we look at what the 
government has put into the budget it is $2 billion a year on 
health care.  That means $2 billion this year and $2 billion next 
year.  That adds up to $4 billion, but the way it is being done 
is that the $3.5 billion comes out of that.  It is not an extra 
amount at all.  I have checked this out because I did not 
understand it. 
At a committee meeting I explicitly asked the officials to 
explain this to me.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also clear after we read the documents for the fifth time. 
We can finally understand that this is what the government is 
really saying.  There is zero more in the budget.  Next year 
there will be half a billion dollars more for health care.  After 
that the government is talking about $2.5 billion and $2.5 
billion and $2.5 billion.  Most of us would think that is an 
increase of $2.5 billion every year.  Wrong.  It is an increase 
of $2.5 billion from what it was before the first five year plan 
started. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is taking an amount and milking it for all it 
can.  Everyone thinks it is a big amount because the government 
is announcing the same amount over and over, but it is actually 
one amount being announced five times.  I think that is 
dishonest, if I dare say that.  It is communicating to Canadian 
taxpayers, to the citizens of this country, our voters, the 
people who want to put their trust in this parliament— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I listened with interest to what the hon. member had to say and I 
think he used the word dishonest.  It is my understanding that 
that is an unparliamentary word.  It is inappropriate in this 
case anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I heard the word as 
well and I heard the context in which the word was used.  The 
context was not attributing it to a specific member of the

In my opinion it was used in a parliamentary fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I apologize.  I mean no 
offence, as I am sure the hon. member understands.  However, I 
think that Canadian taxpayers have the right to know what is 
actually going on.  The government's accounting methods are not 
correct.  The auditor general has said so.  We need to listen to 
what the auditor general says.  It is his duty and it is the duty 
of all of us as parliamentarians to guard carefully the 
accounting and the expenditure of the money that Canadian 
taxpayers are forced to give to the government.

been brought in by the budget.  It deals with what I would call 
piecemeal tax relief for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says it is giving a non-refundable tax credit for 
interest paid on student loans.  I do not think any Canadian 
would have a problem with that.  The government is proposing 
changes to the registered education savings plan.  I do not think 
anyone would have much of a problem with that.  This is a small 
step toward correcting the problem of high debt loads which 
students pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my last speech to this House I talked about the problems 
facing students.  We see the government again addressing this 
issue in a piecemeal way.  The government is claiming credit by 
saying it is addressing the heavy tax burden from which Canadians 
are demanding relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government estimated that it expects a $3 billion surplus in 
the budget.  Most forecasters are now expecting that the 1998-99 
balance could be anywhere between $7 billion and $12 billion. The 
government is not really looking at the money that is forecast 
and it does not have a proper plan to provide tax relief to 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues from the NDP and the Conservatives talked today 
about income tax reform to address all of the issues. 
They feel that tax credits should not be the driving force.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern is that we could have tax reform, but we do not want 
tax reform where, in the final analysis, the bottom line remains 
the same and the government gets more money from Canadians. 
There is no point in tax reform which transfers the burden from 
one group to another group.  What Canadians are asking for is 
real tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today in the Montreal <I>Gazette</I> there is an article with the 
heading “I do not pay my taxes joyfully”.  This arose from the 
fact that Reverend Bill Phipps said we should pay our taxes 
joyfully. In the article the writer talks about how much tax he 
had to pay after he did his income tax return.  His bottom line, 
after indirect taxes, service fees and all of the taxes that are 
taken from his pay cheque, came to 60%.  Sixty per cent of our 
income is going toward taxes.  I do not think there is any 
Canadian who would say that they would joyfully pay 60% of their 
income toward taxes when they feel there is no return from the 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was another news item in the paper today saying that when 
the premiers meet at their annual conference in Montreal, 
productivity and tax reduction will be at the top of the agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard the business community screaming about high taxes. 
Now we have the business community, the provinces and Canadians 
talking about high taxes.  I do not know whether my colleagues on 
the other side, when they go back to their ridings, have 
constituents coming into their offices talking about high taxes, 
but they are coming into my office talking about high taxes. 
Students are talking about high taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have heard government members and the parliamentary 
secretary giving great facts and figures on how they are 
addressing this issue.  However, nothing has happened in 1998 and 
1999 with respect to tax relief.  If we were to take their 
figures, in 1999-2000 the total tax relief will be around $55 
million.  That is a positive aspect for all Canadians.  When we 
take it further, in the year 2000 we will have bracket creep, 
which the government does not wish to talk about.  The bracket 
creep will increase and will take more money away from Canadians. 
They will be paying more taxes than they are now.  Where is this 
tax relief they are talking about? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we add to that the CPP increase.  No matter what we want to 
say, the mismanagement of the CPP has resulted in a negative 
balance and it is a tax that Canadians are paying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the government wants to say that it has been addressing 
the demand for tax relief, more and more Canadians are saying 
that it is not fair.  There is no tax relief for them.  There is 
just a manipulation of accounting procedures.  My colleague just 
spoke about the accounting procedures that the government 
employed, which everyone is questioning, including the auditor 
general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the tax relief that the government talks about?  I sat 
here this morning and heard the many points on tax relief that 
the government talked about.  However, when we look at what is 
happening out there, tax relief is not there for Canadians. 
How long will Canadians wait before this government addresses the 
issue?

</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear from the finance minister that he would like to take a 
cautious approach.  He is keeping money in the contingency fund. 
Now we see that the surplus will jump from $7 billion to $12 
billion.  What will the government do with the surplus? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government likes to put forward the argument that if it gave 
tax relief the social services which Canadians dearly love, 
especially health care, would somehow face a crisis.  I would say 
that health care is facing a crisis already because of the cuts 
the government implemented.  Now it is putting money back, but it 
is only what it took away.  What about expansion?  Canadians are 
getting older and older.  It is not sufficient to put back the 
money the government took away.  The health care system is 
looking for more solutions and more money because more and more 
Canadians are getting older.  That is why we have a health care 
crisis.  When huge surpluses are being racked up by this 
government it is wrong to say that if tax relief is given somehow 
it will impact the health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other areas where the government could cut waste.  It 
has been identified many times in this House that the government 
could cut taxes and it would have no impact at all on many of the 
social services and health services we have in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that the federal government is the last one to 
address this issue.  The provinces have already started to 
address the issue of tax cuts.  They understand that the burden 
on the Canadian taxpayer is very heavy.  The federal government 
is the only one that does not seem to realize or understand the 
feelings of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-72, which the Liberals call a housekeeping bill, we would 
oppose.  We oppose it not because there is no tax relief in it, 
because we understand that there is some small tax relief, but 
because it does not address general, overall tax relief for 
Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lou Sekora (Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam,

about the budget and a few other things.  I have been here for 
only a year.  I came from a city where I was a council member and 
a mayor for many years.  All we hear from members opposite is 
crying and complaining about many things, but they never come up 
with any solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have surpluses in Canada for the first time in many, many 
years, and a balanced budget.  The fact is that the federal 
government paid down the debt load by $30 billion just the other 
day.  The debt load is coming down.  We have a balanced budget 
and a few other things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite mentioned health care.  The premiers are very 
happy with the money the provinces received for health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite mentioned high income taxes.  B.C., where I 
come from, has an income tax rate which is 15% higher than any 
other province.  Ontario lowered its income taxes, but the 
Ontario government borrowed the money to do that.  Does it make 
sense to borrow money to give people a break?  This government 
will do it the way it should be done.  When there is money in the 
budget it will lower taxes.

am a little confused.  I believe this was a speech and it was a 
very short speech, but I was getting ready to ask a question of 
him since I think he just made a speech and we should now be in 
questions and comments on his speech.  Is that correct? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  That is a really 
good point of order.  After two years it is the first point of 
order that has been a real point of order.  It is a point of 
order because I recognized the hon. member for Port 
Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam.  I believe I asked three times 
for questions or debate and I recognized the member on debate and 
so it was.  The hon. member for Elk Island has a question to pose 
to the member for Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The government side would have no objection to the member for 
Elk Island answering the questions of the member for Port 
Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Let us sort it out 
then.  Was the question asked of the member for Calgary East? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  In that case we will 
take it on advisement that the hon. member was rising on 
questions and comments and that the question was directed to the 
member for Calgary East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I understand it is 
questions and comments and I am so happy to see the member 
finally ask a question.  I was sitting here for such a long time 
and he would not rise to ask a question. I am so glad he rose to 
ask me a clear question.  He asks what party I am in.  I am from 
the official opposition which will keep him in line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talks about a balanced budget.  No wonder he has not been 
asking any questions.  He does not know his facts. Of course we 
all believe in balanced budgets but the issue is that when there 
is so much surplus, where is the tax credit?  That is the issue. 
Canadians are saying enough of this tax burden.  Where are you in 
coming along and saying yes— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am sorry but I 
have a responsibility to interrupt to ensure things do not get 
out of hand.  Please address each other through the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my apologies.  I should 
talk through the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate today is not about a balanced budget.  The debate is 
about tax relief.  The government is talking about the tax relief 
it has given out.  That is what we are talking about.  We would 
like to point out to the hon. member that the tax relief his 
government is talking about is piecemeal tax relief and it is not 
what Canadians are looking for. There is a huge debate going on 
among Canadians including businessmen and students.  They are all 
saying that there has to be an approach taken by the government 
that addresses this basic question. The bottom line is Canadians 
are saying to get off their backs.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to address Bill C-72.  The 
title of the bill is sort of scary in itself. Bill C-72 is an act 
to amend the Income Tax Act and implement measures announced in 
the February 1998 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It scares the pants off me whenever the government starts 
talking about income tax changes and implementing its budget 
proposals. What was even more frightening was when the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance talked about 
the fact that this was just not a one year approach, that the 
government's approach back in 1993-94 was going to be a 
continuing approach. 
It certainly has been.

<A HREF="#LINKT54"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw the tax increases by the Liberal government start in 
1994.  At that time we gave it the benefit of the doubt.  We 
thought maybe just for that year we would see the income tax 
increases the government was proposing, but in fact we have seen 
them every year since the Liberals have been in power.  The 
parliamentary secretary has certainly given credibility to the 
tax increase plan the government had back in 1994 when he said 
that it was not a one year approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the Canadian people have a little bit of a problem 
with the income tax increases that have been brought in by the 
government since 1994.  As a matter of fact, there has been 
almost $40 billion of increased taxation since the government 
came in.  That was brought about by some 38 or 39 individual tax 
increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To see the members of the Liberal government stand and talk 
about tax decreases or tax relief is a shock in itself.  It makes 
one wonder what kind of horror movies they have been watching 
that would demand this huge turnaround in their thinking, which 
we cannot take with much credibility anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other frightening thing the parliamentary secretary said 
this morning was that the government has eliminated the deficit 
and that it is not borrowing any more to balance the books.  The 
Liberal line is “We do not borrow any more; we have eliminated 
the deficit”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real story is the Liberals have raided the EI premium 
surplus fund to the tune of well over $20 billion.  They have 
simply taken the money despite the fact that the current premium 
of $2.55 per $100 of earnings has been described as being far too 
high by their own people within the EI commission.  The EI 
commissioner has clearly said that a premium of $2.00 per $100— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It is down from $3.05. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member says 
it is down from $3.05.  That is good.  I am glad they brought it 
down from $3.05 to $2.55.  The fact is they suddenly stopped. 
They stopped within 55 cents per $100 of what the EI commissioner 
said was sufficient to maintain the EI fund as well as to provide 
for a rainy day fund in case there was a dramatic decrease in the 
economy and more people were claiming benefits.  It is still 
several billions of dollars ahead of what is required to sustain 
the fund and provide for EI benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we are on the subject, the Liberal government has cut 
benefits to EI payees, to the workers in Canada.  It has cut 
benefits by almost 40%.  Almost 40% of the benefits that were 
available to workers in Canada before the government came to 
power in 1993 have been eliminated. Millions of Canadian workers 
are still paying the price for the plan they had in 1993 but the 
benefits of the plan have been cut by about 40% by the 
government.  That is one of the ways the Liberals managed to 
eliminate the deficit and of course it is another tax increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the Liberals are planning on scooping, I think the number is 
about $30 billion, from the public service pension fund. 
One has to ask if this government simply has no shame when it 
comes to scooping money.  These funds were contributed, yes by 
the government, but in good part by the public servants 
themselves who work for the government.

<A HREF="#LINKT55"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says no, it has this surplus and it is not going 
to use it to enhance the retirement benefits of the public 
servants.  Rather it is going to take it all out of there because 
after all, it is in its bank so it can do it.  That is a pretty 
high-handed attitude from this Liberal government which has 
always claimed that it is a government which is there to 
represent the people and to reflect in its policies the wishes of 
the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the hon. member for Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam 
is in the audience.  I am glad he is because obviously he needs 
as much exposure to debate in the House as he can possibly get so 
he can catch up to the rest of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have here is a give them a dime take another dollar type 
of government. This government is like someone who will take the 
whole jug of water away from someone who is about to embark on a 
desert trip. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lou Sekora:</B>  What about a brain transplant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris:</B>  Is it not amazing that when the 
hon. member for Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam comes into 
the House and listens to reasoned rational debate which he has no 
answer for, his only response can be incoherent babble. If the 
hon. member really wants to find out what his government is doing 
rather than simply what it tells him, he might listen to the 
debate that is coming forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was also interesting to hear the Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Minister of Finance talk about the raising of the tax 
exemption for firefighters and volunteers from $500 to $1,000. 
That is good and we certainly support that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that since 1994 the government has 
taken another $2,200 in personal income taxes out of the pockets 
of the firefighters and other volunteers who serve our citizens 
so well.  It has taken another $2,200 in net personal taxes from 
the firefighters and then it has turned around and given them 
another $500 in tax exemptions, which would be worth maybe about 
$200 or $300 in actual net taxes.  The firemen after six years of 
Liberal government are still at a net tax deficit of around 
$1,800.  Would it not be nice if it had left the paycheques of 
the firefighters alone? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has an insatiable appetite for taxing Canadians. 
We are as you well know, Mr. Speaker, the country with the 
highest personal income tax in all the G-8 countries.  I know you 
are aware of that, Mr. Speaker, and I know that it really rubs 
against the grain of your fiscal conservative thinking.  I know 
that you are a free enterpriser, Mr. Speaker. I know you hate 
income tax.  I know you can hardly stand it when you are in that 
chair listening to the government talk about how good it is to 
the Canadian taxpayer.  Mr. Speaker, I sympathize with your job 
when you have that bunch standing up in the House today talking 
about just how tax friendly they are to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has never yet addressed the question of the 
unfair taxation of Canadian families, particularly two parent 
families who have one single income in the household.  The other 
day I pointed out one example and I will do so again for the 
benefit of the Liberals who have trouble understanding things 
when they are told just once.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On one side of the street lives the Jones family: two parents, 
two kids and two incomes.  On the other side of the street lives 
the Smith family: two parents, two kids and one income.  Both 
families earn a household income of $60,000 a year.  Everything 
is the same except one household has two jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The big difference is that the Smith family has made sacrifices 
because they have realized that in their particular case there is 
value in having a parent at home to help on a full time basis 
with the guidance of the children.  Because they have made that 
decision they will pay about $5,000 more in personal income taxes 
than the Jones family who live on the other side of the street. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not saying that either side has made the wrong decision 
or the right decision.  It was their decision to make.  What we 
want to know is why the so-called Canadian, family friendly 
government thinks it is fair to penalize the Smith family with 
one parent staying at home to the tune of $5,000 each and every 
year out of their income tax? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has not addressed that yet.  That is tax 
discrimination of one of the very worst kinds.  Most members know 
what I am talking about even if the member for Port 
Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam is still having problems 
figuring out what day of the week it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have an unfair, unclear, incomprehensible and 
unacceptable tax code.  Canadians have been looking to the 
government for some sort of tax relief.  Middle income Canadians, 
who are by far the biggest supporters to the personal tax revenue 
the government grabs every year, have not had a tax break and are 
still waiting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Middle income families have contributed about 70% to the 
personal income tax of the government.  They are wondering why 
they are still being penalized while everyone else is getting a 
tax break.  They want to know why wealthy Canadians and poorer 
Canadians get a tax break but middle income Canadians do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message is that the government really is not the caring 
government that it says it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, despite two sterling examples in the country, the 
provinces of Ontario and Alberta, the government has not 
realized, despite examples from all over the world and 
particularly in the United States, that there is a direct 
connection between high tax levels and high unemployment as well 
as a direct connection between low tax levels, low unemployment 
and a buoyant economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces of Alberta and Ontario have given tax relief to 
their working residents and their economies have boomed. More 
jobs have been created in Ontario.  The biggest portion of jobs 
that the Liberal government likes to crow about were created in 
the provinces of Ontario and Alberta, the very two provinces that 
gave their residents real and substantial tax breaks.  The 
government stands up and takes the credit for that.  That is 
insane.  Has it no shame? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces with the lowest unemployment in the country are 
the ones that have given their residents substantial tax relief. 
They have done it and have still allowed for increased spending 
in education and in health care.

election because he has lived up to his promises.  He has a very 
buoyant economy.  He has had to address the health care and 
education problems created by the NDP under the leadership of Bob 
Rae when he was the premier.  The problems fell into Mike Harris' 
basket after the people of Ontario threw out the NDP and their 
disastrous performers.  I just cannot wait until June 3 when we 
will see Mike Harris, the tax cutting premier of Ontario, 
returned as premier again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals still do not get the message.  They do not know the 
direct correlation between low taxes, low unemployment and a 
buoyant economy.  Our party has a lot of problems with the way 
Liberals run the finances of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in Port Moody—Coquitlam not too long ago and met with 
some of the people who voted for the member for Port

were very happy to see him leave town.  They also said that they

well said by economists in the country that were it not for our 
export market, our country would be in serious problems because 
we do not have a domestic economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be very thankful that the U.S. is so buoyant right 
now.  Its consumption of so much of our Canadian goods and 
services is giving our economy a bit of a boost. Why is it able 
to help us by buying our products?  It is because its economy is 
booming.  Why is it booming?  It is because its tax levels are 
far lower in every area than they are in this country.  We will 
unequivocally oppose Bill C-72.

have heard a lot of discussion, debate and lectures on taxation 
and on monetary and fiscal policy, but I have never heard such a 
rambling diatribe of information as I have just heard in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to come reality.  We are not here to speak for 10 
minutes and consume the 10 minutes.  We are here to present 
facts, realities and some conclusions to the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After listening to the member talking about the two families, I 
cannot help but wonder what the attitude and policy is of the 
Reform Party.  It seems to show that two low income families 
should pay the same amount of taxes as one major income earner 
family.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member comment on how his party could come to the 
conclusion that two families, being compared in terms of total 
income, one where two people each earn $20,000 a year, should pay 
the same income tax as a single earner earning $40,000 per year. 
Could the member please inform the House of his thinking, his 
logic in coming to that conclusion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I guess the member 
for Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam was making too much 
noise for the hon. member to really understand what I was saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about total household incomes.  The money comes 
into only one place, whether it is earned by one parent or two in 
that family.  The family on one side of the street happen to have 
two parents working with a total household income of $40,000. The 
family living on the other side of the street, the Smith Family, 
have only one parent working but also have a total household 
income of $40,000.  No family is making more money than the 
other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals do not understand that the disposable income left 
in the hands of the $40,000 one income family after the taxman 
gets hold of the paycheque is about $3,500 less to buy shoes for 
the kids, to put food on the table, to buy clothes and school 
supplies and to send their kids to what little recreation they 
are able to afford.  That is the tax discrimination I was talking 
about.  I do not know why the member did not understand that. 
There is no difference in household income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difference is the discrimination that comes when the tax man 
comes a-calling on their gross paycheque.  Why should this 
family, when they have one parent at home but the same income as 
the other one, be dinged an extra $3,500 or so, simply because 
they have made sacrifices to have one parent at home to help full 
time in the guidance of bringing up the children?  Who can argue 
against that?  Only the Liberals can.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was very 
interested in my colleague's speech.  He has a way of putting 
into simple words a very important concept and that is that 
Canadians are taxed to the hilt and they are sick and tired of 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing that rather interested me was the way the government 
keeps doing its accounting and trying to communicate to Canadians 
that they are doing just fine and everything is tickety-boo, 
everything is clicking along whether it is or not, because the 
communications do not always agree with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was quite surprised to hear the member from Port 
Moody—Coquitlam announce that the government has paid down $30 
billion on the debt because I had not heard about that.  It was 
news to me, but maybe I just have not picked up the newspaper 
today to read this announcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I made a phone call asking about this and apparently it is true. 
Can my colleague who just spoke comment on where he thinks this 
money came from?  Does he know anything about this?  How 
wonderful that the government is paying off the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member 
for Elk Island for the question.  I think it raises another very 
serious question.  If the Liberal government has paid the $30 
billion, that is fine, but where did it get it from?  Where did 
it come up with $30 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect the government has already taken the $30 billion out 
of the public service pension fund.  Let me say that again. Has 
the government already taken the $30 billion out of the public 
service pension fund without bringing it forward to the House 
first in some form of a bill that would allow them to do it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe the parliamentary secretary to the government House leader 
can tell us—and this would be scary in itself—whether the 
government can simply scoop that $30 billion without bringing it 
to the House for a vote, a vote which of course the Liberal 
majority would ram through anyway?

is piecemeal tax relief.  What is his view of the fact that the

stock options to address the brain drain in the high tech 
industries? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for Calgary East for the question.  It raises another 
question. Why does the finance minister not recognize 
particularly middle income Canadians and the terrible tax burden 
they are under?  If he is going to give tax relief on the stock 
options to the high tech people, why is he singling them out for 
special favouritism? Why is he doing that?  If he believes in tax 
relief, why does he not reflect it with a policy and program that 
is going to give broad based tax relief to working Canadians, 
particularly those in the middle class?

</I></B></P><P align=left>About a year ago I received a letter from a constituent of mine 
which has to do with the complications in the income tax form.  I 
am going to quote from it.  Dalton Fisher states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just added up my expenses and my income and find that I 
cannot afford to hire a tax consultant to do my taxes so 
therefore I have provided a sheet of paper complete with all my 
income and expenses and I have filled out my tax form to the best 
of my ability.  I therefore submit the same for your audit.  Or 
for your acceptance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like at this time to submit that if the tax form were 
made simpler then most people would gladly fill out their entire 
form and make life simpler for the tax department and for the 
average taxpayer. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think he has a good point.  I would like my friend to comment 
on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this has been a 
request we have had from Canadians all across the country.  They 
have been tearing out their hair for years in frustration over 
the complexity of the income tax form.  It might be good for H&R 
Block and the accountants but for the average Canadian of which 
there are far more, the tax form the government uses is 
absolutely ridiculous in its complexity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly Dalton Fisher's suggestion that we have a very 
simplified tax form would be a very welcome relief for Canadians. 
But once again this is talking about common sense, something we 
have not seen from this Liberal government since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Resuming debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask for unanimous consent, particularly because 
the hon. member for Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam did not 
have a chance to ask an intelligent question— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  That is not a point 
of order, and it would not have been acceded to in any event.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, today I 
would like to take a different approach on reviewing Bill C-72, 
which is an act to amend the Income Tax Act and implement 
measures announced in the February 1998 budget.  I did hear some 
of my colleagues talk about the 1999 budget.  I am going to focus 
my attention on the 1999 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say right off the bat that it is very easy for an 
opposition politician to criticize.  We can criticize almost 
anything.  It is also as easy for a government member to put a 
spin on something that is very positive.  That is part of the 
government-opposition interchange. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting when a member of the government does a 
critique of its own budget. That has happened. I am not going to 
embarrass him by identifying him specifically, but there is a 
current sitting member of the Liberal government who is a well 
respected accountant.  He came from an accountancy background to 
this place.  I have talked with him personally.  I find him to be 
a logical reasonable individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said that he would try to do a critique, a review of 
the budget each time it came out.  He has no axe to grind.  He 
has no reason to put a spin on the proposal.  He is a 
straightforward accountant.  For the benefit of Canadians, I 
would like to go over the things that he says about the 1999 
budget.  Next year there will be an implementation bill just like 
this one for the 1999 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of the surplus that has been reported in the 
current budget, there is an $11.5 billion surplus just reported 
in this budget.  This MP says, and says it very plainly, that the 
$11.5 billion surplus comes from increasing tax revenues, not 
from spending cuts.  Let me quote that specifically again.  The 
surplus in this budget comes not from spending cuts, which is 
what the government has been saying over and over again, but from 
increasing tax revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an accountant he went through and picked out the figures. 
This is very useful. He also made a condemnatory statement when 
he said “These figures here I think have been massaged”.  A 
Liberal member of the government commenting on the Liberal budget 
said again “These figures here I think have been massaged”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He turned his attention to spending.  The first budget from the 
Liberals came down in 1994.  The last budget was in 1999. He went 
back and looked at the spending in 1994.  This is discretionary 
spending, something the government could do something about. In 
1994, $56.7 billion was spent.  In 1999, $54 billion was spent. 
We heard over and over again about the huge amounts that spending 
had been reduced by.  The difference is $56.7 billion down to $54 
billion, a grand total of $2.7 billion, not the figures we have 
been hearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then he turned his attention to taxes.  He did exactly the same 
thing.  He went back to 1994 and to see what the government took 
in in taxes, and this is a public document and a public record, 
and the projection for 1999.  He found that in 1994 the 
government took in $116 billion in taxes.  In 1999 it proposes to 
take in $157 billion in taxes.  That is an increase of more than 
$40 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will go back to the original statement.  The original 
statement was plain, that the surplus in the budget comes not 
from spending cuts but from an increase in revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened to my colleagues across the way say that it is 
because the economy is working so much better and they are 
getting more tax revenue. 
There is some truth in that statement.  There is more revenue 
because the economy is better, largely because of provinces that 
are now booming.  The provinces that are booming are provinces 
that have actually had a significant change in their taxes.

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about the debt.  He said “My government 
promised to put revenue excess to pay down the debt”.  He looked 
at the figures.  Accountants really have a talent for this.  He 
looked at the figures and found that there is no reduction in the 
debt.  To the member across the way who said that the government 
has reduced the debt by $30 billion, this is what his compatriot 
said.  There is $580 billion of debt now and that is shown right 
through to 2000-01.  As plainly as I can state it in the member's 
words there is no reduction in the debt. It is difficult to 
refute when the figures are so plain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of the way the accounting is done is where the 
member's comments become so perfect.  As an accountant he said 
“The finance minister has hidden some revenue”—interesting 
words for an accountant—“in things like the $3 billion 
contingency fund”—which is an emergency fund—“or into lump 
sum payments for health care which will not be spent until next 
year”.  The member then followed that statement by saying “This 
flies in the face of good accounting”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hark to the words of the auditor general who said exactly the 
same thing “this flies in the face of good accounting”.  The 
auditor general will not sign off on this method of accounting, 
nor will the sitting Liberal member who is an accountant.  This 
money will not be spent this year.  It should not be booked this 
year.  It should not artificially reduce the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I digress from the member's comments and ask why would the 
finance minister not want Canadians to see the surplus?  Could it 
possibly be because there is a lot of pressure on him to spend 
that surplus now, to go back down the deficit road?  I think so. 
Could it possibly be that the finance minister wants to hold on 
to any surplus so that it could be used closer to an election? 
Possibly. Interesting questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal MP, an accountant, then turned his attention to 
public debt charges.  This is interesting.  We are told debt 
charges are going down.  The cumulative debt and cumulative 
interest are going down.  That makes sense.  The interest rate is 
going down.  In 1997 the public debt charges were 40.9% and in 
2001 the public debt charges are 43.3%.  They rose.  His comment 
was “He is showing”—that is the finance minister—“cumulative 
interest going up, yet we know market debt is going down. 
Something does not add up”. These are not my comments and not my 
criticism.  These are the comments and criticism of the Liberal 
MP who is an accountant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the surplus he says plainly that the government expects an 
$11.5 billion surplus.  He said “I think if it”—the 
budget—“was based on generally accepted accounting principles, 
yes, there is a surplus and the public has a right to know how 
much it is”.  We come back to the issue of the hidden surplus. 
I query again why would the surplus be hidden?  The Liberal 
accountant MP asked the question, not myself. 
I do not know who asked the question, but he was asked whether 
the current budget gave a clear and accurate picture of 
government finances.  His answer was an emphatic no.  The answer 
from that sitting Liberal MP was no when asked whether the budget 
gave a clear and accurate picture of government finances.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to look at the way the government balanced its 
books, which is something I do not believe the public has a good 
grasp of.  The budget was a health care budget. My prime interest 
in being in the House is health care.  We saw all the advertising 
and heard all the talk about an $11.5 billion increase to health 
care funding over the next five years.  That in itself was 
wonderful news.  We would expect bells to ring across the country 
when the public heard about it.  How could anyone criticize it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not now speaking for the accountant across the way.  I am 
speaking for myself.  Since 1993 I have watched cash transfers to 
the provinces drop $21.4 billion in the previous five years.  Let 
us think of the cumulative effect on the provinces of them 
dropping $21.4 billion in five years.  In the next five years 
they are to rise $11.5 billion.  Is there any wonder why there is 
no cheering?  Is there any wonder why there is no excitement?  Is 
there any wonder why there are still long waiting lines for 
health services? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to a colleague across the way haranguing the Ontario 
provincial premier on Thursday on the issue of health care.  He 
said that the provincial government in Ontario had done terrible 
things to health care.  The figures are plain; $1.3 billion were 
put into health care by the Ontario government while the federal 
Liberals took out $3 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could an individual Liberal in good conscience say what he 
said?  It is a great difficulty.  I will say it again as plainly 
as I can.  Over five years $21.4 billion was taken out of health 
transfers and over the next five years $11.5 billion will be put 
back in.  When I speak to kids in grade eight they say to me 
“Doc, the math doesn't equate”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget is very easy for an opposition politician to 
critique.  I have chosen to use a Liberal MP's critique of it to 
say that all is not as it is spun.  Are there good things in the 
budget?  Let me take a few moments to say yes, there are.  Are 
there things that I will not critique?  There are.  I believe 
there are things that my Liberal accountant colleague across the 
way would say are positive in an attempt to say there is some 
balance.  None of these words were my critique, except for the 
health care critiques.  They are the ones that are probably the 
most condemnatory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me summarize the comments of the Liberal MP accountant.  I 
have not identified him so that he will not be embarrassed.  In 
summary, the budget surplus comes from increasing tax revenues, 
not from spending cuts.  The debt will the same from now until 
2001 according to the budget projections. 
The Liberal MP stated on the accounting that the finance minister 
had hidden some revenue.  This flies in the face of good 
accounting practice.  On the public debt charges, something is 
going on that does not equate.

it.  The Liberal MP said it.  The accountant MP said it, and I

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am very interested in the hon. member's comments on 
the underfunding of medicare.  He is, after all, very familiar 
with the system, having worked in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problems with medicare are not confined to any particular 
province or to any particular stripe of provincial government.  I 
live in Saskatchewan, the cradle of medicare, which has a 
dreadful situation.  I do not blame the provincial government. I 
do not agree with its politics, but I cannot point to the 
provincial government and say it has allowed the system to 
collapse out of malice or ineptitude.  It has collapsed because 
of chronic underfunding from the federal government, which has 
lowered its annual contributions from 50% when it started out 
down to about 15% now.  No provincial government can stand that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are hospitals in Saskatchewan where elderly helpless 
people have to rely upon relatives and friends to bathe them and 
to feed them because there simply is not enough staff to carry 
the load.  I have had personal experience in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have lived in several Third World countries and that is the 
way hospitals operate there.  When did we get to that stage of 
development in Canada?  This is awful.  I blame the members over 
there totally for this situation.  They took $21 billion out of 
the health system in a period of only five years and now, 
whoopie, they are to put $11.5 billion of it back over the next 
five years.  For that we are supposed to be eternally grateful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is a medical doctor.  I would like him to 
comment more fully on that.  I am sure his range of knowledge is 
wider than mine.  I can speak only anecdotally, having seen these 
things with my own eyes.  I would like him to say whether he 
believes any province is doing worse than another or can be 
blamed for the disastrous condition of medical care in Canada 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I lived in Saskatchewan for 
a period of time.  I just recently completed a tour of that 
province on this issue.  It is true that there are problems in 
Saskatchewan.  A number of hospitals were overbuilt in the years 
of largesse, building up a fairly significant debt structure in 
Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specific to Saskatchewan, it spent more on health care during 
the time of the cuts.  It is closest to the people who are ill 
and has the most accountability. Every province in Canada but two 
during the times of reduction found funds by priorizing and 
cutting funds in other areas.

for the federal Liberals to cut.  There were large grants to 
successful businesses totalling billions of dollars.  There was 
the opportunity to remove regional grants that were choosing 
areas in which to place money.  There were significant areas of 
spending that were completely useless and easily totalled the 
$21.4 billion over five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How was that cut from health care?  It was hidden under the 
Canada health and social transfer.  The public was ready for 
deficit reduction at almost any cost, until it found out that the 
cost was our grandmas and our grandpas on waiting lists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why health is now the most important issue and why it is 
so politically popular to say somebody else will be the 
scapegoat.  The fact of the matter is the public does not care. 
It does not want to point at anybody.  It wants the health care 
system fixed and that is what we should be expending our efforts 
doing.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to rise in debate.  As my colleague 
from Cypress Hills—Grasslands stated, we in Saskatchewan have 
taken a terrible beating in health transfer costs because of the 
government opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were to talk about individual cases which have come across 
my desk, I would be speaking at midnight about the horror cases 
in my province.  People would like to blame that totally on the 
provincial government.  When a any government issues a figure of 
$11 billion it sounds good, but it forgets to tell us to divide 
it by five. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the way into work the other morning a radio host had three 
people on his show representing the three parties in Ontario in 
the upcoming election.  I could not believe what one individual 
said, that we just could not stand any more tax cuts.  If there 
is anything the country needs right now, it is individual tax 
cuts.  A T-shirt can be seen on almost any street in any Canadian 
city which says “Tax me, I am a Canadian”.  I have three 
brothers who went state side and stayed there to develop their 
professions for obvious reasons.  They could not stand the 
Canadian tax regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It used to be in April of any year most senior citizens on my 
block would come to me with their tax forms.  They would ask me 
to fill them out.  It was a very simple form and I gladly did it. 
Now it is no longer a simple form.  It has become a very 
complicated form.  Only a government can produce a complicated 
form for a very simple process of collecting income tax from an 
85 year old lady. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about simple forms.  Saskatchewan farmers used to 
get a form from the government by mail.  I cannot ever remember a 
form coming from the government on Internet.  They have to apply 
for it or have to go to the RM office for it.  It constitutes 
about 40 pages even though the form itself may only be seven or 
nine pages.  The farmer looks at it and says “It is like my 
income tax.  I cannot fill out this form”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite tell me that it is a very simple form.  Of the 
hundreds of people who phoned in, I only know of three who 
actually tried to fill it out themselves.

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We continue to completely ignore the wishes of the people.  One 
Norwegian chap phoned me and said that he thought the government 
should get a very simple form with only three lines on it.  The 
first line would be “How much did you make?”  The second line 
would be “What were the expenses?”  The third line would be 
“Kindly remit the rest”.  That is about the way it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to congratulate those who figured out the AIDA form.  They 
did a masterful job.  It would take real brains to figure out how 
to force a person farming to put all of this down on a form, only 
to find out how much money they made and there would not be any 
help coming.  That is the kind of form it is.  It is a Rubik's 
cube. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have a right to know about our budget.  When I was 
asked on television what I would say about the budget if I were 
the finance minister, I said that I would say this to all of the 
employees and workers in Canada:  “Thank you very much.  We just 
robbed you of $26 billion bucks.  Thank you very much, workers 
and business people, because that is what we took away from you 
in extra employment insurance premiums”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thank you should be mentioned.  We ought to thank those 
who contribute to the pension fund because the government is 
dipping into that fund and will take out $30 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The “tax me, I'm a Canadian” theory goes beyond just income 
tax.  I must mention something that really bothers me.  There is 
excessive income tax, but the government is also finding the ways 
and means in different departments to take more funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where I live partly borders on the state of Montana and partly 
on the state of North Dakota.  There are nine border crossing 
points and many of my people live closer to a hospital south of 
the 49th parallel than they do to a hospital in the province. 
Members will know that when their wife is expecting they will 
take the shortest route in the case of an emergency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what happened to a family that lived almost 70 miles 
closer to a hospital in Montana than they did to a hospital in 
their province.  This couple has paid their income taxes and has 
watched the form grow and grow.  They have watched their taxes, 
municipal taxes and school taxes, grow until they are at the 
point that they get the AIDA form and they do not even know if 
they can fill the thing out.  On three occasions Brian and Louise 
did not have much choice.  Away they went.  After less than 30 
miles they were in a modern hospital.  Three of their four 
children were born stateside, just a few miles across the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are Canadian people.  Both mom and dad were born here in 
Canada.  Both paid large income taxes.  Both paid huge 
agriculture taxes.  Both paid huge road taxes, and they do not 
have any roads.  Their children received their birth certificates 
from the states.  The oldest boy is now 14.  Guess what?  He has 
to get a SIN number to take his driver's training.  Guess what? 
It is going to cost Brian and Louise $75 a kid, or $225, for them 
to get their SIN numbers.  Talk about a government that does not 
miss a beat.  Congratulations.  If it can get its hands in the 
pockets of a Canadian citizen, it certainly knows how to do it. 
These people and many people who cross the border in an emergency 
situation in my constituency use the hospitals in the United 
States.  It is not out of preference, it is because of an 
emergency.  They do not ask the provincial government or the 
federal government to pay their costs, they just do it.  But when 
these three individuals want to get their social insurance 
number it will cost them $75 apiece.

What will their member of parliament do?  Just what I said I 
would do; not only will I speak in the House about this, but I 
will write the particular authorities to complain bitterly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to humanize this whole idea of extracting money.  We 
simply make fools out of ourselves by doing this.  These three 
little kids, born to Canadian parents, have lived here, have been 
raised here and went to school here, but the government says 
“Give us a little more”, and they are protesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I want to draw the attention of the House to another 
factor.  I mentioned this case before.  There was a single 
working mother who had two children.  The government finally 
caught up with her husband and extracted a lot of money from him 
for support payments.  He was made to pay three years of support 
payments, which amounted to about $11,000.  What did the 
government do?  It said “Give us $5,500 all at once”.  My 
argument is that members opposite are wrong.  It should have been 
divided by three and it should have been at that rate, but so far 
this valiant young mother has not heard from Revenue Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that Canadians deserve a little more attention.  Perhaps 
the government could humanize its approach to Canadians.  We are 
human beings.  Brian and Louise do not have $225.  They do not 
even know if they will be able to plant a crop because of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not one cent of AIDA money, to my knowledge, has been dropped 
into the province of Saskatchewan.  I know the minister says that 
the farmers in Prince Edward Island have it and the farmers here 
have it.  They all had their forms before ours were printed.  I 
would bet that our income tax forms arrived at the same time.  I 
know that mine did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents are like other constituents.  The young people 
move away.  There are more than 200 students going to university 
in Minot.  Why?  Because they can get bursaries and grants and it 
is cheaper.  Why do we do this?  Why do we continue to tax 
ourselves to a standstill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I most certainly will not be supporting Bill C-72.  I cannot do 
it.  My conscience would not let me do it even if I were sitting 
on the other side of the House, but I expect that all of those 
members will support it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charles Hubbard (Miramichi, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
somewhat amazed to hear the hon. member.  He may recall last fall 
when he and I had a lengthy conversation on the farming problems 
in the province of Saskatchewan.  Following that we implemented a 
program which provided some $900 million to help the farmers 
across this country.  Where does the member think that $900 
million came from?  Was there some magic pot or was it from 
taxation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am glad the hon. member 
asked that question.  First of all, when that program was 
announced there was some reluctance on the part of Saskatchewan 
to even opt into it because basically, as this House knows, most 
of the farmers in Canada live in Saskatchewan. 
Therefore, the greater proportion of the 60:40 split would have 
to be borne by the provincial government.  The province opted in, 
but, interestingly enough, just a week later the agriculture 
minister for Manitoba said “We are opting in because only 15% of 
our farmers will qualify”.  What did the minister of agriculture 
for Manitoba know that we did not know?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now know that less than 15% of our farmers will qualify 
because of the Houdini form that has been sent out.  The 
government is returning to Canada's number one industry, 
Saskatchewan's number one industry, $900,000, which is a great 
deal less than was spent on the floods and the ice storms, and 
those people deserved it.  Is the government trying to say that 
the people out there do not deserve it?  They did not deserve the 
forms which were sent out.  Most assuredly, that is the biggest 
disaster they have had so far. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when the hon. member for Souris—Moose Mountain was 
talking about disasters in the medical system in Canada I thought 
he would probably mention another case from his riding which I 
believe is the most atrocious I have heard so far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An elderly man was suspected of having a brain tumour.  He 
needed an MRI.  With Canada's wonderful system he could get one 
within a year.  He thought that was a little tough, so he went 
across into the United States, as just about everybody does in 
that part of the world.  He got his MRI and was told “You, sir, 
have a brain tumour.  It is growing rapidly and if you do not get 
it removed right away you are going to go blind”.  So he said 
“I still have a few years left.  How much is it going to cost?” 
He was told it would cost $40,000.  He said “I just happen to 
have saved in my lifetime $40,000, and my sight is worth it, so 
go for it”.  They operated and removed most of the tumour.  The 
gentleman went home quite content. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then he decided that for his checkups, which he had to have 
after major surgery of that nature, including another MRI, at 
least he would get that done in Canada and it would be covered by 
our wonderful medicare system.  Lo and behold, he was told “No, 
my friend, you had that work done in the United States.  To hell 
with you.  Go back there to get your MRI checkups because we are 
not going to have any part of you here in Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely unconscionable that Canadians would be treated 
that way.  First they get driven out of their country to seek 
medical care and then, when they come back, the bureaucrats are 
so mean-spirited that they will not even give them follow-up 
care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am curious.  I would ask the hon. member what is going on with 
that particular case now.  Does he have any new information? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in that case the individual 
tried through various means and ways to get some support, or at 
least to get back what it would have cost in Canada, or a portion 
thereof, but he was not able to do that.  He saved his own life. 
The officials refused to give him treatment.  He was refused that 
surgery outright for at least three months.  He would have been 
dead.  He saved his life and now, as my hon. colleague has 
mentioned, he has been denied follow-up care simply because he 
used the services at a clinic which is world famous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to face reality.  There are hundreds of cases like this. 
The least the government could do would be to pay a portion of 
their expenses, at least the same portion as they would have paid 
here.  That is not the only case.  There are three more, Mr. 
Speaker, but I know that you do not want to hear about them right 
now.

<A NAME="LINK210">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from May 5th consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-68, an act in respect of criminal justice for young 
persons and to amend and repeal other acts, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee; and of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
bill, of which we are resuming debate at second reading today, 
was initially introduced on March 11 by the Minister of Justice. 
Today, we will continue debating the motion moved by the member 
for Laval-Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all it must be remembered that all Quebeckers, without 
exception, spoke out against and opposed the approach proposed 
in Bill C-68. This bill is a useless, dangerous, vicious and 
right-wing, if not extreme right, piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, the rate of youth crime is the lowest in Canada. Why? 
Because Quebec authorities look after teenagers and young people 
and provide them with a framework. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-68 would lower the age limit from 16 to 14. This would 
mean that 14 or 15 year olds could be tried as adults. I wonder 
if the Minister of Justice has teenage children of her own, if 
she has raised children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the chance and the pleasure of raising three children who 
are now young adults, and I have vivid memories of my son, when 
he was 14, 15 or 16 years of age, playing with his Tonka cars in 
his twelve by twelve sandbox. He did not look like a criminal, 
but I often looked at him and observed him. All the kids from 
the neighbourhood liked to come and play in the sandbox. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My son was no saint at that time. He probably stole carrots from 
our neighbour's garden, apples from our other neighbour's apple 
tree, he probably went fishing and exceeded his quota, but he 
did not become a criminal.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Had he had the bad luck of hanging around with friends who could 
have had a negative influence on him, he could have become a bad 
boy. A one night or one week adventure could have landed him in 
jail. Even at 14 or 15 years of age, he could have been 
incarcerated in a facility for adults. The danger is that, when 
a young person is treated as an adult, that young person is 
still at the learning stage and jail is the worst school there 
is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, under this bill, 14 or 15-year old children who receive 
an adult sentence could have their name and even their picture 
published in the newspapers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice minister is a member of the Liberal government, the 
same party that, under Pierre Elliott Trudeau, slipped a bit 
towards the left, as hon. members certainly remember, when the 
House voted to abolish the death penalty. Does the minister 
today think the exact opposite of what her party stood for at 
the time? I do not think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice minister represents the riding of Edmonton West, in 
Alberta. I wonder if she is not about to give in to the right, 
to the extremists who say something like “He who kills shall be 
hanged”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I was elected to this House, I had the pleasure to teach 
for 27 years. 
During those 27 years, I met thousands of high school students 
and often the teachers would see how some of them behaved and 
comment among themselves “If this young guy does not change 
soon, he will run into some serious trouble”.  I remember we 
were all in agreement about one student in particular, who 
seemed to be highly refractory. A few years later, he pulled 
himself together, and today he is a much sought-after renowned 
lawyer who earns a respectable living. The entire teaching staff 
was wrong about him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you yourself have been young, and you know that 
young people sometimes go out, in groups of three or four, in a 
car, and end up in a bar. With such a party atmosphere, one 
young person in the group could be a little more devious than 
others and lead good boys and girls to commit an unfortunate 
act. Thus, one evening's mistake could ruin a lifetime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was talking in fact to my colleague from Berthier—Montcalm of 
the example of David Milgaard, in Saskatchewan, who was 
imprisoned some 20 years because of an error of justice.  It 
would seem the Government of Saskatchewan is getting ready to 
compensate him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When an adolescent is incarcerated for over 20 years, these 
being the best years of his life, a few million dollars cannot 
rectify such an error.  They are preparing to give him $2 
million plus $20,000 a month for life.  Naturally, such 
situations give us pause for reflection.

commitment by the Minister of Justice, who comes from Alberta. 
She seems to want to espouse the ideals of the Reform members 
increasingly.  This is most unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like in closing to quote the opinions of a number of 
Quebeckers on Bill C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>André Normandeau, a criminologist at the University of Montreal, 
said, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>People out west are still reacting the same way they did 20 or 
30 years ago, when crime was constantly on the increase.  They 
have retained a highly punitive mindset.  Changing the law is 
too simple and, more importantly, ineffective.  Coercion has no 
effect at all on violent crime, which accounts for 10% of the 
whole. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So said André Normandeau in the March 13 issue of <I>Le Soleil</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now refer to what Cécile Toutant, another criminologist 
and member of the Quebec Bar Association's subcommittee on young 
offenders, had to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When interviewed on the television 
program <I>JE</I>, the criminologist expressed her concerns about the 
reform, because of its potential for automatic referrals to the 
adult court. 
The criminologist maintained that, despite the flexibility of 
the process, there will be the possibility of measures being 
applied.  She wondered why what is unjustified and inappropriate 
should be made possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec there is unanimous support for rejecting bill C-68 
which, I would remind hon. members, lowers the age of adulthood 
from 16 to 14 years.  Placing children of 14 or 15 in 
penitentiaries, where they will be raped and come under the 
influence of adult criminals, means the lives of these 
adolescents will be ruined for ever.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to get up to speak to Bill C-68. My 
colleague from the Bloc Quebecois may get his wish.  At the rate 
the bill is going through the House, and with rumours that we may 
prorogue some time this fall, it may never see its final resting 
place in this session. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last spring the House passed Motion No. 261 which called for the 
establishment of a national head start program.  This motion, the 
vision and work of my colleague from Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, may 
well form part of the solution we seek in the administration of 
youth justice.  I might even mention another colleague right next 
to me, the hon. member for Saanich—Gulf Islands, who seconded 
the motion of the hon. member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The genesis of this enlightened approach to raising, nurturing 
and disciplining a child is based on the concept of prevention of 
anti-social behaviour, rather than the management of a situation 
or problem that has been years in the making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The work and research of my colleague from Esquimalt—Juan de 
Fuca reveals the importance of the first eight years of life.  If 
an individual is exposed to pernicious behaviour such as drug 
abuse, sexual abuse, violence, dysfunctional parenting or absence 
of parenting at all, it has a negative impact on the child's 
brain.  The neurological development of the child's brain is 
impeded.  This has a consequence as the child grows to 
adolescence and on to become adult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question large segments of the current prison 
population are products of negative family exposure years before. 
This does not diminish their deeds, but I wonder if given a 
better chance we could have eliminated some of the possibility 
that these people would turn to criminal behaviour.  Bill C-68 is 
all about making sure that people do not turn to criminal 
behaviour and that young children do not turn into criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not be better to spend a few dollars on those now in 
their formative years of one to eight than to spend it on 
lawyers, courts, psychologists, prisons, halfway houses and 
parole officers later?  As they say, an ounce of prevention is 
worth a pound of cure.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-68 provides us with an opportunity to initiate the 
practice of prevention rather than crisis management.  Have we 
not been practising crisis management of young offenders since 
the early 1980s?  Are we not on a treadmill to nowhere?  Are we 
trying to transmogrify something that cannot be done? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak about a national headstart program as one 
means to start on a different path.  While I realize this 
initiative may not be a panacea, it may be at least one of the 
components in reducing youth crime and developing a more 
emotionally and socially adjusted adolescent into our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the course of my years in politics one of the problems and 
curiosities as I see it in the development of public policy is 
neglect of linkages between programs emanating from department to 
department within governments.  By this I mean government is 
negligent in identifying existing programs and policies which may 
aid or benefit in instituting a new program or help move a new 
concept along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short there is a plethora of programs out there in some sort 
of void waiting to be accessed and used.  We have to get better 
at using the tools we have if we are to make the enlightened 
choices that we should be making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in 1966 the government's own National Crime Prevention 
Council identified a national headstart program as a way to 
prevent crime and one that is cost effective.  I mention again my 
colleagues the member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca and the member 
for Saanich—Gulf Islands who put that motion before the House in 
this session.  In 1996 the government was doing it itself, 
talking about a headstart program yet to this date we do not have 
anything.  There is nothing in this bill that talks about going a 
different way or doing anything different from what we have been 
doing all along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One headstart program that was identified as being instrumental 
in significantly reducing crime was the Perry preschool program 
in Michigan.  This program was one of two others identified, one 
which is in Moncton and the other in Hawaii.  They were proven to 
in total decrease child abuse by 99%. Any program that can reduce 
this problem by 99% is one that we should be taking a quicker 
look at than we are in the House.  A few years ago we looked at 
it from the government side and now this side puts in a motion. 
We are still not looking at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This program kept kids in school longer and dropped youth crime 
by 50% in other areas.  It decreased teen pregnancies by 40% and 
saved the taxpayer in the final analysis $30,000 per child.  What 
a success story.  What a testament if not a template for Canada 
to use as a national youth strategy.  Why are we not doing it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has some money in this program but it only covers 
about 30% of the cost instead of 50% like it agreed to.  It could 
save us $30,000 per child by bringing in this program. Why does 
the bureaucracy not push the government to get this program in 
place? The government bureaucracy says it is a good idea. 
Members on this side say it is a good idea.  We should be looking 
at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We listened to our colleagues from Quebec who are opposed to 
this bill.  They brought up some very good points.  The 
government likes to attack and fight them because they are 
separatists but the facts are that the province of Quebec has a 
lower crime rate for children than we do in the rest of Canada. 
We should be looking at the program Quebec has.  We should be 
paying attention to what is being done there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that when we get this bill into committee we will have 
lots of time to bring people from the province of Quebec to tell 
us what they disagree with in the present legislation and where 
they think we should be going.  We should be looking to where the 
successes are, just as we should be looking to the headstart 
program because of the great success in that program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the critical elements in the success of these three 
programs is the involvement of the parents.  Parents are and have 
to be the axis around which the program revolves.  No amount of 
money will replace the intrinsic importance of good parenting. 
Without a loving safe environment with rules of behaviour defined 
and boundaries established can a child be expected to grow to a 
stable socially responsible participant in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-68 has three elements concerning the role of parents. 
Should a child fall between the cracks and need help, under Bill 
C-68 parents will be called upon to become involved with 
representatives of the community to design and implement 
extrajudicial measures.  There will have to be compulsory 
attendance of the parent at court when considered by the judge to 
be in the best interest of the young person.  There will be 
increased punishment for the parent who signs a court undertaking 
to supervise the young person upon release and who wilfully waits 
or fails to fulfill that responsibility. 
That is extremely important. I will repeat that.  There will be 
increased punishment for the parent who signs a court undertaking 
to supervise the young person upon release and who wilfully fails 
to fulfill that responsibility.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Surrey North played a great part in this 
paragraph that I am reading. We should give him a lot of credit 
for the work that he has put into this youth legislation. We all 
know the effort that he puts in in the House working toward 
children.  We all appreciate his commitment very much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Surrey North can take great pride, credit and 
solace in managing to motivate the government to include his 
initiatives in Bill C-68.  It is because of the member's 
determination and concern as manifested in his private member's 
Bill C-260 that we have the parental responsibility prescribed in 
the new youth criminal justice act.  It is one good part of this 
bill if nothing else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why it is even more unfair for the government members to 
perpetuate untruths about Reform policy surrounding how to deal 
with 10 and 11 year olds in youth justice.  At no time has any 
Reform member suggested incarcerating 10 and 11 year old kids. In 
fact enlightened work like the kind instituted by the member for 
Surrey North indicates a compassion for children and an attempt 
to put the onus on the parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly it is the government that would like to sweep the issue 
of 10 and 11 year olds under the carpet, ignoring this challenge 
by saying there is no problem.  It is simply abandoning these 
children.  Is that not in itself a form of incarceration? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe it is the government that has to take a look at its lack 
of recognition of 10 and 11 year olds in its new bill.  Maybe it 
is the federal government's responsibility  to become equal 
financial participants in programs with the provinces to 
rehabilitate these kids who have strayed. Maybe it is the federal 
government's responsibility to deal now with the issue of 10 and 
11 year olds before they become incorrigibles later on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will however take more than $206 million over three years. 
The provinces have pleaded with the federal government on the 
need to deal with this age group.  Why is it so difficult  for 
the federal government?  Is it because of the money?  That is 
what is scary.  This age group needs help and needs it badly.  It 
is really a money issue.  The government tries to cover it up 
under the flim-flam and the puffery but we need help in those 
areas. The provinces need help in those areas. We will debate 
these issues very deeply in committee and I look forward to that.

is my privilege today to speak to Bill C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Youth crime demands the attention of all levels of government 
and it demands the attention of parents and families.  In Calgary 
I recently attended a town hall meeting for an organization 
called the Friends of Clayton McGloan.  My colleague from Surrey 
North also attended another of the town hall meetings in Calgary. 
This organization was named for a young man whose life was 
tragically taken from him by two young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clayton was stabbed numerous times and left for dead by two 
young thugs. These individuals are now fighting to have their 
cases remain in youth court while the crown is stating its case 
for the adult court. To my knowledge these two thugs have been in 
the system before. These are young murderers and they deserve to 
be held responsible for their crimes.  However in this case maybe 
the law will be on their side.  Maybe they will be tried in youth 
court and receive a much lower sentence than they would have 
received had they been tried in an adult court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The family of Clayton McGloan is fighting through a petition 
asking for fair justice.  The pain and the suffering they have 
gone through can only be felt when we attend town hall meetings 
and we listen to the family's pain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have seen these kinds of cases all too often in the 
last 15 years.  They have seen young murderers and rapists 
receive sentences that do not fit the severity of the crimes. 
Why?  Because they are children. Because we say they do not know 
any better. 
I believe that many of the kids do know better.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition on behalf of Canadians has been calling 
for changes to the Young Offenders Act.  Thankfully something is 
finally on the table for us to debate in this House.  We know 
that the justice minister introduced a new youth criminal justice 
act as a replacement for the Young Offenders Act.  It is my hope 
that the Young Offenders Act will be assigned to the garbage.  It 
has been a failure and Canadians have had to suffer the 
consequences for far too long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice minister upon taking her job promised that 
introducing the new young offenders legislation would be her top 
priority.  That was two years ago.  I had hoped that after such a 
long delay the justice minister would have put forward 
legislation to deal with the complicated issue of youth crime in 
an effective way, yet the youth criminal justice act fails again 
to deliver what Canadians expect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition recognizes that there are two elements 
to youth crime.  One is the rehabilitation aspect and the other 
is an accountability aspect.  My colleague spoke very eloquently 
about what he felt the government should be addressing in the way 
of rehabilitation programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a youth justice committee in my riding.  This committee 
has been doing a tremendous job in trying to address youth crime 
through community sentencing and rehabilitation programs.  It has 
been quite successful.  This is the kind of program we need to 
encourage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also teach the consequences of actions.  We must make 
youths aware of the severity of their actions when they cross the 
boundary and hurt people.  That should be a fundamental aspect. 
Revenue Canada makes good examples of taxpayers who have not paid 
the money they owe. Revenue Canada comes crashing down by 
charging penalties and interest from the first day that they do 
not pay.  Why?  Because the government needs to set an example 
for others. Lo and behold, here we have people committing crimes 
and it is said there has to some leeway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard a colleague from the Bloc address this.  I did take 
exception to some of his comments when he addressed the issue of 
western Canada somehow being a right-wing very uncompassionate 
society.  I beg to differ with that.  I appreciate the fact that 
there is a lower crime rate in Quebec.  As my colleague said, it 
is something we can learn from, but to say that we are 
uncompassionate is not appropriate.  But the Bloc is the 
separatist party so that is fine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When going through this new legislation the feelings of the 
members of the official opposition was that this is simply the 
old Young Offenders Act presented in a different colour and 
format. Some provisions in this bill appear to be tougher. 
However, there is always an opportunity down the road for 
provinces or courts to provide exceptions and maintain the status 
quo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the minister has had to appease all the different 
philosophies within her own government.  Some want tougher 
legislation and others think the situation is just fine. Nobody 
wants to listen to what Canadians are saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this House petition after petition has been presented asking 
for a fair justice system.  The government's thinking is that 
perhaps this is some kind of paper in the basement that does not 
need to be addressed. 
Hence the bill that has come forward has all the loopholes one 
can imagine.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the process the minister claimed she needed time to 
consult with the provinces.  We recognize the provinces have an 
important role to play.  We have to understand just what the 
various regions of the country were wanting in the overall youth 
laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A great deal of this information has already been gathered by 
the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights.  The 
committee spent many months conducting hearings from coast to 
coast.  The committee listened to the provinces.  It spent almost 
$500,000 to provide a comprehensive report with a number of 
recommendations toward significant changes to the youth laws. 
That is how our parliamentary democracy works.  The committee 
conducts hearings and receives presentations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces are not satisfied with the legislation.  The 
minister of justice for Alberta, John Havelock, wrote to the 
federal minister complaining that there had not been adequate 
consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was concerned that the federal government had failed to 
address some of the major concerns of many provinces. Alberta, 
Manitoba, Ontario and P.E.I. all wanted a number of significant 
changes.  Perhaps the most important was the reduction of the age 
of criminal accountability from 12 to 10. One speaker from my own 
town, Calgary's police chief Christine Silverberg, criticized the 
government changes as not going far enough with violent children 
under the age of 12. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not be surprised that this recommendation was not 
included.  Not only did the government ignore its partners in the 
youth justice process.  It ignored the justice committee and its 
report which included a similar recommendation, a committee that 
is made up of a majority of government members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government continues to attack the official opposition.  I 
will conclude by saying that the official opposition, throughout 
this debate, will indicate its concerns and the shortfalls of the 
government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am very 
pleased to take part in this debate on Bill C-68, an act in 
respect of criminal justice for young persons and to amend and 
repeal other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very important piece of legislation that deals directly 
with one of the most delicate aspects of our collective 
behaviour. When dealing with youth crime, it is important that 
society behave correctly so that the situation does not become 
worse for the individual who is directly involved and that 
measures be taken to ensure adequate rehabilitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, Quebec has a very legitimate historical position 
which seems to be the envy of many other countries and which has 
had notable and undeniable success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to share with you an excerpt from the report 
brought forth in 1995 by the task force established by the 
Government of Quebec to look into the Young Offenders Act. It is 
called the Jasmin report, no doubt after the chairman of the 
task force. This excerpt truly reflects the position of the Bloc 
Quebecois, which is valiantly put forward by the member for 
Berthier—Montcalm. I take this opportunity to recognize the 
excellent work he has done on this issue, as he usually does on 
any issue he tackles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote from the Jasmin report: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is often easier to change a law than to change practices of 
intervention. It may be tempting to think that tougher 
legislation is the answer to the problems of delinquency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simplistic responses blind us to the full extent of complex 
problems and create the false impression that we are doing what 
is necessary to resolve them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One such simplistic response is substituting get-tough measures 
for educational approaches. This, however, overlooks the fact 
that adolescents are still in the process of learning, and it 
means they are being saddled with full responsibility for 
delinquency, as if the society and environment they live in had 
nothing to do with it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think these lines are a good reflection of Quebec's very 
progressive position, one which has proved itself and, as I 
mentioned earlier, is the envy of many. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the position of the Quebec coalition, which is opposed 
to the federal government's plan to change the rules of the 
game, putting Quebec in its place to a certain extent, and 
refusing to follow Quebec's lead.  On the contrary, the federal 
government is siding with the Reform Party, which takes a right 
wing approach, an approach pushed by Margaret Thatcher and 
Ronald Reagan when they were in office, an American approach the 
effects of which are becoming increasingly apparent in our daily 
lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The coalition is composed of well known individuals.  They are 
very representative of our society, and speak knowledgeably 
about this issue.  I will name the 16 groups who are in favour 
of the same position, the position supported by the Bloc 
Quebecois, and who all criticize the position of the Government 
of Canada and support that of the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there is the Commission des services juridiques du 
Québec, which represents the defence.  This includes prosecutors 
and defence staff involved in legal proceedings.  As if by 
chance, it therefore includes both those who prosecute and those 
who defend, which is the best proof of all of how representative 
this coalition is of those who work daily in this very difficult 
area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the list of 16 groups: the Commission des services 
juridiques du Québec, which is on defence side; the Conseil 
permanent de la jeunesse; Jean Trépanier, of the School of 
Criminology of the University of Montreal, who is an eminent 
criminologist; the Aide communautaire juridique de Montréal, 
which also works for the defence; the Fondation québécoise pour 
les jeunes contrevenants, the Institut Pinel which is 
represented by Cécile Toutant, also prominent in that area; the 
Association des chefs de police et pompiers du Québec; the 
Conférence des régies régionales du ministère de la Santé et des 
Services sociaux du Québec; the Association des centres jeunesse 
du Québec; the Commission des droits de la personne et des 
droits de la jeunesse; the Bureau des substituts du procureur 
général, which works on the prosecutor side; the Association des 
CLSC et des CHSLD du Québec; Marc Leblanc, of the 
Psycho-education School of the University of Montreal, who also 
is a well-known authority in that area; the Regroupement des 
organismes de justice alternative du Québec; the Canadian 
Criminal Justice Association; and finally the League for the 
well-being of young children of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are Canadian organisations which have made Quebec's 
position their own and whose Quebec section completely endorses 
the position of the coalition and the position of the Bloc 
Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe this shows there is serious unrest on two levels; 
first on the socio-economic level and second on the Canadian 
political level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the socio-economic level, when we talk about young offenders 
and youth crime, fortunately this type of criminality is 
decreasing. Indeed, it has decreased by 23% between 1991 to 
1997. As a matter of fact, youth crime is linked to serious 
unrest in our communities leading young men or women, to commit 
such serious acts. We should not only treat the effects of crime 
but also deal with its causes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As can be seen in the quote from the report, this makes young 
people alone bear the responsibility for delinquent behaviour, 
as though society and the community had nothing to do with it. I 
am deeply troubled by this kind of thinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about young offenders, we are talking about the 
failings of our economic system. We are talking about the 
failings of neo-liberalism, which is promoted by right wing 
parties like the Reform Party, to which the Liberal government 
is much too eager to cater.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The same applies to the problem of the homeless, to the 
unacceptably high unemployment rate in Canada and Quebec, to 
precarious employment, to family violence, to food banks, to 
over consumption of drugs, to mental illnesses, to the 
unacceptably high suicide rate for a civilized society like 
ours, to family tragedies with murder and suicide or murder of 
the wife and children, tragedies that are becoming far too 
frequent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All those things are inter-related, and it is not coincidence. We 
must go to the roots of the problems. We must examine not only 
the effects, but also the causes of these excesses and failings 
in our societies. 
This is when we have to look at the socio-economic causes, 
something we do not do often enough in this parliament, where we 
like to deal with issues on a superficial level, on a case by 
case basis, without ever getting to the bottom of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must talk about the causes and stop talking about the effects 
and quickly go on to some other topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe there is something very political in this bill within 
the larger context of the constitutional debate. What we have 
here is two historically different approaches: Canada's and 
Quebec's. In Quebec the approach focuses less on guilt and puts 
less of a burden on the individual, whereas in Canada it is more 
punitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that the government is ignoring the success of Quebec's 
approach is indicative of the new Canada envisioned in the 
spirit and the letter of the social union, whereby Quebec is not 
recognized as a distinct society, does not have a say, and is a 
province like all the others. It is important for those who are 
listening to understand this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this area, Quebec is a province like all the others. Its 
track record and success story are being trivialized. This is 
the future of Quebec within a Canada where everything is 
trivialized. From now on, Quebec will be a province like all the 
others, and its government will become a regional government. 
This gives us a lot of food for thought.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to have an opportunity to 
discuss Bill C-68 once again.  The motion before the House 
proposed by the Bloc Quebecois looks at the possibility of in 
essence striking the entire bill and sending it back for further 
discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although we in the Conservative Party have great difficulty with 
some of the initiatives, and perhaps more so with the perception 
of what the bill will actually accomplish, I think it would be a 
giant step backward to completely throw the baby out with the 
bath water when it comes to youth justice.  That will not 
accomplish what we in this place hope to accomplish, which is to 
fix a existing fundamental problem when it comes to youth crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One major problem with the Young Offenders Act since its 
introduction over 15 years ago has been the impression the act 
has given young people that they will not be held accountable for 
criminal behaviour.  Right or wrong, that is the impression out 
there and that is what is drastically undermining public 
confidence in our youth justice system and our justice system in 
general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An attempt has been made by the government to address some of 
the problems.  I will be very straightforward in pointing out 
some of the steps that are improvements on what we have seen. 
Obviously the ability to bring parents into our justice system is 
something that has to occur.  However what will occur in this 
instance is not the full package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will happen now is that the parents of young offenders who 
have been apprehended and are in the process of going through 
court and potentially being released back into the community will 
now be forced to come forward, sign, and essentially make a 
contract with the province and the attorney general's department 
that they will ensure the conditions deemed appropriate by a 
court will be followed.  They will be brought to court themselves 
and charged if those conditions are not adhered to. 
That is what will be accomplished and that is a laudable attempt 
to fix some of the problem.

</I></B></P><P align=left>However, what we do not see happening is parents being brought 
forward to answer for where they were in the first instance when 
a child was involved in a criminal act.  Why is it that a young 
person was out breaking into a neighbour's house or stealing 
their car at 2 o'clock in the morning?  That accountability we 
have not yet achieved and sadly we will not through this piece 
of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been much ado, much discussion, much debate and 
acrimony about the age of accountability.  Again I think the key 
word in all of this is accountability.  The Liberals have 
countered attempts by the opposition to debate this issue by 
saying “Look at this overreaction on the part of 
neo-Conservatives who want to somehow throw 10 and 11 year olds 
in jail for criminal acts”.  That is not the case at all.  That 
is certainly not the position that has been taken by the 
Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we want to see happen, obviously, is that if by some 
misdirection or some misdeed a 10 or 11 year old finds himself or 
herself involved particularly in a violent criminal act, there 
will be some mechanism by which to bring that young person to 
account, not necessarily through the full hammer of criminal 
sanctions in a courtroom, but at least there should be the 
ability to trigger a response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it currently stands, that does not exist in our Criminal 
Code.  It exists in other countries.  It once existed in our 
Criminal Code under the old Juvenile Delinquents Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said at the outset, the issue is accountability.  The issue 
is the state, the province, the police and our social services 
having a mechanism by which to bring to account and to bring 
forward some recourse for a young person at that tender age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly the whole principle behind the Young Offenders Act and 
the principle behind the new youth criminal justice act is to 
recognize that there is obviously a difference in the level of 
accountability that will be levelled upon a person under the age 
of 18.  We are saying that it should be taken one step further. 
Drop it down a bit further so that we can at least start the 
process of rehabilitation, bringing that person into a system, be 
it the criminal justice system or be it a diversion into the 
social welfare net.  There has to be something to start the 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that when violent crime is involved the response has to 
be quick.  The criminal justice system, I suggest, is best suited 
and best equipped to make that intervention and then to follow 
through.  After the fact, when an arrest has been made, when the 
justice system has been given the tools to act, then we can 
decide what the long term recourse will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To accomplish all of this the provinces will have to receive 
greater funding.  This has been the crux of the issue with 
respect to the provinces and their responses, both positive and 
negative, when one starts to look at the overall strategy as to 
what is to be accomplished in our youth justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative government has to take some fault 
in this as well because when the justice system was first set up 
to encompass the Young Offenders Act we never saw the 50% share 
of the funding that has to be shouldered by the federal 
government.  That has never occurred.  The Progressive 
Conservatives froze that funding.  The Liberals then went further 
to cut it to the point where, in some provinces, it is below 30%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The irony in all of this and the reason for giving some 
background is to recognize the fact that much of what is sought 
by this youth justice system, that is, earlier intervention, 
preventive measures, a proactive approach taken to justice, which 
are all wonderful buzzwords and laudable goals, cannot be 
accomplished unless we have the opportunity to put into the hands 
of the provinces the proper funding to administer it.  We know 
that the drastic cuts that have been handed out by this federal 
government have had an absolutely deteriorating effect on social 
services throughout the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The brunt of this legislation and the administration thereof 
will fall on the provinces once again.  The 50% funding that 
should be coming from this government to accomplish all of the 
goals, as laudable as they are, simply will not happen without 
that resource allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again we have seen the government speaking grandly, giving 
a grandiose plan as to what it would like to accomplish.  There 
has been a great deal of absolutely wonderful press conferences 
and announcements that have been made time and time again at the 
press gallery instead of here in the House of Commons. 
That was all done in the run-up, in the raised expectations of 
the new youth criminal justice act.  However, those goals, those 
accomplishments that the government has put forward, will not be 
achieved unless the provinces are given the money.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a lot of discussion in the Chamber as well about 
the approach that has been taken by the Quebec provincial 
government and there are statistics to back it up.  La belle 
province de Québec c'est la première province pour la justice 
when it comes to the treatment of youth.  The difficulty with 
this legislation is that once more we see a very cynical position 
put forward by the government.  Not only could it have borrowed 
from what Quebec has done, it has said “If you do not do it our 
way you can opt out and not receive the money”.  Not only is the 
money not sufficient, the provinces can decide not to do it the 
federal government's way and they will not get the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see an approach that time and time again has left Canadians 
feeling very cynical, feeling almost despondent about the way we 
accomplish these goals.  They are common goals.  We in the House 
should certainly be able to put partisanship aside when it comes 
to accomplishments in our youth justice system.  However, 
every time we get into these issues emotion and partisanship 
prevails and we get bogged down in debates, casting aspersions on 
who did what last.  The Tories did this.  The Liberals did that. 
It is the Reform Party.  It is the Bloc.  It is the NDP.  That is 
not going to accomplish these goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are issues in health, taxation and justice that we should 
be trying to work toward in a very positive fashion instead of 
continually dredging up the past.  We could go back to John A. 
Macdonald, if we want to do that.  We see it and we live it every 
day in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government is serious about accomplishing these things 
and if it is serious about aiding the provinces in the 
administration of this new youth justice act, it should not 
simply spout figures like the $206 million that is going to be 
handed to the provinces in the next three years, it should live 
up to the commitment that was originally intended and that was 
that the federal government would pick up 50% of the tab when it 
came to the administration of justice and the administration of 
this new youth criminal justice act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I, like other members of the House, look forward to 
participating at the committee level, proposing changes, working 
with my colleagues, both in opposition and on the government 
side, to achieve these laudable goals. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I would like to pick up where my friend from the 
Progressive Conservative Party left off.  He made some very valid 
points and I will focus on a few of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have to focus on is that every single young offender, 
every single youth who comes before our courts, the ones who 
commit the most serious offences, who are incarcerated, are going 
to be released into society.  I agree with him absolutely that we 
need funding for this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Young Offenders Act will be re-packaged.  There will be a 
new bow put on the package, with a few new dressings on the 
outside and it will now be called the youth criminal justice act, 
but we will basically have the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I held a one-day seminar at a high school in my riding and I 
invited the head youth provincial court judge, Judge Chaperon, to 
participate in the seminar.  She brought up a very disturbing 
fact that happens within our youth justice system, which boils 
down to what my friend was focusing on, and that is the lack of 
resources.  Her biggest frustration is not being able to give the 
youth in our justice system the help they need.  The resources 
from the federal government are not there, although, again, it 
mentions the $206 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She told me that over 50% of the people who are in the youth 
detention centre in Victoria have one form of psychological 
problem or another.  However, they do not have the resources to 
give them the counselling and the programs they need to turn them 
around and to make sure they do not come back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has the responsibility to make sure that it puts 
the resources out there so that the provinces will have the tools 
they need to provide the rehabilitation that is so necessary. 
Warehousing these youth, locking them up and not doing anything 
with them while they are in the warehouse, not ensuring that they 
are getting anger management, drug counselling and psychological 
counselling from experts before they are released into society, 
is a waste of time.  We have to focus on that. 
That is one area in which the government has really been slack.

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area, and my hon. friend also brought this up, is the 
involvement of parents in the youth justice system.  I do not 
think the government has really done anything there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under section 7.2 of the old Young Offenders Act if a youth was 
incarcerated and the judge was going to release them the judge 
had a tool whereby the parent could be forced to sign an 
undertaking that they would report any breaches of the 
conditions.  It could be a curfew, going to school or attending a 
certain program.  It could be anything.  If that young offender 
breached one of those conditions, it was absolutely imperative 
that the adult or whoever signed the undertaking report it to the 
authorities.  It is not forcing parents to make sure they have 
control over their children, but when they lose control they must 
report it to the authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a positive step.  The old penalty was up to six months 
and the new penalty is up to two years.  I agree with my hon. 
colleague from Surrey North.  As he put it, maybe that will be 
the incentive required to make parents fulfill their obligation, 
because in many respects they are not.  In the personal situation 
of my good friend from Surrey North that did not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we need to go one step further.  We need to make sure 
that we press charges, especially in the most violent cases where 
there is absolutely no excuse for them not to report it or where 
we can absolutely show that it was a blatant abuse of the system 
and they did not report it when they knew about.  I would submit 
that is not happening now.  That is something we should be doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague from West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast spoke 
about the importance of prevention.  I really want to emphasize 
that.  That is where we need to be going in our youth justice 
system.  We have to look at prevention at the front end.  We do 
not want our youth put into warehouses and locked up.  We want to 
make sure they are productive members of society.  There are 
programs, such as the head start program put forward by the hon. 
member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca in Motion No. 261, which would 
go a long way to achieving some of these goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day we are now getting this new youth justice 
bill and I do not think it is going to change a whole lot, as my 
colleagues have stated.  I do not think the government is putting 
the resources into it that are required.  I do not think it is 
compelling the parents enough to participate in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should be a section in the bill which makes it mandatory 
for parents or guardians of all young offenders, at all levels, 
to be present in the courtroom.  That is not happening now and it 
will not happen under the new youth justice bill.  For any young 
offender who is before the courts, it should be absolutely 
mandatory that a parent be there to participate in the process. 
We know that young offenders are going to be released into 
society.  If they are going to succeed, then they are going to 
need that parental support and we should be making it mandatory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I want to focus on the resources.  I have practised 
criminal law within the youth justice system and my own 
experiences show that if we are going to make the changes 
necessary, then we have to make sure that we provide the 
resources necessary so that when our youth go askew, when they 
fall under the cracks, there is accountability and that our 
number one goal is not to warehouse them but to put them back 
into society in a productive manner.  To do that the people in 
our justice system will need resources and tools.  Under this 
bill they will not have them.  The $206 million does not even 
come close to cutting it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  That is over three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  I have just been reminded that that will 
be over three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I will bring this back to Judge Chaperon from Victoria, 
who is a youth court judge.  That is her biggest frustration. 
The resources are not there so that when these kids go askew she 
can make sure they get the help they so desperately need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many cases they had disastrous family backgrounds which are 
absolutely beyond imagination. 
It is up to us as a society to make sure we can give them at 
least a fighting chance, get them into counselling programs or 
life skills programs or whatever they need.  If they need 
psychological help we could provide it, but that is not there.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from the Progressive Conservatives also talked 
about Quebec and the opt out provision.  I personally do not 
think that we should be giving a province an opt out provision. 
We need a national youth justice program.  The reason it is 
fighting for it is that what is on the table is not adequate.  It 
is not the answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day there is no question we have seen the same 
Young Offenders Act.  There will not be a lot of difference. 
There has been some tinkering, but there will not be much change 
in how we administer our youth justice system.  We have lost the 
confidence of the Canadian people.  We have lost the confidence 
of the public.  We have to restore that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has to be accountability and a twofold approach.  When we 
get them before the courts in the beginning we need a tough love 
approach.  Let us deal with them.  Our number one goal is to make 
sure that they never come back into the justice system again.  I 
am not talking about incarceration.  I am talking about tough 
programs and curfews that are mandatory so that they will not 
want to come back.  It will not be an easy ride.  It will also 
deal with the rehabilitative side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously there will be a second approach for the few that go 
askew and will commit these incredible and horribly violent 
offences.  There will be accountability and we will deal with 
them in a severe way so it will not carry on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day we have to restore the confidence of the 
Canadian people in our youth justice system.  Unfortunately the 
bill basically repackages the Young Offenders Act with a new 
outside but the same interior. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am going to make a comment that is not on 
the bill.  I have watching these debates for most of the day and 
I see that more and more members are speaking without notes.  I 
compliment the hon. member; I was here for his talk.  I think 
that is great.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, you will be 
pleased to know that I too do not have a prepared speech to read 
and put the House to sleep with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to begin with an important quote, which could guide our 
discussions today. It is from the report submitted by the Jasmin 
task force, established by the Government of Quebec to look into 
the application of the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This excerpt is important in the context of the current debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Jasmin report sates: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is often easier to change a law than to change practices of 
intervention. 
It may be tempting to think that tougher legislation is the 
answer to the problems of delinquency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simplistic responses blind us to the full extent of complex 
problems and create the false impression that we are doing what 
is necessary to resolve them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One such simplistic response is substituting get-tough measures 
for educational approaches. This, however, overlooks the fact 
that adolescents are still in the process of learning, and it 
means they are being saddled with full responsibility for 
delinquency, as if the society and environment they live in had 
nothing to do with it. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In today's debate, this should be a beacon guiding the minister 
as regards the bill before us. But that is not what the Liberal 
Party is doing. The minister should have travelled across the 
country to explain that, as far as young offenders are 
concerned, the best policy is the one advocated by Quebec, but 
she did not do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, the minister decided to reform herself. She decided to 
adopt the philosophy of western cowboys. Members will recall 
that the cowboy approach to young offenders was simple: shoot 
first and ask questions later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Listening to my colleagues from the Reform Party and the 
Progressive Conservative Party, I could not help but wonder if 
the hanging would be reintroduced. Why not have public hangings 
while we are at it? The Reformers and the Conservatives are 
going a little too far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I condemn the Liberal government for moving toward such radical 
solutions. It is not by changing the law to make it tougher and 
by imposing exemplary sentences that we will solve the problem 
with regard to young offenders.

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think Quebec's approach was better. Unfortunately, as usual, 
the minister and her cabinet colleagues simply ignored that 
approach. She will engage in a big centralizing exercise. We 
will have to wait and see how it will fit in with the various 
provincial justice systems. We already know there will be a 
problem in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister claims, among a lot of other things, that the 
existing legislation is not clear. 
However, statistics do not lie. The crime rate in Quebec is the 
lowest in Canada. Why has the minister not taken Quebec as 
model instead of embracing the philosophy of the Reform Party 
and western Canada and bringing forward such a harsh piece of 
legislation to deal with young offenders? She even found a way 
to criticize everything that is related to Quebec's justice 
system and police forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Quebec does not agree with the minister's 
bill. The Barreau du Québec does not agree. Most criminologists 
have expressed great concern about the minister's approach. 
Youth centres, which deal with young offenders and see to it 
that they are rehabilitated instead of punished and put into a 
system they will never get out of, have expressed their 
opposition to the minister's proposal. And so has Quebec's 
president of the bar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not take many examples from the law, but one that caught 
my eye is the one about publishing the names of the young 
offenders.  We consider this totally counterproductive. 
Juvenile delinquency breeds new recruits for gangs like the 
Hell's Angels and the Jokers.  When a juvenile delinquent is 
planning a career with the Hell's Angels, and his name appears 
in the papers, he need only report to the Hell's Angels and say 
“See what a naughty brat I am.  I am ready to take over in a 
motorcycle gang”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that publishing the name of these young people is 
counterproductive.  This is one of the measures I found in the 
bill.  There are a lot more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have before us today is again two systems and two 
values.  The Quebec system believes in rehabilitation. 
Under the Quebec system, all the energies of the justice system 
and the police forces must go toward rehabilitating young 
offenders who have not reached the age of majority.  The 
solution is not to send them to a harsh prison setting where 
there is absolutely no chance of rehabilitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec considers it important to give young people who have 
committed an offence, whatever the offence, the opportunity to 
rehabilitate themselves.  Unfortunately, I think that the 
minister opposes this.  As usual, she holds the philosophy of 
centralization under which all of Canada's justice systems, 
Quebec's or that of other provinces, must align with the federal 
system.  That is totally deplorable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are not just the visions of Quebec and Canada that differ. 
There are also two visions in the area I hold dear, Indian 
affairs. 
In most provinces, except in Quebec maybe, the rate of 
incarceration of young natives is very high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people understood how to deal with the issue in Quebec. A 
travelling judge used to go to northern Quebec and attend what 
they call sentencing circles. When a young native had a crime 
problem, people gathered in a room and asked the community “What 
can we do, by using a healing circle, to reintegrate this 
teenager?” Some extraordinary things are being done in Quebec 
but unfortunately not elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This judge was Jean-Charles Coutu. 
He travelled to the far north on a regular basis to solve 
problems. Contrary to many judges and indeed to the minister's 
philosophy, this judge sat down and, after having heard the 
evidence and before sentencing, he would listen to what the 
community had to suggest in order to rehabilitate the young 
offender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On numerous occasions, the judge agreed with the healing circle 
and said “I will sentenced this young person according to what 
you told me and we will see how successful rehabilitation will 
be”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The rate of success was very high. Besides avoiding 
overpopulating jails, they succeeded in rehabilitating those 
young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why it is regrettable that the minister is leading us 
down a different path and taking a hardline approach. 
Unfortunately, the Bloc Quebecois will have to vote against this 
bill, for the main reasons I have just given. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> Once more, dear colleague, I wish to congratulate 
you. Except for the short quotation, you spoke without any 
notes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Battlefords—Lloydminster. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to finally get a chance to speak to the 
government's attempt to revise and update the Young Offenders 
Act.  Contrary to popular belief, this is something for which 
Canadians from coast to coast to coast have been calling for 
years, not just cowboys from western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it ironic that my party gets abused for this.  We are 
portrayed as insensitive and tough minded when it comes to 
criminals, yet the first thing the Liberals do when they trot out 
their latest effort is to brag about how tough minded it is.  I 
guess we could say that it is pretty insensitive too, but in this 
case it is insensitive to the wishes of a majority of Canadians 
and certainly my constituents who are looking for a little more 
meat on the bones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The youth criminal justice act like other legislation that has 
percolated up through months or years of consultation and study 
contains a germ of good intentions.  Section 6 formalizes the 
role of police to correct the actions of young offenders who have 
committed minor infractions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last few years our justice system has been bogged down 
with the rights of the criminal to the point that police find 
themselves on the defensive after carrying out their duties. What 
was acceptable on one occasion is found unacceptable by a later 
court.  This process has made the officer's ability to deal with 
people frustrating and time consuming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a town hall meeting one year ago my constituents told me that 
for first time and minor offences rehabilitation is the top 
priority.  Local authorities must have the option of running 
programs that suit local conditions and that bring young 
offenders face to face with their victims and the impact of their 
thoughtless actions.  It is kind of based on the sentencing 
circle model we see being used in the aboriginal communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was told that young people must have respect for the justice 
system.  I believe that is something which cannot be started 
young enough.  The problem with Bill C-68 is that it leaves this 
concept up to a variety of jurisdictions, a lot of them 
overlapping, and it includes no money to encourage a system of 
diversionary programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all in favour of civil rights and no one wants to see 
anyone victimized by overzealous authorities.  Unfortunately what 
we too often see these days is the concept of human rights being 
twisted and reinterpreted to what is more acceptable to special 
interest groups and their particular needs rather than the 
acceptance of everyone as being equal under the law.  This 
undermines the job of the police which is to keep the general 
peace and apply the law equally to anyone who breaks it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young criminals see that concept operating and lose respect for 
the law while they take advantage of the loopholes.  I realize 
these are qualifications.  There is such a thing as diminished 
capacity that suggests younger people cannot frame the moral 
implications of what they are doing with the same sophistication 
as a mature adult, but this does not mean there should be no 
consequences, only different ones.  I would hope the young people 
of the country still have enough respect for the police to listen 
and alter their behaviour when a man or a woman in blue comes 
calling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In rural areas, allowing police to use discretion and deal 
openly with the young offender and his parents may save a lot of 
time and trouble.  The problem then becomes whether we can be 
assured there will be enough officers to go around.  With the 
financial abuse suffered by the RCMP at the hands of the 
government it is not a hopeful picture.  Bill C-68 does not 
promise any relief for hard pressed police forces in this 
respect, or community programs for that matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ironic that the justice minister would choose to number 
this bill with the same designation as the previous gun control 
bill.  We see over $200 million being wasted there when it could 
certainly help prevent crime by being invested in our youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate my colleague from Crowfoot for his excellent work 
in bringing forward the perspective of frontline police officers. 
His name is not on the bill but his ideas are certainly stamped 
there.  Maybe in his lifetime we will see real change in the 
country, in the words of the minister, “in a timely fashion”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice in section 8 the crown prosecutors may likewise be 
authorized to issue cautions rather than proceed with court 
action.  This can be different from province to province 
according to the whims of each attorney general and can undermine 
the work of the police.  I realize that criminal cases cannot go 
forward on the exclusive say-so of the police, but we do see 
instances where overworked crown attorneys trade off low profile 
cases for higher ones to the frustration of the frontline 
officers. 
I also note there is a great deal in the bill about diversion or, 
as the government terms it, extra judicial measures.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to government spin, I do not believe that any of the 
Reformers or the two million Canadians who voted for us are 
interested in filling our jails with young people.  That is not 
the answer.  We had the unfortunate spectacle of the justice 
minister claiming we want to jail 10 year olds and I am sure even 
she regrets playing these political games in order to score 
points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The entire justice committee heard and put forward in the report 
the need for action expressed by Canadians.  My constituents said 
that 16 and 17 year old repeat violent offenders should be 
treated as near adults rather than near children.  I will repeat 
that.  We are talking about repeat violent offenders being 
treated as near adults rather than near children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young children are being targeted for participation in criminal 
activities by older youth offenders and career criminal adults 
who believe they are untouchable and maybe will remain so under 
this redecorated bill.  Unless 10 year olds are taken under wing 
by the justice system, especially a stronger system than we see 
today, they will be headed for future problems that all of 
society ends up paying for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Surrey North has logged countless hours with 
diversion programs that work.  Every clear-thinking Canadian 
would like to see young people corrected before their 
misbehaviour leads to serious jail time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal version of extra judicial measures has enough holes 
in it to drive a stolen car through.  The definition of offenders 
who will be eligible for diversionary programs can include those 
very car thieves, drug traffickers and break and enter criminals 
as long as they do not “cause or create a substantial risk of 
causing bodily harm”.  That is a loose term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like so many other statutes in law, this is open to 
interpretation.  I can imagine courts taking up time defining 
what has happened before ever getting around to deciding what to 
do about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if teenagers out on a joy ride in a stolen car 
represent a substantial risk of causing bodily harm or an 
insubstantial one.  I guess it depends on whether they run over 
anyone or not.  Does whacking another fellow on the head with a 
lead pipe constitute more of a risk causing bodily harm than 
whacking him on the knee?  I guess it all comes down to 
interpretation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In section 9 we see that evidence of an offender having received 
extra judicial measures or special status on previous occasions 
is not admissible for proving prior offending behaviour. Like the 
closed file that we have now, the record of trouble with the law 
cannot be entered as evidence that the person is a repeat 
offender.  The youth is safe again.  This means that young 
offenders and drug traffickers could be diverted from serving 
jail time over and over again.  They will not be called repeat 
offenders, never having been designated as repeat offenders, 
because each case will be or may be treated as a one time event. 
We can hope that this will not happen in practice but the opening 
is definitely there to be tested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The definitions are all open to interpretation and challenge. 
As I said, our clogged court system will spend more time chasing 
its own tail and it will vary from province to province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents at the town hall meeting said that the central 
concept of the youth justice system must be that actions have 
consequences and that legal actions will bring swift and 
appropriate punishment.  Instead, Bill C-68 brings more arguments 
between judges and lawyers.  I guess that is a perverse Liberal 
job creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in the area of definitions and interpretations that gets 
us most in trouble.  The justice minister has said that there are 
competing visions for competing cultures in law.  She seemed to 
suggest there is a simplistic vision which wants to jail all 
transgressors and a more compassionate vision which wants to be 
flexible and helpful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As every parent knows, there is room for both of these 
approaches when bringing up our young people.  Parents know that 
sometimes we have to be firm and say no.  When the line is drawn, 
the consequences for crossing it must be immediate and relevant, 
scaled up or down to fit the nature of the situation. My 
constituents were clear on this very distinction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ironic that a government that keeps claiming a role in 
raising the next generation refuses to make the tough choices 
that parents must do every day.  We do not see clear lines drawn 
in the bill so much as circles.  We read about what may be done 
or what should be happening in a variety of cases and in 
different jurisdictions.  This could be interpreted as 
flexibility, but in light of the present state of underfunded, 
overworked and handcuffed police forces in the country, I think 
we can see it as an abdication of a government bent on being 
politically correct and offending as few groups as possible while 
turning the whole mess over to the courts.  That is simplistic; 
just pass the buck but not the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The old adage, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, 
certainly defines the direction we must entertain regarding our 
youth justice.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to speak to this bill and to 
remind the House that we are debating the amendment introduced 
by the hon. member for Laval Centre. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1805"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT85"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT85"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1805

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That amendment reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-68, an Act in respect of criminal justice for young 
persons and to amend and repeal other Acts, be not now read a 
second time but that the Order be discharged, the Bill withdrawn 
and the subject-matter thereof referred to the Standing Committee 
on Justice and Human Rights. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has the Bloc Quebecois introduced this amendment?  Because, 
basically, this bill is unacceptable. 
It does not seek to improve the treatment given young offenders, 
ensuring that they may be rehabilitated or reintegrated into 
society.  It has nothing to do with improving a system that 
might not be working properly at the present time and might need 
some improvement.  What it does have to do with is vote seeking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In western Canada, the mindset is more punitive.  They would 
like to see far more severe measures.  It would seem that the 
present government has decided to bow to the pressures from that 
part of the country and to bring in changes to a system that is 
already working very well.  At least, it is working very well in 
Quebec.  We have a quite attractive record for our effectiveness 
at rehabilitating young people and reintegrating them back into 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebeckers are not necessarily more peace minded than others but 
we in Quebec have developed good tools to give young people a 
second chance when their behaviour gets them in trouble with the 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have put a lot of energy into this, spent money, put 
structures in place and trained judges and lawyers. We have also 
trained many stakeholders so that first offenders are more 
generally dealt with at the community level, made to realize the 
seriousness of their actions, and put in a context where they 
are able to change their behaviour and not go back to their old 
ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are provisions of the existing legislation that run 
contrary to this approach, and we find that totally 
unacceptable. First there is the publication of names. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides for the publication of the names of young 
persons having committed an indictable offence. This will be 
counterproductive. Young people who commit crimes as part of a 
gang are often looking for a way to gain recognition; to release 
information would only reinforce the negative aspects of their 
actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe this kind of attitude is more in keeping with the 
promotion of a punitive approach. This is not a good model. It 
has not yielded good results so far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec we have developed our own approach. 
Statistics show that we are successful in rehabilitating young 
offenders. Most of them manage to find their place in society 
and live a normal life. This should be the purpose of such an 
act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This purpose is not to make sure that we impose the harshest 
possible penalty on someone who committed a reprehensible act, 
but to make sure that the offender understands what he has done 
and that conditions are created whereby he will not reoffend but 
rather lead the life of a regular citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that sense, the existing legislation is effective. It fulfils 
its objectives. However, there is a prerequisite, which is the 
will to succeed. We must therefore invest the necessary energy 
and resources. 
If we take a totally different approach and say that it is not 
worth the effort, that it is pointless to invest in resources to 
rehabilitate young offenders, that we can always rely on the 
punitive approach, the model developed in Quebec cannot be 
successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We currently find ourselves in a very difficult situation in 
Canada. The government wants to change an act that works well. 
It is fundamentally effective. It allows us to achieve good 
results, but now they want to change it. We will find ourselves 
in a situation where, in spite of the minister's claims, the 
punitive approach, the negative approach will be prevalent all 
across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When judges will have to make a ruling in certain circumstances, 
the precedents will be such that, in the end, over the years, 
the new act will have an impact that could undermine the 
approach developed by Quebec.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important point is that incarceration is not a solution, 
and there is evidence of that everywhere in our society. 
Incarceration of a young person has often turned prison into a 
school of crime. A young person may have committed an offence 
once, and there are two choices for him or her. The first choice 
is to send that person to prison, where he or she can learn a 
lot of things for the rest of his or her life, for example how 
to engage in illegal activities or how to become part of the 
underworld. The second choice, which avoids incarceration, 
forces that young person to face the reality of our society, 
teaches him or her how to become self-confident and how to use 
the legal means that exist, and ultimately makes a responsible 
citizen out of him or her. I think it is an interesting example 
from that point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would invite the minister to take another look at the results 
achieved in Quebec. The essence of the amendment brought forward 
by the Bloc Quebecois is to say that it is simply impossible 
today, with what we have, to make the changes the federal 
government wants us to make because we would be destroying a 
system that is working well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are enough things that need to be improved in our society 
without making changes in this area. Maybe people will say, 10, 
15 or 20 years from now, that Quebec had the right approach. If 
we are very strict and if we put a lot of people in prison, we 
will have results that will look more like the American model, 
and I do not think that is what we want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If some things need improving in the present legislation—no 
legislation is perfect—they can perhaps be improved, but not the 
way the bill has been drafted.  As my colleague says, we must 
not throw the baby out with the bath water.  What is needed are 
amendments that would let those provinces interested in adopting 
a model similar to Quebec's do so, with appropriate funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill should have included provisions allowing those 
governments who wish to do so to take a constructive approach 
and invest in approaches like youth courts, youth homes, all 
sorts of closed custody facilities, whatever is available.  We 
encourage them to explore these avenues.  Provinces who try this 
approach will see that it works.  In Quebec, there are fewer 
long term jail sentences and crime has been down for several 
years now. 
This must be allowed to continue and the American model, with 
its increase in crime, avoided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one final point.  In the case of 14 and 15-year olds, the 
bill also contains a provision allowing a judge to base his 
decision directly on the Criminal Code, as though it were a case 
involving an adult, rather than referring the case to an adult 
court.  There is a world of difference because, as things now 
stand, when a judge wishes to have a young person sentenced on 
an adult basis, he simply refers him to the other court.  At 
that point, a defence can be prepared accordingly, and judges 
and stakeholders, who are accustomed to working with a more 
community based model, the model developed by Quebec, take an 
approach different from the one taken when a youth is referred 
to another court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill wanted to have these two models implemented in the same 
way by the same court, which would not, in my opinion, be a 
worthwhile solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, then, we are faced here with a bill that needs 
reworking as far as its very principles are concerned.  I invite 
the government and the entire Liberal deputation to influence 
the minister and the cabinet so that it will not seek to win 
votes at the expense of young offenders aged 13, 14 or 15, who 
have lots of other things to worry about besides a punitive 
approach that will follow them all their lives.

Speaker, there is an old expression, the elephant laboured and 
brought forth a mouse, except I think in this specific instance 
perhaps one could say more accurately the mouse laboured and 
brought forth a gnat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has the government actually accomplished after two long 
years of labour?  There is a new name.  The YOA is now the YCJA. 
That sounds like a song.  From the government's point of view 
that is probably a good thing because the YOA was a lightning rod 
which attracted the anger of the Canadian people against the 
justice system of this country.  Everything that was, is and 
probably will eternally be wrong, was indeed directed against 
that one specific act.  So it had to be changed.  There had to be 
a little sleight of hand, a little cosmetic surgery and it came 
up with a brand new bill which is supposed to have us all very 
excited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some actual changes in the bill if one goes through 
the reams and reams of paper.  There appear to be some changes. 
The age of responsibility with respect to sentencing for certain 
violent crimes has ostensibly been lowered to 14 years of age. 
Superficially this addresses a major public concern.  There has 
been a lot of outcry about that over the last few years, but what 
has actually been done is merely to create a treasure trove for 
lawyers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to get the 14, 15, 16 and 17 year olds into the adult 
justice system for sentencing, there has to be a court battle, a 
trial within a trial because any young person so charged can, 
through his or her lawyer, apply to the court to have his or her 
sentencing done in youth court.  Naturally nobody will pass up 
the opportunity, so there will be eternal legal battles as to who 
will be sentenced as an adult and who will be sentenced as a 
youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an act written by lawyers for lawyers.  Of course we all 
know that lawyers do look after their own.  The justice minister 
recently found $83,000 in her stocking to reward a lawyer who 
also just happens to be a Liberal hack for three months of work. 
What a great example to set for the kids. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a letter from a constituent who said he wished we could 
pass a law making it illegal for lawyers to sit in parliament.  I 
do not know how far that would go but perhaps it is worthy of 
some consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-68 fails to address the major public complaint against 
the Young Offenders Act.  That is the lack of accountability for 
repeat or serious offenders who happen to be less than 12 years 
old.  The minister babbles interminably and incoherently that 
inclusion of 10 and 11 year olds within the youth justice system 
process would be “barbaric”.  However she refuses to accept the 
reality that these children desperately need help, help that they 
are clearly not getting from the provincial child welfare and 
mental health systems on which they are dumped by the justice 
system because there are no alternatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hundreds of kids are reoffending and laughing at the 
powerlessness of their social workers while feeling deeply hurt 
by the disinterest of their parents.  By the time they reach 
their teens, they are hardened little criminals.  We have to do 
something for these youngsters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most proponents of the idea that there should not be any 
legislation governing 11 and 12 year olds have the curious idea 
that young children cannot make reasoned decisions, that they are 
incapable of being judgmental.  Those people certainly have not 
raised any kids.  They have never been confronted with the guile 
of even the most benign and sensitive 11 year old.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On the good side, this bill will permit publication of names of 
young offenders more than 14 years old who qualify for adult 
sentences or who received a youth sentence for a particularly 
heinous crime.  But again there is no certainty, again there is 
room for dispute, so let us call that initiative half good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alternative sentencing for first time non-violent offenders is, 
in my opinion, only common sense, as long as it is indeed limited 
to such offenders and not extended to young thugs who cause 
bodily harm.  Similarly it should not be extended to old thugs 
who cause bodily harm and it sometimes is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Diversion programs are also a very good idea, very laudable, but 
as my colleague from Battlefords—Lloydminster pointed out, the 
provision as written is wide open for abuse.  There has to be 
some certainty in the law.  This is all so wishy-washy, so poorly 
tied together.  Again it is written by lawyers for lawyers.  They 
can probably figure it out.  They can find all the loopholes. 
They know where to jump to get over the barriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However it does not improve the justice system in this country 
by one iota.  All it does is put a new coat of paint on the old 
YOA, and I think this is not an exaggeration, which almost 
everybody wanted to get rid of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government had the chance.  It could have given us good law,

string of insulting comments the Bloc Quebecois has been making

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise before the House today to debate the government's new 
youth justice strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For months, even years, Canadians from across the country have 
been calling on government to get tougher with youth crime. The 
recent highly publicized events that took place in Colorado and 
Alberta and the murder of young Reena Virk in B.C. have pushed 
this issue one step further.  They are vicious acts which really 
need to be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe all provinces were united in their belief that 
immediate steps had to be taken to protect society against 
individual youths who for whatever reason have chosen to follow 
the path of hate and destruction.  Calls from throughout Canada 
could be heard in support of amending the Young Offenders Act to 
more aptly respond to the more serious acts of violence that all 
too often are threatening our friends and family. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that our justice system needs a major overhaul 
as it concerns young offenders.  Canadians have become tired of 
hearing that young criminals do not pay enough for the error 
they commit against our society. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that the time has long since passed whereby 
those youth who commit violent crimes finally pay their debt to 
society. It is with this realization that the provincial justice 
ministers met with the federal justice minister to discuss 
appropriate ways of implementing changes to the Young Offenders 
Act, changes that would reflect society's revulsion toward the 
leniency the present system has been according to our young 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was only natural that Canadians awaited the change to the 
Young Offenders Act with great anticipation.  Finally they 
thought that this government was committed to cracking down on 
young offenders. 
Finally they thought that the government was going to take youth 
crime seriously.

government was only interested in providing cosmetic changes that 
fell far short of what the provinces wanted and what the Canadian 
electorate expected in terms of protection against youth crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of our key recommendations put forth to the minister was the 
lowering of the age of application for the Young Offenders Act 
from the age of 12 to 10 years. It was a private member's bill 
before the House.  Although this request received wide ranging 
support across the country, the minister chose to ignore this 
recommendation.  This was in spite of the fact that offenders 
have progressively become younger.  This begs the question why 
the federal minister would ignore the advice of not only her 
provincial counterparts but also of her experts who recommended 
that this particular change be accepted.

</I></B></P><P align=left>How can that be possible, when the federal government first 
refused to honour the agreements in the first bill on young 
offenders? And now, in this new bill, it is not even offering 
50% of the money needed to provide these programs to our young 
offenders. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government did not live up to the funding agreements 
contained in the previous Young Offenders Act.  This act does 
nothing to restore the federal share of funding for youth 
justice.  The lack of financial resources contained within the 
new youth criminal justice act can only result in more youth 
falling through the cracks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This piece of legislation specifically ignores provincial 
demands for mandatory minimum sentences for weapons offences.  I 
think it is quite reasonable to expect that Canada's legal system 
operate in uniformity when it comes to passing judgments against 
our young offenders.  The Liberal government could well have 
provided some direction to our provincial justice ministers. 
Instead it chose to once again ignore their requests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The size and complexity of the clauses and subclauses contained 
within this bill will invariably lead to confusion and further 
backlog in our courts.  Our judicial system is already struggling 
with huge caseloads and serious lack of resources.  This act will 
serve only to further complicate crown prosecutors and judges 
about their respective roles in the youth justice system and will 
not adequately serve Canadian interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been many reasons associated with committing crime 
among Canada's youth.  It has often been suggested by some that 
one of the reasons behind youth crime is that they find 
themselves living in extreme poverty.  Although I do not believe 
that poverty in itself is a cause for youth crime, it certainly 
can be a mitigating factor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the Young Offenders Act, the government has also failed to 
address poverty.  Millions of Canadians continue to struggle to 
survive while living in poverty.  Over 1.5 million Canadian 
children live in poverty.  Our party has been working with 
poverty for the last while.  The government showed Canadians its 
true commitment to Canada's poor when it voted against Bill S-11, 
a bill that would help improve their lives by adding social 
condition as a prohibited ground for discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government had an opportunity to make a profound and lasting 
impact on Canada's justice system that would serve all Canadians 
for years to come. Instead the government chose to employ smoke 
and mirrors in hopes of giving the appearance of strengthening 
legislation when in fact its changes fall far short of what the 
provinces expected and what Canadians demanded.

bill.  It will not have the desired effect of helping our 
judicial system combat youth crime in Canada.  Therefore, I must 
oppose this proposed legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton—Kent—Middlesex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to take part tonight in the adjournment 
proceedings to discuss the upcoming negotiations on agriculture 
within the World Trade Organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I stated in the House on April 19, it is important that the 
government be familiar with the views of all parts of the 
agriculture sector that may be positively or adversely affected 
by the trade talks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, agricultural trade is more often than not a small 
family business competing against the world's largest 
corporations.  In many ways it is like David versus Goliath, 
which makes it vitally important that we have a strong, 
consistent federal government looking out for the interests of 
agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need rules that let the small guy trade with the big.  We are 
all for world trade, but only if the rules are applied equally. 
Let us look at the recent example of Canadian beef not being 
allowed access to the European Union.  I support our government's 
efforts to get tough by using the rules already in place to take 
action against the EU. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Trade rules applied equally and fairly are sentiments shared by 
many groups, including the Canadian Federation of Agriculture, 
but also the Ontario wheat producers, Ontario pork producers and 
Ontario dairy farmers to name but a few from my province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Horticulture too is import sensitive but export dependent. This 
sector is but one example of the great stake they hold in the 
talks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These negotiations, scheduled for November 30 to December 3 in 
Seattle, are crucial to Canadian egg, dairy and poultry farmers. 
They want the WTO to focus on eliminating subsidies, suggesting 
that the United States and the European Union still continue to 
subsidize their farmers while Canada has lived up to its previous 
commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is great to be free traders in Canada, but the world also 
must be fair traders.

<A HREF="#LINKT94"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tariff rate quotas must also be set realistically and not 
artificially inflated according to the amount the importing 
countries can actually accept or afford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have known for two years in advance that agriculture will be 
on the bargaining table at the next WTO talks.  For those years 
meetings have been held by Agriculture Canada officials with a 
cross section of producers groups.  Meanwhile, our supply 
management system has proven year in and year out its 
effectiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new issues that should emerge in Seattle this fall will deal 
with biotech products and single desk buying and selling.  Canada 
currently cannot send genetically altered canola to Europe any 
longer because of their fear of genetics, based on Britain's mad 
cow disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will know that there are no black and whites in trade, 
just varying shades of grey.  Thus it is important that Canada 
stick to a position based on the views of all our agriculture 
sectors and not trade one off against the other.  It is a tough 
row to hoe because of the very complicated issues that will 
discussed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remain hopeful that the World Trade Organization negotiations 
this fall will work toward implementing effective rules that will 
be fairly enforced enabling our agricultural producers to compete 
head on with a level playing field.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to thank the member for Lambton—Kent—Middlesex for her 
question.  She is a strong member of the Standing Committee on 
Agriculture and Agri-Food.  She has shown a great and abiding 
interest in Canada's upcoming negotiations with our WTO partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are crucial talks and the government has a firm commitment 
to consult closely with the agriculture and food sector and with 
provincial governments before its establishes an initial 
negotiating position for the upcoming World Trade Organization 
negotiations on agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently in Ottawa, people from all parts of the agriculture and 
food sector and from all regions of the country came together to 
provide their advice about the elements of an initial Canadian 
position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conference heard that Canada should seek to eliminate export 
subsidies in the upcoming negotiations.  Participants also 
indicated that Canada should push to improve market access, 
particularly with respect to minimum access commitments. 
Industry participants called for clearer rules and stronger 
disciplines on trade distorting domestic subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the industry indicated that Canada should continue to 
insist that health and safety standards should be based on 
science not emotion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the main highlights of the discussion.  The 
government has listened carefully to all the views expressed at 
the conference and they will be considered as we work to develop 
a negotiating position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food and his provincial 
counterparts will discuss the outcome of the consultations at 
their meeting in Prince Albert this coming July.  The government 
will then take a decision on an initial agricultural negotiating 
position that will truly reflect the needs and interests of 
Canadian agriculture in the food sector.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my four minute speech will not be a 
love in like the one we just heard.  The House is now going to 
hear some real opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general recently came out with his report.  Chapter 
4 discusses the incredible deficiencies within the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans.  Recently I asked a question of the 
minister and got an answer back from the parliamentary secretary 
regarding shrimp discarding or high-grading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About a year ago in committee, the member for Labrador asked if 
there was massive high-grading of shrimp and discarding of small 
pieces of broken shrimp going on within our 200 mile limit off 
the coast of Labrador.  A letter from industry addressed to the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and copied for all members of 
the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans stated that 
high-grading was extremely rare and does not happen as massively 
or as proportionately as the member for Labrador had indicated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a recent meeting we had with the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans I asked if high-grading or discarding of shrimp happened 
within our 200 mile limit off the coast of Labrador?  The answer 
was a very solid yes.  The next question was how much of this was 
happening?  The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans indicated that 
he did not know the answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It only leads us to believe that the member from Labrador, who 
is in the government's own party, was correct when he said there 
were very large amounts of high-grading and discarding of shrimp 
going on within the 200 mile limit.  That begs the question: How 
can this happen? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has announced in its recent estimates for the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans a further cut of 17%, 
totalling $54 million, to science and research over the next 
three years.  This is at a time when the world is clamouring for 
more scientific information.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just heard the parliamentary secretary to the minister of 
agriculture say that what we need is good science.  The auditor 
general has indicated, and I hope he is listening, that 5,000 
scientists have been cut from the federal service.  These are up 
and coming scientists, scientists with basic knowledge and long 
term knowledge of the various industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government talks about needing better science.  We cannot 
have better science if it keeps laying them all off. There are 
two things we can do to scientists to ruin their careers:  take 
away their funding and discredit their reports. That is what 
happens here all the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recently had a concern about seals.  There were two prominent 
scientists from Newfoundland, who indicated we have to have a 
seal cull and the other indicated we cannot have a seal cull. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Department of Fisheries and Oceans is not the final 
source of good, solid, sound information, then where do the 
fishermen and their communities get this information from? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking the parliamentary secretary to answer the following 
questions. How can the government justify a $54 million cut to 
science? What is the government doing about the high-grading of 
shrimp, that is the discarding of shrimp off our coastal waters? 
Will the government put science back into the information so that 
fishermen, plant workers, communities and the provinces can have 
sound, long term management plans for the fisheries off our east 
coast? 
<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we would not expect 
a love-in from the hon. member opposite but we certainly would 
like him to get his facts straight.  He is considerably wrong on 
some of his facts this evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will deal first with the high-grading of northern shrimp. 
There is no question the department is concerned about this 
practice which is illegal and wastes shrimp.  As a result the 
minister announced increased observer coverage and comparisons of 
observed and unobserved catches in the inshore fishery.  That is 
a practice that has been going on.  There is greater evidence 
that kind of observer system works.  It was talked about at 
committee the other day, I believe, by the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will provide better data on what is happening on the water 
and will allow the detection of violations.  The auditor general, 
and I hope he is listening as well, commented positively on these 
measures as steps being taken by the department to better monitor 
the fishery and to better use observer data.  That is a step 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The overriding concern of the minister is to conserve living 
marine resources and to ensure they are used in a sustainable 
manner.  In all fisheries, decisions on quota levels are based on 
the best scientific information available.  It is not just 
numbers of scientists.  It is how that information is collected, 
how it is tabulated and how decisions are made.  If this 
information is uncertain, we err on the side of caution, meaning 
that quotas might be set lower and additional conservation 
measures might be introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Keep in mind that these are temporary allocations that are 
recommended and can be withdrawn when the science dictates 
otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The motion to adjourn the House is now 
deemed to have been adopted.  Accordingly this House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 
24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 7.28 p.m.)
