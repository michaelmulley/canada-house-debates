<B>(1020 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to speak on 
Bill C-17. The first thing I have to say is that Bill C-17 is an 
omnibus bill. It covers many areas, some of which we support 
and some to which we take exception.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4433"> 4433 </A></B>
<P>
	We have asked the government to break the bill into its 
constituent parts, which it refused to do. We were therefore left 
with little or no choice but to put these motions in order that 
we may stress the point that we agree with some parts of the 
bill and disagree with other parts. While we will be forced to 
vote against the bill in its entirety, we wish to go on the record 
as saying that we do support certain parts of the bill and hence 
our motions this morning.
<P>
	Basically we are in favour of the sections pertaining to the 
freezing of wages of the public sector. As everyone knows we 
are in a serious debt and deficit crisis. Anything that can be done 
to help alleviate that problem has to be in the best interests of the 
country.
<P>
	However as the Reform Party has pointed out on many 
occasions, much more could be done by the government rather 
than turning on its own civil service and squeezing some extra 
money out of its pockets to help the government come to terms 
with its debt and deficit situation. If we had not only frozen the 
salaries of the public sector but eliminated every civil servant in 
the country and saved every nickel that we were paying in wages 
to these people, we would still not save even half the annual 
deficit.
<P>
	Therefore if the government thinks it is going to balance the 
budget on the backs of the civil servants, it has it entirely wrong. 
However the basic concept that we are going to save some 
additional money because every nickel helps in this exercise has 
to be supported.
<P>
	There are some items that I want to point out. One is the 
extension not only of the salary freeze for an additional two 
years but the introduction of a two-year suspension of pay 
increments within the salary grades.
<P>
	I have had numerous representations made to me as a member 
of Parliament for the constituency of St. Albert where the Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police perform the police services. In the 
RCMP, when a new Mountie graduates from training school, his 
pay increases semi-annually over the next three years until he 
reaches the normal salary for a police constable.
<P>
	With this change the increments of a new RCMP constable are 
now frozen. Now we have an inequity between the amount of 
money that is paid to new RCMP constables on the beat and the 
ones who are there already. It is not that they do not want to do 
their part, but members of the RCMP are subject to transfer from 
one part of the country to another more frequently than any other 
member of the civil service. As they move from rural Alberta or 
Saskatchewan to perhaps downtown Vancouver the cost of 
living is going to change dramatically.
<P>
	They are being asked to maintain their salaries at exactly the 
same level as they entered the police force rather than have the 
semi-annual increments to bring them up to the level of any 
other constable in the force.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	We see the rise in crime. We have talked about it in the House 
on many occasions. Perhaps we should give some consideration 
to recognizing the value that our police force provides to us in 
the maintenance of law and order. How can we expect them to 
get by on less than a shoestring? We are not adequately 
compensating these people as they in many cases put their lives 
on the line for our protection. We are asking them to do that with 
less than reasonable salary for the new members of the force.
<P>
	We support the wage freeze in the public service. We want to 
do whatever we can as the Reform Party to ensure that every 
effort is made to come to terms with this horrible deficit that we 
have. It may be a small step but it is a step that we support with 
some reservations in some areas.
<P>
	As I said at the outset, while we will be voting against the bill 
in its entirety when it comes up for a vote we wish to go on 
record as having supported the basic thrust of the clause 
regarding public service wages in Bill C-17.
<P>
	The other sections that deal with compensation in other areas 
outside the ones I have mentioned we are basically in support of, 
especially the one that would freeze the salaries of MPs. We 
have always wanted to send a clear signal to Canadians saying: 
``Let us provide leadership''.
<P>
	During the last election that was one of the things that we as 
Reformers said, that providing leadership to Canadians, 
demonstrating that we as government and parliamentarians, as 
those elected to show the way and lead the way in the country, 
are prepared to do our part to ensure efficient government is 
provided at a reasonable cost to Canadians at this time when 
restraint has to be the watchword.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise and speak on the amendments of 
the Reform Party and the Bloc Quebecois grouped for debate, all 
the more so because this bill is very important to me.
<P>
	Why do I consider it important? Because it is the perfect 
expression of the total lack of openness that has characterized 
this government ever since it came into office.
<P>
	What do we find in this part? To start with, I would like to tell 
you that I am pleasantly surprised by the position taken by the 
Reform Party regarding this part of Bill C-17 because, since the 
beginning of the debate and even the study in 
subcommittee-the one which considered all the provisions of 
Bill C-17-the Reform Party has not demonstrated much 
interest in what the government has been doing to its employees. 
The Reform Party did not say a word on the fundamental right to 
open collective bargaining, a thing that the Bloc Quebecois has 
defended from the start.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4434"> 4434 </A></B>
<P>
	As I said, we are pleasantly surprised because, by introducing 
these amendments to delete all the clauses dealing with the 
wage freeze in the federal public service, the Reform Party 
shows it is now more kindly disposed towards fundamental 
rights like collective bargaining. Consequently, based on the 
reasoning and the actions of the Reform Party this morning, we 
can assume that it is also more kindly disposed towards 
collective bargaining itself and towards workers rights, and that 
it would be willing to come back to the former system whereby 
the government and its employees would talk constructively 
and come to some synergic agreement on working conditions.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	This means they agree with the new models introduced just 
about everywhere around the world which call for co-operation 
between public service employees and the government with a 
view to finding constructive solutions to controlling public 
finance problems and to recording yearly deficits smaller than 
those recorded year after year by the Canadian government.
<P>
	I am surprised by this. With our motion, which would require 
the government to come back to the House on the expiration of 
the compensation provisions in the legislation to debate either 
an extension or changes to the provisions, we were simply trying 
to be realistic. We did not want to introduce one or more motions 
calling for the elimination of all of these provisions since the 
government, given its majority position, would surely vote 
against any such motion.
<P>
	Indeed, while the Reform Party's motion goes further than our 
deep-seated convictions, our motion is more realistic because it 
calls for a democratic debate upon the expiration of the 
provisions in Bill C-17 respecting public service compensation. 
We are also asking for transparency, something which this 
government has not demonstrated since the start of this debate.
<P>
	I will give you one example of the lack of transparency and 
the attitude of this government which is quickly trying to put one 
over on us with this omnibus bill before the House this morning. 
As you know, the sub-committee which considered Bill C-17 
was initially supposed to hold two and a half days of public 
hearings. Some of the provisions in this bill, particularly those 
pertaining to unemployment insurance which will be debated 
during the course of the day, are fundamental. The government 
was trying to stage a reverse kind of filibuster.
<P>
	The government was attempting to impose some fundamental 
provisions within the context of an omnibus bill, and had it not 
been for the actions of the Bloc Quebecois members of this 
sub-committee, we would not have had two weeks of public 
hearings during which testimony was heard from at least one 
hundred individuals.
<P>
	Transparency will not stifle this government. A similar thing 
occurred with the Pearson airport bill. Here again,  the 
government tried to hastily pass some fundamental measures, 
without resolving in any way whatsoever the problem with 
lobbyists in Canada.
<P>
	That is what the Bloc Quebecois motion is about. When wage 
agreements between the federal government and its employees 
expire, let a transparent public debate be held, let the 
government account for the decisions that will have to be made 
and let the whole world see that while this government may be 
new, it is totally out of date with regard to the relationship it 
wants to establish between its employees and their managers.
<P>
	That is not how things are done now. Imposing is no longer an 
option; and whether we agree with the idea of a wage freeze or 
not has nothing to do with the matter. But imposing a wage plan 
upon public servants in a dictatorial fashion will have disastrous 
effects.
<P>
	First, it will demotivate workers. Second, it is gagging union 
representatives. You know that these people have things to say, 
and a job to do, as they have demonstrated in the past.
<P>
	I was pleasantly surprised in early February, before the 
government even tabled its budget, to see public service unions 
volunteer to make sacrifices that often went far beyond a simple 
wage freeze like the one now imposed upon them. They came up 
with positive ways of reducing the annual deficit, increasing 
efficiency in the federal administration and achieving that 
wonderful meeting of the minds which we see in many regions in 
the world yet is totally non-existent here because this 
government is out of touch and out of date.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	It prefers to avoid confrontation, like the Prime Minister is 
doing with the Constitution issue, rather than face the real 
issues, rather than make real decisions in consultation and, I 
might say, in a spirit of brotherly love.
<P>
	That is what the motion put forward by the Bloc Quebecois is 
about. We want to force a public debate not only on public 
servants' wages but on wage costs as a whole, the efficiency of 
the government machine and even suggestions made by the 
unions.
<P>
	So, with our motion, the House would debate the issue anew 
upon the expiration of the wage provisions in the budget and, as 
I mentioned before, if we had not been so concerned about being 
realistic and had not considered the fact that this government 
shamelessly takes advantage of its majority to always have its 
way, we would have introduced, probably with respect to the 
Bill C-17 clause on public service compensation, motions 
similar to those of the Reform Party.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4435"> 4435 </A></B>
<P>
	But, because we want to be realistic, we know very well that 
such motions would probably be defeated by government 
members. Therefore, we have proposed a very realistic motion, 
which is likely to be approved by the Liberal members, if they 
are really concerned about transparency and democracy.
<P>
	By voting against our motion, they will confirm that the 
government has something to conceal, that it lacks the political 
will, that it has no vision, and that it could not care less about 
civil servants, about the state of our public finances, and even 
about the improvements that we could all make to the 
government system which is cumbersome, outdated, and rigid, 
just like the members of this government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> I think there are changes to the text.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier: </B>I thank the hon. member for reminding me of 
my technical obligations. We noticed this morning after the 
motion notices were printed that there were discrepancies 
between the English and the French versions.
<P>
	The errors are in the French version. I want to move the 
necessary amendments with the unanimous consent of the 
House. In fact, they are not amendments but corrections. If we 
have unanimous consent, I will read them to you. I would 
appreciate your accepting them. So shall I read them, Madam 
Speaker?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent of the House to accept the amendment to the motion by 
the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Do you want to read 
them for the record?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Motion No. 
4 reads as follows in section 7:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>On the expiration of the extensions of compensation plans provided under 
subsections 5(1), 5(3), 7(2.1) and 7(2.2), these provisions shall be referred to 
such committee-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The French version, which refers to a House of Commons, 
Senate or joint committee, should be amended to ``a committee 
of the House of Commons'' only.
<P>
	Instead of ``as may be designated or established by 
Parliament'', the French version should read ``as may be 
designated or established by that House'' to match the English 
text and on the last line, ``changes it deems desirable'' should be 
replaced with ``whether there should be any further extensions 
of the compensation plans''. Thank you, Madam Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> So if I understand 
correctly, there is no change to subsection (8).
<P>
	The hon. government whip.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alfonso Gagliano (Saint-Léonard):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to participate in this debate this morning. After 
listening to the finance critic of the Official Opposition tell us 
that the government had things to hide and was doing things in 
secret, I would not like this debate on this motion to end leaving 
those listening to us under a completely erroneous impression. I 
want to set the record of this House straight.
<P>
	This government was one of the first to establish a process 
that is open to consultation, first of all in this House where we 
have special days to debate the budget process. The Minister of 
Finance held public consultations throughout the country that 
were televised, not only for those who could take part in this 
debate, but also for people to follow it on television and even in 
the committees.
<P>
	The hon. member referred to the committee where an 
agreement was first made. We had two days of hearings with all 
members of the committee. When the opposition asked for more 
time, their request was granted. We are operating with an order 
of the House which specifies that we will have two days, today 
and Monday, to debate the motions after they have been debated 
in committee at report stage.
<P>
	So when they tell us that the government wants to rush this 
through and that we do everything in secret, the opposite is true, 
because this Liberal government established an open process in 
which everyone can participate. In the parliamentary reform we 
made at the beginning, when this House opened, we decided that 
for the next budget, the finance committee, on which the hon. 
member sits, will be able to help prepare the budget; it will not 
be as before, when we learned what the budget was only when 
the Minister of Finance came to the House to make his speech.
<P>
	So, it is wrong to say that the Liberal government wants to 
rush changes through in secret, because everything was done 
publicly. We are still doing so and will continue to do so. I 
wanted to make sure that the other side of the coin is seen also 
and that our listeners can have the other side of the story.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I rise with regard to this series of amendments because 
this discussion is symptomatic of a rather fruitless debate which 
has been going on for several years in Canada and in Quebec. On 
the one hand, it is conceivable to support the Reform Party's 
amendments for a return to open collective bargaining, instead 
of having decisions on employees's wages imposed by the 
government. On the other hand, no lesson seems to have been 
drawn from past experience. Let us face it: bargaining in the 
public sector differs somewhat from bargaining in the private 
sector.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4436"> 4436 </A></B>
<P>
	Through its consultation exercise on the budget and on 
management as a whole, the government should have come up 
with a vision different from that of the Conservatives. What we 
have is a Liberal rehash of an old Conservative recipe. 
Permanent solutions should definitely be found with respect to 
collective bargaining in the public sector, so as to avoid the 
current situation, where the government is once again forced 
to impose wage conditions to its employees, because it did not 
react soon enough. Indeed, it should have developed labour 
relations enabling it to reach agreements and implement a real 
social contract with its employees.
<P>
	This is probably why the two opposition parties want 
significant changes to be made. This bill sends the message that 
government employees are not productive enough, do not work 
hard enough and that, consequently, they must not be paid any 
more than they are. Yet, the truth is altogether different. The vast 
majority of people in the public sector, as in the private sector, 
do their job very well and the government should have had the 
courage, the determination and the originality to develop an 
adequate collective bargaining model for them, because they 
deserve it.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	During the first few months of this session, we were able to 
speak on the issue of the special bill passed to settle the labour 
dispute at the Vancouver harbour, where once again the 
government took a stand that showed some unwillingness and 
inability to negotiate fair agreements. Today, we are faced with 
this bill and we must deal with it. Unfortunately, we are not 
being asked to recognize a bargaining system arrived at through 
consensus by the employer, the government, and by 
representatives of the employees, the unionized public servants.
<P>
	For all these reasons, the government should review the 
amendments put forward by the opposition. Up to a certain 
extent, the amendments from the Reform Party seem 
interesting, because they at least come back to the main issue, 
which is open collective bargaining. But such bargaining 
between a government and its employees occurs in a different 
context than bargaining in the private sector. Even if the 
amendments of the Reform Party are agreed to, we would still 
need to add new stages to the process.
<P>
	It seems to me that the position taken by the opposition parties 
is much more in line with the new way we want to manage our 
labour relations. In fact, the message the opposition wants to 
convey to Canadians and Quebecers is this: we are here to see 
that our employees are treated fairly, and not to stand by while, 
year after year, the situation remains the same, whether we have 
a Conservative government or a Liberal government. We have a 
new government, and it has not made the slightest difference in 
this area and on several other issues.
<P>
	I think it is important to watch what new strategies are being 
applied in this area elsewhere. There must be some  information 
on compensation in the public and the private sectors. In 
Quebec, we get this kind of information from the Institut de 
rémunération, and we have learned that over the last 10 or 15 
years, compensation in the private sector has slowly caught up 
with compensation in the public sector. Forget the tales about 
overpaid public servants, we are getting closer and closer to 
wage parity in both sectors.
<P>
	If it is wage parity that we want, we will have to provide for a 
bargaining process as free as possible, taking into account the 
specificity of the government as an employer. Our amendments 
were to that effect, that is to find ways to oversee the action of 
the government because they seem to have already made up their 
mind, and whatever their decisions might be, they have a major 
impact on the budget for this fiscal year. We thought we had to 
ensure an adequate control in order to have the opportunity to 
see the results so as to be able, in the short term, to manage our 
labour relations in a way which does not de-motivate employees 
while allowing us to reach normal productivity objectives for 
the public service, which are measured in terms not only of 
lower operating costs, but also of job satisfaction.
<P>
	Employee satisfaction starts with meeting their basic needs. 
Whenever these needs are not met, workers will not respond to 
second- or third-level motivation. It is well known among 
personnel motivation experts that basic needs have to be met 
before anyone can be asked to contribute more. If these are not 
met, no other motivational action will work.
<P>
	I therefore encourage this government to accept the 
amendments by the opposition, be they by the Reform Party or 
the Bloc, which all aim at a more realistic bargaining process 
and at truly equal opportunities for both employer and 
employees. I hope the government will take heed of the 
amendments which have been tabled.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière):</B> Madam Speaker, I am glad to 
speak on the amendment of the Reform Party and that of my 
party and denounce the Liberal government for continuing the 
Conservative government's policy of ending what I would call 
the open collective bargaining in the Public Service.
<P>
	In the past, I lived through two situations where the 
government changed the rules of the game and imposed its will. 
I assure you that that had serious consequences, not on the 
motivation, but on the morale of the workers affected. Of 
course, people who work for the government and provide a 
public service continue to do so. On the two occasions when 
such laws were passed in Quebec, I observed that the people 
around me. The public servants continued to do their work well 
but something had changed in their attitude. It seemed that the 
workers had become more suspicious or distrustful of their 
employer, which is the government in this case.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4437"> 4437 </A></B>
<P>
	So I think that the government should interfere in open 
collective bargaining only in extreme situations and I do not 
think that we are in such a situation at this time. But what kind 
of a situation are we in right now? We see governments that 
have lost control over their spending. They must therefore make 
political decisions to show that, at least, they care for the 
interests of their people.
<P>
	What is the first decision? They find a scapegoat and public 
servants, the government's employees, are the perfect 
scapegoat. The government will say: ``Public service employees 
cost a lot of money, so we will cut their salaries''. When you 
look at those salary cuts compared to our national debt, it really 
is not much, but it still allows politicians to say: ``Yes, we do 
spend a lot of money, but remember that we have cut public 
service employees' salaries''. I think that it has simply become 
an excuse for a government that has lost control of its spending.
<P>
	There is another point that I would like to raise, and it has to 
do with the fact that we live in a country where the rule of law 
prevails. The government can make all the laws it wants to 
make, but they have to be considered fair and adequate by the 
people. And when a law is considered questionable and 
inadequate by all the people, I think that we find ourselves in a 
situation where the rule of law does not prevail any more. In 
fact, we find ourselves in a situation where the state wants to 
impose its will, where arbitrary considerations take precedence. 
People are willing to negotiate an agreement, to take part in a 
collective bargaining process, but there is always somebody 
somewhere that can say no. The contract that was signed in good 
faith by people who took the time to think about it and who voted 
during union general assemblies has now been unilaterally and 
arbitrarily repudiated.
<P>
	I am in favour of the amendment proposed by my party. 
However, if it is rejected, the amendment of the Reform Party 
advocating a return to open bargaining seems more acceptable to 
me than what we find in this bill. In this instance, the 
government, wanting to show the people that it is ready to make 
tough decisions in managing our country's affairs, finds a 
scapegoat and hits its workers in order to avoid having to look 
elsewhere.
<P>
	After spending six months in Ottawa, we, in the Bloc 
Quebecois, know that there are cuts to be made elsewhere. There 
are things that need to be examined. That is exactly what my 
party wanted to do at the very beginning of the session when it 
proposed the establishment of a special committee to review all 
government spending.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	When I say all government spending, this includes wages, but 
this also refers to all things that are bought, things that are sold, 
things that often seem, even for the layman, ill planned and that 
entail expenditures much more substantial than those related to 
cuts that could be done by a freeze in public servants wages.
<P>
	I will vote for the amendment proposed by my party and 
against the main amendment presented by the Liberal 
government that is putting an end to what I call open collective 
bargaining in the public service.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Madam Speaker, I too 
would like to condemn strongly the fact that this one bill 
includes all sorts of important issues for Quebec and Canadian 
society. This bill deals not only with unemployment insurance, 
as we will see later on, but also with the CBC and with the public 
service, the subject of my remarks today.
<P>
	Many public servants listened to the government party's 
sirens's song. The Liberals told them to change government and 
re-elect Liberals in order to get open collective bargaing back. 
Many of them told us how disappointed they were when, a few 
short months into the mandate of a new government, the wage 
freeze was extended.
<P>
	We should know that this is not the first wage freeze. For most 
of those concerned, this will merely be an extension of an 
existing freeze.
<P>
	Public servants are a resource for this country. Their role is to 
provide to their fellow citizens in Quebec or the rest of Canada 
the services they need and, most of the time, cannot provide 
themselves.
<P>
	This refusal to engage in a real dialogue between negotiating 
parties has untold consequences in terms of productivity. The 
way you are dealt with very often determines the way you react. 
Obviously, you can always coerce somebody into working 
because there is a salary at the end, whatever the amount. But 
you can never force anybody to give his or her maximum unless 
he or she wants to. If we want workers to do their best, and we do 
need that everywhere now, one of the important things is that 
they have to feel that they are respected.
<P>
	One may think that it is arrogant to deprive public sector 
workers of their dignity with a few paragraphs of a bill which 
contains measures on programs as important as UI that have 
attracted the most attention because they affect the most 
disadvantaged people in society.
<P>
	The Liberals are at the beginning of their mandate. They are at 
a stage where they should have started a bargaining process.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	They should have tried to ensure a settlement, even one which 
would subject workers to restrictions. Such a settlement implies 
that there is an exchange, give and take between parties, and 
that, at the start, the parties put their cards on the table, and 
respect each other.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4438"> 4438 </A></B>
<P>
	All the conditions were in place for the Liberals because they 
had not been in power for a long time and the economic 
situation was better. But, by doing what they have done, what 
they are about to confirm, what they are threatening to do, if 
I really said what I think, they have blown their opportunity 
to re-establish a real dialogue with their employees who, let 
us not forget, are employees of the government and render 
services which we would not be able to provide otherwise.
<P>
	Yes, they often have a bad reputation. However, many citizens 
know that they can count on their civil servants because they 
know them well, they know about the cuts, the problems that 
they face, that their workload is heavy, that they are the ones 
who answer the questions of the elderly taking their problems 
into account and that they are much better than answering 
machines with which the government wants to replace them.
<P>
	We need a public service that gives the best of itself, and it is 
not by treating it the way we do that it will. On the contrary. This 
is the reason why-not expecting the government to reconsider 
its decision regarding the freeze-we proposed this amendment, 
inviting the government to have this reviewed by a House 
committee and give the public service the conditions so that they 
can do their best. By supporting this amendment, the 
government would at least-despite its tough position-show 
its commitment to review the whole matter.
<P>
	It could start right away to prepare the ground for the return to 
open collective bargaining. It is in this spirit that this 
amendment has been formulated. We hope that everybody in this 
House will support its adoption and its implementation.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to say how surprised we are with the amendment to 
the motion of the Reform Party, and I would like very much to 
congratulate them. I think that they perhaps have a much more 
realistic vision of the public service today and that they made 
the right decision.
<P>
	The lack of motivation of public servants is such that I think it 
is high time that the government opens its eyes. They already 
have had a wage freeze for several years, and what the 
government is doing this year is simply carrying over that freeze 
once again.
<P>
	That is totally irresponsible on the part of the Liberal 
government. With all its good will, it could have renegotiated its 
contracts with public servants in order to find an area of 
agreement so that things would be much more realistic. Since it 
came into office, the government has been proving to us that it 
refuses to make cuts where it counts.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	Again, we are talking about tax shelters, an issue that remains 
taboo in this House. We and the Reform Party are the only ones 
who talk about it. We talk about family trusts. How many times 
did we ask for studies? The  government still has not responded. 
It is impossible to get answers on that issue.
<P>
	Our economy is not as its best. We should not delude 
ourselves. I think it is very well known that the economy is not 
about to make a big start this year. If the government decided to 
give good wages to its public servants, it would probably help 
the economy considerably, because the economy is like a wheel. 
When you give good wages to your employees, they buy more 
products and they make the wheel turn. The more you freeze 
salaries the more prices go up and the less people will make the 
economy work. This is all quite normal.
<P>
	The government really has made its choices this time. Again, 
it is always the same people who pay the bill. We have talked 
again and again in this House of the poorest in our society. We 
have had discussions on many occasions about social housing, 
among other things, but the government ignores the issue. We 
have also talked about the middle class which is the public 
service.
<P>
	I have relatives working for the public service who are 
responsible for big departments and who told me that the rates of 
absenteeism and sick leave in the public service are so high that 
it has created a real problem. People loose their motivation and 
this of course gives rise to absenteeism, sickness, depression 
problems and what have you, while the number of single parents 
is constantly increasing. This is why the salary freeze is totally 
unacceptable.
<P>
	I do not want to go from one extreme to the other and say that 
we have to give everything away, but perhaps we should accept 
open collective bargaining. This is what matters here. I am very 
happy to see that our Reform friends have changed their minds. I 
support the Bloc Quebecois' motion and hope that for once the 
government will make wise decisions and sit at the bargaining 
table. Being at the beginning of its mandate, the government has 
an opportunity to do so, to prove it is a good government, to sit 
with civil servants and renegotiate so we can have a public 
service which is efficient rather than dissatisfied as it has been 
for many years.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise to 
address the Bloc amendment in this grouping and to set the 
record straight on two issues: first, collective bargaining and, 
second, the purpose of our amendments.
<P>
	First, at the beginning of the debate on this grouping the 
member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot indicated that he was both 
surprised and shocked that we had changed our minds. He felt 
that the Reform Party was against collective bargaining but with 
these amendments we had somehow or other changed our minds 
and were now in favour of public sector negotiations.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4439"> 4439 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to set the record straight. Our party's position 
is that we are in favour of collective bargaining. We are in 
favour of people forming groups and unions. We are in favour 
of them having the right to strike. What we are against is 
holding the public to ransom. We are against employers not 
being able to find replacement workers should they need to. 
Those are the areas where we have to make the public sector 
a little more like the private sector.
<P>
	I say that so that the hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot will realize that we have not totally 
changed our position on that issue.
<P>
	Second, I would like to set something straight on the omnibus 
bill of the government, Bill C-17. We object very strongly to the 
bull-headed, arrogant fashion in which the government brings 
forth legislation dealing with five or six different areas of the 
economy, lumps it all into one bill and tries to force it on an 
opposition party, not allowing us to question the purpose of each 
area or to evaluate each individual category separately.
<P>
	The Reform Party had to come up with a strategy. I guess it is 
a political game to come up with some amendments to the 
omnibus bill in order to force debate.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	What is happening now is based on Reform Party strategy and 
on what we feel is in the best interests of all Canadians so that we 
can discuss each of these five categories separately instead of 
them being all lumped together in order to confuse everybody.
<P>
	We wish to point out those areas of the bill that we favour and 
those we are against. When it comes to voting on the groupings 
on this bill, I warn the members of the Bloc Quebecois that 
although we are getting compliments for changing our minds, 
we have not changed our minds.
<P>
	Do not be surprised that we will be voting against our own 
amendments in the groupings.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Madam Speaker, I am very 
happy today to say a few words about Bill C-17, the group of 
amendments proposed by the Reform Party and the way those 
amendments are being dealt with. I think that there are more 
than thirty of them. Of course, we have put about ten of them 
together and decided to vote on these ten amendments.
<P>
	As far as I am concerned, I am in favour of some of those and 
against some others. Since I have to vote on a group of 
amendments, I find myself in a very awkward position.
<P>
	That being said, I would like to talk briefly about 
unemployment insurance and the way this government treats our 
society. It is said to be a Crown corporation, but the government 
acts as if it was its own business. All of a sudden it decides to 
increase the unemployment insurance premiums, to reduce the 
benefit period and to  increase the number of weeks that one has 
to work to be entitled to unemployment insurance benefits.
<P>
	It is a hard blow on employers and employees who both have 
to pay higher premiums. At a time when recession is so hard on 
us, I wonder how the government can consider such a measure to 
be reasonable and responsible.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, once again, and I am talking here only about 
employers, I realize that small and medium-sized businesses 
which will be burdened with this increase in premiums are still 
going to see their chances of success diminish-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
would like confirmation that we are still on part I, public sector 
compensation, and not on part V, unemployment insurance.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> We are indeed on part I, 
which is a grouping of resolutions on remuneration.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> This puts a very heavy burden on 
companies and their employees, and I must say that reducing the 
number of weeks during which unemployment insurance 
benefits may be received will have a negative impact which will 
be very costly for the provinces, especially in Quebec.
<P>
	Reducing the number of weeks during which people are 
entitled to unemployment insurance means that when they run 
out of benefits, and this will happen soon as a result of the 
government's proposal, they will have to go to Quebec's social 
assistance department for help.
<P>
	It is estimated that in Quebec, another $500 million may be 
needed to help the unemployed when their unemployment 
insurance benefits run out.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	In other words, the federal government has used this devious 
approach to pass its financial burden-the unemployed-onto 
the provinces. That is unfair, and irresponsible.
<P>
	We see this happening in other sectors as well. For instance, 
when medicare was introduced, the provinces did not want the 
federal government to be involved in health care because it came 
under their jurisdiction. At the time, the federal government 
said: ``Do not worry, we will establish national standards, we 
will control health care and introduce regulations, and of course 
we will also provide 50 per cent of the money required. We will 
collect the money from the public and give it back to the 
provinces-they did not say that, of course-and it will be a nice 
present for the provinces, because we will pay 50 per cent of 
health care expenses. But of course they never said the money 
would come out of taxpayers' pockets.''
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4440"> 4440 </A></B>
<P>
	So the federal government took control of health care with 
its national Canadian health care policy. But today, the 
government pays only 30 per cent, not 50 per cent, and the 
provinces pay 70 per cent of their health care bills. And 
meanwhile, the federal government still insists it should 
oversee medicare.
<P>
	More or less the same thing is happening in the case of 
unemployment insurance. In this case the approach is even more 
devious. The government says it will reduce the number of 
weeks during which people have access to benefits which means 
the provinces will have to take up the slack and ensure that these 
people can continue to eat and sleep and heat their homes in the 
winter, in this harsh climate of ours. This is outright hypocrisy.
<P>
	The government also says it does a lot of consultation. It does, 
but it is not really listening. It does what it feels like doing. To 
consult usually means to listen to what people have to say, but 
the government does not listen. It does not respect their views. 
That is what their consultations amount to.
<P>
	When the government decided to raise UI premiums, it said 
that it was gradually getting out of unemployment insurance 
programs, but since it was still paying, it also wanted to get 
involved in training as well. Since I will not have enough time to 
expand on this point, I will mention what happened and what I 
heard in committee during the past few years.
<P>
	The Conseil du patronat and the unions said: Listen, if we as 
employers and employees have to pay most or all of the 
unemployment insurance premiums, why does the government 
continue to manage the program? The Conseil du patronat said, 
for instance: If we pay and the employee pays, why should we 
not be responsible for managing unemployment insurance?
<P>
	For the benefit of our listeners, a distinction must be made 
between unemployment insurance and job training. The 
government has managed to confuse the issue, but basically, 
employees and employers pay about the same for 
unemployment insurance, while the remaining amounts go to 
job training. This is another example of federal interference. It 
takes the money contributed by companies and their employees 
to provide job training, although this should be strictly up to the 
provinces.
<P>
	So, employers and employees say: ``Look, we would be 
willing to administer this unemployment insurance corporation, 
since we are paying for it. This way, we would assume our 
responsibilities''. The government would not make all kinds of 
unrealistic rules which often do not reflect real needs; 
employers and employees would administer the fund and 
probably have a more responsible attitude. Employees would 
not be dismissed without due cause, and neither would they 
resign on a whim. They would realize that acting this way would 
bring about an increase in unemployment insurance premiums.
<P>
	I personally believe that people must be given more 
responsibility. They must be able to administer their own  
unemployment insurance program. It could provide a good 
example to have the unemployment insurance fund 
administered by employees and employers.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I want to clarify 
something for the members. Motions dealing with the same 
subject have been grouped together. Therefore, motion No. 1 
deals with compensation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The grouping of resolutions on which members will be voting 
as groups of motions is under sections or parts of the bill. This 
particular group is under compensation. I thought I would clear 
that up in case members had any doubts or questions on it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Would you also clarify whether I am correct in understanding 
that a member may speak once to each of these areas and then 
not speak again? In this case would the hon. member be able to 
speak on compensation later on, or is he entitled to speak again 
to unemployment insurance, so that we are not having two 
swings at the same ball here?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> At the present time we 
are speaking on Motion No. 1 which is on part I, compensation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Madam Speaker, just for clarification, if a 
member has spoken on unemployment insurance, would that 
member again be able to speak on unemployment insurance 
when that grouping comes before the House?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Members desiring to 
take part in the debate will be able to debate on every group of 
motions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette):</B> Madam Speaker, I thank you for 
the opportunity to speak to this motion, firstly because I am the 
critic for public service renewal and secondly, because I am 
familiar with the collective bargaining process from a labour 
standpoint, having served as president of a teachers' union.
<P>
	When one wishes to increase employee motivation, the first 
thing one must do is respect the employees, not only by 
following universally accepted practices, but also by engaging 
in ongoing dialogue and by paying attention to arguments put 
forward by the union, particularly when the aim is to improve 
the situation. Federal public servants realized that the 
government had financial problems, was deeply indebted and 
needed to find ways to resolve the situation. Public service 
unions even made some suggestions to the government on ways 
to achieve these objectives without singling out public servants 
to bear the full brunt.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4441"> 4441 </A></B>
<P>
	The government apparently did not even bother to seriously 
discuss these proposals. Instead, it imposed a salary freeze. Not 
only did it freeze salaries, it also imposed a freeze on pay 
increment increases. This action means that public servants not 
only take an immediate step backward, they also lose ground 
for the rest of their working days. Those nearing retirement will 
see their pension calculated on the average salary earned during 
the last five or six years, and this salary will have been frozen.
<P>
	Everyone recognizes that the federal public service is highly 
competent. The members who have been here for several years 
have repeatedly said so. We have had the opportunity to judge 
this for ourselves since starting to work in this House and to rely 
on the help of the public service.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	You cannot on the one hand, contend that these people are 
competent and deserve our respect and on the other hand, 
disregard what they have to say concerning possible solutions to 
government problems.
<P>
	The best way to ensure someone's co-operation certainly is 
not to kick them in the rear end. If you want them to work 
together with you, you cannot just tell them they are nice, good 
and intelligent people and then turn around and completely 
disregard their proposals for making things work better.
<P>
	The way the government has gone about imposing a wage 
freeze on its employees without any consultation or rather 
serious consultation, because some may say they have been 
consulted. Meetings were held, speeches were made and 
legislation was passed. But that can hardly be called serious 
consultation. Serious consultation sometimes involves 
changing your approach.
<P>
	That is why we are requesting today that before making 
decisions in that respect, the government be required to submit 
its plans to a committee of the House of Commons so that a 
public debate can be held to allow the public to determine 
whether these decisions were made too hastily or at the expense 
of a segment of the population, one which has unfortunately 
been a favourite target over the past ten years. The middle class 
is always targeted. Yet, it is the one expected to pay yet more 
income tax. The middle class has been a cash cow for the past ten 
years. Now it is being eliminated without any regard for its 
contribution to the nation's coffers.
<P>
	As far as I am concerned, this is no way to establish and 
maintain good union-management relations and I hope the hon. 
members will support the motion before us not only out of 
fairness for this segment of population but also to show the 
government's regard for all those members of our society who 
are willing to co-operate, by asking them to pay no more and no 
less than their fair share.
<P>
	The government must figure out what can reasonably be asked 
from this group of government employees without affecting 
their motivation, credibility, enthusiasm and the respect they 
have for their employer.
<P>
	I hope we will show them the same respect and from now on 
have these people join us around the table for the sake of 
maintaining the atmosphere of confidence that must continue to 
exist in the Public Service.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak on this 
part of Bill C-17 and the amendment proposed by the Bloc 
Quebecois, that is, to designate a parliamentary committee to 
review the operation of this section on a permanent basis.
<P>
	This section deals with the federal-provincial tax agreements 
on the Canada Assistance Plan, in particular the freeze on 
federal contributions to the CAP.
<P>
	The Canada Assistance Plan has often been the subject of 
harsh criticisms, which were quite justified in some respects, 
especially since the CAP is a shared-cost program where costs 
are split 50-50 between the federal government and the 
provinces.
<P>
	The main criticism expressed in recent years is that this 
formula favours the richest provinces, which can invest in 
assistance programs and initiatives in the hope that the federal 
government will pick up half the costs.
<P>
	I can tell you that the changes made by the previous 
government were rather fair in some respects and more socially 
equitable or democratic that those of the current government, 
which calls it a general freeze.
<P>
	What the Conservatives did is freeze federal contributions to 
the CAP for Canada's three richest provinces, and with good 
reason. Contributions were frozen for Ontario, Alberta and 
British Columbia.
<P>
	Then the Liberal government comes to office and decides to 
freeze contributions for all Canadian provinces, whether rich or 
poor.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	So I would say to you that the Liberal government is less 
liberal than the previous Conservative government. I would say 
that it is like what we have been getting since the morning of 
October 26, under the cover of social democracy or even 
socialism, in some respects. Rules that are not quite social 
democratic are imposed on us. As was mentioned in the previous 
debate, we are forced to  put up with an attitude that is not quite 
open and not quite fair when it comes to equity between the 
provinces, for example, or fiscal equity in general.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, just capping CAP and funds for 
post-secondary education will cost the Canadian provinces at 
least some $2 billion in 1995-96 alone.
<P>
	I was telling you about the federal government passing the 
buck to the provinces because of the inability of this 
government, like its predecessor, which was strongly denounced 
by members of the present government, to regain control of the 
public finances in a responsible manner, not by shifting 
financial problems to the provinces as they have been doing 
since the morning of October 26, and when it is not the 
provinces, sovereigntists are blamed for the poor economic 
situation or the bad state of Canada's finances; sovereigntists 
are accused of creating instability and causing high interest 
rates, although it is the present Minister of Finance who cannot 
properly manage Canada's finances without passing the buck to 
the provinces, who is responsible for the economic crisis and the 
way the government's finances are headed for disaster.
<P>
	We deplore this attitude of the present government, just as we 
deplored the ceiling on equalization payments when we had to 
debate that issue. In both cases, behind these shameless, 
ill-considered decisions, we find the same incompetence of 
those who are running this government.
<P>
	In this regard, let me remind you that, in the House, we are 
constantly hearing government members, as well as Reform 
members, claim to be great Canadians while disregarding-and 
the debate we had on equalization is still clear in my mind-, 
sneezing at or dismissing offhand one of the fundamentals of 
Canadian federalism which is fiscal federalism. They want to 
limit expenses such as equalization payments, which constitute 
the underpinning of fiscal federalism, and they congratulate 
themselves for capping or freezing payments, knowing very 
well that they are destroying one of the fundamentals of the 
system for which they stand as great Canadians. That explains 
why the system is in total disarray.
<P>
	Anyway, I think that the members of the Bloc Quebecois have 
made the right decision, which is to leave that system behind.
<P>
	According to our motion on this clause, which limits federal 
transfers made under the CAP, each time a freeze, cap or cut is 
introduced on such basic programs, the matter would have to be 
debated, and the government would have to justify its support 
for the hateful measure and put up with our telling it that its 
so-called system based on equalization payments or transfers 
under the Canada Assistance Plan is faulty. This system attacks 
the provinces with impunity and it shamelessly off-loads the 
federal government's fiscal problems onto the provinces.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4443"> 4443 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	I also recommend a follow-up on these bad decisions, this 
government's shameful decisions, a follow-up on the impacts, 
because there will indeed be repercussions. To freeze all 
contributions to every Canadian province, including the poorest 
ones which are experiencing the most serious problems in terms 
of welfare recipients and underemployment in general and 
which include Quebec and the Maritimes, can only have 
disastrous consequences from an economic and social point of 
view.
<P>
	This decision by the government follows another one which 
we will have the opportunity to debate this afternoon and which 
concerns the Unemployment Insurance Program where, once 
again, the government is prepared to totally destabilize and 
demoralize entire communities, particularly in Quebec and in 
the Maritimes, which are in no position to support such 
hardship.
<P>
	We too could have proposed the deletion of this part of Bill 
C-17. However, unlike Reform Party members, we are 
responsible people. We know that tax agreements were signed 
by the provincial and federal governments and this is why we did 
not deem appropriate, particularly with a majority government, 
to ask that these clauses be deleted.
<P>
	However, we are proposing transparency, honesty and, more 
importantly, we want this government to be accountable to the 
House and to Canadians for the shameful decisions it has been 
making since it took office, decisions which are in total 
contradiction with the agenda and the vision-because the 
Liberals think of themselves as visionaries- which it keeps 
referring to. I submit this amendment and ask all members to 
support it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
rising also to speak on these motions at report stage of Bill 
C-17, the Budget Implementation Act, particularly at this time 
motions dealing with sections 12 to 14, the fiscal transfers 
portion of the bill.
<P>
	We are debating four motions, three of which I have moved, 
and I want to clarify my reasons once again for moving those 
motions. We have opposed the bill because of its omnibus 
nature. We insist upon having a debate on the floor of the House 
of Commons on each section of the omnibus bill because this 
should not be one bill.
<P>
	I raised a lengthy point of order at second reading on this 
particular issue. I realize that the Chair ruled against it and I 
respect that decision which was based on precedent. I 
nevertheless reiterate that precedent is an unfortunate way to 
proceed here because we do have a new Parliament. We have a 
chance to right some of the wrongs and some of the questionable 
practices we have fallen into, in particular the practice in recent 
years of presenting omnibus legislation with respect to 
budgetary matters.
<P>
	This particular section which I want to address in report stage 
today concerns fiscal transfers and specifically two areas: the 
CAP or Canada assistance plan and the PUITTA or Public 
Utilities Income Tax Transfer Act. We very reluctantly support 
these particular aspects of the bill, although my amendments are 
here to provide us with an opportunity for debate on this specific 
portion.
<P>
	Let me first of all address section 12, that is the Canada 
assistance plan portion. The government is introducing through 
the budget a freeze to CAP transfer payments to the provinces at 
present levels for the immediate future.
<P>
<B>(1145 ) </B>
<P>
	Through this, the government projects savings of $466 
million in the next fiscal year, 1995-96, and the budget has 
promised social security reform based on co-operative effort 
among federal and provincial governments.
<P>
	This is an area where the government, although it is adopting 
some of the things we proposed, is really proceeding without a 
plan and causing friction with provincial governments. I would 
note that in spite of its promise of co-operation this is clearly 
not happening. The evidence for this was the refusal in April of 
some provinces to attend a scheduled briefing to inform them of 
the federal government's progress in the area of social security 
reform.
<P>
	I caution the government against making the same mistake 
with welfare that it has already made with health care, that is 
getting into an area of provincial jurisdiction-welfare is 
clearly an area constitutionally of strict provincial 
jurisdiction-enforcing national standards through, in this case 
the Canada assistance plan and regulations, and then gradually 
decreasing funding levels; in other words cutting the provincial 
funding but not giving them the freedom to adjust to the changes 
to make their targets and policies appropriate to funding levels.
<P>
	Obviously this is a formula for alienating the provinces. 
Along with cuts which decrease their spending power it will 
make it difficult for them to implement social policy now and 
could also impact their ability to implement proposed social 
policy reforms down the road.
<P>
	We need national deficit reduction of course, but we need it in 
a plan. We need it with an agreement in these areas with the 
provinces rather than a dysfunctional partnership in which the 
federal government makes unilateral changes through transfer 
arrangements but leaves in place policies that were based on full 
funding.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4444"> 4444 </A></B>
<P>
	Section 12 of the bill which freezes the current level into the 
future does, I would also note, perpetuate certain anomalies. 
It perpetuates the CAP discrimination that exists today with 
regard to the so-called have provinces, Ontario, Alberta and 
British Columbia, particularly Ontario and British Columbia 
where the unilateral and discriminatory reductions over the 
years in CAP funding have dramatically impacted upon those 
provinces.
<P>
	I note, for example, that in Ontario the federal share of costs 
of CAP has decreased from 50 per cent to 29 per cent. This is one 
anomaly. Another is in the case of Quebec. This is an area that 
has been brought to my attention for not being clear in the bill.
<P>
	In the area of CAP, Quebec operates under a bilateral tax 
abatement agreement with the federal government. I would call 
upon the government to clarify how exactly this freeze of 
transfers affects that agreement into the future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Considering these problems, I want to congratulate the hon. 
member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot for his amendment, 
Motion No. 12, which proposes the setting up of a parliamentary 
committee to review on a permanent basis the implementation 
of this policy. It is important, given the lack of a comprehensive 
strategy by the provincial and federal governments, to have such 
a committee, and I asked Reform Party members to support the 
motion tabled by the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I conclude with a comment on sections 13 and 14 that affect 
the Public Utilities Income Tax Transfer Act. These sections 
extend the freeze, basically a freeze of 10 per cent below the 
1989-90 payment on these transfers to the provinces into the 
future.
<P>
	I support this and our party supports this with even more 
reluctance than we support the CAP transfers. Of course the 
income tax transfers in this area to the provinces should be 100 
per cent funded.
<P>
<B>(1150 ) </B>
<P>
	One should remember that the purpose of these tax transfers is 
to refund to provinces that have privately owned utilities the 
portions of tax revenue that are raised by the federal 
government. These are transferred back to the provinces where 
these private utility companies are located. In the case of 
Alberta, which receives a lion's share of these transfers, they are 
passed on to the customers of these utilities.
<P>
	This is not a special payment. This simply ensures that there is 
not discriminatory taxation against provinces and against 
individual Canadians who happen to be customers of private 
rather than public utility companies.
<P>
	While this should be fully funded, I understand the reason for 
the government's finding that at this time it cannot restore that 
but must continue the policy that was unfortunately established 
by the previous government.
<P>
	We support that with some difficulty but we hope that will be 
reassessed some day when we do have a plan to get our fiscal 
House in order within a reasonable time period.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to say on these amendments that 
we recognize the need for significant reform and some reduction 
of federal transfer payments to the provinces to balance the 
budget. These are not the best ways of proceeding. They are the 
ways the government has chosen. We are very concerned about 
the lack of an overall plan and strategy but are prepared to 
support them on an interim basis.
<P>
	I would remind the House once again that I have moved 
certain amendments to allow this debate, but I would 
recommend to my caucus that we support the Bloc amendment 
to study particularly the operation of CAP transfer programs in 
the future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Madam Speaker, I was 
interested to hear what the hon. member had to say. I will also 
speak on the amendment put forward by the Bloc Quebecois, 
which calls for the review by a committee of the administration 
and operation of this clause.
<P>
	What we call CAP for short is in fact the Canada Assistance 
Plan. This plan, also funded by the taxes paid by all Quebec and 
Canadian citizens, was established during the major economic 
recession between 1957 and 1961, when we noticed a significant 
increase in the number of poor people, including unemployed 
workers.
<P>
	In fact, in its first three years, the plan was called the 
Unemployment Assistance Program. This program, which was 
created in cooperation with the provinces, but still comes under 
a federal law, ensures that the federal government will finance 
50 per cent of a number of expenditures. As the hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe said earlier, to a certain extent, this program 
was of a greater help to the richer provinces, which could incur 
more expenditures, knowing that the federal government would 
cough up 50 per cent of the costs, as was the case, for example, 
for daycare and social housing programs.
<P>
	As far as social assistance is concerned, the amount to be paid 
by the Canada Assistance Plan varied according to how 
generous the individual provinces were. On the one hand, you 
had people living below the poverty level, and on the other hand, 
you had individual provinces deciding upon the kind of 
programs they could afford.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4445"> 4445 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	This budget completely changes the terms and conditions of 
what could be called the moral contract between the provinces 
and Canada, because, from now on, the subsidies given to the 
provinces will not exceed what was granted as of March 31, 
1995.
<P>
	I must add, Madam Speaker, that the Canada Assistance Plan 
is subject to many more changes, since, for all practical 
purposes, the same budget also announced the end or the 
overhaul of the Plan. The consultations to be undertaken by the 
Minister of Human Resources Development, which, as we know, 
are also announced in the same budget, concern the social 
assistance reform. And yet, social assistance unequivocally falls 
within provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	When the federal government freezes the payment transfers 
for the Canada Assistance Plan, it changes naturally, first, the 
situation the provinces are in and, second, the rules governing 
the other programs which exists under this Plan. Moreover, and 
this is extremely important, we will speak a little later of the 
changes to the unemployment insurance. These changes to the 
unemployment insurance will mean a heavier burden for 
provinces as far as social assistance is concerned.
<P>
	Thus, in two very important ways, the budget and this 
omnibus bill will make things worst for the provinces when it 
comes to dealing with poverty-and this is what it is all 
about-when it comes to helping people without any revenue 
whatsoever to survive. With what poor people are given in each 
of the provinces, they can barely live.
<P>
	We are talking here of distributing the contribution of the 
richer provinces to the poorer to help people who have no 
revenue not to live but, as I said, to barely survive.
<P>
	Under these circumstances, the amendment is very modest. 
We would very much like the Reform Party and the government 
to agree to incorporate it into the omnibus bill. It will allow us to 
look more closely at the operation of this act, to examine the 
means available to each province to fight poverty.
<P>
	I must add that I have the feeling that, given the reform 
undertaken by the minister, these sums will be used for other 
purposes and that we will have heated debates in this House over 
the next few months if I am right about the changes that I think 
are forthcoming. But I will wait.
<P>
	I would like to respond here and now to those who wonder 
why Quebec sovereigntists want to separate from the Canadian 
federation when Quebec benefits from equalization and from the 
Canada Assistance Plan. Yes, we want to separate because we 
are not only convinced but certain-because we have studied all 
these issues very carefully-that if Quebec had all the powers of 
a sovereign state to develop its economy and fight poverty, it 
would be in a better position to help those in need, to provide 
social housing and child care services to  Quebecers. Quebec 
would do better as an independent state than if it continued to 
receive transfers that are constantly reduced and subject to more 
and more conditions. It would do better than if it continued to be 
deprived of the means with which to develop a strong economy, 
with workers who have all the job training they need. The fact of 
the matter is that the federal government does not give the 
province enough money, money it collects from Quebec 
taxpayers in the first place.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	So, this is a modest amendment which will hopefully allow us 
to continue to demonstrate that the operation of this act makes 
no sense.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to reiterate our party's philosophy on debating the bill 
today.
<P>
	The purpose of our amendments is to make our support clear 
for some portions of the bill. At the same time we may not 
support our amendments when they come to a vote. We were 
forced to do this because the government wanted to lump a 
bunch of bills together and put it through without due and proper 
deliberation.
<P>
	We feel it is important that everybody get a chance to debate 
each specific issue on its own merits and not have things lumped 
together. The advantage of this philosophy or political strategy 
is that it has forced debate on five separate areas. We can bring 
attention to each of the areas so there is a clear understanding of 
what areas we are for and what areas we are against, on all sides 
of the House.
<P>
	What is wrong with an omnibus bill is that it groups unrelated 
pieces of legislation together. It is an admission of two things.
<P>
	First, it is an admission that individual members, at least 
government members, have no real input into substantive 
legislation. There is so much put together and so much to 
consider that it is too hard for an individual to comprehend.
<P>
	Second, it shows how ineffectual the committee system is. If 
input was really expected from committees a bill as broad as this 
would never go to just one committee. It has five different 
components and thus should not go to just one committee. 
Members of this House, especially government members, could 
then do a proper and better review.
<P>
	In the accounting taught in most schools eventually 
everybody gets to hear about the kiss system: keep it simple, 
stupid.
<P>
	It would be nice if this government would not ram big bills 
through on the opposition and on the Canadian public but 
instead applied a new approach, a more simple and more visible 
approach. It should start separating bills and discussing each 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4446"> 4446 </A></B>
<P>
issue individually. I encourage  the government to adopt that 
kind of a philosophy. It would be advantageous for everyone.
<P>
	We favour the section on the fiscal arrangements with the 
provinces, partially because it adopts some of the policies and 
principles of the Reform Party zero in three plan. With that plan 
we would have a zero deficit in three years.
<P>
	At first we had a lot of criticism of that zero in three plan. The 
Liberal government said our cuts were too draconian and that 
our suggestion of 6 per cent cuts on this year's budget alone was 
too draconian. I have now found out that when the finance 
minister appeared before the Business Council on National 
Issues, he indicated that in next year's budget he is actually 
looking for perhaps up to 12 per cent in cuts. If our 6 per cent is 
too draconian for the spending cap we set this year, what can be 
said about the government's proposed 12 per cent? We would 
work toward showing the government where those areas of cuts 
could be.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	Our zero in three plan for cuts in this area would have been 
combined with some workfare and some constructive 
mechanisms and with hope for people to do just as much with 
less money, acknowledging the fact that we all have to start 
living within our means. We know the Canadian public is forced 
to live within its means. It is only this government that will not 
accept the fact that the problem is the deficit and the debt. It is 
not looking for ways to reduce spending.
<P>
	I want to make the point that when we see the government 
does recognize that, and there is a significant saving here of up 
to $466 million through this freeze, then we support it. We 
compliment the government on that section and we encourage it 
to do more of the same.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> We will.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> I heard an hon. member opposite say: ``We will''. 
We will hold them to that promise.
<P>
	I caution the government about making the same mistake with 
welfare as it is making with health care, which as members 
know, is another purpose of the Canada assistance plan and 
transfers to the provinces. The government has promised social 
security reform based on a co-operative effort among the 
federal and provincial governments. Clearly this is not 
happening. Evidence of this is in the refusal of some provinces 
to attend a scheduled briefing on health care.
<P>
	The government makes the same mistake with this welfare 
program and decreased funding levels which it must and is 
doing. However it has to give the provincial governments the 
freedom to adjust to these changes and target funding 
appropriately.
<P>
	The provinces cannot be punished by having to reduce their 
spending or having to figure out alternate ways of paying for 
these programs that are only partially subsidized by the federal 
government. Whereas they should have been subsidized to a 
higher degree, the  federal government reduces the funding and 
the provinces have to look for ways and means to pay for the 
programs and then they are cut off. We know it is a problem but 
we just wish the government would be more aware of it.
<P>
	Currently despite the fact that constitutionally welfare is 
strictly under the control of the provincial governments the 
federal government enforces national standards through the 
Canada assistance plan and regulations. We have a few concerns 
about this area. Alienating the provinces along with cuts which 
decrease the federal spending power may make it difficult when 
it comes to the social policy reforms being planned for in the fall 
by the minister of human resources.
<P>
	Overall we recognize the need for significant reform and the 
reduction of federal transfer payments to provinces to balance 
the budget. We just have a concern about the overall plan or 
strategy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Madam Speaker, in response to a question raised 
earlier, the amendments we are proposing do not affect tax 
points.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière):</B> Madam Speaker, this is a 
Bloc Quebecois amendment and I want to comment on it. It 
would amend Bill C-17 which proposes to freeze the federal 
contribution to the Canada Assistance Plan.
<P>
	You know that the Canada Assistance Plan is financed by the 
federal and provincial governments.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	According to Bill C-17, the federal contribution to CAP 
would be capped after March 1995.
<P>
	CAP is a plan that was developed in the 1950s and 1960s for 
the sake of social justice for classes of people who, for some 
reason, cannot support themselves.
<P>
	So, it is a plan that really addresses the basic needs of some of 
our fellow citizens. The government's proposal would impose a 
unilateral freeze on the federal contribution to CAP.
<P>
	My party denounces this way of proceeding. This change 
would have major consequences that we parliamentarians can 
hardly assess at the present time but we in the opposition know 
that some parts of the population would be severely affected.
<P>
	With this in mind, my party proposed an amendment calling 
for a standing committee to study the whole question so that the 
members of this House could know the real impact of the Liberal 
government's proposal on the most needy in our society. As 
parliamentarians, we must in all honesty seriously consider the 
consequences of our decisions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4447"> 4447 </A></B>
<P>
	I think it is not improper to really want to take into account 
the serious impact that could result from legislation we pass 
here. It is therefore important that people, through their 
representatives, be made aware of the situations that could 
result from a proposal such as the one the Liberal government 
is making.
<P>
	I also want to denounce the practice followed at various levels 
of government, that is using a seemingly harmless measure to 
freeze transfer payments to other levels of government. That is 
what is called passing the buck, shifting one's problems, one's 
responsibilities onto someone else.
<P>
	That is exactly what the federal government is doing now. 
And what will happen? Provincial governments will get less 
contributions. To maintain their present level of services, 
provincial governments will have to spend more and perhaps go 
deeper into debt or they will have to bear the responsibility of 
cuts in programs affecting the most disadvantaged members of 
our society.
<P>
	But then the federal government will wash its hands of the 
matter, saying that it simply made cuts in transfer payments 
whereas provincial governments decided not to make 
supplementary expenditures in order to offset the cuts.
<P>
	I think this is dishonest and hypocritical, because the 
government proposing this bill knows perfectly well what will 
happen, but it is going ahead with it nevertheless; when in 1995, 
1996 or 1997, provinces have to either cut services to the most 
disadvantaged members of our society or borrow money to 
maintain services, they are the ones that will have to face 
criticism for their actions.
<P>
	As parliamentarians, I think we have to be responsible for our 
actions. If we want to cut social programs, we should say so. We 
should not force others do that by putting them in a situation 
where they will have no other choice, but that is typical of this 
Liberal government.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	We know that a reform is under way. Mr. Axworthy, the 
Minister of Human Resources Development, announced it. 
Committees are studying the matter. Experts were hired to 
determine the government's position. The Standing Committee 
on Human Resources Development is exploring different 
avenues. The government has no project, no overall plan. Things 
are done in a piecemeal way. We hear that cuts might be made in 
UI or in social assistance or that the student loans program 
might be redesigned. But since they are informed of all this in 
such a fragmented way, Canadians cannot assess the whole 
reform. And we parliamentarians cannot say to our constituents 
what our objectives are and what results we want to achieve in a 
few years.
<P>
	So this proposal, which looks pretty insignificant but will 
have important consequences for many of our most 
disadvantaged fellow citizens, is a patent example of the 
hypocritical and often lying way in which our country is now 
ruled and its social policy for the poorest members of our 
society is designed.
<P>
	I will certainly vote against the main proposal on freezing 
federal transfer payments, and I will vote for the amendment 
moved by my party to strike a standing committee for the 
purpose of reviewing all these proposals and gauging their 
impact. Parliamentarians will thus be accountable to Canadians 
on important measures and bills such as the one before us today.

would not want people to think we have 53 members in the 
Reform Party just yet.
<P>
	We have moved this amendment to allow us to address the 
various parts of the bill. When I first spoke on this I pointed out 
that it was an omnibus bill. The nature of an omnibus bill is 
something that presents so many different parts that may not 
closely or even relatively link to one another that it is impossible 
to pick and choose what you can support and what you 
consequently have to reject.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4448"> 4448 </A></B>
<P>
	If there are things in it which are totally unpalatable and one 
cannot support then one has to reject the entire bill. The reason 
we have moved this amendment is so that we can address the 
individual parts of the bill in debate.
<P>
	With regard to the transportation subsidies, as I said before 
that is one portion which I can agree with at least in principle. I 
also suggested at the time that the government had not really 
done its homework on these issues. Had it done so it would have 
found that there were many areas, both in the western grain 
transportation subsidies and in the Atlantic regional subsidies 
where other costs could have been cut that would have achieved 
the same or a higher level of saving for the government without 
penalizing the people of the region that these subsidies were 
initially designed to serve.
<P>
	It could be done in such a way that the subsidies could be 
reduced and the local people would still realize a saving in 
money if we got rid of some of the waste and inefficiencies. I 
suggested this was a lack of homework on the part of the 
government. I have seen very little in the ensuing period since I 
last spoke on this issue to suggest that the government is yet 
ready to do this work.
<P>
	Much of this can be resolved in committee. I believe that is 
what committees are for. It is unfortunate that the government 
sees fit to take all these different aspects of things generally 
relating to the budget, lump them into one omnibus bill and then 
suggest that we have to accept or reject the bill in its entirety.
<P>
	We have seen the folly of this under such things as the 
Charlottetown accord. The Charlottetown accord was probably 
the most omnibus piece of work that has ever come from any 
government. It was rejected by the majority of Canadians who 
reviewed it and said: ``While there may be some things in there 
that we support, there are things in there that we cannot plug our 
nose and vote in favour of as the previous Prime Minister 
suggested''. Consequently the majority of Canadians in their 
own best interest rejected that.
<P>
	Forevermore, from the previous Prime Minister to the present 
Prime Minister and all his cabinet ministers, every time we try 
and raise an important issue for Canadians we hear that we 
rejected that. We hear: ``We offered that to you and you rejected 
it under the Charlottetown accord. Never, ever bring it up 
again''.
<P>
	Using that same rationale, it brings to us Bill C-17. In Bill 
C-17 there are probably some good things we would like to see 
through. We are told that the government has to reduce its cost 
and yet every time it tries we reject what it is saying. We say 
there are things in here where we can save money and we support 
that. Transportation subsidies is one area which in general 
principle we can support.
<P>
	An example of something I personally cannot support tied 
into the same bill is allowing borrowing by the CBC. It is not bad 
enough that the government borrows more than it can ever hope 
to repay and cannot even pay the  interest on, but now it wants to 
farm out those rights to its various crown corporations so that 
they can borrow. In that way it is not seen as part of the 
government's national debt.
<P>
	With regard to the transportation subsidy I would support the 
reduction in grain subsidies but I couple that with a request if not 
a demand that the government at the same time look at the 
inefficiencies of the transportation system. It has been proven 
that simply pumping money into the transportation system does 
not get the grain moving and that is what the farmers require.
<P>
	By all means we can reduce the costs but at the same time we 
have to get rid of the inefficiencies. I suggest that if we got rid of 
all inefficiencies we could get rid of subsidies almost entirely 
without any penalty to the farmers who are in dire straits 
because of government inaction.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	With regard to the Atlantic regional subsidies, again the same 
situation. There are many areas where the government could 
reduce subsidies if it would improve certain other areas which 
penalize the Atlantic region. One that I mentioned specifically 
was the icebreaking services provided without cost to the 
shippers in order to keep a frozen port open while ice free ports 
remain underutilized. This is penalizing the Atlantic region.
<P>
	As I mentioned, I have no problem with keeping that service 
available but shippers should pay the cost of providing that 
service which costs $20 million a year. This would more than 
offset the type of subsidy it is looking to reduce and which is 
actually penalizing the Atlantic region.
<P>
	I also mentioned the economic development grants. Those 
could be reduced as well if at the same time the government 
would do something about interprovincial trade barriers which 
costs the Atlantic region more than its entire economic 
development grants.
<P>
	On the basis of breaking this up, I will support with my added 
remarks the transportation subsidy portion. But until the bill is 
broken up and the parts dealt with individually so that the 
ludicrous parts can be eliminated, it makes it very difficult to 
support.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I will not talk at length about this part of Bill C-17, 
since I do not think there are major problems with the 
administrative provisions on transportation contained in this 
bill.
<P>
	I will rather speak about the lack of seriousness of the Reform 
Party when it proposes to examine the bill section by section. 
We were just told in a very strange way that the party wants to 
eliminate the entire clauses of that part of the bill, while 
recognizing that some provisions could be beneficial. I have 
never heard such a thing before. I have already seen politicians 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4449"> 4449 </A></B>
<P>
who were not  serious, but we expected that the Reform Party 
would be a little more serious than that.
<P>
	Had they proposed constructive amendments to this part of 
the bill, it seems to me that it would have been promising for the 
overall examination of the bill. I see that they are unable to do 
that, because they are not serious. All the more so since it was 
just said that the bill contains some provisions that are 
beneficial for Western grain transportation. They have been 
elected only in the West and they are proposing amendments to 
eliminate these provisions as a whole, including the ones 
concerning Western grain transportation, the famous Crown's 
Nest Pass Agreement.
<P>
	Do these people talk to their constituents? As they claim, their 
way of doing politics is somewhat different. They bring up 
questions faxed to them by citizens. They should have gone 
directly to their constituents, especially the western farmers and 
the western carriers to seek their opinion, instead of acting so 
irresponsibly and proposing these amendments.
<P>
	I also noticed that each time a bill, including the motion 
introduced by the Reform Party, dealt with a region east of 
Manitoba, it was necessarily bad. One said for example that, in 
the Maritime Provinces, users could have been asked to pay for 
the ice monitoring. As if these people were not already 
overburdened. I noticed it during the hearings held by the 
sub-committee on bill C-17, especially on the part dealing with 
unemployment insurance. Let us stop -as the Reformers 
always do-taking the Maritime Provinces as the sole example 
to illustrate inefficiency.
<P>
	The same thing applies to regional development grants. I feel 
it is a little too much. I wanted to stress that. It does not add 
anything to the motion introduced, it does not take away 
anything from it. But the attitude of the Reform Party today is 
disgraceful.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> Madam Speaker, while the government bill 
proposes to amend the rules pertaining to unemployment 
insurance, Canada Assistance Plan and collective bargaining by 
imposing a salary freeze upon its employees, while the 
government is making cutbacks everywhere and taking money 
in the taxpayers' purse, it is still granting the CBC a borrowing 
authority of $25 million which could be increased under an 
appropriation act.
<P>
	First of all I would like to denounce the omnibus bill which in 
the hands of the government becomes a way to disguise 
important policy changes. This bill is a soup containing to many 
ingredients and too spicy to the taste of the poorest.
<P>
	That being said, I would like to emphasize the borrowing 
authority that the government intends to give the CBC. 
According to the rule book, a line of credit is generally granted 
to individuals and to financial institutions that know how to add 
up figures, how to administer their business, that have 
expansion plans based on market research studies or who know 
how to balance their books. In other words, individuals and 
institutions that have a financial reputation that can justify their 
request.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4450"> 4450 </A></B>
<P>
	Yet, this is far from being the case with the CBC. Let us have 
a closer look at the facts. Based on data prepared by senior 
officials of the Department of Canadian Heritage, the CBC will 
see its deficit grow from $41 million this year to $78 million 
next year and this does not take into account the budgetary cuts 
of April 1993. You must add to those projections an amount of 
at least $100 million that the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
intends to recover from the CBC over the next five years.
<P>
	The minister also stated that he would like to see the CBC less 
dependent on advertising revenues. Those revenues will account 
for 26.3 per cent of the total revenues of the CBC in 1994, that is 
almost $400 million on a total budget of $1.5 billion.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	Up until now, several drastic measures have been taken by the 
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to redress its structural 
deficit. With a document published by professor Lauzon, I want 
to remind you of some of those measures which in the end did 
not solve anything and, above all, did not allow the corporation 
to balance its books. Yet, we still suffer from some of those 
measures. There have been 2,800 jobs lost since 1984, including 
some lay-offs, French and English television services have been 
restructured, three local television stations have been converted 
to satellite stations, and all regional programs have been 
cancelled except for news bulletins. That measure should bring 
about an economy of $46 million.
<P>
	Incidently, it is impossible for me, as a citizen, to find out how 
much it costs to operate the French CBC station in Quebec City. 
People in Eastern Quebec have the vivid impression that that 
station profited from the savings that were to result from the 
closing of the Rimouski, Matane and Sept-Îles stations. But 
when we ask for information in Quebec City, the answer is: 
``Sorry, we have competitors, we cannot give you that 
information''.
<P>
	Let me go on with the list of cuts the CBC made in order to 
reduce its deficit: $12 million in expenditures for the television 
network. Another apparent cut affects precisely the office of the 
Speaker of this House; the parliamentary channel has been 
transferred to the budget of his office. Such a measure seems to 
result in an economy of $5 million but in reality the service still 
costs taxpayers $5 million; it has simply changed envelopes.
<P>
	Another cut was the reduction of Radio Canada International 
services abroad and the transfer of its financing to Foreign 
Affairs. This might look like a $20 million saving for the 
corporation, but it is costing $20 million to Foreign Affairs. 
Such measures are deceitful for the public; they are a real 
disgrace.
<P>
	But not all services have been cut, not all services have borne 
their share of budget cuts. The amounts withheld from the 
regions have simply been transferred to the networks.
<P>
	According to a study conducted by the Syndicat des 
journalistes de Radio-Canada, contrary to what they  would 
have people believe, the closing of stations in the regions in 
1991 has not reduced the costs of television programming. It has 
led to a transfer of funds to the networks. If you compare the 
costs of television programming for 1991 with those for 1992, 
you realize that they have decreased by $40 million in the 
regions and that the costs of the regions' contributions to the 
network have also decreased by $7.1 million. One regionally 
produced program we all know very well is ``SRC Bonjour'' 
which originates right here in Ottawa.
<P>
	Therefore, you will say, there was in fact a cut of some $47 
million. Quite the opposite; if you look at the figures, the 
network costs have increased by $60.7 million. There you have 
another example of the kind of cover-up this government and 
that corporation are carrying out. The final cost was $13 million 
higher than the anticipated cuts. Therefore, the network 
benefited from the closing of our regional TV stations and it 
hurts even more. We are still reeling from it.
<P>
	I would like to mention something that was promptly 
dismissed by the president of the Canadian Broadcasting 
Corporation and by the Minister of Canadian Heritage, namely 
the funding discrepancies between Radio-Canada and the 
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.
<P>
	On April 5 last, the Coalition pour la défense des services 
Français de Radio-Canada, which, I will remind the House, is 
made up of technicians, journalists, musicians, researchers, and 
in-house artists, published a report showing that the funding 
discrepancy between the two networks now totals $76.4 million. 
SRC gets $69 million, whereas CBC receives $146.1 million.
<P>
	One hour of TV programming costs on average $37,400 on 
CBC, and $18,390 on SRC. Producing the news on the French 
network costs on average $7,000 an hour, whereas the same 
thing on the English network costs $18,000. And yet, news are 
news, no matter the language.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	Comparing average drama production costs is just as 
shocking: $68,000 on the French network against $99,000 on its 
English counterpart. In spite of such disproportionate funding, 
which can only be due to cultural racism, CBC and the Société 
Radio-Canada have comparable audiences. With a BBM 
audience rating of 13.6 per cent, the Canadian Broadcasting 
Corporation reaches approximately 2.8 million viewers whereas 
the Société Radio-Canada, with a rating of 33 per cent, reaches 
an audience of 2.2 million. Therefore, such funding 
discrepancies between the two networks cannot be justified.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4451"> 4451 </A></B>
<P>
	Recently, the CBC bought the broadcasting rights for the 
Olympic Games in Atlanta for $28 million. Its competitors 
were offering $10 million. The corporation believes that it can 
sell $35 million worth of advertising, which experts in this area 
tend to doubt. Does the corporation intend to use its new line 
of credit to make up for any revenue shortfall? It is a question 
every citizen is wondering about.
<P>
	In view of such financial mismanagement, the Bloc 
Quebecois, on behalf of Canadian and Quebec taxpayers, wants 
the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to be accountable to 
Parliament for the use of its line of credit. That is the reason why 
we proposed an amendment which would make it compulsory 
for the corporation to explain to Parliament the purposes for 
which it plans to borrow money and its plans to repay the 
borrowed money. What sense is there in giving the corporation 
borrowing authority if it is unable to manage its affairs?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak today on part four of Bill C-17 which would 
grant borrowing authority to the CBC.
<P>
	I wish to address the several flaws inherent with this notion. 
First, the government has committed itself to a management and 
funding review of the CBC. Without waiting for the completion 
of this same review the government has remodelled funding for 
the CBC on two occasions.
<P>
	In the first instance this administration has reversed spending 
cuts announced by the previous Conservative government from 
$350 million to $250 million over four years. Meanwhile the 
government's budget includes a provision that a $25 million 
borrowing authority be awarded to the CBC in order to offer it 
more businesslike flexibility.
<P>
	I am very sceptical when it comes to assuming that the ability 
to borrow $25 million would accomplish efficient management 
not realized with $1.1 billion in appropriations from the 
Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	It really does baffle all logic that the government would call 
for a funding review in one instance while at the same time 
tampering with existing funding formulas.
<P>
	It is obvious to me that the provision to grant the corporation 
borrowing powers is premature based on the government's own 
announcement. From a practical standpoint it makes no sense 
whatsoever to allow the CBC to seek loans.
<P>
	The CBC is not like a business in the private sector. There are 
no shareholders or customers in the normal sense to answer to. 
There is no compelling obligation to strive for efficiency 
because there is no bottom line. In short, there is no need to 
worry about turning a profit, nor is the concept of bankruptcy a 
constant preoccupation.
<P>
	In this type of structure there is never a shortage of things on 
which to spend money. Permitting the CBC to borrow is more 
likely to enhance the national debt than corporate efficiency.
<P>
	The budget document suggests that the public broadcaster 
may be allowed to borrow an amount greater than $25 million 
with parliamentary approval. In effect the ceiling of $25 million 
is really a decoy. How did the government arrive at this figure? 
What measures will keep it from climbing to $50 million or 
$100 million? Who will be ultimately responsible for the debts 
incurred by the corporation?
<P>
<B>(1245 ) </B>
<P>
	The general trend is that when one includes clauses like these 
in legislation, there is a tempting desire and requirement to use 
them. The law of wasteful spending requires that unaccountable 
financial entities will spend any and all funds directed toward 
them without adherence to efficiency.
<P>
	While testifying as a witness before the Standing Committee 
on Canadian Heritage not long ago on April 12, CBC president 
Anthony Manera conceded that the corporation currently 
estimates a shortfall from all sources to be in the order of $180 
million over the next four years. The CBC has a $45 million 
deficit on operating budget on revenues of about $1.4 billion.
<P>
	It would be paramount that any business facing such a 
financial crisis first put its own house in order before assuming 
any further liabilities. Borrowing to reduce debt load is 
synonymous to using a Visa card to pay down a MasterCard. 
Even in a best case scenario, it would require shrewd 
investments and a commensurate amount of time and good luck 
for the CBC to realize economies of scale from its borrowing 
authority.
<P>
	Allowing an indebted company to accumulate further debts at 
the public's expense is poor management and it is morally 
irresponsible. The rationale behind the new borrowing power is 
supposedly to allow the corporation to make investments in 
systems and equipment that will result in long term savings.
<P>
	What are these investments? What are the risks involved? 
What is the projected return on investment? Who will be 
responsible if the investment fails? These questions demand 
answers before this request by the CBC can even be considered.
<P>
	It has also been suggested that a levy be raised on private 
broadcasters or cable subscriber fees be initiated to fund the 
CBC to the detriment of their competitors and the public. The 
crown corporation cannot have one hand in taxpayers' pockets 
and another in the marketplace, giving it the best of both worlds 
when there is no incentive to be cost effective or competitive.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4452"> 4452 </A></B>
<P>
	With respect to its mandate, the CBC is facing an abundance 
of difficulties. For example, the CBC English language 
television audience has been declining steadily since 1990-91. 
The viewership has declined to only a 13.3 per cent share of 
audience, which caused CRTC chairman Keith Spicer to remark 
to Mr. Manera at a recent licence renewal hearing: ``You are 
going down the tubes here in ratings. You are going down to 
oblivion''.
<P>
	What of the U.S. programming during prime time and a litany 
of U.S. soap operas from one until six in the day? How does the 
CBC explain the decline in arts programming, in children's 
programming since 1987? All of this combined with 
technological breakthroughs cause us to question the need for 
the existence of the CBC.
<P>
	Specialty channels and the electronic superhighway have 
become catch phrases of the 1990s. Is there a need for a public 
broadcaster when the public will have 500 channels to choose 
from offering a similar and cheaper product to the CBC? The 
CBC has jointly submitted a bid to operate one of these specialty 
channels under the name of Festival.
<P>
	Since Parliament has not changed its mandate, is it even 
appropriate for the CBC to establish and operate new television 
networks? One must also examine whether the CBC is 
undermining its current obligations by engaging in another 
channel bid. This relates both to its legally required 
programming as well as its management of scarce resources.
<P>
	In addition, it would be important to critically examine the 
program management and copycat production practices of the 
CBC. Canadians frequently criticize the Canadian style U.S. 
programs that find their way on to the air waves. Meanwhile the 
shifting around of ``Prime Time News'' from 10 p.m. to 9 p.m. 
only to have it return to its original time slot has diminished 
public confidence in the operation of the CBC.
<P>
	In the futile task of persistently propping up the CBC, there 
are some serious questions to consider with the prospect of 
borrowing money. Here are four issues which really demand 
answers. First, how will the CBC generate profits on its revenue 
in order to repay any loans it has incurred?
<P>
	Second, clause 19 of the bill states: ``Notwithstanding the 
Financial Administration Act, part VII of that act does not apply 
to a debt incurred by the corporation''. It is not clear after 
consulting the Financial Administration Act and the 
Broadcasting Act if the crown or the corporation would be 
ultimately responsible for the debts of the CBC.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	Third, what guidelines has the government established to the 
exercising of this borrowing authority?
<P>
	Fourth, why is the government allowing the CBC to borrow 
money in the first place? Would it not be more financially sound 
to privatize portions of its operations  and realize substantial 
savings which then may be used to finance new cost effective 
ventures?
<P>
	It is crystal clear that any attempt to revitalize the CBC using 
measures normally reserved for companies competing in the 
private marketplace undermines its integrity as a public 
broadcaster. Any special measures designed to raise capital for 
the CBC, such as loans, subscriber fees or licence fees, would be 
an unfair advantage should the CBC underbid its private 
counterparts for any services which it is given in addition to its 
heavy state sanctioned financing.
<P>
	These factors along with the changing technological 
landscape bring into question the relevant role of the CBC. It is 
for the reasons outlined above that our caucus will not be 
supporting this borrowing authority.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roger Simmons (Burin-St. George's):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I too would like to say a few words on Bill C-17. I will 
come in a moment specifically to section 18 which deals with 
the proposed amendment to the Broadcasting Act to grant CBC 
some borrowing authority from the consolidated revenue fund.
<P>
	First, the bill, in effect the budget implementation bill which 
flows from the budget of a couple of months ago, would seek to 
do a number of things. I am surprised, I say to my friend from 
Medicine Hat, that he did not spend a good amount of his speech 
lauding the bill because a lot of it goes straight to the issue of 
budget restraint which in some ways will be painful for various 
parts of the country, but necessarily painful because, as the 
Minister of Finance has said again and again and as the Prime 
Minister has said repeatedly, we are committed to getting our 
financial house in order and Bill C-17 goes a fair distance to 
doing that.
<P>
	In light of the comment made by my friend from Medicine 
Hat, let me come directly to the matter of the proposed 
amendment to the Broadcasting Act.
<P>
	This amendment would give to the CBC the businesslike 
flexibility which I submit is necessary for a billion dollar 
corporation by authorizing the CBC to be able to borrow up to a 
limit of $25 million from the consolidated revenue fund and 
from Canadian banking institutions through lines of credit, 
through commercial loans and the issuing of bonds or 
commercial paper.
<P>
	I believe this measure would represent an important step in 
our campaign to help the CBC by permitting it to become more 
efficient in operations and allowing the corporation to enter into 
other ventures acceptable to the government that provide a 
return on investment. It is perhaps in this context, I say to the 
member for Medicine Hat, that I find his objection most 
surprising. It is interesting to note that he did not say what he 
was going to do today. He said what his caucus was going to do.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4453"> 4453 </A></B>
<P>
	I say to my friend from Peace River, I assume that is another 
example of the free vote approach of that party. Now one stands 
up and says what the entire caucus will do. What happened to 
the free vote we used to have in that great party, that party that 
I have come to admire? Where is the leader today when I need 
him to answer on this particular issue of why suddenly he is 
allowing the member for Medicine Hat to muzzle a party of free 
voters?
<P>
	I digress. On the one hand the member for Medicine Hat 
decries the bill for allowing the CBC some borrowing authority 
but yet we hear them wax eloquently from time to time about 
how we ought to become more efficient as a government and as 
crown corporations. Again I say to him that we cannot really 
have it both ways, can we?
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	The funds that the bill would permit the CBC to borrow would 
be used only to generate operating savings. This idea that 
somehow it is going to go out and buy Lotto 649 tickets with it or 
somehow splurge-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> It might be a better investment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> In fairness, the member for Peace River 
interjects that it might be a better investment. I have to say to 
him in response that for a member of the Reform Party hope 
must spring eternal.
<P>
	These borrowed funds would be used to generate operating 
savings or for venture investments. The operating savings would 
come from investments in capital equipment and projects which 
have a payback of four years or less. At the present time the CBC 
is unable to take advantage of these opportunities due to its 
shortage of capital resources and the immediate need of 
addressing physical obsolescence in plants and equipment 
across the country.
<P>
	Perhaps a good example of how this proposed borrowing 
authority would help the CBC was the arrangement reached by 
the corporation to disaffiliate from its Pembroke, Ontario 
station and replace it with rebroadcasting towers at a capital cost 
of $2.2 million.
<P>
	The subsequent annual savings in payments to the affiliate 
less the cost of using the towers yielded net savings to the CBC 
of $374,000. As well the corporation earned an additional $1 
million in advertising revenue as a direct result of this 
disaffiliation in Pembroke. A capital investment of $2.2 million 
was repaid in under three years. That flexibility to undertake 
such initiatives is an indispensable tool for the CBC.
<P>
	It is worth reminding ourselves that under no circumstances 
would the CBC be permitted to use these borrowed funds to 
address an operational shortfall and thereby operate on deficit 
financing.
<P>
	I say to my friend from Medicine Hat, there is the answer to 
one of the questions he raised. If he listens to the debate he will 
get the answers to all these questions. We heard his questions. 
We not only heard them we had  anticipated them beforehand 
because these are some of the legitimate questions that need to 
be asked. Nobody has scored the member for Medicine Hat for 
being unthoughtful. He is very thoughtful about his questions 
but he rushes to judgment a little too quickly. He decides this is a 
bad thing before he has fully examined it. However I give him 
credit for at least knowing the questions to ask.
<P>
	I repeat to him that the CBC will not be allowed under any 
circumstances to use these borrowed funds to address 
operational shortfalls and thereby operate on deficit financing. 
It is not only a commitment of the government. It is a caveat that 
will be in the agreement that would be entered into between the 
government, the Minister of Finance on the one hand and the 
CBC on the other.
<P>
	The CBC's borrowing ceiling under this provision would be 
$25 million. A memorandum of understanding between the CBC 
and the Department of Finance would, as I have just said, set out 
the terms and the conditions governing the borrowing authority. 
Foremost among those conditions is that the CBC would require 
the approval of the Minister of Finance, in accordance with the 
established Department of Finance guidelines, for each 
transaction it undertook pursuant to this particular provision.
<P>
	We have heard again, particularly from my friends in the 
Reform Party, some concern about this issue. It is not surprising 
on the one hand because we know they are for the dismantling or 
the privatization of the CBC and I respect that point of view as a 
policy position. I do not agree with it myself and my party does 
not agree with it either but certainly I respect the point of view. 
It flies in the face of our position. It is diametrically opposed to 
what we believe on this issue. We see the CBC as a key national 
cultural institution.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	At the same time I cannot resist mentioning to my friends in 
the Reform Party that there is a bit of an inconsistency in their 
position in that we hear them so often talking about the 
importance of the businesslike approach. I believe the record, 
what we said on this issue, demonstrates that what we are trying 
to achieve here is a more businesslike approach for the CBC.
<P>
	Finally there have been concerns about adequate reporting to 
Parliament. This is addressed by the procedure under which the 
borrowing authority will be included in the corporate plan 
summary which the CBC is obliged to table annually in 
Parliament.
<P>
	In the context of the $1 billion crown corporation that we are 
talking about, the $25 million we are talking about is a relatively 
small amount. I submit the government is taking adequate 
safeguards to see that it is done in a reasonable manner.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane):</B> Madam Speaker, 
in Bill C-17, it is mentioned that the government can authorize a 
borrowing of $25 million. I wonder about that. Where will this 
money be spent? Will it be in large centres or rather in fringe 
areas?
<P>
	Madam Speaker, you know that in my region, in Matane, 
Rimouski and Sept-Iles, we have been terribly penalized. It is a 
sparsely populated rural area. When constituents are few, it 
seems that they can take everything away from you. It hurts us in 
the rural areas.
<P>
	How many of these millions will be used to restore television 
service in Rimouski, Matane and Sept-Iles? In our modern 
world, communications are extremely important. In my region, 
in small isolated parishes with nothing for 8, 10 or 15 kilometres 
around, people are beginning to speak out.
<P>
	Last Saturday, I attended a meeting of Urgence rurale in 
Saint-Marcellin, a small community of 300 inhabitants. For 
once, the people spoke for themselves instead of inviting Ph.Ds 
from the university. They were asked: ``What do you want in 
your region?'' They had stunning things to say. For the last 15 or 
20 years, these people have taken things into their own hands 
and almost made miracles with very modest, very minimal 
means. Their parish was supposed to be closed, but they reacted. 
They asked me why they no longer had services from 
Radio-Canada in Matane, Rimouski and Sept-Iles. They told 
me they had invited reporters to a meeting of Urgence rurale, but 
the CBC never bothered to cover their story. They were too 
small. Small parishes are not important for the CBC.
<P>
	Then, I asked myself: ``Where are these 25 million going to 
go?'' If none of it comes to our area there will be a serious 
problem. You must realize that there might be some political 
game involved. Duplessis used to say: ``The less people know, 
the more they will vote for me''. He had another saying: ``In 
Quebec, we have the best education system in the world''. Of 
course, it was not true then.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	Is our communication system threatened? If we cannot 
communicate with each other we will stay ignorant, and 
ignorance is the saddest and the most rotten thing in the world.
<P>
	We demand to be provided with CBC services. Today we do 
not have such services. We can still communicate of course, but 
we do it differently, we have to go through the telephone. This is 
a rather crude way, when television could really unite us.
<P>
	Our region includes the Magdalen Islands, Sept-Îles, Matane, 
Rimouski, and we cannot communicate with one another. As 
long as we are unable to talk to each other, the governments will 
be satisfied. Because we are isolated, we are almost islanders 
and this give us a  tremendous dynamism, although we cannot 
export it to the right places.
<P>
	As I was saying, the area of the Lower St. Lawrence, the area 
of Gaspe, the islands, the North shore, no longer has access to its 
own means of communication and this is painful.
<P>
	In order for people to develop a sense of self-worth and to 
understand one another and in order to raise their collective 
consciousness, communication is essential and the 
Radio-Canada television network is an excellent 
communication vehicle. If the government does not want to give 
money to Radio-Canada, then it should give it instead to 
Radio-Québec or to community television stations, because this 
money comes from the taxes Quebecers pay. It is their money to 
begin with. We could use this money to readily defend ourselves 
with dignity.
<P>
	Three stations were shut down and a decision was made to 
broadcast from the Quebec City station. I have nothing against 
this station. Quebec City reporters are undoubtedly very 
competent, but what do they know about our region? Do they 
know that there is no university in my riding? Do they know that 
there is only one CEGEP? What do they know about eastern 
Quebec or about the federal-provincial agreement? Absolutely 
nothing. Are Quebec City reporters familiar with the 
unemployment rate in the area ridings? Absolutely not. They 
deliver the evening news and they do a good job of it, but they 
know nothing at all about our region. Even if they want to be as 
objective as possible, quite often they are ignorant of local 
events and do not give a totally fair account of the facts.
<P>
	The ties that bind us together are being severed. In today's 
global village, we receive news from around the world. We 
receive an immediate account of events taking place in all 
countries abroad, whereas we have to wait two, three or four 
days, and sometimes even one week, before learning about the 
goings-on in our own backyard.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	Would you not agree that this is insulting and frustrating? The 
$25 million to be spent should be spent in the regions. I firmly 
believe this and I hope that my colleagues opposite understand 
the problems faced by rural communities. I hope that they will 
come to our defence because we too pay for a great many things 
in Canada through our taxes. However, we do not get our kick at 
the can as often as we should.

	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to speak in opposition to this portion or grouping of Bill

Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to borrow up to $25 
million, plus more by special legislation if necessary.
<P>

<P>

<P>
	When will the Liberal government and the country 
understand that this borrowed money is in fact debt capital and 
not equity capital which at the end of the day will simply 
increase the government's deficit?
<P>
	The government in this fiscal year will add $41 billion to the 
debt which will take it over the $550 billion mark. It is this debt 
and the interest to service the debt that have helped to create the 
recession and put 1.7 million Canadians out of work and forced 
countless businesses to close their doors.
<P>
	Why does the government continue to lend money it does not 
have? When will it face up to the reality that just as Canadians 
are forced to curtail spending so must the government?
<P>
	Unaccountable crown corporations like the CBC sail through 
these troubled times spending money believing that there is 
plenty more where that came from.
<P>
	In the finance department's March 16 news release regarding 
Bill C-17 the finance minister stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The act proposes to implement initiatives in support of our twin objectives of 
job creation and deficit reduction.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I put this question to all members of the House and all 
taxpayers watching this on TV: How can $25 million in 
borrowed money, in addition to the $1.1 billion of taxpayers' 
money that the CBC currently receives, possibly reduce the 
deficit? Is the CBC going to hire more people? Will the tax 
revenue from income create a profit for the government?
<P>
	This is a contradiction in terms. It is like saying the more 
money we spend the more money we will have in savings. The 
CBC is not a made for profit corporation. Therefore any amount 
of money that we give it will add to the deficit. It is a corporation 
whose ratings have dropped and the only way it generates any 
revenues at all is by playing U.S. produced shows which do not 
satisfactorily portray Canadian culture.
<P>
	It is this generosity with other people's money that creates the 
pie in the sky Liberal logic which takes the emphasis off the real 
problems in this country, high debt, high interest costs to service 
this debt and high taxes to pay for wasteful grants and subsidies.
<P>
	Liberal government members have said that 85 per cent of 
real jobs are created in the private sector. Therefore I submit 
they would do a better job creating long term, meaningful jobs 
with $1.1 billion in tax reduction rather than subsidizing the 
CBC with $1.1 billion.
<P>
	If the government truly wants to promote Canadian identity 
and pride, let the private sector create long term, meaningful 
jobs and put Canadians back to work. The government should 
regulate, administer, pass laws and defend borders, but stop 
interfering with the marketplace by endlessly funding crown 
corporations and short term job creation programs that benefit 
the few and not society as a whole.
<P>
	If the federal government sees a vital role for Canadian 
content on TV then regulate it, do not pay for it. Let the law of 
supply and demand dictate which shows stay on and which 
shows are cut.
<P>
	I believe it is time to consider a partial privatization of the 
CBC. The fact is that under the present situation Canadians are 
not watching.
<P>
	At a recent licence renewal hearing CRTC chairman Keith 
Spicer told reporters that CBC's English network saw its 
audience share dip to 13.5 per cent in 1992-93 from 15 per cent 
in 1990-91. Mr. Spicer went on to say: ``Your ratings are 
plummeting. They are falling like a rock''.
<P>
	This is a perfect example of what happens when companies 
lack a competitive atmosphere. There is less incentive and lower 
overall quality of the product. Private sector companies in this 
position have shut their doors and have closed forever. This is 
not the case, however, with the CBC which has guaranteed 
government backing. With Bill C-17 it will have yet another 
option to borrow.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	When will the government acknowledge that it is in fact part 
of the problem and not the solution? When will the government 
stop the unlimited funding of the CBC? When will the 
government create the atmosphere and environment for 
investment and stop making investments with money that it does 
not have? The private sector understands this. It is time that 
cabinet ministers did too.
<P>
	Private sector growth generates confidence and opportunity. 
It sends a message to investors that this country is able and 
willing to compete.
<P>
	The Liberal government should send a message to foreign and 
domestic investors, lenders and businesses that Canada 
welcomes competition in a fair marketplace, free from 
government interference, subsidies and grants. This signal alone 
would bring in equity capital for businesses and the government 
could get out of businesses it knows nothing about such as the 
CBC, Petro-Canada and Canada Post.
<P>
	The CBC presently pays millions of dollars to broadcast 
American comedies. Mr. Spicer stated: ``The network is merely 
tinkering with this direction in the face of crisis''. Where is the 
accountability or the justification?
<P>
	As a businessman I know that corporations both public and 
private over time begin to lose their overall objectives. Perhaps 
Mr. Spicer's quote is an indication that the CBC has itself moved 
away from its original objective of providing quality Canadian 
programs, promoting Canadian culture and talent.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4456"> 4456 </A></B>
<P>
	Privatization of the CBC in whole or in part would, as Mr. 
Spicer said, force the company off the road to oblivion without 
a rescue plan.
<P>
	With privatization the performance of the CBC would be 
subject to market rules with market benefits and market 
sanctions. Even partial privatization would reduce the deficit 
and still maintain jobs. Time and again private corporations 
have proven that they can operate more efficiently and 
effectively than crown corporations. A dollar spent in the 
private sector requires three dollars for the same service in the 
public sector.
<P>
	At risk money motivates, government money obligates but it 
obligates the wrong people, the taxpayers, without enough say. 
Decisions in the private sector must be made quickly to take 
advantage of investment opportunities as they arise. Companies 
that make these decisions subsequently suffer or gain from the 
consequences. Crown corporations have long been criticized for 
their inability to make these decisions. It is largely due to the 
lack of incentive, motivation and accountability because the 
government acts as a safety net.
<P>
	Who gets fired if a costly program never airs? Who ever hears 
about it? Who ultimately pays for the extravagance and the 
errors?
<P>
	Government involvement gives these corporations a kind of 
financial longevity that corporations in the private sector do not 
have. Therefore the longevity becomes a burden to taxpayers. 
This promotes unfair competition within industry sectors, those 
who have to answer to shareholders and those who have an 
endless supply of taxpayers' money.
<P>
	Privatization would also improve the government's financial 
position. Selling assets would allow this government to reduce 
its monetary requirements for the year, which for this year will 
be $41 billion, and repay part of our accumulated debt of over 
$516 billion.
<P>
	Privatization in whole or in part of the CBC, not $25 million 
in borrowing authority, would help the government truly meet 
the so-called twin objectives of the finance minister of job 
creation and deficit reduction.
<P>
	As of eleven o'clock this morning, the Doomsday clock 
calculated the national debt at $516,293,742,299.79. Since 11

$1,473.50 per second with a debt per taxpayer of $36,730.20.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):</B> Madam Speaker, 
Bill C-17 is an omnibus bill dealing with a wide range of 
subjects, from unemployment insurance to Western grain 
transportation and Atlantic region freight assistance, including 
a line of credit for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	In fact, Bill C-17 affects directly or indirectly 16 acts of 
Parliament, that is 11 directly and another 5 indirectly. This goes 
to show the lack of transparency of the federal  government, in 
spite of its campaign promises to that effect.
<P>
	Bill C-17 typifies the lack of will to be open on the part of the 
federal government, by bunching various acts together and 
asking the House to vote on them as a whole. There are many 
good things in Bill C-17 and some bad ones. I am totally 
opposed of course, to the planned unemployment insurance 
reductions in view of how severe the unemployment situation is 
in Canada.
<P>
	As for the $25 million line of credit extended to the Canadian 
Broadcasting Corporation, I would like to focus on this aspect of 
Bill C-17 for the next 10 minutes. We cannot object to the CBC 
having a $25 million line of credit. Many reasons can be 
provided in support of the CBC. The hon. member for 
Burin-St. George's mentioned earlier ``the intention is to put 
the financial house in order''.
<P>
	There are several other reasons, including perhaps acquisition 
of new equipment or restructuring. The problem is not so much 
the line of credit as the matter of control. How will we know how 
this $25 million will be spent and on what? And how will it be 
repaid? That the problem. If this government was concerned 
about transparency, it would make sure this $25 million loan 
will be subjected to the scrutiny of this place, like all CBC 
expenditures. Even a blind person could see that there is 
mismanagement at the CBC.
<P>
	Here a few examples of mismanagement at the CBC that 
basically reflect the essence of this government. There is 
financial mismanagement in government in general. It is 
particularly obvious at the CBC. And we parliamentarians 
cannot examine the particulars of CBC expenditures. It would 
seem that the corporation has no business plan, but if it ever did, 
it was shelved a long time ago. Recently however, this 
mismanagement has being causing serious problems. While this 
government is taking money out of the pockets of the 
unemployed and away from seniors in their tax credits, it seems 
ready to tolerate blatant squandering on the part of the Canadian 
Broadcasting Corporation.
<P>
	I would even dare to ask questions on the fact that the CBC 
increasingly seems to favour the English-language network at 
the expense of its French-language counterpart. On the subject 
of mismanagement, that is quite obvious. Did you know that 
since 1984, 10 years ago, about 2,000 jobs have been cut at the 
CBC? Rather drastic cuts were made, for instance, in regional 
production. In 1990-91, regional production was cut by $46 
million.
<P>
	The Minister of Canadian Heritage even announced very 
recently that another $100 million would be cut over five years. 
While experiencing major cuts, layoffs, job losses and service 
cuts in the regions, the CBC has increased its share of the 
advertising market.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4457"> 4457 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	Between 1979 and 1992, the CBC increased its share of the 
advertising market from 15 per cent to 25 per cent, nearly 
doubling its market share in 10 or 15 years. Its revenues have 
therefore doubled or increased considerably.
<P>
	Despite drastic cuts in the staff budget and a growing share of 
the advertising market, CBC's deficit continues to climb. From 
1992 through 1995, CBC's deficit was absorbed by the 
employee pension fund surplus. This deficit is expected to reach 
$41 million in 1995-96 and CBC itself predicts that it will 
increase to $78 million by 1998-99. My God, what is wrong at 
the CBC?
<P>
	We have serious questions on the operation and management 
of the CBC. It is obviously poorly managed, there is no control. 
It is a little like the federal government: a kind of ship sinking in 
the middle of the ocean.
<P>
	All we ask for on this side of the House is not necessarily to 
object to CBC's line of credit because CBC is, of course, an 
important network with top-notch reporters and expertise we 
want to keep. We do not necessarily object to this line of credit, 
but we would still like to have the power, as parliamentarians, to 
see where this money goes and why the deficit keeps growing 
despite the cuts and CBC's bigger share of the advertising 
market.
<P>
	It is a basic request, and if the federal government really cared 
about transparency, it would grant it to us. But it will not do so, 
of course, because its majority will enable it to pass this bill 
regardless of the good reasons to improve it.
<P>
	The cuts are serious. For example, I just told you that in 
1991-92, CBC's budget was cut by $108 million. Did you know 
that it cost $129 million to cut this $108 million? The 
reorganization, that is, all the services put in place to implement 
the cuts, costs $29 million more than the cuts themselves.
<P>
	The fact that CBC's production costs rose by $177 million 
from 1988 to 1993 leads me to believe that this mismanagement 
on the part of the CBC- In fact, if I had more time, I could have 
shown you that money has been transferred to the 
English-language network at the expense of the 
French-language network.
<P>
	In any case, in conclusion, we on this side would certainly like 
to have the right, as parliamentarians, to review the use of this 
$25 million line of credit to the CBC.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> On the same motion, I 
recognize the hon. member for Témiscamingue.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Madam Speaker, it is no insult 
for me to be called the member for Témiscamingue, but I will let 
him speak for himself shortly.
<P>
	I am pleased to speak on the third part of the omnibus bill 
concerning the CBC's borrowing authority. As my colleagues 
just said, the Bloc Quebecois is not here to gum up the works. 
The Bloc Quebecois presented a motion for more openness in 
the management of the CBC, but since we are good managers 
too, we understand that the Crown corporation needs borrowing 
authority to be able to operate. Whether this borrowing is on a 
line of credit or they have to acquire more assets to finance new 
things, we will support it.
<P>
	What bothers us, though, is the lack of openness in CBC 
management. Although management has done certain things and 
revenue is rising and some things are being cut, they still have a 
deficit. It is a structural deficit and it is like a cancer constantly 
eating away at the CBC.
<P>
	Why am I talking about cancer, Madam Speaker? It makes me 
think of a loss we had in the Gaspé. As a result of this lack of 
openness and this unwillingess to listen to the people, the CBC 
closed three television stations in our region, in Sept-Iles, 
Rimouski and Matane.
<P>
	I am criticizing it for lack of openness; it is as though the 
government asked or allowed the corporation to do its dirty 
work. ``You be the one to do it.'' It is as though they wanted to 
cut the means of communication of people in eastern Quebec, 
especially in the Gaspé peninsula.
<P>
	This time, we might say that the government is a little 
ashamed to come and borrow money itself. It is telling the CBC 
to go and do it this time. I am sorry; as long as Quebecers are in 
this federation and part of Canada, we pay taxes and we have a 
say.
<P>
	They took from us what was our pride, that is our means of 
communication. Now, we are asked to close our eyes and to say: 
``Okay, you will allow CBC to borrow up to $25 million'', but 
we will not be allowed to knowthing any more. The purpose of 
this motion is precisely to make sure that we know what will be 
done with that money, and particularly how CBC intends to 
repay such loans because, as I said, as long as Quebec remains 
part of Canada, we will have to pay part of that loan and part of 
the deficit. We can argue later about what that part will be. In the 
meantime, however, as long as we are here, we will ask for 
greater transparency.
<P>
	Canadians and Quebecers certainly deserve some 
explanations from the Parliament of Canada. People can 
understand. They are not dummies, to use a common expression, 
and this is demonstrated by the fact that news and information 
programs get the best ratings. People want to understand what is 
going on. They want to know what is happening and, as a 
parliamentary institution, the House must be receptive. But I do 
not think it was receptive enough in the past.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4458"> 4458 </A></B>
<P>
	We are concerned by the fact that the government is prepared 
to give a blank cheque to the corporation, without knowing 
what it will do with the money. If I was told that the corporation 
needs authority to borrow $25 million because, following the 
mistake made by closing regional TV stations, it now has to 
recapitalize regions and part of that $25 million would be used 
to that end, I would say fine, because I would at least know what 
is going on. But here we are only told: ``We borrow $25 
million''. What will those millions be used for? This evening, 
some people will listen to the parliamentary channel, since they 
do not always hear directly from their MP on the local news.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	So this evening, they will hear their own member, the member 
for Gaspé, say that he wishes the Canadian Broadcasting 
Corporation would seriously consider reopening the regional 
stations it closed down, which was a big mistake; that it would 
indicate, as any good manager would, how the $25 million 
would be spent; and that we as parliamentarians could see how 
the money is allocated.
<P>
	If the CBC's requests were sufficiently detailed and included 
the proper justification, the Bloc québécois would be among the 
first to say: Well, your request is very reasonable, and since your 
$25 million authority is not sufficient, we would be willing to 
increase it. But you must understand our concern. A blank 
cheque for $25 million is out of the question. This is 1994, and 
the public has a right to know.
<P>
	Why this emphasis? I referred to the stations that were closed, 
and I said that we would agree to give them the $25 million 
borrowing authority they want, but the problem is lack of 
transparency.
<P>
	I would be the first to acknowledge the excellence of the 
performers on Radio-Canada. We all have our favourites. We 
have Marylin who discusses municipal politics at 7 p.m., and we 
have newscasters like Bernard Derome. I think we can say that 
Quebecers, and I imagine Canadians generally are like that, 
enjoy a variety of programs. They want entertainment but they 
want the news. I realize that getting the news costs money. 
Through these administrative measures, Parliament enable the 
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to fulfil the mandate it was 
given by Parliament. However, as far as news programming is 
concerned, people in the Gaspé and Eastern Townships, and I 
said this before, feel left out.
<P>
	Today, we get local news bulletins from Quebec City. I do not 
mind getting the Quebec City news, because I have some good 
friends in Quebec City, including the members for the local 
ridings, but news from these areas is not as interesting as our 
own local news. That kind is just as important. I am sure, 
Madam Speaker, if you had to listen to the local news from the 
Gaspé, you would say: What a wonderful region! But you would 
not be as interested in the local news from that area. Oh, sure, at  
the end of the news bulletin they give you two or three minutes 
worth about your own community, but that is not much. And in 
our case, that is what happen.
<P>
	And that is why, as a member of the Bloc québécois, I wanted 
to say in the House today that from a manager's point of view, I 
agree that the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation needs 
management tools. However, I am outraged at the lack of 
transparency in the government's proposals, and I want to make 
it clear that if all Canadians are supposed to be involved, I think 
we should not forget that the people in the Eastern Townships 
and the Gaspé are very upset about the fact that their regional 
stations were closed, and if the government wants to convince 
me that the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation has come of 
age, then it should do something about correcting these 
mistakes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to expand on what my colleague was 
saying. As a member for the same area I also wonder, when I see 
that the CBC is being allowed to borrow, what they are going to 
borrow for? We have been burnt before.
<P>
	Just think that $46 million were cut when regional stations 
were closed, 100 specialized jobs in communications and radio 
and television were abolished, but at the same time $61 million 
were added to the networks. There is some imbalance there.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	After that experience we wonder: ``If this was done in the 
past, and if we now add this borrowing power, what are they 
going to do with the money?''
<P>
	The next Olympic Games, in Atlanta in 1996, are another 
good example. CBC submitted a tender for $28 million. This is a 
totally unacceptable overbidding if you consider that TVA had 
offered $10 million for the same coverage.
<P>
	Is the $18 million difference going to come from money it 
borrows? Is it what is going to be used to pay a somewhat 
inflated price to cover an event which, after all, will only last a 
short period of time, whereas the cuts which are depriving our 
regions of adequate coverage will last all year long?
<P>
	I would willingly trade three weeks of Games in Atlanta for a 
TV station in Eastern Quebec and on the North Shore, which 
would provide year-round coverage and would allow us to know 
how our own people are managing, how they are coming to grips 
with the situation and how they see their future.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4459"> 4459 </A></B>
<P>
	You will not be surprised then to learn that what the Bloc 
Quebecois is asking is that this new borrowing authority be 
transparent. We know that for the past few years, the Canadian 
Broadcasting Corporation has been presenting its business plan 
to the minister, but we have never seen such business plans in 
this House. The CBC does not produce canned goods. It is a 
corporation with a Canada-wide communication mandate.
<P>
	Consequently, one would expect that it should be accountable 
to the Canadian Parliament for the manner in which it carries out 
its business, not with a view to censuring it, but rather to see how 
it spends its money. Now is the time to start doing it, especially 
regarding the use the Corporation is going to make of its new 
borrowing authority.
<P>
	How is it going to spend this $25 million plus interests? Will it 
be for projects Canadians and Quebecers generally approve of? 
Will these projects provide better service to the people in 
Quebec and in Canada, or will they be like the icing on the cake, 
something extra for areas which already receive service?
<P>
	So, I think it is important to know how this money will be 
spent. In fact, we are very concerned about the openness of this 
process, all the more so given the estimated deficits of the CBC. 
Despite cuts made especially in regional stations over the last 
few years, the estimated deficit should reach $41 million in 
1995-1996; $54 million in 1996-1997; $65 million in 
1997-1998; and $78 million in 1998-1999.
<P>
	So, if this borrowing authority is going to increase the deficit 
without improving the service, I do not see how we can support 
such decisions. We want to see the CBC budget and we want to 
know in what direction the CBC is going, how it intends to spend 
the money and mostly how it will manage to provide services in 
Quebec and in Canada to ensure the public gets adequate 
information.
<P>
	Let me give you an example. Two weeks ago, I was asked to 
act as commissioner during community hearings held by Rural 
Dignity and an organization set up to maintain the train service 
in Chaleur, in the Gaspé Peninsula.
<P>
	The newspaper coverage we got was quite interesting. 
However, the television coverage was not so good, not because 
the technicians, communications experts and announcers in 
Eastern Quebec are not capable, but because when you have only 
two or three reporters to cover such a large territory as ours, that 
is thousands and thousands of kilometres, it is obvious that you 
cannot provide the same adequate service as if you had regional 
stations.
<P>
	That shows the extent of social disintegration that can occur if 
we do not have a communication network which the people in 
the regions can relate to and identify with. You can be sure that 
we will never renege on our commitment to provide adequate 
television services.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	And since the closing, we are taking steps to make sure that 
the services will be offered once again and that we can have in 
our region some experts, some people who can provide the 
adequate broadcasting for the people within the region as well as 
elsewhere.
<P>
	So, indeed, we could say that the borrowing authority of the 
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation is relevant, as for any other 
business that may have to borrow money at a given time. But, in 
order to get that money, that business must prove to us that, 
indeed, it is using the funds in an adequate and fair manner and 
is also fulfilling its mandate, which is to provide 
communications throughout Canada.
<P>
	We must get away from the image left to us by the previous 
Conservative government which, whether in the case of VIA 
Rail, Post Canada or the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, 
decided to define the mandate of these national corporations as 
if they were private companies, when their mandate should 
reflect the realities of the country as a whole.
<P>
	In that context, we would like to make the government aware 
of the fact that, if the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation has a 
borrowing authority, the uses of the amounts provided for by 
that authority, whether in the form of credit lines or other, 
should be tabled here in the House.
<P>
	I hope that government members will be sensitive to this 
amendment and will vote with us to make sure that, at least, we 
know where our money is going.

	He said: Madam Speaker, I wish to explain to the House once 
more the reason for our motions. We are opposed to the 
government's use of an omnibus bill to implement the budget 
rather than introducing separate bills for each act it proposes to 
change.
<P>
	Today I would like to comment specifically on the changes to 
the Unemployment Insurance Act. I spoke to Bill C-17 on April 
14 during second reading stage. At that time I said that the 
Reform Party was generally in favour of the changes to the UI 
Act, but argued that the government did not go far enough with 
its amendments. Even though we think that further improve-
<P>

<B><A NAME="4461"> 4461 </A></B>
<P>
ments to the unemployment insurance provisions could have 
been made, we are prepared to vote in favour of the UI changes.
<P>
	However, there are other changes in Bill C-17 which we 
cannot support, such as the CBC borrowing authority 
provisions. Therefore, in order to register our opposition to 
certain legislation contained in the bill, we have to vote against 
the whole bill.
<P>
	How do we express our views and the views of our 
constituents when we are forced to vote yea or nay to a block of 
legislation with such diverse concerns? How can we do that? 
Dividing the bill logically into its various components would 
facilitate the democratic process. It would also allow for 
meaningful votes based on the analysis and voter reaction of 
each part of the bill.
<P>
	That is the reason for our motion. We are not trying to be 
obstructionists; we are being practical. We want the procedures 
of the House to be understood by the voters. An omnibus bill is 
not a common sense way of doing things. People sent us here to 
bring common sense ideas to Parliament. I think the voters 
would agree with our position on omnibus bills and the motions 
we have introduced today.
<P>
	I would like now to specifically address each of the changes to 
Bill C-17 that we would implement in respect of the 
Unemployment Insurance Act. I am going to comment on these 
as I go along.
<P>
	First, the bill would roll back UI premiums for 1995 and 1996 
to $3 for every $100 in insurable earnings, down from $3.07. 
The Reform Party generally supports this measure but would ask 
the government to consider further reductions in payroll taxes. 
If jobs are created by doing this, why not find other ways to 
reduce payroll taxes?
<P>
	Second, the bill will reduce UI benefits to 55 per cent of 
insurable earnings, down from 57 per cent. The Reform Party 
supports this measure but would ask the government to further 
reduce benefits to bring them in line with benefits paid by other 
OECD countries and to lessen dependency on the system.
<P>
	Third, the bill will increase the benefits for those UI claimants 
with low earnings and with dependants to 60 per cent of 
insurable earnings, up from 57 per cent. The Reform Party 
supports this measure because it states: ``to target payments to 
those people who are most in need''. That should be the aim of 
our social program.
<P>
	Fourth, the bill will increase the minimum amount of time a 
person needs to qualify for UI from 10 weeks-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member of course will have ample 
time at the end of question period to take up where he left off.
<P>
	It being 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 30(5), the House 
will now proceed to Statements by Members pursuant to 
Standing Order 31.

	<B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
ethanol is being presented as a subsidized gasoline additive 
offering environmental benefits.
<P>
	However, the United States energy department earlier this 
month revealed that an assessment study of ethanol showed that 
the losses outweigh the gains, taking into consideration the 
money spent and pollution created in production and 
distillation. In fact ethanol will produce negligible if any 
benefits for air quality.

serious problems have undermined the credibility of the process 
to review, on compassionate grounds, cases in which refugee 
status was denied. Although the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration has been aware of these problems since March, 
there has been a steady stream of deportations without any 
particular show of concern by the minister.
<P>

compassion, it is arbitrary and it puts in jeopardy the lives of 
hundreds of people deported to their country of origin where 
human rights violations are the order of the day.

observes its international obligations or whether it is taking an

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the minister of heritage. In a 
submission today to the official languages committee, the 
Fédération des communautés francophones et acadienne points 
to the urgent need to adopt a comprehensive policy for the 
development of Canada's Francophonie. The federation is of the 
opinion that the lack of a comprehensive policy is preventing the 
federal government from fulfilling its responsibilities under the 
Official Languages Act.
<P>
	My question is as follows: Does the minister recognize the 
urgency of the situation and the need to implement immediately 
a comprehensive policy for the development of Canada's 
francophonie, given that the federation is arguing today that the 
absence of such a policy is the reason for the failed 
interdepartmental co-operation effort and for the relaxation in 
the application of the Official Languages Act?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to report that such a policy is on the 
drawing board. A great deal has already been accomplished and 
we will continue to meet our legal obligations in the area of 
official languages.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, here is a government that has been in power for six 
months and, in the face of an emergency, responds that the 
policy is on the drawing board. That will not do.
<P>
	How can the minister not commit immediately to adopting in 
the coming weeks a general, comprehensive policy on the 
development of La Francophonie? According to the federation, 
which proclaims the urgency of the situation, ``the rate of 
assimilation is increasing and the socioeconomic situation is 
deteriorating''.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition does not seem to have 
paid close attention to our actions in recent months. We have 
increased grants to La Francophonie in different parts of 
Canada. School governance has been spared budget cuts. We 
have negotiated and are continuing to negotiate a whole series of 
agreements with minority groups and provincial governments. 
If the Leader of the Opposition would like a list of our 
achievements, I would be delighted to provide him with one.

since today, it has sounded the alarm.
<P>
	Will the minister commit today to establishing the central 
federal agency which the federation is demanding to put an end 
to the process of assimilation which, and I quote, ``is having a 
devastating impact on these communities''?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, clearly, we have not spoken to the same persons. The 
Leader of the Opposition is getting his information from

Offenders Act will be introduced before the summer recess. 
Including today, there are 21 legislative days left in this session.
<P>
	Will the minister tell the House precisely when these 
amendments will be introduced and, even more important, when 
the minister expects to see them actually passed into law?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government remains on 
track. As we said from the outset we intend to introduce during 
June changes to the Young Offenders Act. I expect if we have the 
co-operation of all parties we can enact them into law very 
quickly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there are specific changes which could be made 
quickly and easily to the Young Offenders Act. For example, the 
age parameters of the act could be reduced from the current 12 to 
18 years to a proposed 10 to 16 years.
<P>
	My colleague from New Westminister-Burnaby recently put 
this proposal forward in the form of an opposition motion but it 
was defeated by both the government and the Official 
Opposition.
<P>
	Why is the minister reluctant to respond decisively to the 
demands of Canadians by immediately introducing specific 
amendments to the Young Offenders Act which after 
consultation with the House leaders could be passed before the 
summer recess?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, the decisiveness of the 
government will be shown with the legislation we will bring 
forward here. But as I have made clear to the House on past 
occasions, we intend to deal with the Young Offenders Act in 
two ways. First, is the introduction of the legislation that will 
contemplate specific changes and which we are going to ask this 
House to consider for immediate implementation.
<P>
	Second, I am going to turn over the statute in its entirety to the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs with a request 
that in this the 10th year of its operation that statute be looked at 
thoroughly from one end to the other, that the committee hear 
witnesses, hear the concerns of Canadians, speak to those most 
affected by this legislation and decide once and for all whether 
in current circumstances the Young Offenders Act remains the 
best model for juvenile justice for Canada.
<P>
	Those are the two steps we are taking. The first is a bill for 
specific changes at the outset and, second, a thorough review in 
the course of the coming months through the standing 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr.

speculation that the Liberal government may be issuing the 
same hollow promises.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
The statements made by the Auditor General of Canada confirm 
that the Minister of Human Resources Development has 
launched a reform of social programs without the information 
required to make a real diagnosis. The Auditor General also 
deplored the lack of co-operation between Ottawa and the 
provinces.
<P>
	Does the minister admit, as the Auditor General points out, 
that he has launched a reform of social programs before he was 
ready and that his haste can only be explained by his eagerness 
to meet the budget requirements of the finance minister, who has 
found no better way to reduce his deficit than to make the 
poorest people pay?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification): </B>Mr. Speaker, I would like to reply to the hon. 
member by quoting the Auditor General himself. He said, ``I 
find nothing wrong with his approach''. The answer is clear. The 
Auditor General does not have a problem with our approach. He 
asked for other assessments and I agree with him. That is why 
we have an agreement with all the provinces to exchange 
information on social programs.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, given that 
this reform of social programs is not included in the red book, 
that the Liberals did not bother to get the information at that 
time and that they are not mandated to carry out this reform, 
does the minister admit that the reform must be based on the full 
satisfaction of the provinces and that they must therefore be 
closely  involved in the process, unlike what has been done so 
far?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the last week we have had a 
report from Statistics Canada based upon a very substantial 
evaluation showing that the unemployment insurance system 
has a very strong impact upon the way jobs are created in this 
country, a detrimental impact.
<P>
	We have had a major report from the Centre for Policy 
Alternatives based upon two studies of economists in Quebec 
saying that there is a substantial cost to unemployment in the 
country. We received a report just yesterday from the Family 
Planning Council in Toronto which says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Unless we develop innovative programs to ensure that young families do not 
become outsiders, Canada's future is truly endangered.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	There were three specific reports in the last week that point to 
the fundamental need to reform our social programs. Our 
mandate comes from people who are concerned about the future 
of this country, not the opposite side who have no concern about 
Canada.

question is for the Minister of Health.
<P>
	Last week the four western premiers jointly requested that one 
of the 10 premiers should co-chair the upcoming forum on 
health care with the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Health care is a provincial responsibility and the provinces 
pick up the large bulk of the health care tab. On this basis, does 
the Minister of Health agree that the premiers deserve better 
access not only to health care but also to decision making and 
that one of the premiers should co-chair this important 
upcoming meeting?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am quite pleased to answer the hon. member's request.
<P>
	The national forum on health is meant to be an advisory body 
to the Prime Minister and to this government. However there is a 
place for the ministers of health both federally and provincially 
to discuss matters and to make decisions. There is also a place 
for premiers to meet, discuss and make decisions.
<P>
	We certainly are not in any way wishing to take away the 
powers of the premiers as they meet and discuss issues nor do we 
want to take away the decision making process of the ministers 
of health.
<P>

	The national forum on health will look at long term issues

minister of health care.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> I have a supplementary 
question, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	On Tuesday the Minister of Health said that she was forced to 
withhold health care funds from B.C. because she had a duty to 
enforce the Canada Health Act.
<P>
	Another provision of that act the federal government 
conveniently ignores is its commitment in that act for funding 
for 50 per cent of health and health care costs. At present the 
federal government funds less than 35 per cent of those total 
costs.
<P>
	Could the minister explain why she vigorously enforces some 
portions of the Canada Health Act while conveniently allowing 
the federal government to ignore its commitment under that act 
to funding 50 per cent of all health care costs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would suggest that the hon. member look more closely at the 
Canada Health Act. The Canada Health Act has five principles. 
It does not mention a percentage of funding.
<P>
	During the last election as part of our red book we clearly 
stated that we supported the principles of the Canada Health Act 
and yes, we stood by them, unlike the party across the way which 
during the last election made absolutely no mention of the fact 
that it was in favour of extra billing and a two tier health system.
<P>

would be very advantageous to anyone who fears that.''

contacted?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
now have a commission of inquiry on blood. This commission is

That is what we are doing and we very much look forward to

guidelines and we will consider the issue within that timeframe.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond):</B> Mr. Speaker, those 
infected with Hepatitis C are victims of the worst negligence in 
the history of Canada's health care system and 75 per cent of 
them still do not know that they are infected.
<P>
	Despite what the official in charge of the Bureau of Biologics 
in her department said, does the minister know that there is a 
treatment to help carriers of Hepatitis C and that this fully 
justifies her taking immediate action to reach these people?

<P>
	Yesterday the Senate approved amendments to Bill C-18 to

indicated that one of the problems with the current process was 
the lack of supervision of the independent, non-partisan

the government supports the concept of an independent arm's

<P>
	We have said however that the process for doing this has not 
been thoroughly reviewed since it was created in 1964 and that

at a cost of over $5 million.
<P>
	Surely killing the process is not a serious priority for this 
government. Could the Acting Prime Minister assure the House 
that the only reason left for stopping this redistribution again 
would be to follow the suggestion of my party echoed by the 
Minister of National Revenue that the number of seats in the 
House of Commons be capped or reduced?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the suggestion of the hon. member is one that deserves to be 
looked at by the House of Commons procedure committee.
<P>
	Before one makes a decision on that, one has to consider the 
impact of capping or reducing the number of seats on the 
expectations of people in certain parts of Ontario where 
populations have grown and the expectations of people in the 
province of British Columbia where populations have grown for

that he may have misspoken.
<P>
	Let me reassure you by saying that we take a real interest in 
this issue. However, as I said before in this House, it must be 
understood that medical treatments always involve some risks. 
Nothing is 100 per cent sure. It goes without saying that if 
people think they are suffering from side-effects, they should 
see a doctor. This is my opinion. In the meantime, we are

<P>
	Interprovincial trade barriers are costing Canadians as much 
as $7 billion and many are losing economic opportunities while 
the discussions drag on. Some provinces are co-operating and 
some are making it difficult to remove costly barriers for other 
Canadians.
<P>
	Could the minister tell the House what he is doing to get the 
co-operation of all provinces and to meet the June deadline for 
an agreement?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member for Edmonton East raises a very important issue which I 
think most Canadians find quite astonishing, that while Canada 
has entered into international trade agreements it has failed to 
find a way to reduce interprovincial trade barriers which in some 
ways would not be permitted in our relations with other 
countries.
<P>
	I am pleased to advise the House that progress is being made. 
A great deal of effort is being put into this project by ministers 
who are members of the committee of ministers on internal 
trade, ministers from all provinces and the territories, as we 
work toward the June 30 deadline.
<P>
	Given the commitment that is being made on the part of all 
provinces, there is a very good prospect it will succeed in having 
a broad based and worthwhile framework agreement together 
with comprehensive chapters in a number of areas, a number of 
sectors, which will provide a good base for continuing progress 
in this issue.

action being taken by Ontario in light of the results of the

	It is becoming apparent that the mandate and operation of the

General have all demanded changes to CIDA. We hear reports 
and we read all the time that CIDA's mandate may even be at 
cross purposes with the humanitarian objectives of Canadians.
<P>
	Will the minister bring in enabling legislation so that 
Parliament, not cabinet, can debate and eventually direct 
CIDA's mandate?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, CIDA has a very clear mandate, 
one of sustainable development in developing countries.
<P>
<B>(1445 ) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member knows very well because he was at the 
meeting this morning. The Canadian Council for International 
Co-Operation appeared before the joint committee on foreign 
policy and it praised CIDA for providing a very enviable 
reputation in many countries where it is doing work.
<P>
	The hon. member also knows we are now going through an in 
depth review of foreign policy, including foreign aid, defence 
and other issues. Any recommendations the member has should 
be made to the joint committee on foreign affairs which may 
consider some of his recommendations. However it would have 
to be an agreement of the foreign affairs standing committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, part of 
the problem is that Parliament does not have an opportunity to 
give direction to CIDA because it is a creation of cabinet and is 
not under the direction of this House of Commons.
<P>
	In order to reassure CIDA management, Canadian NGOs and 
the Canadian people, will the minister bring in that enabling 
legislation to refocus CIDA's mandate on the truly needy people 
of the world?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will pass the hon. member's 
question on to the minister. Again the hon. member knows the 
forum to which to take such a recommendation.
<P>
	I would not agree with the hon. member when he says that 
CIDA is not accountable to Parliament. The Auditor General 
just did an in depth audit of CIDA programs, specifically in 
three Asian countries. He gave CIDA a glowing report.
<P>
	There is accountability. No one more than the workers in 
CIDA are conscious of getting the best for the Canadian tax 
dollar. They know how hard it is to collect that dollar and they 
spend that dollar very wisely. They look at their objectives and 
the programs that would meet those objectives. The hon. 
member must know that before a program is implemented the 
local provincial governments are consulted, as are the NGO 
people.

contract. This firm is desperately trying to convert to civilian

dragging his feet with respect to compensation for those 
businesses which were penalized by the cancellation of the 
helicopter contract, is threatening the very survival of several of 
them, including AVCORP?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
believe that the government made it perfectly clear, when it 
announced the cancellation of the helicopter contract, that there 
would be no compensation for the companies involved, except 
for contracts between the government and those companies.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It was quite clear and the Leader of the Opposition should try 
to understand there was no offer of compensation outside the 
contracts. The contracts are being settled by the process of 
negotiation and perhaps legal proceedings.
<P>
	On the broader issue of defence conversion, we have 
discussed that in this House many times. There are many 
elements to a defence conversion policy.

my question is for the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food.
<P>
	Last December the government acted on a Canadian 
International Trade Tribunal recommendation for an annual 
quota of 72,000 tonnes on imported boneless beef. This measure 
was necessary to prevent serious injury to the Canadian beef 
industry. Now the government has increased that quota to 
85,000 tonnes.
<P>
	Why is the government disregarding the CITT 
recommendation, thereby abandoning the Canadian beef 
industry?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government is most certainly not 
abandoning the Canadian beef industry. The CITT 
recommendation upon which the government acted last 
December also included the recommendation that we should 
monitor the situation and take into account changing 
circumstances.
<P>
	A surprising thing which occurred this year is that the 1994 
quota level which was established in the area of 72,000 tonnes 
was in the process of being filled very early in the year. I think 
none of the participants in this process anticipated that. When it 
became obvious the quota was about to be filled, some 12,000 to 
15,000 tonnes of product which had been contracted for at a 
lower price were actually in transit. Because of the time taken in 
transit the product would have arrived in Canada at the higher 
price and subject to the surtax. Therefore the number was 
adjusted to take into account, among other things, that volume 
of product which was actually in transit and would have been 
treated unfairly upon its arrival in Canada at the higher price.
<P>
	We continue to monitor the situation. There are discussions 
going on today and tomorrow with respect to the importation 
situation for offshore boneless beef. We  will try our best to keep 
a very balanced view of the situation to make sure that all 
Canadian interests are properly taken into account.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the minister for that answer. I would like to point out to 
him that cattle farmers have taken a 20 cents per pound 
reduction in prices since January. At present beef exports from 
Australia and New Zealand to the U.S. are down, while exports 
from Australia and New Zealand to Canada are up 47 per cent. 
Our cattle producers are being forced to ship live-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order, please. I would ask the hon. member to 
put his question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Excuse me, Mr. Speaker. Why is the minister 
putting the Canadian cattle industry at risk and also allowing the 
export of jobs in the Canadian beef processing industry?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is certainly not my intention nor 
that of the government, nor that of any Canadian I am sure, to 
put the Canadian cattle industry at risk.
<P>
	Over the last period of time while we have been plagued with 
some difficulties in our grain sector, the red meat sector 
particularly the beef industry, has been one of those bright spots 
we would obviously want to encourage in every way possible.
<P>
	I am certainly sensitive to the point the hon. member has made 
about the need to ensure the viability of this industry, including 
the processing and further processing side of this industry for 
the future. That is indeed one of the factors the government will

	We all agree on the need to solve the native cemetery issue. 
However, will the minister pledge to ensure that the case of the 
forgotten ones of Oka, which has been dragging for two years 
now, will not be shelved by his negotiator, Michel Robert?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, if I understand the preamble that 
there is a reference perhaps to the negotiator's confidence, I 
want to point out that the appointed negotiator was the president 
of the Canadian Bar Association-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Irwin:</B> Okay. The Bloc agrees he is a very competent 
person with a big reputation.
<P>
	As to the process, everything is on the table. There is going to 
be an orderly process on the cemetery, the  houses north of 344, 
the houses south of 344, the Seigneurie of Deux-Montagnes, 
past housing grievances, working with the Mohawk community 
toward some of the catch up on the program of financial 
responsibility.
<P>
	What I wanted was a process that would move pragmatically 
ahead. With the appointment of Michel Robert as our negotiator 
that will happen. Moreover, I have approached a member of the 
Quebec judiciary at the Supreme Court level. If we get 
permission, not only will we have Mr. Robert, but also a very 
eminent person from the judiciary who will act as a mediator and 
facilitator. I think my friend will be happy with that type of 
procedure.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I never questioned Michel Robert's competence. However, I ask 
the minister: Is there a link between the mandate which he just 
gave to Michel Robert regarding the Oka issue and the fact that 
Mr. Robert currently sits on the Security Intelligence Review 
Committee of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, in its quiet way, that is an 
unacceptable slur on a man of the highest integrity.
<P>
	He was president of the Canadian Bar Association, a member 
of the International Bar Association, the American College of 
Trial Lawyers. Do you want more? He was a Corporation of 
Industrial Relations counsellor, a member of the royal 
commission on economic union and development prospects for 
Canada, the McDonald commission, an appointed member of 
the Privy Council and, incidentally, a member of the security 
intelligence review committee.
<P>
<B>(1500) </B>
<P>
	He is acceptable to us. He is acceptable to the Mohawk 
community and I do not accept that slur on a man of this type of 
integrity.
<P>
	We should be glad that these types of men are prepared to 
come forward from Quebec to help the country.

or no.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International

Party.
<P>
	We have never mentioned a carbon tax. We are not in the 
business of doing that. It seems the Reform Party is.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead):</B> Mr. Speaker, let us lay 
this speculation to rest. We are genuinely concerned, given the 
fact that the national energy program was imposed by a Liberal 
government in the early eighties which was disastrous to Alberta 
and the west.
<P>
	Will the government put an end to the speculation and just 
answer the question? Is the government considering a carbon 
tax. Yes or no.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International

of the word ``no'' he does not understand. We have never 
mentioned a carbon tax. Read the red book. Is it found in the red

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
with the weekly business statement, today we are debating the 
report stage of Bill C-17, the budget implementation bill.
<P>
	Tomorrow the House will consider a number of bills. First, we 
will consider Bill C-26 regarding the National Library. Then we 
will move on to Bill C-30 regarding assistance to workers and 
then to Bill S-2 regarding certain international tax agreements.
<P>
	If we make progress very quickly we could also look at the bill 
introduced today by the Minister of Canadian Heritage to deal 
with support for the Canadian Film Development Corporation.

	On Monday the House will continue the report stage of Bill 
C-17 and on Tuesday the House will deal with third reading

	I should point out we have more than a dozen and a half bills

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BUDGETIMPLEMENTATIONACT">BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of Bill C-17, an act to 
amend certain statutes to implement certain provisions of the 
budget tabled in Parliament on February 22, 1994 as reported 
(without amendment) from the committee; and Motions Nos. 23 
to 38.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I understand the hon. 
member for Yorkton-Melville has six minutes remaining on 
his intervention and therefore I will give the floor to the hon. 
member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
made the point that we could not accept the omnibus bill here. 
There are parts of it that we agree with but there is a part that we 
disagree with and therefore we have to vote against the whole 
thing because of one element, and that is not acceptable. I want 
to continue my remarks with regard to Bill C-17 and the 
Unemployment Insurance Act with the fourth point that I was 
making.
<P>
	The bill will increase the minimum amount of time a person 
needs to qualify for UI from 10 to 12 weeks. The Reform Party 
supports this measure and would ask the government to consider 
making it tougher for repeaters to continue to get UI benefits.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4474"> 4474 </A></B>
<P>
	The fifth point is that the bill will allow more workers who 
voluntarily quit their jobs or are fired with just cause to collect 
benefits. The Reform Party is opposed to this measure because 
there are now 43 just cause reasons which allow job quitters 
to collect UI. Need more be said?
<P>
	Finally, the bill will reduce the length of time a worker can 
remain on claim and include specific provisions for areas of 
high unemployment. The Reform Party supports this measure 
because it will encourage workers to move to areas where there 
is a better chance of finding work.
<P>
	As members can see, of the six major changes to the 
Unemployment Insurance Act the Reform Party supports five. 
Had the bill been only addressing these specific changes, the 
Reform Party would be voting in favour.
<P>
	When I spoke on Bill C-17, I put the UI reforms outlined in 
this bill to a simple test which I referred to as the taxpayer's test. 
I would like to take my remaining time to discuss the principles 
we believe should be used to design and develop a true 
unemployment insurance program.
<P>
	Reformers believe that the UI program is no longer a true 
insurance program. The system has been used and abused by 
politicians over the years. Now it is operating more like a social 
welfare program. People in many regions of the country are so 
confused that they now think unemployment insurance is a right.
<P>
	Many Canadians see UI as an entitlement that comes without 
any obligations. A common observation for many workers is 
that ``I have paid into it, therefore I am entitled to draw as long 
as I want''. They proceed to do just that.
<P>
	The majority of workers who have paid into the 
unemployment insurance program year after year and have 
never collected are tired. They are tired of paying the bills for 
the minority of workers who collect UI year after year.
<P>
	Employers who pay UI premiums are tired of subsidizing 
other employers who use and abuse the UI program to keep a 
captive workforce. Reformers believe it is time to get back to 
some basic principles and return unemployment insurance to its 
original purpose, an employer-employee funded and 
administered program to provide temporary income in the event 
of an unexpected job loss.
<P>
<B>(1510 ) </B>
<P>
	We know that the Minister of Human Resources Development 
is currently trying to develop an action plan for the reform of 
social programs. Reformers would like the minister to keep 
these fundamental principles in mind. The government says it is 
listening. I hope this is true.
<P>
	I will go through this list without explanation because I do not 
believe my time will allow it.
<P>
	(1) Social programs should be designed to eliminate all 
administrative duplication between the federal government and 
other levels of government.
<P>
	(2) Social programs should be structured so as to minimize 
economic distortions and disincentives and thereby encourage 
clients to become economically productive.
<P>
	(3) Social programs fall into one of two categories, income 
supplements or income insurance. Both should be financially 
sustainable but only income insurance programs can be 
self-financing.
<P>
	(4) Income insurance programs should operate on true 
insurance principles. This means the workers who make 
repeated claims on the program and employers who repeatedly 
lay off workers would have to pay higher premiums.
<P>
	(5) Income insurance programs should be democratized, 
meaning they should be administered by employers and the 
employees who pay for them.
<P>
	(6) Income insurance programs must be accountable. Every 
Canadian should receive annual statements indicating how 
much he or she has paid into the program and how much she or 
he has received in benefits.
<P>
	(7) Income insurance programs should treat all Canadians 
equally, regardless of the area of the country in which they 
reside. Regionally based entrance requirements, regionally 
extended benefits and other forms of geographically based 
discrimination should be prohibited.
<P>
	(8) Income insurance programs should be designed to 
minimize abuse of the system. It should be possible to virtually 
eliminate abuse of income insurance programs once they are 
made completely self-financing and administered by workers 
and employers.
<P>
	(9) Any large scale reforms to the federally administered 
social programs should be approved by the electorate in a 
national program.
<P>
	I believe if the government is serious about reforming the UI 
programs, it should seriously consider applying these 
principles.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
have appreciated more time in order to address the amendments 
we proposed one by one. However, since according to our 
procedure, we can speak only once, addressing all the 
amendments to this clause which deals with unemployment 
insurance, I will keep my remarks fairly general.
<P>
	I would like to start by commenting on what was said by the 
hon. member for the Reform Party. I was amazed he did not 
know how much he paid into the unemployment insurance fund 
and how much he received. You have to know both figures to do 
your income tax return.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4475"> 4475 </A></B>
<P>
	This unemployment insurance reform has split Canada in 
two, and the people who support a united Canada and a great 
Canadian federation are now the first to attack-that is the term 
we must use, under the circumstances-the economy of the 
Atlantic provinces and the economy of Quebec, with no 
warning to all their supporters who voted for them in the 
Maritimes. On the whole, these proposals will bleed more than 
$1.3 billion annually from the economy in Quebec and the 
Atlantic provinces. The members opposite have not heard the 
last of this from us, believe me. It is going to take a lot of 
infrastructure programs to make up for that.
<P>
	We in the opposition are convinced that the government failed 
to consider the economic impact, because budget measures do 
have an impact on the economy. At a time when the economy is 
very weak and growth is slow and is not supported by an increase 
in employment, taking this kind of money out of the economy of 
the eastern provinces which are already in poor shape merely 
undermines what the government is trying to accomplish.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I would like to draw the attention of the House to 
two of the amendments we proposed. My colleagues will 
address the others, but since not much has been said about this 
aspect, I want to address the provision in clause 22 which reads 
as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``(1.1)For purposes of paragraph (1)(<I>b</I>)'',-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It sounds confusing, but it is about making sure that claimants 
with dependants will receive 60 per cent of their insured 
earnings, and we want to ensure that the onus is on the 
Commission to establish that the claimant is not entitled to 
application of the rate of weekly benefit provided.
<P>
	Let me explain. Claimants with dependants and insurable 
earnings of up to $390 per week will be entitled to this 60 per 
cent. Three hundred and ninety dollars per week for someone 
with dependants is not much, but by introducing a form of 
assistance in an insurance program, the government may be 
faced with resorting to some kind of inquisitorial means test in 
the case of individuals who receive this kind of assistance 
instead of straightforward unemployment insurance benefits.
<P>
	The purpose of our amendment is to allow the claimant who 
would receive the 60 per cent to establish a <I>prima facie</I> 
entitlement, and to put the onus on the commission to establish 
that the claimant is not entitled to this rate.
<P>
	I would like to make a few comments regarding another 
provision, which we are also proposing to amend, and which 
may appear rather innocuous, in spite of the fact that it gives the 
minister all latitude to suspend the application of the provisions 
of the Unemployment Insurance Act in the case of workers who 
have lost their jobs in areas where a pilot project is being 
conducted.
<P>
	If you are lucky or unlucky enough to be involved in a pilot 
projet, the usual provisions of the act may not apply any more, if 
the minister so decides. We believe that it does not make any 
sense at all and that is why we want the House of Commons to 
give its approval by resolution, to make sure that we have a 
public debate and that each pilot project is examined on its own 
merits. As I said before, being involved in a pilot project may be 
worth it, but you never can tell, and it is important to ensure that 
the minister cannot change, at will, the provisions of the UI Act.
<P>
	The minister may say that he would never do such a thing, but 
the legislation is there, regardless of who is responsible for it. 
That is why it is very important for us to convince our colleagues 
opposite to accept this amendment. They may not have realized 
how enormous the powers they are vesting on the minister are. 
By giving him full latitude to deprive anyone, anywhere, of his 
or her legal rights to unemployment insurance, they are indeed 
giving the minister discretionary powers.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, this omnibus bill is a shame. As we said many 
times before, we do understand that the government is in a 
serious financial situation and that it must deal with the deficit.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	We strenuously object to this being done on the backs of 
people who are not only becoming vulnerable from loosing their 
jobs but living in regions in which the economy is the most 
vulnerable.
<P>
	To wrap up, those who cloak themselves in the Canadian 
identity are in fact engaging in a shameful cover-up because the 
proposed measures affect directly the economy, and even more 
so in Atlantic Canada than in Quebec, although Quebec's 
economy is also hard hit. Only 8 per cent of the total population 
of Canada lives in the Atlantic provinces; yet, they are hit with 
26 per cent of the cuts. All the adjustment programs for Atlantic 
fishermen practicing ground-fishing will not make up-it will 
not even come close-for these drastic cuts.
<P>
	Seeing that I have a couple of minutes remaining, I will say 
this. The government probably did not think about the 
depressing effect these measures would have on the economy. It 
is important for every citizen to bear in mind that when 
governments reallocate money taken out of our pockets to 
unemployed persons, this money is immediately pumped back 
into the economy. It is not used for speculation purposes or to 
buy luxury items which are generally imported. It is pumped 
directly back into the economy. It is used to pay rent which 
would otherwise be more difficult to collect, assuming that 
someone needs to collect rent. It makes life easier for small 
businesses which derive their livelihood from it and, of course, 
it makes life easier for families which depend on these 
provisions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4476"> 4476 </A></B>
<P>
	Some will argue that there may be people who will use or 
abuse the system in the sense that they will apply repeatedly 
for unemployment insurance. Let me say that any one of these 
people who apply repeatedly for unemployment insurance 
would gladly trade places with someone who has been paying 
UI premiums for 25 years and always held a good, decent job.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the 
riding of Laurentides that I represent, the unemployment rate is 
18 per cent, which is significantly higher than the national rate. 
One would have to be a little naive to believe the Liberal 
government's recent actions can lower this unemployment rate.
<P>
	All you have done since October 25, all your decisions and 
actions are only a drop in the ocean. With your false optimism 
and pompous speeches, you try to mislead the population by 
telling them that your plan is working and producing results. In 
fact, you throw a few crumbs here and there. You aim for the 
precarious and the very short-term. In Quebec and in my riding, 
the pre-election period brings its usual jobs.
<P>
	The provincial and federal Liberal ministers announce here 
and there that financial assistance will be provided under the 
infrastructure program, thus creating or preserving some 
temporary, short-term jobs. The government opposite is 
satisfied and delighted with its miraculous action.
<P>
	But where is the true vision, Mr. Speaker? Where are the 
longer-term plans that would bring us a more stable economy, 
one that would create more jobs? Instead of seriously tackling 
the problem and looking for solutions, the ministers opposite go 
from place to place and see themselves as the bearers of good 
news.
<P>
	The people opposite practice day-to-day management while 
waiting to see what will happen tomorrow. The unemployed 
people of Laurentides know full well that nothing has changed. 
There are no more jobs available for them since you moved over 
to the government side.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	What they know however is that after unemployment 
insurance comes welfare. That is the Liberals' real contribution 
to the economy. That is what is really happening in our ridings.
<P>
	The federal government has shifted its responsibilities to the 
provinces. This transfer, this shameful process shows the laxity 
and inertia of the Liberals. Welfare, UI cuts, dead-end jobs, 
increased taxes for the middle class and empty rhetoric, of 
course, are the only results achieved by the red book 
government.
<P>
	The finance minister's Bill C-17, a real post-budget grab bag, 
introduces amendments to the Unemployment Insurance Act. 
We find several changes completely unacceptable. The 
amendment of my colleague from 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup concerning the change to the 
premium rate would make this rate change earlier.
<P>
	We want to end as soon as possible a measure that hurts 
employment. Instead of waiting for January 1, 1995 to bring the 
rate back to $3 per $100, we want to bring it back to 3 per cent on 
June 1, 1994. The Liberals have not been very honest on this rate 
issue, since they themselves increased it from $3 to $3.07 on 
January 1, 1994.
<P>
	Now they are acting like real comedians when they tell the 
public that they are correcting this rate which is too high, when 
they themselves just increased it. The process is not honest and 
the Liberals are making it worse by pretending that they will 
create 40,000 jobs by correcting this rate.
<P>
	For one thing, if the government is so confident about the 
positive impact of a lower rate, why did it raise it on January 1, 
1994, and why is it delaying the decrease until January 1, 1995?
<P>
	Furthermore, this projection of 40,000 jobs is illusory or 
hypothetical, as it is based on the old schedule which would have 
seen the rate rise to $3.30 on January 1, 1995. This lower rate 
simply eliminates a deterrent to job creation and, according to 
the minister's very debatable figures, reduces job losses.
<P>
	As far as I know, reducing job losses is not the same as 
creating jobs. Maintaining jobs or stopping job losses keeps the 
unemployment rate from rising, while creating jobs lowers the 
unemployment rate, but for the Liberals, it is the same thing.
<P>
	Their recipe for employment, which is in very poor taste, 
combines all the ingredients blindly, without measuring them 
and without discernment. Then they give the people their 
product and hope that they will just swallow it all.
<P>
	Well, wake up. The people know very well what is going on 
every day. My constituents want real action and tangible results. 
The people of Laurentides want jobs. They are ready to train, 
retrain and upgrade themselves to acquire the skills needed to 
meet the needs of the labour markets.
<P>
	The 30 per cent of my constituents who are unemployed, I 
repeat, 30 per cent, want to see the light at the end of the tunnel. 
They ask the government to put forward programs that will help 
them go back to work. Long-term employment that will give 
them some security. Not more small jobs lasting just a few 
weeks and created through programs designed only to ensure the 
required number of weeks to be eligible for UI benefits.
<P>
	We are not getting anywhere with this system. The 
government only supports a vicious circle which workers cannot 
escape. It must change its approach to get better and more 
profitable results, both for workers and employers.
<P>
	The new changes to the UI program make it harder to be 
eligible for benefits. In my riding, these changes will adversely 
affect a large number of workers who are simply not able to work 
the 12 weeks required, because  of a regional economy based on 
tourism. This is their ticket to welfare. Nice job by the Liberal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4477"> 4477 </A></B>
<P>
government. It never occurred to the decision makers opposite 
that some workers have all the trouble in the world to find work 
for the required weeks of insurable employment.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	The Liberals go even farther. They say: You work more but we 
give you less. Fewer weeks of benefits and those benefits are 
reduced. This translates into less money to spend and a declining 
purchasing power which, in turns, means that other workers are 
laid off, no jobs created, and the spiral continues.
<P>
	The Liberals make cuts in the UI program without offering 
alternatives to workers. They do things the wrong way round. 
Their logic has nothing to do with common sense. This is 
worrisome and depressing for my constituents. It clearly shows 
that the Liberals are more interested in figures than in people.
<P>
	Consequently, I ask the Liberals to support our amendment 
regarding the premium rate. If the Liberals are so sure of the 
positive effects of that drop, they have to support our position. 
However, it remains to be seen whether they have the courage 
and the will to do so. I have strong doubts about that.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on Bill C-17, in particular those clauses 
relating to unemployment insurance.
<P>
	Canadians have quite rightly been proud of the unemployment 
insurance benefits in this country. During the so-called free 
trade debate one of the grave concerns expressed by the New 
Democratic Party was the attempts that would follow the 
agreements to Americanize our unemployment insurance 
scheme among other issues such as health care.
<P>
	What we see in the bill is not a true reform of legislation, not a 
true measure to build a system in Canada which really addresses 
the needs of the unemployed but rather regressive steps to attack 
the unemployed rather than to address the very serious question 
of unemployment.
<P>
	During the discussions in the last session of Parliament on 
Bill C-21 brought in by the former Conservative government 
and Bill C-113, the Liberal opposition at that time was 
vehement in its opposition to the regressive measures in those 
two pieces of legislation. The clauses on unemployment 
insurance in Bill C-17 far exceed the regressive measures in 
those previous pieces of legislation which were decried loudly 
by members opposite when they were in opposition and now are 
being implemented with a vengeance in the bill.
<P>
	Just to give one example, in 1989, 90 per cent of unemployed 
people were covered by unemployment insurance in this 
country. Just four short years later, after the Conservative 
government trashed the unemployment  insurance scheme, only 
65 per cent of unemployed workers are covered by 
unemployment insurance.
<P>
	Let us be clear what we are talking about here. This is an 
insurance scheme. Under the previous regime, the government 
withdrew its funding and financial obligation for unemployment 
insurance. It is an insurance scheme by employers and 
employees. Insurance means you pay into a scheme and you are 
entitled to a benefit from that scheme.
<P>
	I am truly shocked that the current Liberal government has 
chosen to bring forward a piece of legislation even worse than 
that brought in by the Conservative government. I am sure there 
is not a Canadian in this country who expected this government 
to be worse than the previous government. It is going some to 
say that it could actually accomplish that in the bill. That is 
exactly what it has done.
<P>
	I want to give a few specific examples. First, Bill C-17 will 
introduce a means test to determine the level of rates. What is 
really concerning about the bill is that it hurts those in areas of 
high unemployment even more than those in areas with less 
unemployment. I cannot believe the provinces and territories 
are not screaming from one end of this country to the other 
because what this bill does as it has done in the past is simply 
transfer responsibility for supporting unemployed workers 
while they are looking for a job to the provinces and territories. 
Once again this is what the government is doing.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	The duration of benefits has been slashed across the country 
just at the time that long term unemployment becomes a 
problem. In the past we saw that the duration of unemployment 
for Canadians was much shorter than it now is. What is even 
more shocking is that at present only 59 per cent of Canadians 
have full time jobs in the country.
<P>
	A report released this week called ``The Outsiders'' reports 
levels of poverty and unemployment not seen since the 
Depression.
<P>
	On the one hand we have in our country an economic system 
in crisis. For far too many people this is not a recessionary 
period, this is a depression. On the other hand we have a Liberal 
government that says it is going to take a new way but has taken 
an even worse way than the previous government in attacking 
the unemployed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4478"> 4478 </A></B>
<P>
	In the February budget 60 cents on every dollar in cuts was 
taken from the unemployed through job cuts and cuts to other 
social programs.
<P>
	The second matter that is very concerning about this bill 
directly contrasts to the red book which we hear so much about. 
In the red book it was said: ``The people are irritated with 
governments that do not consult or that disregard their views or 
try to conduct key parts of public business behind closed doors. 
A Liberal government will take a series of initiatives to restore 
confidence in the institution of government''.
<P>
	What has it done in this legislation? It is one of the biggest 
grabs of power by the government from Parliament that I have 
seen in the seven years I have been in this House of Commons. 
Under this legislation, particularly the pilot projects section, the 
power will rest solely with the government to determine the 
rules and the nature of those projects, not with Parliament.
<P>
	The government has appropriated $20 billion of taxpayers' 
money. It has said that it will not be all of the parties elected to 
Parliament that will help to decide how it develops this program. 
It is us, it is the government. That is exactly what makes people 
cynical about the majority kind of government we have and 
exactly contrary to the red book.
<P>
	These regressive measures regarding unemployment 
insurance completely undermine any faith that might exist in the 
social policy review undertaken by the minister of human 
resources. The minister and the government on the one hand are 
saying they are really going to look at changes to the system. We 
in the New Democratic Party agree. We know the system does 
not function, that younger families are falling even faster into 
poverty and that the gap between the rich and poor is increasing. 
We agree with looking at this.
<P>
	However, what has the government done? It said on the one 
hand that it is going to consult everybody. In the secret 
document leaked this week it said it is going to spend over a 
million dollars not to do but to promote social policy review. At 
the same time in a piece of omnibus legislation hidden away we 
see that this government is setting the very parameters of new 
social policy.
<P>
	The minister of human resources must answer to Canadians. 
Where is the review when the ministry of finance under this bill 
has set the policy?
<P>
	We have here a very hypocritical piece of legislation at least 
in terms of meeting the kind of rhetoric we heard both when the 
Liberals were in opposition and now with their commitment to 
consult Canadians.
<P>
	All Canadians are concerned about the social service network 
and how we should deal with that, none more so than the New 
Democratic Party. Let me mention several things that could 
achieve some of the same objectives.
<P>
	The government did not come in with a full employment 
policy.
<P>
<B>(1540 ) </B>
<P>
	I hope it will support my private member's bill on full 
employment which will be up for discussion next month. If it 
had through a real plan reduced unemployment to about 9.5 per 
cent, the $2.4 billion cutback that we saw in this year's budget 
could have been avoided.
<P>
	If the government were to truly focus on a full employment 
program we would not need nor would we even be talking about 
changes to the unemployment insurance system. We have to get 
away from the myth that unemployment is free and that we can 
deal with unemployment if we just hit the unemployed a little 
harder.
<P>
	The New Democratic Party is totally opposed to the measures 
that the government has brought in regarding unemployment 
insurance. They do not address the serious problems in our 
society. In fact they make them worse.
<P>
	I do not believe that Canadians elected this government to 
make the lives of millions of Canadians worse. That is exactly 
what is being done in the bill. I hope that the provinces and 
territories will stand and counter as well the measures that are in 
the bill.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the objective of slash and trash has become 
much more the watchword as we see reflected in the bill than 
real reform and a real concern for Canadians. The social and 
financial costs of unemployment are huge. We know that but we 
will not address those costs by making it more difficult or by 
trying to transfer the problem.
<P>
	I have received thousands of letters, petitions and cards 
opposing these unemployment insurance changes. I agree with 
them because they do not deal with the substantive issue in 
society.
<P>
	In conclusion I hope the government will re-read its own 
speeches on Bill C-21 and Bill C-113 where it opposed even 
less drastic measures than the ones it is now taking. Shame on 
you is what I have to say to the Liberal Party.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I welcome this opportunity to address the proposed amendments 
to the clause on unemployment insurance in Bill C-17. I would 
like to start by making it clear to Quebecers and Canadians that 
from the very beginning of the sub-committee's consideration 
of Bill C-17, during which I was the critic for the official 
opposition, the government tried to sneak through one of the 
major, if not the major reform of our social programs.
<P>
	The proposals in the last budget, the first and last budget 
brought down by the Minister of Finance, provide for slashing 
$5.5 billion from the unemployment insurance fund during the 
next three years. More than 50 per cent of these cuts will be felt 
by two particular regions, mainly the Maritimes, an area that is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4479"> 4479 </A></B>
<P>
not known  for its booming economy, and especially in recent 
years with the crisis in the fisheries, and another region that has 
been hit very hard, my country, Quebec, which will also absorb a 
major share of the cuts the federal government proposes to make 
in the unemployment insurance fund through the Liberal budget.
<P>
	Next year alone, although the Maritimes represent 8.5 per 
cent of the population, they will be hit by 26 per cent of the cuts 
totalling $21.4 billion which the federal government will make 
in the unemployment insurance fund. The government is going 
to take $630 million out of the pockets of the unemployed in the 
Maritimes.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	As for Quebec, next year, the impact of these cuts will 
represent $535 million or 31 per cent of the total for that year. 
Again, this government, and I see a few of its eminent 
representatives, will make these cuts at the expense of the 
unemployed, of the neediest in our society.
<P>
	That is how this government treats the unemployed. That is 
how this government says it will create jobs. That is how this 
government treats people who do not deserve to be treated this 
way, since they already have to cope with the unemployment and 
under-employment that is widespread in Quebec, in the 
Maritimes and more or less across Canada. Should we be 
surprised that this is happening?
<P>
	When, not so long ago, I heard the Prime Minister refer to the 
unemployed as people who were always drinking beer and say 
they should stop drinking beer and go out and look for a job, I 
said to myself: Now that is statesman like. That is a man with 
vision. And that from someone who on so many occasions 
waved the red book, saying: We are concerned about jobs. Now 
that is a kind of cynicism we have never seen before in Quebec 
or Canada: cynicism at the expense of the unemployed.
<P>
	And when we consider that the present Prime Minister once 
represented the riding of Beauséjour in the Maritimes, and that 
normally if he did his job-which I sometimes doubt when I see 
him in his prime ministerial role-he ought to be aware of the 
economic situation in the Maritimes and the impact of the cuts 
he himself proposed as the leader of the government. He should 
know that these cuts will have a tremendous impact on all the 
Maritime communities already crushed by the demise of one of 
its most important industries, the fishing industry, and by other 
difficulties of industrial revival and redeployment or 
diversification.
<P>
	Without the Bloc Quebecois, without our hard work, the 
subcommittee responsible for studying Bill C-17, and in 
particular the part relating to unemployment insurance, would 
have sat only two and a half days. One day to hear department 
officials explain the content of the report and a day and a half to 
hear witnesses. By being very persistent, we finally managed to 
obtain an extension of about two weeks. But even that was not 
enough, because this is the biggest reform of  unemployment 
insurance since its creation. What I heard during those two 
weeks was, for example, the feeling of helplessness of the 
people from the Gaspe.
<P>
	I was talking this morning with my colleague, the Bloc 
member for Gaspé, and he was telling me that in his riding the 
unemployment rate was at least 27 per cent. The increase in the 
number of weeks required to qualify for UI, from 10 to 12 
weeks, will have an enormous impact on some people. My 
colleague was telling me that last month, only 42 per cent of the 
unemployed had been able to secure at least 10 weeks of work 
and were therefore eligible under the new rules introduced by 
this government. At 12 weeks even fewer people would have 
qualified. In these single-industry areas, where seasonal work is 
the norm, there are very few places where you can work more 
than 10 weeks.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	And I would tell you that, during the two and a half weeks of 
hearings of the sub-committee on Bill C-17, people from the 
Maritimes came to see us saying that the measures proposed in 
that bill would destabilize whole communities, would make 
most of the seasonal workers, fishermen already affected by the 
fisheries crisis, go from unemployment insurance to welfare and 
that welfare benefits would come out of the already scarce 
provincial funds, as we well know.
<P>
	When I saw how offhand my Liberal colleagues were with the 
people of Newfoundland, New Brunswick and everywhere else 
in the maritimes, and particularly the people of the Acadian 
Peninsula, I could not help but find it revolting. These people 
presented arguments to us and to the government, saying that 
with these measures, the government was attacking them 
directly without offering any compensation like economic 
development measures, diversification of the economic base or 
programs to help them get back into the labour force. The 
government was attacking them and cutting their means of 
subsistence and it was saying: ``Come what may, it is a case of 
make or break for these people''.
<P>
	I even saw, and I must admit I am still troubled and moved by 
that, members of this government who threw out people who had 
driven hundreds of kilometres because they could not afford to 
fly. They came from the Acadian Peninsula and from 
Newfoundland to shout and cry their hopelessness. And the 
members of the government did not even have the courage to 
listen to all they had to say; they just threw them out.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4480"> 4480 </A></B>
<P>
	One evening, there was one Bloc member, no Liberal 
member, no Reform member, and yet people had come all the 
way from Atlantic Canada to once again voice their grave 
concerns.
<P>
	I was outraged by such a show of cynicism during the 
committee hearings. We can see this characteristic trait of the 
Liberals displayed in their attitude in general, and in the 
measures they are implementing. I can tell you that my 
constituents in the riding of Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, and the 
constituents of all my colleagues and probably of quite a few 
Liberal members opposite, have had just about enough of their 
cynicism, and their sarcasm regarding such fundamental things 
as human misery and suffering, which are considerable east of 
Manitoba.
<P>
	I am particularly interested in one specific amendment aimed 
at deleting clause 28. The purpose of the amendment is to 
eliminate the proposed table of required number of weeks of 
insurable employment, and to go back to the initial provisions. 
In areas which are heavily dependant on resource industries, 
people have no other choice than to hope for some better times, 
and now they see that to be eligible for UI, they need 12 weeks of 
insurable employment, instead of 10.
<P>
	What I have heard in the past three weeks has convinced me 
more than ever that it is important to treat people with respect. 
For instance, we were given statistics for Labrador, showing that 
up to 65 per cent of the people there, whole communities in fact, 
were without work at one time or another during the year, and 
that, of course, they would be hit very hard by this bill.
<P>
	All I ask is a bit of compassion for these people. Let 
Parliament adopt the proposed amendments to the 
Unemployment Insurance Act and let the government 
implement measures for the diversification or the strengthening 
of our industrial base, and to facilitate the re-entry of 
unemployed workers into the labour force. These people need 
hope.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to speak to these 
motions and respond to the critic of the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	I am very pleased to see such a large audience here today. 
Sometimes we see the ironies of Canadian politics first hand. It 
gives us an opportunity to understand, and I do wish the member 
has the opportunity to listen to me here. Here is a man standing 
up right now who has been one of the great supporters of the UI 
program. What is the UI program?
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	The UI program is one of the greatest contributors to national 
unity we have ever had. It does not matter what part of the 
country you live in. We have made rules; we have made 
exceptions; and we have reached out to make sure that no matter 
what economy you are in or what  part of the country you live in, 
you have an opportunity to participate in UI.
<P>
	There is a party whose sole purpose is to come here and 
destroy our country, but what does it do? It ends up defending a 
program that benefits all Canadians. This is the hypocrisy which 
drives the government crazy. Yes, this is a very important 
program and, yes, people in Atlantic Canada deserve to be 
protected and deserve to be supported. These members have to 
realize that this is a national program which requires national 
participation. No program in the last 50 years has contributed 
more to the needy regions of our country than this legislation.
<P>
	Part of the difficulty with the opposition is it repeats day by 
day misrepresentations of what happens in committees, which 
allows people to think what it says is really the truth.
<P>
	Let me clarify the record of what happened in committee. 
When we began hearings there was not one particular group 
which had expressed an interest in talking on the bill. We had an 
agreement from this party that we would allow a week to see if 
groups came forward.
<P>
	Suddenly, to use a colloquialism, to hot dog it for the press, 
they said: ``we are cutting off the debate'' when they had made 
an agreement that a week was sufficient. Suddenly the press 
shows up and the line changes in the cheapest of all forms of 
politics.
<P>
	Second, several weeks were set aside for people to come 
forward. Not one group that asked to come forward has not been 
heard on the bill. There has not been one group that has not been 
spoken to and asked questions of.
<P>
	The government has reached out to make sure that its program 
is understood and that when groups come forward, whether they 
are from the Gaspé or from Atlantic Canada or a group from 
downtown Toronto, which had really good ideas to reform and to 
improve on the system, they are responded to.
<P>
	The government has been very proud of the way it approached 
a very complicated bill such as this and the way it set out 
hearings and gave an opportunity for everyone to speak who 
wished to speak on the bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
take part in this debate on the proposed unemployment 
insurance reform. I have already criticized certain aspects of the 
proposed reform and today, I would like to draw the House's 
attention to one particular measure which would reduce UI 
premiums to $3 as of January 1, 1995.
<P>
	As everyone knows, the premium was increased to $3.07 on 
January 1, 1994. In its budget, the government party stated the 
following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4481"> 4481 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The UI measures proposed in the budget will enable the government to rollback the 
UI premium rate for 1995 to $3. By the end of 1996 there will be 40,000 more jobs in 
the economy than could be expected if premiums were allowed to rise.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What is the government saying? It is saying that 
unemployment insurance premiums increased on January 1, 
1994, that is while the current Liberal government was in office, 
and that this increase resulted in the loss of 9,000 jobs in 
Canada. Yet, the government did nothing to stop the increase 
from taking effect.
<P>
	The premium rate was slated to increase to $3.30 in 1996. The 
government is saying that if the rate increase were allowed, in 
view of the cost to employers, roughly 31,000 jobs would be 
lost. When we add 9,000 jobs and 31,000 jobs, we come up with 
a total of 40,000 jobs. And yet, in the budget, this is called 
creating 40,000 jobs.
<P>
	I think this illustrates one typical way the current government 
has presented the facts in the last six months.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	The government floats some figures as to what might have 
happened had it not acted in a certain way. People are left with 
the impression that jobs have been created. The figure of 40,000 
jobs is almost equivalent to the number of jobs announced in the 
infrastructure program of which the government is boasting of 
late.
<P>
	In the meantime, what is the government doing for the jobless 
person in a region such as my own, the 
Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region? It is a region in need of 
industrial development, a region, particularly my riding, where 
major industries, workers and the surrounding population once 
flourished. Large companies such as Alcan and Abitibi-Price 
paid their workers handsomely and brought obvious wealth to 
the region.
<P>
	This glorious era is long gone. Large companies are 
converting their operations and rumours are flying in the region 
that employment levels will decline even further.
<P>
	Alcan in Arvida and Abiti-Price in Kénogami have reduced 
the workforce at their plants by at least one third in recent years. 
Unemployment is high in my region. People are hoping that 
governments will take adequate steps to ensure that wealth is 
generated and employment picks up.
<P>
	What do we find in this Liberal government budget? A 
hypothetical measure which, had it been implemented, would 
have caused a number of jobs to be lost but, since the 
government is dropping it, fewer jobs will be lost.
<P>
	And that is presented as a job creation measure! I would say 
that in the regions, people are worried, particularly in resource 
areas like mine, in which traditionally, heavy industry has 
developed natural resources and produced primary products.
<P>
	What Alcan produces is primary aluminium for use abroad in 
the manufacturing of industrial goods. What the Abitibi-Price 
plant in Kénogami produces is paper and paperboard for the 
export market. Our regions have  come to depend on these 
industries and today jobs cuts have local residents concerned.
<P>
	Some have lost their jobs while others live in fear of loosing 
theirs. So, what does the government have to suggest in its 
budget to ensure some kind of a future for these people? First, it 
announces cuts to the unemployment insurance plan at a time 
when people need it the most and, second, it proposes no 
concrete measures to create jobs.
<P>
	Instead, you find hypothetical measures like the one I am 
denouncing now. There is also the infrastructure program, but 
these are all measures that take time to implement and even so, I 
have noticed that certain municipalities take advantage of the 
infrastructure program to get the federal and provincial 
governments to pay for work they would have done anyway.
<P>
	One can seriously doubt the job creation potential of such 
programs because, after all, part of this work would have been 
done anyway. Creating jobs, and creating new infrastructure for 
that matter, does not ensure that we will have a stronger 
financial base in the future. All this does is to make the federal 
and provincial governments foot the bill for work that would 
have been done anyway.
<P>
	I am therefore amazed that a party which ran on a platform of 
jobs, jobs, jobs, produced this kind of budget.
<P>
	The unemployed and, in my region, small business owners, 
people looking to market new products, those who want to 
continue to build our region which celebrated its 150th birthday 
just two or three years ago, are disappointed.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	Some of these people had expected a lot from this 
government. You will say that in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean 
region, the Bloc Quebecois candidates captured perhaps around 
65, 66 or even 75 per cent of the vote like my leader, Mr. 
Bouchard, in the riding of Lac-Saint-Jean.
<P>
	You will say that a lot of people may not have believed in the 
illusions, in the nice promises of the Liberal Party, but there 
were still people who looked at the Liberal Party's platform and 
thought it contained a few measures that would have improved 
our economic situation.
<P>
	These people may have voted for the party because of these 
promises and they now realize that nothing of the kind has been 
done after six months and a long development process. We are 
told that the Liberal government has been in office for only six 
months, except that the whole election platform development 
process had started a year or a year and a half earlier, so we can 
say that the Liberal Party platform has been around for a year 
and a half.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4482"> 4482 </A></B>
<P>
	A year and a half later, the people of my region who need 
new development programs to kick-start their economy see 
nothing in the government program that can meet their needs.
<P>
	I think it is important to reduce UI premiums. They obviously 
place a heavy strain on employers. But if it was so important and 
if we should be so proud of it, why does this reduction not take 
effect on June 1, as proposed by my colleague from 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup?
<P>
	Why must we wait another year to give hope to the people, to 
create jobs? Because if, as we are told, this measure had caused 
9,000 job losses as of January 1, by cancelling it now we could 
assume that 9,000 jobs would be created. What is the Liberal 
government waiting for when it could be creating 9,000 jobs? It 
is waiting for January, for people to be even more desperate, for 
a number of people now on UI to go on welfare. Is that what the 
government is waiting for?
<P>
	We see that deep down the government did not have a firm 
policy and that it has pursued the policy established by the 
previous Conservative government because this premium 
increase which took effect on January 1 had been planned by the 
Conservative Party.
<P>
	In closing, I must point out that this new economic wind, this 
new hope for workers and the unemployed that had been raised 
by the Liberal Party of Canada in the last election campaign did 
not materialize. I will be happy to support the amendment of my 
colleague who wants the proposed UI premium to come into 
effect on June 1 so that jobs can be created as soon as possible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am glad the hon. member had only 10 minutes within which to 
misrepresent the bill and mislead the Canadian public.
<P>
	Earlier one of the speakers from his party used the phrase ``my 
country, Quebec''. I suggest if that is the case, he is in the wrong 
Chamber. If he wants to represent Quebec, Quebec is 
represented in the Senate. It is also represented by the premier of 
the province of Quebec. The hon. member only represents a 
riding in Quebec.
<P>
	We are discussing Bill C-17. It deals with the unemployment 
insurance program which is a program for Canadians from coast 
to coast. We all contribute to this program to get the benefits.
<P>
	Shortly after World War II, Winston Churchill was asked to 
make a distinction between communism and capitalism. He 
said: ``If capitalism is the equal distribution of wealth, then 
communism is the equal distribution of misery''.
<P>
	If Canada is not good enough for some members of the Bloc, if 
Canada is not good enough for them to share in the prosperity of 
this country then no doubt their opposing the bill guarantees the 
people in Quebec the equal distribution of misery.
<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	I ask my colleagues to support the bill because the bill is a job 
creation bill. In the last two months this government has created 
115,000 jobs. This government is the only government to have 
58 per cent popularity in Canada today. We have to continue 
with this progress until we get the maximum number of 
Canadians working again and bring the unemployment down, to 
the benefit of all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the previous speaker said that we did not necessarily 
represent Quebec or our ridings; I remind him that the mandate 
we received is to defend Quebec's interests, as was stated very 
clearly. That is why Quebecers chose the Bloc Quebecois, 
because the Liberal candidates did not represent the way of the 
future that they considered necessary.
<P>
	Today, I rise to speak much more about the owners of small 
and medium-sized businesses in my riding who are looking for 
real straight-forward job creation measures. Rioux Fibreglass, 
for example, in Sainte-Françoise, MT Pressure Moulding, FF 
Soucy Prelco are small or medium-sized companies-in fact, 
the paper company is fairly large-that want simple programs. 
They want something so that they can contribute quickly to 
society by creating jobs.
<P>
	The infrastructure program is a smoke screen. It is good 
politics, it is good for their image, it creates some jobs, we 
admit, but there are much clearer and simpler measures that 
unfortunately do not provide the political coverage which this 
government seeks and seems desperately to want.
<P>
	My amendment is very simple: it would lower the employer's 
contribution to UI to 3 per cent right away, instead of playing the 
government's very Machiavellian game. They have created a 
new kind of job. Before, there were full-time, part-time and 
temporary jobs; now there are the jobs that they saved. They 
boast that they created 40,000 jobs because they saved them 
from disappearing.
<P>
	I think that the message we must give Canadians and 
Quebecers now is one of confidence and the way to do that is 
with positive actions which tell industrialists that it is time to 
invest and go ahead, not contrary actions that restrict their 
economic commitment and keep them from playing the role that 
they should in creating jobs to restore prosperity.
<P>
	This government prefers to give very ambiguous messages. 
While the government claims to want to create jobs, it decided 
that, in a region such as the Gaspe Peninsula, which has an 
unemployment rate of 27 per cent, workers will need three 
additional weeks to be eligible to UI benefits and will get these 
benefits for a shorter period. What a way to build confidence! 
The same bill tells civil servants, whose salaries are rather good, 
that things are so bad that the government must  freeze their 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4483"> 4483 </A></B>
<P>
salaries and that they cannot be paid what they deserve. Another 
negative message.
<P>
	It sounds very much like the old Conservative line. It sounds 
like what they used to say before Franklin Roosevelt became 
president of the United States, just after the Depression. Then, 
people were saying: ``We have to cut spending. Let us cut as 
much as possible and, more importantly, let us not create jobs 
because this will happen by itself''. The purpose of this 
amendment is to send a clear message to entrepreneurs, to give 
them some leeway as quickly as possible. This is particularly 
important in the case of an industry such as tourism.
<P>
	There are many seasonal jobs in the summer. This is the time 
to send a message to put people back to work. With the savings 
they will make, employers can contribute more easily to the job 
creation effort.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	This is not merely a question of money and maths. There is 
also a psychological effect involved. In that regard, the current 
Liberal government missed the boat and this is why its budget 
satisfied so few Canadians.
<P>
	Consequently, I ask members opposite, particularly those 
who live in the Maritimes and in regions where there are many 
seasonal workers, to support our amendment.
<P>
	Imagine if, tomorrow, we were to send employers a message 
to the effect that it has dawned on the government that the 
simplest way to create employment was to allow small 
businesses to act quickly, without red tape, without additional 
paper burden, and without having to get approval from three 
levels of government to build a sidewalk. This would allow 
small entrepreneurs to directly invest the money they would 
save by not having to spend it on bureaucratic formalities.
<P>
	I do hope that government members will understand that. 
After all, they were elected by promising ``jobs, jobs, jobs''. 
They should understand that when such political commitments 
are made but not fulfilled, it greatly undermines the credibility 
of politicians.
<P>
	Last fall, Canadians elected a new government because they 
wanted one which would put the emphasis on job creation 
through concrete and realistic measures. Today, you have the 
opportunity to adopt one such measure with this amendment and 
I hope that you will do it.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, since my riding is Cumberland-Colchester in that 
great province of Nova Scotia, which is classified as a maritime 
province, and since the hon. member has just referred to us on 
several occasions I believe it is important that I express some of 
the views that business in the maritime provinces has expressed 
to me on Bill C-17 and our budget.
<P>
	In Nova Scotia we have some 90,000 small businesses 
employing fewer than 50 persons each. We have a population of 
just under 900,000. That is a one to nine  ratio of small business 
to population. Those business people have said to me: ``If we 
could only reduce payroll taxes, UI premiums, if we could only 
reduce worker's compensation and those things that impede 
taking on more employees, then we could take care of job 
creation''. This is the message that small business has sent to me 
as a member of Parliament representing the maritime provinces.
<P>
	I suggest that it is small business in the great province of Nova 
Scotia that will do more to create jobs. By doing our part by 
dealing with some of the payroll taxes we are doing the most to 
stimulate economic growth and jobs in the business sector.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is 
the second time that I have the opportunity to take part in the 
debate on Bill C-17. It is vitally important for me, as a 
Quebecer, not to keep quiet about the major changes the 
government wants to make to the Unemployment Insurance Act.
<P>
	These changes will particularly affect Eastern Canada, the 
Maritimes and Quebec. The Liberals are trying to play down the 
losses Quebec will incur by talking about job creation. It would 
be day-dreaming to think that the public will be fooled by that, 
because no jobs will actually be created by these changes. That 
is what I will try to demonstrate here, today.
<P>
	Like all of Eastern Canada, Quebec will be hard hit by the 
increase in the number of weeks of insurable employment 
included in Bill C-17. Indeed, as I said previously, only the 
regions in Canada with a high level of unemployment will be 
affected by the changes to the number of weeks of insurable 
employment. That means six out of thirteen regions in Quebec, 
and seven out of thirteen regions in the Maritimes. Also, 95.6 
per cent of UI claimants in Quebec will be directly affected by 
the changes to the number of insurable weeks needed to become 
eligible for UI benefits.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	The people of my riding will be directly affected by these new 
measures. We have received hundreds of letters asking me to 
intervene in order to prevent the unemployment insurance 
system from being changed that way. Those are protest letters 
coming from taxpayers who, as myself, cannot accept these 
major changes to unemployment insurance. It is on their behalf 
that I speak today and also that I oppose Bill C-17. It is for my 
constituents and also for all those of Quebec and Canada who 
will be targeted by the changes made to the Unemployment 
Insurance Act that I oppose that bill today.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4484"> 4484 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robichaud: </B>No problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau: </B>May I continue, Sir? I thank you very much 
for your indulgence and your attention; that is very nice.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robichaud: </B>I was answering your colleague.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I can only listen to 
one speech at a time. I would ask the hon. member for 
Terrebonne to continue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau: </B>Mr. Speaker, there are people for whom 
causing the loss of jobs or unemployment insurance benefits is 
not a major problem. But it is for us.
<P>
	The impact on workers from eastern Canada and Quebec will 
then be considerable. Taking measures that penalize a specific 
region is dishonest and illogical. Those taxpayers pay taxes and 
contribute to the unemployment insurance system as much as 
other Canadian taxpayers. They give their share but do not get 
much in return.
<P>
	Once again, the federal government's approach shows us the 
importance of acting quickly to put an end to these 
irregularities. A sovereign Quebec could very well administer 
its unemployment insurance system. The cuts, or even the 
savings that the federal government is trying to achieve show us 
how our federal system is totally absurd, with its duplication 
that is costing Quebecers and Canadians millions of dollars 
every year. The Liberals cut where it is most painful because 
unemployment insurance recipients will be the first victims of 
this economic chaos.
<P>
	Let us have a look to the so-called jobs creation that is 
supposed to be generated by the premium reduction. At this 
point, the premium rate is $3.07 per $100 of income. The 
Liberals intend to reduce the premiums to $3.00 on January 1, 
1995. It should be reminded to Quebecers and Canadians that it 
is the Liberals who raised and voted in December the increase 
from $3.00 to $3.07.
<P>
	The Liberals figure that the reduction next year will result in 
the creation of 40,000 new jobs in 1996. There is no need for a 
comprhensive financial analysis to understand that there will be 
no job creation and that we will only maintain existing jobs. 
These are two very different notions that the Liberals do not 
seem to understand.
<P>
	Let us summarize in a simple way how unemployment 
insurance premiums went up and down. In 1993, they were at 
$3.00 for every $100 of income. In 1994, they were raised to 
$3.07 per $100. And they were supposed to reach $3.30 per $100 
by 1995.
<P>
	The new plan of the government is the following: $3.00 per 
$100 in 1993, $3.07 in 1994 and down again $3.00 in 1995. So 
we are back to the rate of 1993. Logically, as said Einstein, 
nothing is lost and nothing is created, but the Liberals do not 
understand that.
<P>
	That is not the way the Liberals figure it. According to them, 
if the previous calculation formula had been kept, we would 
have lost 9,000 jobs in 1994 and 31,000 others in 1995.
<P>
	By bringing the premiums back to $3.00 in 1995, the Liberals 
figure that 9,000 jobs will be saved in 1994 and 35,000 more in 
1995, for a total of 40,000 jobs created. This is totally false. As 
was said previously, a simple calculation gives a grand total of 
zero. As a matter of fact, the increase decided by the Liberals for 
the current year has brought a loss of 9,000 jobs. If premiums get 
back to their 1993 rate of $3.00, we will only recover 9,000 jobs. 
Quite a number! Therefore, we are not talking here about 40,000 
new jobs but about 31,000 jobs protected for 1995 and 9,000 
others lost the previous year but recovered.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	We should not try to mislead the public with such a vain 
promise. People are not so easily tricked any more. We must 
stop offering them empty shells and address the real problems. It 
is true that unemployment is a serious problem in Quebec and in 
Canada and we must not pretend we can solve it so easily.
<P>
	The government must stop believing it can be the sole source 
of job creation. As we said before, small and medium-sized 
businesses are and will remain the main source of job creation 
and we could reduce the unemployment rate, for example, by 
increasing government assistance to those employers. 
Everybody is eagerly awaiting the recovery but unfortunately it 
is a long time coming.
<P>
	Through its actions, the government must show a real will to 
fight down the economic difficulties that people of Quebec and 
Canada have been facing for too many years already. The trust 
they put in their leaders is not unconditional and we must show 
our constituents that the government really wants to get the 
country out of this economic abyss in which it is sinking and this 
is not what it is doing.
<P>
	They must stop making empty promises and developing 
legislations which have negative financial impacts on the 
public. They must instead show they really want to get out of 
this economic impasse.
<P>
	You might say that we criticize without proposing any 
solutions. Not so. My colleague from 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup has proposed amendments to 
Bill C-17 which could help reduce job losses.
<P>
	For example, why not lower the contribution to $3 per $100 
starting June 1, 1994, instead of waiting until January 1, 1995? 
This would mean 9,000 jobs, about 9,000 families who would 
not have to wait another six months. Can we afford 9,000 more 
unemployed? Certainly not. Do you not think that workers 
would prefer a salary rather than unemployment insurance 
payments, also reduced by Bill C-17 I might add?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4485"> 4485 </A></B>
<P>
	To conclude, we are faced with a bill which is unacceptable 
for a large portion of voters. We should stop trying to make 
people believe that they have something to gain, where there 
is in fact nothing to gain. The people will not be fooled again 
by the government. What they want is a real economic recovery, 
they want real jobs. Let us proceed towards the economic 
upturn that the population of my riding and Quebec has been 
expecting for too long now.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
was not going to participate in the debate but this morning I 
heard remarks by the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot 
and I could not resist the temptation to step in because of course 
what he said was an attempt to create a monster. He wanted to 
pretend that the government was a big bully boy, doing a bad 
thing in ramming the bill through the House.
<P>
	I thought it was useful to clarify the position so that the 
statements made by the hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, which were patently false, can be 
exposed for what they are. He knows that there have been no 
bullying tactics by the government on the bill. He tried to 
suggest the government was railroading this particular bill 
through the House.
<P>
	As parliamentary secretary to the House leader, who has been 
more than fair in his dealings in all matters in respect of House 
business, I felt that the record should be clarified. I want to do 
that.
<P>
	I cannot imagine where the hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot got his ideas, but I can only suspect 
that he went through <I>Hansard</I> for the last few years and read 
speeches by the Liberal opposition in the last Parliament.
<P>
	We were faced with a government that was using bully boy 
tactics all the time. It used closure a record number of times and 
time allocation a record number of times. He must have read our 
speeches, the only thing I can conclude, and decided he would 
make the same kind of speech himself at report stage of the bill 
because after all it is a budget bill.
<P>
	The last government used closure on almost every budget bill 
that it introduced. We have not used closure on the bill. I want to 
state that for the record. There has been no time allocation on the 
bill. The hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot has been 
given ample opportunity to express his views and he knows it. 
He tried to suggest otherwise this morning. That is why I am 
rising this afternoon: to correct the record.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	Let us look at what happened and let us not bother looking 
back at the old Liberal speeches in the last House. Let us look at 
the record that has gone on in Parliament in respect of the bill.
<P>
	The bill was introduced on March 16 and was called for 
second reading on March 25. Therefore nine days had elapsed 
between first and second reading. At second reading there was 
ample opportunity for members on all sides to read the bill and 
become familiar with its terms and indeed also for members of 
the public to obtain copies and become familiar with the terms 
of the bill.
<P>
	The bill was called for second reading on March 25. There 
were a number of speakers that day. It was called again on April 
11 and there were a number of speakers on that day as well. 
There were a number of speakers again on April 14. It was called 
again on April 15, when the bill was given second reading after 
the speeches ran out. There were no more speakers; speeches ran 
out on April 15.
<P>
	Seventy-one speakers participated in the debate. Some 
members spoke twice. I for one spoke twice. There was ample 
opportunity again for the hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot and all his colleagues to make 
speeches on second reading of the bill. Second reading occurred 
on April 15 and the bill was referred to the Standing Committee 
on Finance at that time.
<P>
	This morning the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot 
suggested it was rammed through the committee in a week. It 
was referred to the committee on April 19-I do not know why 
my record is different from the last day of debate on the 
15th-but it was referred at the latest by April 19 and it just 
came back from the committee yesterday.
<P>
	Where is this week the hon. member speaks of? That sounds to 
me like a lot more than a week. Yesterday was May 25 and the 
bill went to committee on April 19. Where is the week in here? 
That sounds like five weeks. What happened in this case was the 
hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot suddenly discovered 
there was some opposition to the bill and he had better oppose it 
because he had done nothing of any significance up to that time 
to oppose the bill.
<P>
	When the bill was in committee he discovered there were 
some opponents to it, so what did he do? He ran back to the 
<I>Hansard</I> for the last Parliament and pulled out the speeches 
saying: ``What do I do now?'' He read all the precedents and said 
that the first thing to do was to attack the government and make 
it look like a bully boy.
<P>
	In committee he tried to make it appear the government was a 
bully. He tried in the House in his speech this morning to make it 
appear the government was a bully. If he made it appear as 
though the government was a bully then maybe people would 
think the government was doing something wrong.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4486"> 4486 </A></B>
<P>
	The government is not doing anything wrong. This is a 
normal budget bill. It was introduced in the House with notice 
in the budget. The minister said what the bill was going to 
contain. It was introduced in the House on March 16 after the 
budget. It has been debated extensively in the House since that 
time. There have been 71 speakers on the bill at second reading 
stage. There were extended committee hearings and there was 
opportunity for five weeks of hearings.
<P>
	The hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot obviously 
took his time in the committee. He had ample opportunity to 
consider the bill in committee and this morning he had the nerve 
to stand in this House and rant and rave, whine and whimper a lot 
of stuff and nonsense about the government being a bully and 
ramming this bill through the House. Nothing could be further 
from the truth.
<P>
	We have not heard a peep about that kind of tactic from the 
Reform Party because it knows better. It knows the government 
has behaved with perfect propriety in this matter. It knows the 
government has dealt honourably with the opposition in giving 
ample opportunity for debate at all stages of the bill.
<P>
	We agreed by all-party agreement to limit debate to two days 
at report stage and one day at third reading. It was all-party 
agreement, but it is a good agreement. It is a reasonable time to 
debate the bill. Therefore we have all day today and all day 
Monday. They are long days.
<P>
	At the request of the opposition, we deliberately selected long 
days for the debate on the bill. Instead of having it on a Friday 
we put it on a Monday so there would be a long debate. At report 
stage everyone is limited to 10-minute speeches anyway so 
there is plenty of time for members to express their views. There 
is no bullying here. This is a fair and sensible arrangement in 
respect of the bill.
<P>
	Ample opportunity was granted at second reading. Ample 
opportunity was given to the Standing Committee on Finance 
and its subcommittee which considered the bill to review the 
bill.
<P>
	I know the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Finance spent endless hours listening to complaints and whining 
from the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot because he 
decided he had to oppose the bill late in the process. He has 
shown great patience in enduring hours of argument. I know 
members of the Reform Party have been subjected to the same 
kind of treatment, but we have all survived that.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	Why continue the whining today in the House? Why not 
acknowledge that the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot 
has made a good arrangement. He has had ample opportunity to 
express his opposition. Certainly he objects to the bill; he has 
reservations about it. I was in opposition once. I used to make 
speeches of the kind he made, but I had some reason for it.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brushett:</B> You did not whine.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> I had some reason for it and of course I did not 
whine.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leblanc:</B> Mr. Speaker, the parliamentary secretary has 
been speaking for the last five minutes about the way we deal 
with speeches, about the way we treated the people who came 
before the committee of the House of Commons.
<P>
	He did not address the real issue, which is Bill C-17. I think 
he is wasting our time. He says that we are wasting our time, but 
in fact he is the one who is wasting our time.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, please! It is not 
really a point of order. It is rather a matter of debate.
<P>
	To conclude his remarks, the Parliamentary Secretary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am almost finished, anyway.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am glad the hon. member is paying close attention to what I 
have to say.
<P>
	I wanted to say that the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Finance has been an exemplar of patience in his 
dealings on the bill. I know he has put up with a great deal. I 
know he has bent every nerve and every muscle to assist 
opposition members so that they have full opportunity to debate 
the bill in the House and in committee. That opportunity has 
been granted. This government is not using bully boy tactics to 
get the bill through the House.
<P>
	I can appreciate the hon. member has disagreement with parts 
of the bill. I recognize that in government sometimes tough 
decisions have to be made. However I respect the Minister of 
Finance for the decisions he has chosen to make in this case.
<P>
	I believe it was the hon. member for Terrebonne who 
suggested it was somehow improper for the Minister of Finance 
to make the changes he did and he could have reduced the rate of 
contribution to the unemployment insurance fund on January 1 
this year instead of next year. Yes, he could have. However, for 
financially and fiscally prudent reasons the minister chose not to 
do that. He chose to do it next year and I respect his decision in 
that regard.
<P>
	Frankly, the reception the minister has received from the 
Canadian press and the media and indeed from the business 
community generally has been very positive for this budget. 
This is notwithstanding the cries from the Reform Party that 
deficit slashing did not go far enough and notwithstanding the 
cries from Bloc Quebecois members along the same lines. They 
have also complained about the lack of deficit reduction.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	I see my time is running out. I could go on at length on this 
bill. I appreciate the opportunity to address my remarks and to 
explain the government's tactics in respect of this legislation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Péloquin (Brome-Missisquoi):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the federal government introduces today its Bill C-17 resulting 
from the budget that the Minister of Finance tabled in this House 
a few weeks ago.
<P>
	The measures respecting unemployment insurance which are 
contained in that bill have two purposes. First, the minister 
wants to get the national treasury back on a sound financial 
footing by taking the money out of the pockets of most 
unemployed in Canada. Second, he is trying to give us the 
illusion that this bill contains fair measures for those who have 
lost their jobs.
<P>
	The minister must have performed numerous legislative 
contortions in order to meet the two targets he had set himself. 
You will recognize, Mr. Speaker, that Bill C-17, as most of the 
initiatives that this government has introduced in this House 
since the beginning of its mandate, lacks cohesion and 
consistency, which is the least one can say.
<P>
	The Liberals have always bragged about being the ones who 
had introduced social programs in Canada and who have really 
promoted them.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	How many times during the last campaign have we heard them 
speak about the importance of preserving the integrity of these 
programs? God knows that they rent their clothes in public, 
when they were in the opposition! At that time, nothing seemed 
more important than our social programs. Every single time that 
the Conservatives dared propose any minor amendment to the 
Unemployment Insurance Act, the Liberals were quick to once 
again defend the Canadian social safety net.
<P>
	The current Prime Minister of Canada was seeing himself as 
the Canadian Robin Hood, great protector of widows and 
orphans, always ready to come to the rescue of the poorest of the 
poor. At the time, he kept stressing the importance for Canada to 
clearly distinguish itself from the United States and kept saying 
that the best way to do so was to maintain the quality of the 
social programs provided to Canadians. The unemployment 
insurance seemed then to be on the list of programs sacred to our 
friend Robin.
<P>
	But the noble philosophy of our Liberal companions seems to 
have changed dramatically since they came to office. It appears 
that the new Minister of Finance had no difficulty in taking over 
the role of the Sheriff of Nottingham which I must admit, seems 
to be made for him.
<P>
	As insensitive and ruthless as the famous character of the 
legend, not only has he continued to grossly overtax Canadians, 
he has also decided to attack without mercy  the most vulnerable 
among us: the elderly and the unemployed.
<P>
	With bill C-17, the rate of UI benefits drops from 57 to 55 per 
cent of insurable income.
<P>
	The very first goal that the Minister of Finance had set for 
himself when he tabled the budget has been achieved. We will 
save money on the backs of the unemployed and the deficit will 
be partly paid by those who are basically victims of the federal 
government'a mismanagement of public funds.
<P>
	It is certainly not by choice that some find themselves in the 
difficult situation of the unemployed. The problem is rooted in 
the federal employment policies of the last 30 years. The lack of 
any long term vision in areas like job training is the only factor 
responsible for the precariousness of employment.
<P>
	The minister's second goal was to create the illusion that his 
proposed measures were equitable and progressive. So, he 
decided to provide relief to 15 per cent of those affected by his 
bill. Thus, he is increasing the benefit rate of low-income 
unemployed with dependents from 57 to 60 per cent. As if 
Canadians were too stupid to realize that the government is 
taking away millions of dollars from the unemployed only to 
give hand-outs to a select few. The relief promised by the 
minister is only an illusion and we did not buy it this time. 
Canadians, and especially Quebecers, are no longer fooled.
<P>
	Last year, the Prime Minister kept repeating that Canadians 
were lucky because they could benefit from social programs. He 
kept saying how envious Americans were of our social security 
system. Perhaps he should be reminded that, in several 
American States, unemployment insurance benefits are 
approximately 50 per cent of average insurable earnings. By 
cutting the rate from 57 to 55 per cent for most claimants, the 
Liberals are doing precisely what they always said the 
Conservatives were doing: bringing our standard of living more 
and more in line with that of the Americans. There is really 
nothing to brag about, Mr. Speaker.

	The situation here is becoming dangerously similar to that in 
the United States and the Liberals have done nothing about it 
since they came into office. Bill C-17 is but one example among 
many of the lack of respect this government has for the people. 
Our national Robin Hood has lost a lot of his prestige since being 
put in charge of the Canadian Sherwood Forest.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4488"> 4488 </A></B>
<P>
	Indeed, up to now, the Liberals have reneged on so many of 
their election promises and taken so many measures that 
contradict their traditional philosophy that Canadians and 
Quebecers came to see the government as a very little Little 
John.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before resuming debate, 
it is my duty pursuant to Standing Order 38 to inform the House 
that the questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment 
are as follows: the hon. member for Yukon-Trade; the hon. 
member for London-Middlesex-Food labelling; the hon. 
member for Vancouver Quadra-Pacific salmon treaty.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am 
glad to speak to this bill and I would like to ask some questions 
in this House. For example, what is an unemployed person?
<P>
	In my riding of Matapédia-Matane, an unemployed person is 
someone who does not want to be unemployed. It is someone 
who wants to work. I find that the Liberal infrastructure program 
is a joke, because it does not provide work in our area, or so 
little.
<P>
	In my riding, we decided to seek out our own solutions. We 
made incredible efforts, but we still have many unemployed 
persons who are receiving UI benefits. It is not because they 
want to receive benefits. It is because they are forced to be 
unemployed, and I will tell you why. We live far away from large 
centres, like Quebec City, Montreal and of course Toronto. A lot 
of things are going to Toronto.
<P>
	In my riding, it is very hard to organize further processing, 
which means that everything we produce materially, physically, 
goes outside the region. So economic activity is of course very 
seasonal. People would love to have second or third stage 
processing. We have been asking for it forever, but we are told 
that since transportation is so costly, we cannot have second or 
third stage processing.
<P>
	In our area, we have wood. Last year, we were declared 
forestry capital of Canada. It was marvellous. But when it comes 
to the second or third stage of processing-such as lobster traps 
or snow fences-we cannot even do that in our region. You want 
to know why? Because transportation costs are too high. It 
means that we have to ship the whole lot to be processed outside. 
But people want to work.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	Do you know what we have done in my area? We decided to 
band together and set up what we called Operation Dignity. It 
involved people who took matters into their own hands, who did 
incredible things, investing all their energy and even their 
money to achieve something. With the first Operation Dignity, 
we managed to create a few jobs, but it was not enough. So, what 
did we do? We formed grassroots movements, marched in  the 
streets, rattled the governments a little and finally got certain 
things. It was not much, though. To create a few jobs we had to 
expend a lot of energy.
<P>
	And now what is the Liberal government proposing to do? 
People in my riding have tried very hard, setting up 
development corporations where owners would get together to 
create jobs. They would share their woodlots, telling others to 
come and work on their woodlots, which they did. It worked, but 
now we are wondering if this will continue, if they will be 
generous enough-you must invest in forestry-if they will give 
us our fair share, a share we can claim as our own with great 
dignity. We are not even sure if the Canada-Quebec program, 
the federal-provincial agreements will be renewed.
<P>
	For us, they mean employment, but we cannot even be sure 
that the program will be renewed in the east. For people living in 
Montreal, Toronto or Vancouver, an increase of two 
weeks-from 10 to 12 weeks-in the qualifying period may not 
be too significant, but for those living in our region, two weeks 
can be an incredibly long period of time. Winters in our part of 
the country are long. When I left Matapédia and reached 
Montmagny, the trees were just starting to bud. Here, the Tulip 
Festival is under way, when back home, the tulips are not yet in 
bloom. The natural resources committee was planning to cancel, 
if it has not already done so, its scheduled visit to my riding, 
supposedly because the logging roads were still snow-covered. 
That is not quite true and I was rather angry that they would 
consider cancelling their visit, ostensibly for this reason.
<P>
	The season is quite short in our region. And when this is the 
case, one or two weeks can make a big difference as far as 
unemployment is concerned. It could mean ten additional weeks 
of benefits. That is what is absurd. Everyone says that Canada is 
a vast, beautiful country. However, I find it quite sad that 
disparities exist. One another point we need to consider is that 
each region is unique. Companies have come and created jobs. 
In the forestry sector, the federal-provincial agreement is based 
on a 50/50 arrangement.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	And now, it seems we are not sure if we are going to renew this 
agreement, the Eastern Development Plan, for another five 
years. What does that mean? It means that we are constantly 
living in a state of uncertainty.
<P>
	The situation is terrible at home. Elsewhere in Canada, it may 
not be so bad, but I am talking about the area I know best, and I 
can tell you that the situation back home is terrible. Can the 
members opposite realize that going from 10 to 12 weeks, to use 
only that example, can have more serious consequences in my 
area that elsewhere in the country?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4489"> 4489 </A></B>
<P>
	Things are even worse in the Magdalen Islands. The 
fishermen have a highly seasonal job and work only for six to 
seven weeks. Sometimes, for ten weeks maximum. In their 
case, however much we try, whatever we come up with, if we 
cannot keep them working for a bit longer, what do we do?
<P>
	If people cannot work for 12 weeks in the Magdalen Islands, 
what are they going to do? They will have to rely on income 
security. In other words, the federal government is transferring 
the problem to the provinces and having them pay for it all. Is 
that what equalization is all about? I really wonder, I hope not.
<P>
	Back home, if we go from 57 per cent to 55 per cent, it is 
almost a tragedy. If people took to the streets for Operation 
Rural Dignity and for the Ralliement populaire, what are they 
going to do now?
<P>
	I do not advocate violence at any time. I want the people to 
stay calm, but I know tension is high and I hope that members 
opposite will understand that, in some areas in Canada and in 
Quebec, something needs to be done, if not, I do not know what 
will happen. When there is no food on the table, what is left for 
you to do? What is next?
<P>
	Patience, of course. You can always try to create your own 
job, of course. But maybe there is something else that can be 
done, something for the members opposite to do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Mr. Speaker, I also would like to 
support the amendments by my colleague for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup dealing with the premium 
increases. Of course, he wants to come back to the previous level 
of premiums for the workers as well as for the businesses.
<P>
	I also support the amendments by my colleague for Mercier, 
who is afraid that the Minister of Human Resources 
Development will use the Unemployment Insurance Bill to 
increase his power over regions where pilot projects will be 
implemented.
<P>
	That is why she suggests that these amendments or clauses be 
at least approved by a resolution of the House of Commons. 
There is also the amendment by my colleague for 
Saint-Hyacinthe, who naturally proposes to delete clause 28. 
For the benefit of our audience, clause 28 has to do with the 
number of weeks one will now have to work to be eligible for 
unemployment insurance benefits.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	I want to remind members that this bill reduces the benefit 
period, increases the qualifying period and reduces the benefits 
from 57 to 55 per cent of the claimant's average weekly 
insurable earnings.
<P>
	The role of a member of Parliament is to represent the opinion 
of his or her constituents, among other things. Like my 
colleague from Matapédia, I met with many people over the last 
few months and I will use the testimony of those people who 
came to my constituency  office in the riding of Lévis to tell me 
why they were opposed to these cuts in the unemployment 
insurance program. They are very significant cuts, $1.3 billion a 
year. That is $300 million more than the infrastructure project 
that the government intends to implement in cooperation with 
the municipalities and the provincial governments. By the way, 
if there is a level of government for which this job creation 
program will be less costly, it is the federal government since it 
will be able to recoup part of its investment through income tax 
and GST revenues.
<P>
	But I do not want to stray away from the subject, which is 
unemployment insurance. So, $1.3 billion in cuts is very 
significant. What are my constituents telling me? First of all, I 
will tell you about an important group, the workers of MIL 
Davie. Some members opposite are smiling, but I can assure you 
that there is no reason to smile. The members opposite should 
listen instead of smiling. They do not bother to listen and they 
keep laughing when we deal with the plight of hundreds of 
workers at MIL Davie. The workforce there was 3,000 strong 
last year, but the number of workers is down to only 1,200 now 
and should drop to a mere 700 or 800 in the coming weeks. The 
very survival of the MIL Davie shipyard is in jeopardy. Why? 
Because, among other things, the Minister of Industry, as he 
confirmed today, does not intend to implement new programs to 
help military industries convert to civil production.
<P>
	The government turns a deaf ear to MIL Davie concerning the 
Magdalen Islands ferry. It turns a deaf ear concerning the smart 
ship too, when it could help this industry which gave jobs to 
3,000 workers last year. When the Liberal Party was writing and 
publicizing its red book, there were 3,000 workers there when 
the Prime Minister came to meet them one week before the end 
of the election campaign. He told them he would look after the 
shipyard. What did he do? Nothing. In that same campaign, the 
present Prime Minister said during the leaders' debate that he 
did not intend to cut social programs. What does he do now? 
Through Bill C-17, he slashes $1.3 billion in the unemployment 
insurance program. So much for the MIL Davie workers.
<P>
	Construction workers also fell on hard times; they are still 
going through hard times. They experience seasonal 
unemployment. They came to my riding office, and to those of 
all members in my area, including that of the Prime Minister, to 
tell him that this situation is intolerable.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	The situation is problematic in the construction industry. 
Some degree of security is required. Unemployment insurance 
provided that security. Now it is being cut. At the time, jobs 
were created through the job development program which was 
funded in part by UI funds. Hundreds of organizations in Quebec 
and Canada are waiting for an answer from the government  in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4490"> 4490 </A></B>
<P>
the form of job development programs. Months have gone by 
and they are still waiting.
<P>
	You know, not all the blame lays with this government. Just 
before the election, the previous government had emptied the 
tills of the job development program and incurred commitments 
that carried over into the current fiscal year. What does this 
government do? It announces a social program reform 
sometimes used to cover up a certain lack of decisiveness, but 
pilot projects are supposedly essential. As far as youth programs 
are concerned, I am the youth spokesman and young people have 
told me how precarious their situation is in Quebec, with 19 per 
cent of workers between the ages of 20 and 24 out of a job. That 
is 19 per cent. In Canada, 400,000 young people are unemployed 
and, during that time, the government introduces bills to tell 
them to study longer at the price of getting further into debt. UI 
benefit rates are reduced while the qualifying period is 
extended. At some point, young people who got jobs best 
described as menial, sometimes a combination of part-time jobs 
found here and there, find themselves incapable of meeting the 
UI entrance requirement. What are they facing then? Welfare.
<P>
	What are they offering? The Youth Service Corps. After 
starting at $61 a week in the fall, 2,500 young Canadians will see 
their weekly salary rise to $150. They then dare to cut 
unemployment insurance.
<P>
	When this government was in opposition, they fought with the 
former Minister of Employment whom I can name, Mr. 
Valcourt-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> He was incompetent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Yes, he was incompetent but you are doing what he 
did and worse. You are following in the previous government's 
footsteps. You continue to reduce the number of weeks of 
benefits while you increase, let rise or implement the planned 
premium hikes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robichaud:</B> You are shouting.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Yes, I am shouting, sir, because the situation is 
troubling and tragic. This is no time to laugh while there are 
hundreds of thousands of unemployed people who are now 
listening to us and who are suffering. That is what we hear from 
the people in our ridings.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order! I understand that 
this is a very important subject, which leads to a lively debate. 
All the same, I would like to give the floor for the few minutes 
that remain to the hon. member for Lévis.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, I not only seem indignant, I am 
indignant about the insensitivity now being shown to the poorest 
people in our society. These are not people who go to cocktails 
or to social activities to which members of Parliament are 
invited and which I attend as little as possible but only when I 
believe it is useful for making representations.
<P>
	Meanwhile, these people's purchasing power is declining. It 
is not a trivial thing. Purchasing power to do  what? To pay rent, 
buy food, get what their children need to go to school. Every day 
in my riding, my region, the Quebec City region, the Lower 
Town of Quebec, I see people who did not go and have a good 
time on the weekend, hundreds of families that sometimes are 
on their last week before they go on welfare. They are worried 
about what they will eat. We should not laugh. We must act. I 
think that when the government wanted to reform social 
programs, it should have sent another message, one of hope, not 
a message of lower spending on social programs, but a plan for 
work-
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Jobs, jobs, jobs!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> But we are still waiting for your jobs!
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I will not let myself be provoked by that. I will 
calm down and ask this government, while it is still time, to 
make C-17 consistent with the positions it took when it was in 
opposition and to be sensitive also to what thousands of workers 
did on May 1 in various large cities in this country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I have only just begun to prepare this speech, I will 
rely on you to stop me if I run over my time.
<P>
	While Bill C-17 contains parts which are acceptable to me, I 
would have preferred that the government had introduced 
separate bills for each act for which it is suggesting changes. In 
particular, I would have preferred the changes to the 
Unemployment Insurance Act to be a separate bill.
<P>
	As we know the government's budget proposed changes to the 
unemployment insurance program. We support the direction of 
the changes, the reduction in benefits, the increases in the 
qualifying period and the reduction in the employer premiums. 
However we in the Reform Party feel that the government did 
not go far enough.
<P>
	The proposed changes or amendments could have gone much 
further. This is a good time to state that the Reform Party 
supports the return of unemployment insurance to its original 
function, an employer-employee funded and administered 
program to provide temporary income in the event of 
unexpected job loss.
<P>
	Is that not the purpose of such a program? Should it not be a 
self-sustainable program? Is it supposed to serve a purpose? 
Yes, it is supposed to serve a purpose; unexpected job loss, 
unplanned job loss. Yet in Canada we have seasonal workers 
who go on unemployment every year like clock work.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4491"> 4491 </A></B>
<P>
	If the Canadian economy were flush, if it were abundant in 
a surplus of tax dollars unused and needing or waiting for a 
recipient, okay, great. Then perhaps we could understand this 
abuse of our tax dollars. We all know that the premiums paid 
through the unemployment insurance plan do not even begin 
to cover the cost of our current program.
<P>
	However the program is not working as it was set out to work, 
as a sincere and caring effort to help those in need who through 
perhaps no fault of their own were suddenly without a job and 
therefore income. Those people pay into the unemployment 
insurance plan in good faith, hoping it is there for them if they 
ever need it.
<P>
	The unemployment insurance act was first passed in 1940 and 
has been amended many times. When it began in 1941 UI was 
limited to full time wage earners. Part time workers as well as 
salaried employees with high pay and good job security were 
excluded. The subsequent history of the plan has been its step by 
step expansion to include high risk seasonal workers as well as 
low risk workers, civil servants and teachers. About 90 per cent 
of Canadian workers are now included although MPs and 
senators have not chosen to include themselves, yet.
<P>
	Particularly noteworthy were the reforms undertaken by the 
Liberal government in 1971 when Bryce Mackasey was the 
responsible minister. Mr. Mackasey made UI much more 
generous and introduced regionally extended and maternity 
benefits.
<P>
	Subsequent studies and reforms have tried to undo the damage 
but progress has been limited. The Conservative government 
appointed the Forget commission in 1985 but did not have the 
courage to act upon its excellent report. The changes made by 
the Tories in 1990, higher contributions, stiffer conditions for 
eligibility and directing some benefits to job training were in the 
right direction but far from sufficient.
<P>
	How should unemployment insurance be reformed?
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	Decades of politically inspired manipulation have produced 
grave defects in the Canadian unemployment insurance program 
and system. It is discriminatory. The combination of regional 
entrance requirements and regionally extended benefits means 
that claimants are treated more generously in regions of the 
country where the unemployment rate is higher.
<P>
	The result is unfair inequality between individuals. Simply by 
living in a certain place, one person may be entitled to far 
greater UI benefits than another even though both have 
contributed equally to the plan.
<P>
	It increases unemployment. After the Liberals reformed UI in 
1971, the Canadian plan became the most generous in the world. 
Overly generous benefits create what economists call induced 
unemployment. In plain English, people are tempted to slow 
down their job search to take maximum advantage of their 
benefits.
<P>
	It creates despondency and dependency, for one certainly 
brings on the other. When one can work 10 weeks and collect UI 
benefits for 40 weeks there is little incentive to switch to a more 
stable employment. Extending UI to fishermen and other 
seasonal workers has had the perverse effect of encouraging 
workers to remain in declining industries. It has become an 
inefficient income support plan rather than social insurance.
<P>
	Politicians have loaded so many special features on to the UI, 
regional preference, coverage of seasonal workers, benefits for 
pregnancy, child birth and adoption and so on, that the original 
purpose of providing temporary income in case of unforeseeable 
and unintentional job loss has been lost.
<P>
	These and other problems of UI have been pointed out in 
several studies, most notably the one I have just mentioned, the 
Forget commission appointed by the Conservatives in 1985 
when they first came to power. The Conservatives lacked the 
courage to do what all impartial students of UI agree needs to be 
done; namely, reform the system so that it treats people equally, 
bring benefits into line with those paid in other countries and 
stop using UI to subsidize seasonal industries. Rather, stand up 
to the entrenched special interests.
<P>
	The Tories conveniently decided to forget Forget. The Reform 
policy, in contrast, is to make UI a sensible, sustainable program 
of social insurance. As with all social programs, reform will be 
undertaken prudently with due regard to the expectations that 
people have been led to develop. It would be desirable to phase 
in reform of UI at a high point of the business cycle when 
unemployment is relatively low.
<P>
	To finish and sum up, the Reform Party will return 
unemployment insurance to its original and basically sound 
purpose of providing temporary income in case of unexpected 
job loss.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Mr. Speaker, earlier, you said 
this was a very important debate. I think you are absolutely 
right.
<P>
	Just now I listened to the parliamentary secretary who said 
that since March 15, there had been very extensive debates 
during which people had plenty of time to express their views. 
He is right. There was a lot of debate and a lot of consultation in 
committee. This went on for a long time. We heard testimony 
from business and the unemployed. The committee even 
travelled across Canada to hear people's views. The 
government, however, failed to act on what it heard. And that is 
what is so unfortunate.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4492"> 4492 </A></B>
<P>
	Today, we are told there was a lot of consultation, a lot of 
debate. Of course there was, but this afternoon they were saying 
there had been more than enough debate and that we had to vote 
on this bill as soon as possible. That is not playing fair. It is 
unfair and misleading to tell the public that there was a lot of 
consultation. Oh, yes, there was, but no one was listening. 
Recommendations were ignored, and that is the problem.
<P>
	To Quebecers, these measures are quite a shock.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	We have an unemployment rate of 12.6 per cent, while the 
Canadian average is 11 per cent. This means that there are 1.6 
per cent more unemployed than in the rest of Canada.
<P>
	It means we have more unemployment, and reducing the 
number of benefit weeks means reducing the amount of money 
the federal government invests in Quebec. This means it will be 
up to Quebec to support people when their unemployment 
insurance runs out, and Quebec will spend millions of dollars 
more as a result of this measure.
<P>
	And that is also why we are in no hurry to pass a bill which has 
such a negative impact on Quebec. And another good reason is 
that the government keeps bragging about creating jobs, saying 
that if it creates jobs there will be less unemployment and that 
would solve part of the problem.
<P>
	Unfortunately, so far, since it came into office, this 
government has not taken any action to indicate that it will 
reduce unemployment. It started by raising unemployment 
insurance premiums, since we are talking about unemployment 
today, and these premiums will cost companies and individuals 
about $800 million.
<P>
	This means taking $800 million out of the pockets of 
consumers. It means people will have $800 million less to 
spend. If this is supposed to create jobs, the government is really 
out to lunch. It says it will inject about the same amount into its 
infrastructures program.
<P>
	Infrastructures will be a three-year project, while 
unemployment insurance will be around for much longer. Which 
means that absolutely nothing has been accomplished. The 
number of jobs created by the infrastructures program will have 
zero impact as a result of the increase in unemployment 
insurance premiums.
<P>
	Neither infrastructures nor unemployment insurance reform 
will in the end create more jobs. The government also intends to 
raise personal income tax by $1.5 billion over the next three 
years and will do the same in the case of corporate taxes. 
Altogether this means $3 billion, at a rate of $1 billion annually. 
One billion dollars in corporate and personal tax increases.
<P>
	Here again, consumers will have $1 billion less to spend. And 
of course, most of this money will be used to pay interest to 
American, Japanese or European lenders. It will not be used to 
create jobs. It will not be used in Canada. This money will leave 
the country.
<P>
	If the government expects to create jobs with the timid 
measures it has put in place, it is in for a surprise. There will 
definitely be no jobs created as a result of these measures.
<P>
	If any jobs are created, they will be generated by small 
businesses which innovate and thus create jobs. So basically, the 
government has no long term vision.
<P>
	The government is taking stopgap measures. Instead of 
resurfacing the entire road, it is merely filling up the potholes. It 
does the trick for a while, but it is lacking any real long- term 
vision.
<P>
	These are merely bandaid solutions. They stop the bleeding 
momentarily, but do not attack the root of the problem. There 
are, of course, other well-known and obvious solutions to these 
fundamental problems, but the government continues to ignore 
them. It has its reasons, reasons with which the Bloc Quebecois 
disagrees.
<P>
	The first reason is that the government is being told to be a 
centralizing government. It keeps on trying to take over 
manpower, health and education, whereas these fields come 
under provincial jurisdiction. Duplication is an extremely costly 
phenomenon. It is costly not only in dollar terms, but in terms of 
inefficiency. There is considerable lack of cohesion between the 
projects, programs and regulations of the provincial 
government-particularly the Quebec government with which I 
am most familiar-and those of the federal government. This 
lack of cohesion hinders operations and prevents small and 
medium-sized businesses from flourishing and expanding as 
much as they could.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	Our businesses must have the opportunity to expand if jobs 
are to be created. That is how we must go about creating jobs, 
not by increasing UI premiums or by penalizing the jobless. One 
does not create employment by penalizing the jobless or social 
assistance recipients. One creates jobs by giving our small and 
medium-sized businesses what they need to flourish. And this 
government is doing exactly the opposite of that.
<P>
	The folly of this Liberal government is its determination to be 
a centralizing government. It wants to control everything from 
Ottawa. That is crazy. Everyone knows that decentralization is 
the key to economic growth. Major corporations such as General 
Motors and Ford are experts at decentralization. They turn over 
responsibility to their plants and have them compete directly 
with one another. The federal government, on the other hand, 
wants to control everything. That is ridiculous and that is why 
Canada is heading toward bankruptcy.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="4493"> 4493 </A></B>
<P>
	Day after day, we are digging ourselves deeper and deeper 
into debt and everyone knows it. The business community and 
international investors know it. Where are investors putting 
their money today? They are investing it in the United States, 
in Europe, in Japan or in Asia. They are no longer investing 
on the same scale as they used to in Canada. Why is this? 
Because the economic climate is not beneficial. The basic 
employment problem is due to the fact that Canada does not 
handle its affairs in a way that benefits our businesses, so they 
leave the country. Finally, according to a Canadian Chamber 
of Commerce survey, 20 per cent of Canadian businesses are 
leaving or are about to leave Canada to move to the United 
States. That is tragic.
<P>
	The government itself creates unemployment by stubbornly 
trying to manage everything from here. How can the federal 
government adopt national laws and regulations when Quebec's 
economic culture is totally different from that of Ontario, the 
Maritimes or Western Canada? To withstand international 
competition and freer trade, our businesses must become 
sophisticated competitors. To help them achieve this goal, we 
must stop hindering them as is now the case. Do not look any 
further, that is what is happening.
<P>
	The government should invest a little more in technology and 
make more equitable choices. It gave Ontario $1.2 million more 
than Quebec for science and technology; that is what creates the 
most unemployment in Quebec. I made another very important 
discovery this week. According to a study, Ontario has 100,000 
more federal public service jobs than Quebec. Again, this 
represents a very significant amount. Quebec has more 
unemployment than Ontario because it is very poorly served by 
the federal government. That is why we want Quebec to become 
sovereign.

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I just want to remind the 
hon. member for Calgary North before I give her the floor that at 
5.30 I must move to Private Members' Business.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
sure members of the House will be very sad that I only have 
three or four minutes. It is very interesting to me that members 
of the Bloc keep urging the goose to lay more golden eggs while 
at the same time they want to kill the goose.
<P>
	I thought I might throw into the debate a few observations. I 
am indebted to Mrs. Karen Selick for some of this material.
<P>
	These days in Canada our unemployment rate is over 11 per 
cent. Most probably know that, but what most of us probably do 
not know is that the unemployment rate in Hong Kong is about 
1.5 per cent. That is the rate at which economists consider to be 
full employment. Those 1.5 per cent are primarily people in the 
process of changing jobs. About 1.5 per cent of our over 11 per 
cent  are unemployed for the same reason, but what about the 
other 10 per cent?
<P>
	With 1997 fast approaching and many Hong Kong residents 
scrambling to find a way out before China takes over, one would 
expect that Hong Kong would be going through a major 
economic recession complete with a high unemployment rate. 
Strangely it is not. Why? It is in part because it has no 
unemployment insurance.
<P>
	There is a hypothesis that the existence of unemployment 
insurance increases unemployment. This hypothesis has been 
proven correct by economists. Economic theory can predict and 
explain this result and empirical studies have validated the 
theory.
<P>
	I thought members of this House should have these 
scintillating facts before them as they consider this issue.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I must confess the 
member's timing was pretty good.
<P>
	It being 5.30 p.m., the House will now proceed to the 
consideration of Private Members' Business as listed on today's 
Order Paper.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="WITNESSPROTECTIONACT">WITNESS PROTECTION ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from April 20 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-206, an act to provide for the relocation and 
protection of witnesses, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rex Crawford (Kent):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak today 
for two reasons. One reason is to thank the hon. member for 
Scarborough West for bringing the important issue of witness 
protection before the House today.
<P>
	As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Solicitor General 
rightly pointed out in the first hour of debate, the member 
deserves the thanks of all hon. members for his many months of 
hard work on this bill, for his determination and commitment to 
this issue and many other significant justice related issues. He is 
to be commended. His commitment and dedication reflect credit 
on the entire House.
<P>
	My second reason for rising to speak to one aspect of Bill 
C-206 is the question of the scope of a protection program. 
More specifically, I would like to examine in some depth the 
categories of persons who might be deemed eligible for 
protection under a witness protection program.
<P>
	We are all familiar with the concept of protecting crown 
witnesses who provide testimony against criminals. This group 
is the focus of the bill we are being asked to consider today. I am 
sure members recognize that court proceedings are the 
culmination of many months or even years of diligent work by 
enforcement authorities and prosecutors.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4494"> 4494 </A></B>
<P>
	Witnesses are crucial to this process, but there is also another 
group of persons whose activities are equally important and 
who often operate at great personal risk. These people inhabit 
that shadowy nether world between the courtroom and the 
criminal underworld. I am speaking here of informants, or 
sources as they are typically referred to by police, and of 
agents.
<P>
	The activities of both of these categories of persons are often 
crucial to the process of building a case that can be taken to 
court. Sources are persons who pass information to the police on 
the activities of criminals. They are usually paid for their 
actions and not infrequently are criminals themselves.
<P>
	As with witnesses, sources run the risk of violent retribution 
if their co-operation with authorities is exposed. Betrayal is not 
treated lightly in the violent criminal subcultures and 
retribution can often mean death.
<P>
	Agents are not only paid sources of information. They often 
take on another role. As the word agent suggests, persons of this 
category acting at the direction of the police can undertake 
specific actions to help further investigations.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	For example, during drug investigations an agent can be used 
to introduce an undercover police officer to the criminal suspect 
or suspects. Performing the agent role can involve additional 
risk as one is not only providing information but also actively 
working against individual criminals or organized crime 
networks. Such work by its very nature entails greater risk of 
exposure.
<P>
	Most sources and agents are motivated by the prospect of 
money and there may be little or no altruistic dimension to their 
behaviour. Despite their suspect motives the employment of 
such persons is necessary. The use of sources and agents is 
fundamental to our dealing effectively with organized crime and 
protecting such persons is often the only way to guarantee their 
co-operation.
<P>
	The promise of protection also allows us to neutralize the 
weapons of fear and violence that criminals use to cow potential 
sources into submission.
<P>
	Protection programs offer safe havens for criminals fearing 
for their safety. Their only option may be turning themselves 
over to the authorities. We must address these types of issues in 
a comprehensive manner if we are to construct strong and 
lasting legislation.
<P>
	For this reason and because the activities of sources and 
agents are so fundamental to police investigations we must 
consider fully the categories of persons to be included in any 
protection program.
<P>
	In this context, I would like very quickly to outline for the 
House my understanding of the situation in the United States, as 
I feel it is instructive to our examination of this bill.
<P>
	The U.S. marshal service witness security program began 
operation in 1971. The program only deals with organized 
criminal activity or other serious offences. As its title suggests, 
the program is limited to providing protection for those persons 
testifying in major federal criminal proceedings. Police sources 
who do not provide testimony in court are not eligible for the 
program.
<P>
	We have to bear in mind that the intent of the U.S. marshal's 
program is to elicit testimony that will convict major criminals. 
With a caseload of 500 witnesses per year the program is fully 
occupied with these witnesses alone. Police sources who do not 
testify remain the responsibility of the police. This restriction 
could create difficulties for Canadian enforcement.
<P>
	Before acting we must deliberately and carefully explore 
what categories of people should be covered by any future 
Canadian witness protection program. If we move in haste we 
run the risk of limiting ourselves as the Americans have done 
with their federal program.
<P>
	Certainly we may wish to be restrictive about the types of 
cases in which protection can be granted. To restrict a protection 
program to witnesses alone would in my opinion be 
self-defeating without a great deal more in depth consideration 
of the underlying issues.
<P>
	Other related issues that might be dealt with in the legislation 
are questions of how parolees or probationers can receive 
protection while serving their sentences.
<P>
	Practical issues aside, I also believe that the state has a moral 
responsibility to protect people who assist the authorities in 
criminal investigations. I believe this holds true even 
recognizing that the unsavoury character of many persons in the 
protection program makes them in the public eye unworthy 
recipients of taxpayers' dollars.
<P>
	I would re-emphasize, however, that unsavoury or not, 
protection arrangements are crucial to effective enforcement 
action against criminals and organized crime. The proposed act 
to provide for the relocation and protection of witnesses has 
raised an important issue. We now have the opportunity of using 
the bill as a starting point to take comprehensive action on the 
issue of providing protective services for people who assist the 
authorities during criminal investigations and prosecutions.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	In my view this may mean going beyond the boundaries of the 
protection program proposed in the current bill by examining 
how protective services could be provided to the full range of 
categories of witnesses, sources and agents. Anything less 
would be a disservice to the intent and spirit of the bill and to the 
hon. member who sponsored it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4495"> 4495 </A></B>
<P>
	I congratulate the member for Scarborough West. He and I 
share the same views on most other matters as well. It was a 
pleasure for me to take part in the debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to speak in the debate on Bill C-206, an Act 
to provide for the relocation and protection of witnesses.
<P>
	The hon. member for Scarborough West, the sponsor of this 
bill, deserves to be commended by all of us in this House for 
raising an issue that concerns law enforcement agencies not only 
in Canada but throughout the world.
<P>
	For ten years, the need to protect witnesses has steadily 
grown, in direction proportion to increasing violence by 
criminals who act on their own or belong to organized crime. We 
need only remember the television news last night and this 
morning where threats were made; I am thinking of threats made 
in Italy against some judges and others by a criminal when he 
appeared in court. For this reason alone, then, the hon. 
member's bill is pertinent and certainly timely.
<P>
	In the proceedings on Bill C-206, the Source-Witness 
Protection Program of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police was 
often mentioned. For obvious reasons, the RCMP is reluctant to 
disclose anything at all on this subject. Nevertheless, since it is 
the main program of this kind in Canada, we must have an idea 
of its extent and effectiveness to properly understand all the 
issues raised by this private member's bill.
<P>
	This is why I am pleased to have this opportunity to present to 
the House a general outline of the RCMP's Source-Witness 
Protection Program.
<P>
	First, let me put the program in its context. Source-Witness 
protection programs were always closely related to organized 
crime investigations. The expression ``organized crime'' 
includes various criminal activities, including the smuggling of 
large quantities of drugs, murders, aggravated assaults, money 
laundering, as well as extortion and robbery. As you know, it 
was strongly contended that organized crime was responsible 
for the smuggling activities in my riding, in your riding, and 
elsewhere.
<P>
	More often than not, the perpetrators of these crimes also use 
fear and intimidation to make sure that witnesses and possible 
informants remain silent. However, the protection of witnesses 
now has a much greater scope. It is disturbing to see that, over 
the last few years, individual criminals have started to rely on 
fear and intimidation too. Let me go back to the comments I 
made earlier. These people are prepared to do anything to avoid 
being found guilty or to take revenge on witnesses.
<P>
	Consequently, an increasing number of citizens need 
protection because of their role in cases which have nothing to 
do with organized crime. It is because of this increasing need to 
protect witnesses and informants, and also because of the 
priority given to the fight against  major national and 
international drug smuggling rings that the RCMP's 
Source-Witness Protection Program was created in 1984.
<P>
	The creation of this program was also based on several other 
factors.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	There is the increasing need to use informers instead of 
RCMP undercover agents to penetrate complex criminal 
organizations. There is also the increase in violent crimes in 
Canada. There are, furthermore, obvious signs of extremist and 
terrorist activity in Canada. And finally, even more importantly, 
there is the jurisprudence on disclosure of information since the 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms was adopted.
<P>
	All these factors have led to increased use of the RCMP's 
witness protection program.
<P>
	Originally unique to the RCMP, the program is now used to 
provide protection for witnesses and informers through 
provincial and municipal police services across Canada.
<P>
	Many of these services depend solely on the RCMP for this 
protection, but some of the bigger services have created their 
own units. They do not call on the RCMP for assistance except in 
cases where this is necessary in order to facilitate an identity 
change.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Most people entering the RCMP sources witness protection 
program in the mid-1980s were associated with major drug 
trafficking activities, but as I mentioned before, this has 
changed.
<P>
	Today a growing proportion of the people entering the 
program have been involved in Criminal Code offences such as 
murder and serious assault. Obviously not every witness 
qualifies for witness protection despite the thousands of serious 
assaults that take place each year in Canada but the RCMP and 
other police forces must exercise care and good judgment when 
deciding who is eligible for witness protection and who is not.
<P>
	These common sense safeguards ensure that the number of 
witnesses and informants do not outstrip the human and 
financial resources allocated to support the various witness 
protection programs.
<P>
	In the last 10 years, the witness protection programs of the 
RCMP and other police departments have become highly 
effective enforcement tools against criminals who previously 
were able to use threats and violence against the witnesses to 
their crimes to avoid prosecution and conviction. The success of 
the witness protection program of the RCMP and other police 
departments speaks for itself.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4496"> 4496 </A></B>
<P>
	Of the large number of witnesses and informants and their 
families who have been relocated over a 10-year period, none 
have come to any harm. That is a very important issue for us 
to consider, the effectiveness of what has been done thus far.
<P>
	The RCMP carry out an average of 50 witness relocations per 
year. Of this number, approximately 10 cases are in support of 
other police departments. The direct cost of maintaining the 
RCMP's witness protection program averages $1.1 million per 
year.
<P>
	When those expenses are added to the human resources cost to 
support the program, its total annual cost exceeds $3 million. 
Based on current trends, the costs of the program will probably 
increase as more people are given protection. However the costs 
are relatively cheap when measured against the impact that 
witnesses and informants have on individual criminals and 
organized crime.
<P>
	There is no more devastating evidence than the firsthand 
testimony of a trusted accomplice exposing the inner workings 
of a criminal organization or that of a witness who has seen a 
serious crime take place and can identify the perpetrators.
<P>
	Whether a witness or informant, these individuals are 
invaluable assets to the police and to the judicial system, not to 
mention society as a whole. In many cases the testimony cannot 
be replaced by any other investigative means no matter how 
expensive. This is especially true of drug enforcement.
<P>
	Here the availability of the RCMP witness protection program 
has prompted informants and witnesses to come forward and 
assist the police and testify in court against major national and 
international drug traffickers despite the proven ability of these 
organizations to exact violent retribution. These witnesses have 
provided crucial first hand information to further investigations 
which otherwise would have been obtained at considerable cost 
to police resources, human and otherwise.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	Major police investigations often require the police to use 
investigative techniques such as long term telephone intercept, 
extensive surveillance and the attempted infiltration of target 
groups using undercover police officers. These techniques are 
usually more expensive than the cost of providing protection for 
a witness or an informant.
<P>
	Since starting the witness protection program, the RCMP has 
built up an infrastructure of experienced members and contacts. 
RCMP officers are available in every province and territory to 
support witness relocations and protection, to obtain secure 
identity changes and to provide the necessary provincial 
documents to authenticate these changes.
<P>
	At headquarters in Ottawa, RCMP members have developed a 
national RCMP witness protection policy and procedures and 
contacts to facilitate the changes that  must be made within 
numerous federal government databanks where a witness or 
informant receives a new identity.
<P>
	A witness protection program is an enforcement tool that 
must be administered to some extent under the veil of secrecy. If 
information about police methods and procedures were to leak 
out, criminals could use this knowledge to locate and harm their 
accusers, not to mention the chill it would have on future 
witnesses. For this reason, witness protection is one of the most 
sensitive law enforcement techniques used by the police.
<P>
	The RCMP is well aware of the sensitivity and the need for all 
to take suitable precautions. This holds true whether the witness 
or informant requires a complete protection package or just 
short term emergency protection during court proceedings.
<P>
	The RCMP also provides the same level of quality service to 
any other police department that requests advice or direct 
assistance in that regard.
<P>
	Witness protection is not a cure for violent crime or for 
organized crime, but it is an important weapon in the law 
enforcement's arsenal to investigate and to convict those who 
participate in organized and other serious crime in Canada. In 
short, witness protection is here to stay.
<P>
	The RCMP source witness program and other witness 
protection programs initiated to date in Canada are constantly 
undergoing review, change and improvement to ensure that they 
complement the justice system and provide effective, secure 
support for the protection of witnesses.
<P>
	I see Bill C-206, the proposed act to provide for the relocation 
and protection of witnesses, as part of that process for change 
and for improvement.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to rise in support of Bill C-206, the 
witness protection act. Members of the Reform Party are calling 
for numerous improvements and major changes to Canada's 
criminal justice system. Reformers, some members opposite 
and indeed most Canadians want to see the federal government 
take action on many fronts.
<P>
	The Young Offenders Act and the parole system both need to 
be fixed. Stricter sentencing guidelines for convicted people 
must be implemented. The protection of law-abiding Canadian 
citizens must be an integral part of a major overhaul of the 
criminal justice system. Penal reform and consideration of 
capital punishment are other areas that should be pursued.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4497"> 4497 </A></B>
<P>
	Bill C-206, the private member's bill pertaining to the 
relocation and protection of witnesses, is a step in the right 
direction. This private member's bill is an important one and 
it is a long time coming. For far too long, witness protection 
programs, where they exist, have been administered in a 
helter-skelter type manner. Canada does not have a national 
witness protection program which is rather ironic given our 
federal system where the Criminal Code is the responsibility 
of the federal government.
<P>
	I commend the member for Scarborough West for the work 
that he has done in an attempt to fix just one aspect to facilitate 
an improvement on how justice is done in our country.
<P>
<B>(1755 ) </B>
<P>
	Complaints have been forthcoming for some time regarding 
the lack of adequate protection of witnesses in the current 
unorganized, hodge-podge way in which witnesses are dealt 
with in Canada. It is no wonder Canadians are losing faith in the 
criminal justice system when the state cannot uniformly protect 
its witnesses, the people it relies on to gain convictions against 
organized crime.
<P>
	Introducing a national witness protection program is only a 
beginning step in the right direction when it comes to reforming 
Canada's justice system. Perhaps there can be no full and 
complete reform of the criminal justice system without 
addressing the entire legal industry. There is some speculation 
suggesting that our criminal justice system is in such a bad state 
of affairs because of the proliferation of lawyers which just may 
have something to do with the clogged court system, both 
criminal and civil.
<P>
	Observations are beginning to be made in the United States 
that the true cost of the ballooning lawyer industry in American 
society amounts to billions upon billions of dollars per year. In 
the United States the number of students graduating from law 
school is 10 times higher than those who graduate from 
engineering.
<P>
	In Japan and other countries whose industrial output is higher 
per capita than in the U.S. the opposite is the case and that is 10 
engineering students graduate for every student who graduates 
from law school. I suspect both sets of figures may apply to 
Canada as well.
<P>
	It is interesting and instructive to note there are 100,000 
lawyers in Washington D.C. alone. The American capital has 
one of the highest crime rates in the United States. It seems that 
the proliferation of lawyers and the proliferation of laws go hand 
in hand. Part of the solution is to recognize that there might be a 
problem.
<P>
	People want and demand fair but quick trials and sentencing 
in criminal cases, but the courts are backed up as a result of the 
growth of a system which is, as we all know, extremely top 
heavy. Justice, due process must not only appear to be served but 
seen to be served and as efficiently as possible.
<P>
	The Young Offenders Act is a major contentious issue with 
Canadians. It represents yet another inadequacy in Canada's 
criminal justice system. The Reform Party believes, as do most 
Canadians, that the punishment of crime and the protection of 
law-abiding citizens and their property must be placed ahead of 
other objectives.
<P>
	The present Young Offenders Act flies in the face of that 
major objective. It is the young offender who is protected, not 
law-abiding citizens. Youths between the ages of 12 and 17 are 
abusing the system. For committing murder they face a 
maximum sentence of five years. For armed robbery and violent 
sexual assault they can only be sentenced to a maximum of three 
years. For lesser offences, such as vandalism and theft, young 
offenders can get away with only a slap on the wrist, often in the 
form of community service work. Numerous instances exist 
where even this minimal sentence is spurned.
<P>
	Where is the government's action on the Young Offenders 
Act? All we get are vague postulations, even as recent as this 
afternoon in question period, postulations but no action.
<P>
	Another blatant breakdown in our criminal justice system is 
the issue of parole. Parole is now virtually automatic after 
one-third of the sentence is served. Parole must be 
discretionary, given for good conduct and should not amount to 
more than one-quarter of the sentence. Patronage appointments 
to the parole board must cease.
<P>
	In 1987 parole reform was suggested by the federally 
appointed Canadian Sentencing Commission. So far we have got 
nothing. Perhaps the whole bureaucratic parole system should 
be abolished. Where is the government's action on the parole 
system?
<P>
	Another flaw of the criminal justice system lies within the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Sections 7 to 14 of 
the charter cover the legal rights of the accused. Judicial 
interpretation of these sections has made the work of police and 
prosecutors more difficult in areas such as detention, search and 
seizure, interrogation and the speed of cases going to trial.
<P>
<B>(1800 ) </B>
<P>
	In fact it can be argued that the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms actually hinders the Canadian justice system as it 
protects the criminal. The rights of the victim are not taken into 
account. Victims must be compensated by the offender to the 
greatest extent possible. Yet it is the offender who is 
compensated to the greatest extent by the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms.
<P>
	People, indeed members, cabinet ministers and some 
provincial governments are calling for the abolition of the 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	Great Britain from whence we inherited much of our system 
of government and criminal law does not have a written charter 
of rights and freedoms. I doubt that anyone would argue that the 
fundamental rights of the people in the United Kingdom are in 
grave danger.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4498"> 4498 </A></B>
<P>
	Obviously the Canadian justice system is in rough shape. 
Law-abiding Canadians are demanding that the Young 
Offenders Act and the parole system be overhauled. They are 
demanding that the criminal justice system work for them and 
not for the perpetrators of crime.
<P>
	It is a sad state of affairs when Canadians must wait to have 
their criminal justice system fixed one private member's bill at a 
time, but it is a start. Again I commend the member for 
Scarborough West for taking the initiative to do what is 
necessary and I support the member's efforts on Bill C-206. I 
support it as I hope do all members of this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
you have already heard from other hon. members, the main 
intent of witness protection is to offer protection to those who 
assist the authorities in criminal prosecutions and in particular 
those prosecutions aimed at organized crime. Given this 
emphasis on organized crime I think it would be useful to give 
the House a brief overview of exactly what that term means in 
the context of the bill.
<P>
	If we can understand the threat that organized crime poses for 
our society then we can understand why the bill is so important 
and why it must be given careful consideration. What is needed 
is a statutorily based guarantee of protection for people who 
come forward and are prepared to give evidence against 
organized criminals.
<P>
	Police of all jurisdictions deal with organized crime, 
including the RCMP, provincial and municipal services. Other 
enforcement authorities also have important roles to play. For 
example, federal immigration and citizenship authorities work 
with the police to deal with the smuggling of illegal aliens and 
illicit trafficking in forged or stolen personal identification 
documents. In a similar fashion customs and excise authorities 
work closely with the police in dealing with the movement of 
drugs, weapons, contraband liquor and tobacco, protected 
technologies, or other illegally imported or exported goods.
<P>
	On the judicial side federal and provincial crown attorneys 
are of course responsible for pursuing prosecutions and 
obtaining convictions through the court system.
<P>
	All of those authorities are united in their desire to develop 
and use the most effective laws and programs possible to combat 
organized crime. This desire is understandable given the serious 
threat organized crime poses to Canadian society.
<P>
	The raison d'être of organized crime is simple: to make as 
much money as possible and to minimize the risk of getting 
caught by forming organized groups and networks. In its pursuit 
of illegal profits organized crime will engage in activities as 
varied and complex as those engaged in by legitimate 
multinational corporations.
<P>
	Consider money laundering for example. The laundering of 
criminal proceeds through financial  institutions and otherwise 
legitimate businesses by organized criminals subverts the 
operation of the legitimate economy by introducing unfair and 
unlawful practices, including tax evasion. Organized crime 
plays a key role in the maintenance and expansion of the 
underground economy by fueling the trade in stolen and 
smuggled goods.
<P>
	The results are enormous tax losses for government and 
poorer services to the public. Every honest Canadian pays for 
the illicit profiteering of organized criminals and not just in 
terms of dollars and cents.
<P>
	Many organized crime activities, such as drug trafficking and 
gaming, can have serious negative effects on our youth and 
families.
<P>
<B>(1805 ) </B>
<P>
	Violence associated with organized crime contributes to 
public fears and perceptions about personal victimization. In 
certain instances organized criminals use violence and 
intimidation in an attempt to dominate community members. In 
so doing they contribute to the isolation of some groups in our 
society. As profits from organized crime grow, so does the 
potential for the corruption of public officials and democratic 
institutions.
<P>
	Organized crime groups challenge the legitimacy of 
government and encourage disrespect for lawful authority and 
public institutions. In its international variations, organized 
crime threatens Canadian sovereignty and our ability to control 
our borders.
<P>
	Let me set out a brief typology of organized criminal 
behaviour to further illustrate the depth and seriousness of the 
organized crime problem.
<P>
	Organized crime can occur locally. Juvenile prostitution rings 
operating in urban centres are one particularly sad and cruel 
example of local organized crime at work. In many cases local 
criminal operations are loosely or formally linked to other 
operations across the country.
<P>
	Interprovincial organized crime is a particular problem 
because when criminals operate across jurisdictions it is more 
difficult for authorities to track and to combat their activities.
<P>
	Then we have transnational crime where Canadians are 
involved in the movement of commodities into or out of the 
country. The initiative launched recently by the government to 
bring the smuggling problem under control shows how serious 
this variant of organized crime can be. Similarly transnational 
economic crime and money laundering by Canadians or by 
foreigners using Canadian or international institutions represent 
serious threats to the integrity of our financial and economic 
systems.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4499"> 4499 </A></B>
<P>
	Finally, there is the very difficult and growing problem of 
international organized crime. Here foreign crime networks 
work with or co-opt Canadian criminals. International 
trafficking in cocaine and heroin is the best example with 
extremely well financed, well organized and ruthless cartels 
manipulating the international drug trade.
<P>
	Underlying all of these criminal enterprises are two common 
denominators: violence and intimidation. Violence and 
intimidation are used to enforce discipline in criminal 
organizations, to compete for shares of illicit markets and to 
prevent people victimized by crime from co-operating with the 
police. This is a crucial point in the context of the bill because 
violence creates a climate of fear and fear can be a powerful 
disincentive to co-operation with the police and prosecutors.
<P>
	To break the conspiratorial silence of organized crime we 
have to be able to offer protection to people who are willing to 
assist the authorities in their criminal investigations. There is a 
clear need for a system that encourages people to come forward 
to give information or evidence against organized criminals, a 
need recognized by the bill.
<P>
	In summary, I would like to make some general observations 
on what I believe a protection program must do in the context of 
the organized crime problem.
<P>
	First, we must ensure that a program would accommodate the 
needs of all the police and enforcement authorities with 
responsibilities for dealing with organized crime.
<P>
	Second, every kind of organized crime is serious. In setting 
the parameters for a program we would need to ensure that the 
fullest range possible of offences carried out by organized 
criminals are addressed.
<P>
	Finally, I note that the problem of international and 
transnational organized crime is a growing concern in the 
context of economic and political globalization. Therefore a 
protection program would need to take into account the 
necessity of co-operation between Canadian agencies and their 
counterparts in other nations.
<P>
	I believe that this proposed act to provide for the relocation 
and protection of witnesses is important in signalling to the 
Canadian public the need for a statutorily based protection 
program for people who assist the authorities in criminal 
investigations and prosecutions. However before that is possible 
it must be studied further in light of the criteria I have just 
described.
<P>
<B>(1810 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex):</B> Mr. Speaker, I also 
rise today to speak to Bill C-206, an act to provide for the 
relocation and protection of witnesses.
<P>
	Listening to previous debates on the bill, it is clear that we all 
agree on the importance of providing Canadians with an 
effective and efficient witness protection program. We also 
appear to agree that the best means of  achieving this, of 
ensuring a first rate witness protection program is through 
legislation. The obvious benefits of legislation pertain to 
accountability, transparency and universality.
<P>
	In terms of accountability, there is no question that a minister 
should be held accountable to Parliament for the administration 
of this important service. While acknowledging that witness 
protection is inherently a confidential program, its basic 
principles and features should be matters of public knowledge.
<P>
	There would be less misunderstanding about the purpose and 
scope of a witness protection program if its fundamental 
principles, criteria and procedures were expressly defined in 
law. When we speak of the need for universality, it is that 
witness protection should be available to all Canadians given 
the criteria for eligibility are satisfied.
<P>
	There are of course other desirable features of legislation 
many of which have been raised in this debate. My point is to say 
we are all convinced that Canada's witness protection 
requirements would best be addressed through legislation. 
Having agreed that a legislated witness protection program is 
desirable, we must then ask what we want addressed in 
legislation besides the program's basic tenets and parameters.
<P>
	As we have already learned, witness protection is a complex 
function of law enforcement, criminal prosecutions and public 
safety. It involves the interest and participation of numerous 
individuals and government departments. It generates 
considerable administrative activity. To what extent, I ask, 
should we address in legislation administrative requirements 
that comprise a witness protection program?
<P>
	One thing is certain and that is that an ineffective witness 
protection program could lead to drastic results for all 
concerned. We must ensure we do not create a program without 
providing the tools for its effective implementation.
<P>
	Of course, to address the specific issues that should be dealt 
with by legislation requires a thorough understanding of the 
intricacies of this service. This leaves us in a bit of a quandary as 
there are few experts in this field. Certainly we in this House, 
although we have been considerably enlightened over the course 
of this debate, really are not witness protection experts.
<P>
	It is not my intention in speaking to trivialize in any way the 
efforts of my colleague, the hon. member for Scarborough West, 
or to minimize the knowledge he has obviously gained in this 
area; indeed he ought to be complimented for his efforts in this 
area. Knowing the scarcity of information on witness protection 
and the difficulty in accessing whatever information there is, the 
hon. member is to be commended for his tabling of Bill C-206. I 
speak today only to suggest that as with any law, the proposed 
legislation should take into consideration the representations of 
experts in the field.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4500"> 4500 </A></B>
<P>
	A recent example of a similar undertaking can be found in 
Australia. A parliamentary review of witness protection took 
place in Australia in the late 1980s. The joint committee on the 
national crime authority produced its final report in 1988 
following extensive testimony and submissions to the 
committee by police, lawyers, academics and even protected 
witnesses themselves.
<P>
	We are fortunate to be able to benefit from the Australian 
experience, particularly in light of the scarcity of information 
on witness protection. I would like to share with the House some 
of the committee's observations and recommendations as well 
as review aspects of the Australian witness protection bill which 
was tabled in its Parliament in March 1994.
<P>
	For members' information, the bill proposes the 
establishment of a national witness protection program to be 
operated by the Australian federal police.
<P>
<B>(1815 ) </B>
<P>
	To begin with, the committee clearly recognized that witness 
protection is crucial to the investigation and prosecution of 
organized crime and that in fact the vast majority of individuals 
who receive protection are informants, more specifically police 
agents.
<P>
	I quote from the report:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The reality is that the majority of witnesses likely to be in need of protection 
will look at some involvement in the criminal activities in respect of which they 
are giving evidence.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The importance of this fact cannot be overemphasized. The 
implications of protecting and relocating individuals who have 
criminal experience or criminal associations are significant. I 
would suggest that this fact be specifically addressed in any 
proposed witness protection legislation in the interests of public 
safety and the general success of a witness protection program.
<P>
	The Australian witness protection bill clearly considers this 
important issue. For example, clause 7 of the Australian bill lists 
matters that the witness must disclose before being included in 
the program. Most of these matters pertain to possible civil 
obligations, including debts, bankruptcy and other financial 
liabilities, as well as a detail of the applicant's criminal history.
<P>
	This provision addresses the practical but very important, 
complex and costly problem associated with protecting 
witnesses who have outstanding liabilities in the old name. In 
effect it provides the commissioner of the Australian federal 
police permission to terminate an agreement with a witness if 
these kinds of liabilities were not disclosed prior to admission of 
the program.
<P>
	I would suggest that this is the kind of practical matter that 
needs to be considered when legislating witness protection so 
that the program eventually created is workable.
<P>
	Similarly, the committee recognized the importance of an 
efficient name change and documentation process and made 
several recommendations in this regard. Clause  22 of the 
Australian bill reflects the intention of one of these 
recommendations by creating an offence of unlawfully 
disclosing information about the witness' identity or 
information that would compromise his or her security. This is 
another example of an important aspect to witness protection 
that should be addressed in law.
<P>
	The provisions of documents in the witness' new name in a 
timely and secure manner is vital to the success of relocation. In 
fact, this is the key to the success of any witness protection 
program. If an efficient name change and documentation 
process can be achieved by providing legal authority for the 
administration of this function and also sanctions for disclosure 
then we should be addressing this issue thoroughly in 
legislation.
<P>
	I referred to just a few of the Australian bill's provisions. 
Overall the bill addresses numerous practical administrative 
considerations with informed detail. I have referred the House 
to the bill and the commentary in the Australian parliamentary 
joint committee's report to underscore the need to address this 
issue in a comprehensive manner. These are the types of factors 
that must be examined before this government can in good 
conscience proceed further with legislation for a witness 
protection program.
<P>
	In closing, I would suggest that we learn from the experience 
of our Commonwealth partner and adopt a similar thorough 
approach to the important issue of witness protection in this 
country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria-Haliburton):</B> 	Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to rise and speak on Bill C-206, legislation for the protection of witnesses and the relocation system. I commend the hon. member for Scarborough West for bringing the 
<P>
	Many court cases are lost because of fear from witnesses. 
Family safety is paramount to allow witnesses to give evidence 
without fear of reprisal from criminal elements. My three years 
of work in the Ontario parole system taught me and made me 
very aware of the problems that exist within our penal system. 
Inmates live in constant fear within the system, afraid of being 
identified as rats because rats have a very short lifespan in the 
prison system.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	Gangs from every segment of our population exist in prison. 
They control the institution from the prisoner's point of view. If 
a witness who is himself or herself a criminal wants to change 
their lifestyle this program offered by Bill C-206 is a ticket for 
them to give valuable evidence and be assured of some life after 
the court appearances.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4501"> 4501 </A></B>
<P>
	Innocent family members are also offered an escape from the 
criminal life they may be trapped in and have no way out of. 
The reform of our criminal justice system may come from bills 
like this one from members and particularly from the member 
for Scarborough West.
<P>
	I have experience in an organization called Crime Stoppers 
which I helped form and was the first chairman of in the town of 
Lindsay. I learned that anonymity was the key to success. Pay 
for evidence for convictions. Judges grant search warrants based 
on tips from Crime Stoppers because they know it comes from 
very close sources to the crime.
<P>
	We even had instances of people calling from the Lindsay jail 
for bail money through the Crime Stoppers program. People are 
motivated by not having to worry about going to jail if they give 
evidence or having to exist in a criminal element in our prisons 
by giving evidence. This proves the point that being assured of 
no punishment allows people to come forward and give evidence 
against criminals who have no regard for life or limb of any 
witnesses and will do almost anything to eliminate a witness 
from a court trial that may put them behind bars.
<P>
	Bill C-206 is an important step toward the fight against 
organized crime. Youth gangs, organized mature adult criminals 
and other elements in our criminal society are not prosecuted for 
fear of reprisal from witnesses. If this program does anything to 
address that problem it will certainly make me feel better that 
we have done something in Parliament to forward our criminal 
justice system in a method that allows it to work as it properly 
should without fear of reprisals and to be able to have a life after.
<P>
	Canadians will benefit from the bill. All members should 
support it and help promote witness protection as a right of 
every individual in Canada. It will take away that fear, take away 
that element that criminals thrive on, that wonderful thing that 
they have of intimidation. Take that away in some form and we 
help to make our society a better place in which to live.
<P>
	I support the bill in its entirety. I hope that it goes forward and 
that every member of this House will support it and support 
other bills that come forward, no matter whether they come from 
our friends on the opposite side of the House or from members 
on this side of the House. If they make sense and if they help us 
to promote our society to be a safer, better place to live, we 
should look at all members supporting them and bringing 
forward ideas and bringing forward amendments if we need to.
<P>
	The bill should go forward and it should help Canada be a 
better place to live.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak on Bill C-206, an act to provide for the relocation 
and protection of witnesses.
<P>
	The hon. member for Scarborough West, the sponsor of the 
bill, deserves credit for bringing before the House  an issue that 
occupies the attention not just of Canadian law enforcement 
agencies but of law enforcement agencies around the world.
<P>
	In the past 10 years the need for witness protection has grown 
dramatically in direct proportion to the increased violence 
displayed by individual criminals and organized crime. For this 
reason alone the hon. member's bill is timely and well deserved.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	In previous debate on Bill C-206 mention was made several 
times of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police source witness 
protection program. For obvious and very good reasons the 
RCMP is cautious about revealing information concerning the 
program. As this is the main witness protection program in 
Canada we need to know something of its scope and 
effectiveness if we are to better understand all the issues raised 
by this private members' bill.
<P>
	To this end I am happy to have the opportunity today to 
provide the House with a general overview of the RCMP source 
witness protection program.
<P>
	First let me set out the context. Historically witness 
protection programs are most closely associated with the 
investigation of organized crime. The term organized crime 
covers a broad range of criminal activity including large scale 
drug trafficking, murder, serious assault, money laundering and 
extortion and robbery. As often as not these crimes go hand in 
hand with the use of fear and intimidation to ensure the silence 
of potential witnesses and informants.
<P>
	However witness protection today has a broader application. 
A disturbing trend in recent years has been the use of fear and 
intimidation by lone criminals. These people are willing to go to 
any lengths to avoid convictions or to extract retribution from 
witnesses. As a result there are a growing number of people who 
need protection as a result of their roles in cases that have 
nothing to do with organized crime.
<P>
	To deal with this growing need for witness and informant 
protection and in response to the increased enforcement priority 
placed on fighting major national and international drug 
trafficking organizations, the RCMP source witness protection 
program was started in 1984.
<P>
	There were also several other factors underlined in the launch 
of the program. These included an increasing need to use 
confidential information rather than undercover RCMP officers 
to infiltrate sophisticated criminal organizations; the growing 
incidence of violent crime in Canada; clear evidence of 
extremist and terrorist activities in Canada and, most important 
of all, disclosure jurisprudence flowing from the charter of 
rights. All of these factors contributed to the growth of the 
RCMP's witness protection program.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="4502"> 4502 </A></B>
<P>
	Although originally intended for the use of the RCMP alone 
the program now provides protective services to provincial and 
municipal police forces right across Canada.
<P>
	While many of these police forces rely entirely on the RCMP 
for witness protection program services some of the larger 
police departments have formed their own witness protection 
units. These larger police services only come to the RCMP for 
assistance in cases where federal help is needed to facilitate a 
change of identity for a witness or an informant.
<P>
	Most people entering the RCMP source witness protection 
program in the mid-1980s were associated with major drug 
trafficking activities. However, as I mentioned a moment ago, 
this has changed of late. Today a growing proportion of the 
people entering the program have been involved in Criminal 
Code offences such as murder and serious assault.
<P>
	Obviously not every witness qualifies for witness protection 
despite thousands of serious assaults that take place in Canada 
each year, but the RCMP and other police forces must exercise 
care and good judgment when deciding who is eligible for 
witness protection and who is not.
<P>
	These common sense safeguards ensure that the numbers of 
witnesses and informants do not outstrip the human and 
financial resources allocated to support the various witness 
protection programs.
<P>
	In the last 10 years the witness protection programs of the 
RCMP and other police departments have become highly 
effective enforcement tools against criminals who previously 
were able to use threats and violence against the witnesses to 
their crimes to avoid prosecution and conviction.
<P>
	The success of the witness protection program of the RCMP 
and other police departments speaks for itself. Of the large 
number of witnesses and informants and their families who have 
been relocated over a 10 year period none have come to any 
harm.
<P>
	The RCMP carries out an average of 50 witness relocation 
programs per year. Of this approximately 10 cases are in support 
of other police departments. The direct cost of maintaining the 
RCMP's witness protection program averages $1.1 million per 
year. When those expenses are added to the human resource 
costs to support the program its total annual cost exceeds $3 
million.
<P>
<B>(1830 ) </B>
<P>
	Based on current trends, the cost of the program will probably 
increase as more people are given protection. The costs are 
relatively low when measured against the impact that witnesses 
and informants have on individual criminals and organized 
crimes.
<P>
	There is no more devastating evidence than the firsthand 
testimony of a trusted accomplice exposing the inner workings 
of a criminal organization or that of a  witness who has seen a 
serious crime take place and can identify the perpetrators.
<P>
	Whether a witness or informant, these individuals are 
invaluable assets of the police and judicial system. In many 
cases their testimony cannot be replaced by any other 
investigative means.
<P>
	This is especially true in drug enforcement. Here the 
availability of the RCMP's witness protection program has 
prompted informants and witnesses to come forward and assist 
the police and testify in court against major national and 
international drug traffickers despite the proven ability of these 
organizations to exact violent retribution.
<P>
	These witnesses have provided crucial firsthand information 
to further investigations which otherwise would have been 
obtained at a considerable cost in police resources, human and 
otherwise.

deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TRADE">TRADE</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon):</B> Mr. Speaker, on April 
21 I raised a question with the Minister for International Trade 
specific to the attack on Canadian wheat farmers, including such 
extreme attacks by certain people in the U.S. talking about 
minuteman missiles coming over to Canada.
<P>
	At that time with the minister I raised the issue in general of 
Canada's trade policy, in particular this government's trade 
policy, and what it meant for Canadians specifically to the issue 
of wheat farmers, particularly durum wheat which is an ongoing 
dispute which has not been resolved with the United States by 
this government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4503"> 4503 </A></B>
<P>
	We learned on May 24 that as part of an attempt to resolve 
this dispute the minister simply confirmed that there was a 
Canadian proposal to resolve the farm trade dispute and through 
that Ottawa would eliminate a rail transportation subsidy on 
grain shipped through Thunder Bay, clearly affecting in a 
detrimental way the shipping industry in Thunder Bay. The 
rerouting seems to me not to be an answer to the problem of 
this trade dispute but the creation of yet another problem for 
Canadians in another industry.
<P>
	When I first raised this question with the minister I raised the 
issue as well of NAFTA. He reminded me that the wheat dispute 
did not come under NAFTA but under GATT and of course I was 
very well aware of that.
<P>
	However I am concerned that even since April 21 we have 
seen a deterioration in our trade relations with the United States. 
The minister has made a number of statements that do make the 
connection between these disputes that we have had and the 
NAFTA agreement which was proclaimed by the government on 
January 1, 1994.
<P>
	Prior to January 1, prior to the election of 1993, the often 
quoted Liberal red book with regard to trade relations stated: 
``The Canada-United States free trade agreement and the North 
American free trade agreement are flawed. A Liberal 
government will renegotiate them''.
<P>
	The government implemented NAFTA on January 1 and is 
now backtracking. For example, the minister on May 25 stated 
in an article in the Toronto <I>Star</I>: ``In the harshest remarks by a 
Canadian minister in recent years, the minister yesterday 
accused President Bill Clinton's administration of increasingly 
arbitrary use of U.S. trade law to thwart Canadian exports in 
wheat, lumber and other commodities and of kowtowing to 
regional interest''.
<P>
<B>(1835 ) </B>
<P>
	The article goes on to say that the minister stopped short of 
talking about abrogating the North American free trade 
agreement if disputes continue, but certainly did warn in that 
same interview that NAFTA is in a somewhat uncertain position 
at this time.
<P>
	My party has said for a very long time that NAFTA is not just 
uncertain, it is bad news for Canada. Yesterday in another 
journal, the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, the minister was quoted as saying 
that we may see a move away from the dispute settlement panel 
procedures into a broader based discussion.
<P>
	Clearly the harassment by the United States on this issue 
continues on a variety of fronts. Farmers know what they have 
given up after the NAFTA deal and under the trade policy of the 
Liberal government in general. Lumber producers know what 
they have given up under Liberal trade policy. Unemployed 
workers in the manufacturing and service industries know what 
they have given up under Liberal trade policy and I would like to 
ask the minister or his representative can they tell this  House 
what Canadians have gained from Liberal trade policy.
<P>
	All we see is the backtracking now coming to the realization 
that NAFTA is not in Canada's interest, and implementing such 
measures, for example, is eliminating the rail transportation 
subsidies. Canadians on a wide variety of fronts know what they 
have lost from Liberal trade policy. Can the representative 
explain what exactly Canadians have gained?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food):</B> Mr. Speaker, in response to the 
hon. member, the North American Free Trade Agreement, with 
improvements secured by this government, provides improved 
access to the Mexican market and builds on the Canada-U.S. 
free trade agreement in enhancing Canadian access to the United 
States.
<P>
	Canada and the United States are each other's largest trading 
partners. In 1993 the total bilateral trade between our two 
countries was $256 billion. This trade was in Canada's favour by 
nearly $30 billion. Given such a large volume of trade, it can be 
expected that differences may arise. What is important to 
remember is that 95 per cent of this trade is undisputed.
<P>
	I can assure the House and the member across that a 
satisfactory resolution of the agricultural negotiations with the 
United States is a top priority of the government. The issue has 
been raised at the highest level in discussions between the Prime 
Minister and the President of the United States. As well, the 
Minister for International Trade and the Minister of Agriculture 
and Agri-Food have been working very hard in negotiations 
with the U.S. in order to conclude an agreement that respects the 
interests of the Canadian agricultural industry.
<P>
	The Minister for International Trade has just returned from 
meetings in Washington with members of the U.S. 
administration where he again vigorously underscored the 
Canadian position. With respect to grains, the United States has 
chosen to pursue the matter of Canadian exports to the United 
States under the GATT and not NAFTA.
<P>
	On May 3 the United States officially notified the GATT of its 
intentions to renegotiate tariffs on wheat and barley under the 
GATT article XXVIII. This notification triggers a 90-day period 
in which Canada and the United States will continue to attempt 
to reach a mutually satisfactory settlement of several agriculture 
trade issues.
<P>
	If no agreement is reached following the 90-day period and 
the United States does proceed with restrictions on Canadian 
wheat and barley, Canada has the right under GATT to retaliate. 
If necessary we will exercise our GATT rights in response to the 
U.S. trade action.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4504"> 4504 </A></B>
<P>
	I wish to emphasize that the government remains committed 
to reaching a negotiated solution to these issues and will 
continue to work toward that objective during the 90-day 
period to ensure that the best interests of the Canadian 
agri-food industry are served. The Minister for International 
Trade and the minister of agriculture will be meeting with their 
U.S. counterparts next month in an effort to resolve.
<P>
	In conclusion, I want to remind everyone that in bilateral 
trade in agricultural and agri-food products between Canada 
and the United States, that portion alone is worth several billion 
dollars. It is in the interest of both Canada and the U.S. to ensure 
that this trade grows in both directions to the benefit of both 
countries.

	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
February 21 I had the opportunity in the House to ask a question 
of the minister of agriculture about the expansion of country of 
origin labelling in Canada. At that time the minister indicated 
general agreement with the concept and the fact that there would 
obviously need to be ongoing discussions with the various 
sectors of the agri-food industry.
<P>
	In April I had the opportunity to put a question to the 
parliamentary secretary to the minister, again about the issue of 
country of origin labelling, with the twist that it had come to my 
attention at a meeting of the Middlesex Federation of 
Agriculture that there was concern among Canadian farmers that 
perhaps there had been an agreement, a secret agreement I 
guess, made between Canada, Mexico and the United States not 
to pursue the idea of country of origin labelling. I had the 
assurance from the parliamentary secretary at that time that this 
was not the case.
<P>
	I wish to pursue this briefly today in the House because we all 
know that it does pay to buy Canadian. I certainly prefer to 
purchase Canadian product, and that obviously includes 
agri-food product, as I think many Canadians do. Within a given 
range of expense, I think that many Canadians are prepared to 
pay a little bit more for a Canadian made product or a Canadian 
grown product in the agri-food situation.
<P>
	My farm constituents in London-Middlesex would want me 
to say that we certainly have the safest food anywhere in the 
world, and as an urban Canadian I agree with that. If it is a little 
more expensive through no fault of Canadian farmers, then I am 
prepared to pay that little extra and I would certainly hope and I 
do believe that many Canadians are also prepared to pay that 
little extra.
<P>
	I wonder about the labelling we see in food stores. I have 
spoken to the parliamentary secretary and the minister 
informally on this as well as many members. It is pretty easy to 
go into a food store in this country and see in large letters 
``Packaged in Canada'', and below it in very minuscule letters, 
almost unreadable, ``Product of California'' or South Carolina 
or wherever.
<P>
	To the naive purchaser, which I would be, not often 
frequenting these food stores because that chore is taken on by 
one better qualified in my family, my wife, it is pretty easy to 
think you are buying a product that was produced in Canada 
when in fact it simply was packaged in Canada.
<P>
	I have a couple of questions for the Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food.
<P>
	First, will the government consider some expansion of the 
concept of country of origin labelling, or at least will there be an 
opportunity to have a dialogue with the Canadian agri-food 
industry about this idea?
<P>
	Second, is there not some concern from the minister and from 
our government about safety standards of agri-food product that 
is imported into this country? I ask this second question because 
we have all heard the horror stories about imported food. Let us 
for example talk about chicken from the southern U.S. The 
former illustrious member for Lambton-Middlesex has a 
pretty good horror story about southern U.S. chicken coming 
into this country, treated in such a way that I think if most 
Canadian consumers knew it might turn their stomachs, if not 
dissuade them from buying that product.
<P>
	To what extent is that a concern of the minister and of the 
parliamentary secretary and of our government?
<P>
<B>(1845 ) </B>
<P>
	I have two questions in summary. Will the concept of country 
of origin labelling be pursued with our Canadian farmers in at 
least a determination of how much they want to pursue it? I 
understand there is a potential downside when that is done to our 
product in other nations. To what extent is there a concern about 
imported agri-food product being up to the safety standards of 
our product, not that it is acceptable to come into the country, 
but is that food in all instances as safe as our own Canadian 
agri-food product?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to 
answer the questions from the hon. member.
<P>
	In answer to his first question, yes, the department will 
continue and is open to dialogue as far as the labelling of food 
products in Canada is concerned.
<P>
	In response to the second question, Canada has country of 
origin labelling requirements for food products sold in Canada 
at the retail level. These requirements are provided under the 
appropriate regulations for food covered by the Meat Inspection 
Act, the Canadian Agricultural Products Act and the Consumer 
Packaging and Labelling Act.
<P>
	The rules apply to these products for purposes of health and 
sanitary inspection whether they are produced domestically or 
imported. Our main objective has been and will continue to be 
the safety of the agri-food product.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="4505"> 4505 </A></B>
<P>
	Both federal and provincial labelling requirements for 
agri-food products were in place prior to the signing of the 
North American Free Trade Agreement and were not affected 
by the agreement coming into force.
<P>
	Product which is imported and only packed in Canada will 
still be marked with the country of origin. However if it is 
substantially transformed with the addition of further value it 
will then be marked as product of Canada.
<P>
	Under the NAFTA, rules were negotiated for determining the 
country of origin. These rules will be used for customs purposes. 
In this regard U.S. customs require that all imported products be 
marked with the country of origin while Canada does not use 
markings for customs purposes for agri-food products.
<P>
	Under the negotiations Canada achieved its objective of 
transforming the U.S. discretionary marking rules into a clear 
set of rules based on tariff classification. As a result Canada will 
have a better mechanism to ensure that the U.S. applies more 
consistent rules to Canadian exports into the United States.
<P>
	Appropriate government departments are currently working 
to ensure that the new rules do not create unnecessary costs for 
Canadian exporters and that they are favourable for Canadian 
products which may be packed in the United States and returned 
for sale in Canada.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="PACIFICSALMONTREATY">PACIFIC SALMON TREATY</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	On April 26, 1994 I asked the minister of fisheries a question 
regarding the failure to reach a successful conclusion during 
recent Pacific salmon treaty negotiations. This failure could 
result in serious consequences for the Canadian fishery industry.
<P>
	Canadian fishing conservation measures have been 
undertaken for many years now. Unfortunately our American 
neighbours have not been as diligent in their past efforts to 
maintain a viable fishery stock. Presently they are being forced 
to close salmon runs due to the destruction of habitat and to 
place moratoria on fishing in the Strait of Juan de Fuca due to 
past fisheries mismanagement and the squandering of too many 
fish.
<P>
	It is my understanding that negotiations have gone off track 
due to the intransigence of Alaskan negotiators and their refusal 
to co-operate in Canada's definition of fair and equitable goals. 
Surely the Americans must understand that if we have shared 
fish stocks and they have destroyed or drastically reduced the 
viability of the Oregon and Washington fish stocks in the Strait 
of Juan de Fuca, we as Canadians will want to work out a 
solution to this problem that will not penalize Canada for 
maintaining sound conservation measures in contrast to the lack 
of any of the same practices south of the border.
<P>
	We already have a situation whereby last year we in effect 
subsidized the American fishery by the sum of approximately 
$65 million. This represents Canadian fish being caught by 
American fishermen. We are now being asked to close or 
seriously curtail our fishery in order to correct the poor 
management of the Canada-U.S. shared fisheries resource. This 
would mean a drastic reduction to our catch, tying up Canadian 
boats and putting Canadian fishermen out of work.
<P>
	This situation I suggest is unacceptable for my province of 
British Columbia and for Canada as a whole. I ask the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans 
what further action we may take to get the negotiations back on 
track. If this is not possible, what further action may the 
Government of Canada take in its dealings in the Pacific salmon 
fisheries in order to prevent a full scale fish war?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Parliamentary Secretary 
to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
member for his question. I know how crucial this issue is for 
British Columbia and how important it is to the hon. member.
<P>
	Let me begin by saying that we are very concerned with the 
position of the U.S. government. Its position on fishing 
arrangements is completely unreasonable. It wants more 
Canadian fish but wants us to take less of its fish. It wants 
Canada to help conserve its fish stocks but is not prepared to 
help us to conserve ours. It wants increased access to Canadian 
salmon when its stocks are low but denies Canadians the same 
treatment.
<P>
	Its position on the equity principle is also completely 
unreasonable. According to the Pacific salmon treaty the 
principle of equity means that each country is entitled to 
fisheries benefits which are equivalent to its own production of 
salmon.
<P>
	This fair balancing has never been implemented by the U.S. 
The current imbalance against Canada has almost doubled in the 
last four years and we are now in a deficit position of 
approximately $65 million a year. Instead of recognizing this 
imbalance the U.S. position is that for this year it wants to 
increase the deficit to $100 million.
<P>
	Canada's position is clear. We are doing everything possible 
to ensure that we negotiate terms with the U.S. which are fair 
and responsible for both countries.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has raised this matter with President 
Clinton who has agreed to become involved. The Canadian 
negotiator recently met with the state governors who have 
agreed to pursue the matter further with the U.S. administration.
<P>
	The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans is currently in 
Washington, D.C., meeting with U.S. congressmen and senior 
officials. The province of British Columbia has agreed to assist 
in putting the Canadian case before U.S. opinion makers.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="4506"> 4506 </A></B>
<P>
	Barring these extensive measures, Canada's position is 
equally clear. We are not prepared to allow the U.S. to continue 
to reap the rewards while Canada bears the burdens. For too 
many years Canada has put off until the next year taking a firm 
line with American negotiators.
<P>
	I want to make it perfectly clear that this year that will not be 
the case.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38(5) the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
have been adopted.
<P>
	The House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., 
pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.51 p.m.)
