<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC)</B> moved that Bill 
C-387, an act to establish a national committee to develop 
policies and procedures to ensure coordination in the delivery of 
programs by governments in the case of agricultural losses or 
disasters created by weather or pests, the coordination of the 
delivery of information, assistance, relief and compensation and 
study the compliance of such programs with World Trade 
Organization requirements, be read the second time and referred 
to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to rise today to 
speak to a private member's Bill C-387 that was submitted. 
Unfortunately, it was not deemed to be votable by the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I will put the House on notice that I too will 
re-submit the bill in a different form, and I will re-submit the 
bill in a different form, and I will re-submit the bill in a 
different form until it does have the opportunity to have a vote 
in the House. I feel very strongly about this issue which 
obviously resonates with the farm community across the country. 
It certainly resonates with the constituents who I represent in 
the constituency of Brandon—Souris and the farmers who produce 
the food for Canadians across this great country of ours.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin the debate today with an excerpt from a 
letter that was sent to the minister of agriculture on February 
15 from the national safety nets advisory committee during the 
negotiations surrounding the AIDA program.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The majority of the National Safety Nets Advisory Committee 
would like to express its disagreement with Agriculture Canada 
and provincial governments regarding the changes they intend to 
make to the Farm Income Disaster Program.  The committee does not 
support the program as it is currently designed....We are 
seriously concerned about the precedents which these decisions 
set on for the next round of Safety Net negotiations.  The 
program as designed now no longer provides sufficient support to 
farmers facing a crisis. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That letter came to the minister from the minister's own 
appointed national safety net's advisory committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister and the department of agriculture decided on their 
own to make some substantive changes to the recommendations that 
were put forward by the safety nets committee.  Those changes 
included the aspect of negative margins not being covered under 
the new AIDA program.  It suggested that NISA had to be drawn 
down prior to any access to the AIDA program.  It dealt with a 
three year averaging as opposed to a five year averaging, or 
perhaps even longer as is the case with a lot of provincial 
programs.  This was done completely without the input of the 
national safety nets advisory committee.  It was done ad hoc by 
the department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If only the minister of agriculture had actually listened and 
acted on the words of the committee, perhaps he would not be 
facing the criticism he is now facing with respect to the AIDA 
program.  The minister dropped the ball on the design and 
delivery of the AIDA program so badly that the producers and 
producer groups, such as the Canadian Federation of Agriculture, 
have completely lost trust and faith in the minister and the 
government's commitment to agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a move last week, after my party meeting with key industry 
stakeholders, the CFA decided that it was going to form its own 
advisory committee and take steps in discussions that the 
minister has so far failed to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue is particularly important now given the fact that the 
minister of agriculture, in a letter on March 24 to the standing 
committee on agriculture, said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the intent that over the course of the calendar year 1999, 
we will establish a new direction and enter into new agreements 
with the provinces on the longer-term direction for agricultural 
safety nets. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that these discussions begin immediately with 
the input of all industry stakeholders.  It is vital that there 
be more transparency and fairness in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was a quote from the minister asking for transparency, 
negotiations and consultation.  The very stakeholders who he 
wishes to consult with have now said that they will set up their 
own program, their own safety nets advisory committee because 
they do not trust the agriculture minister to put forward what 
they believe are the right, fair and equitable programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, world trade talks start again in November.  The 
Americans and the European Union will again beef up their 
subsidies on agriculture to strengthen their positions at the 
talks.  Canadian farmers are going to be caught in the middle and 
the need for a long term safety net strategy will again become 
readily apparent.  The time to put these in place is now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to be perfectly clear.  An advisory committee can work in 
the future if it includes representation from all three levels of 
government.  The federal government, the provincial government 
and stakeholders must have representation and must be given more 
power to make recommendations to the minister.  Bill C-387 would 
do just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether it be the ice storm of January 1998, the floods in 
Manitoba and the Saguenay or the droughts in Nova Scotia, it is 
more often farmers who are hit the hardest financially.  When 
natural disasters occur through weather and pests, or 
agricultural losses through falling commodity prices, the federal 
government must take a more proactive than reactive approach and 
start developing policies in advance that benefit our producers 
in good times and in bad.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of my private members' bill is to help the 
government in doing just that.  The bill would create a committee 
that would assist the minister of agriculture in developing 
policies and procedures to ensure the coordination between 
different government authorities with respect to the delivery of 
information, assistance, relief and compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee would monitor situations on an ongoing basis and 
discuss what income protection measures are available to farmers 
in the event of disasters or unusual conditions caused by weather 
or pests, taking into account such areas as crop insurance, flood 
and draught protection programs and NISA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee's mandate could and should be expanded to include 
monitoring the effects of the low commodity prices on the 
agricultural industry and the primary producer's farm income. 
The committee has the power to create subcommittees, much like 
our standing committees, to pursue such ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee would also investigate and advise the minister on 
the compliance of any income assistance program with the WTO 
requirements.  The act would be cited as the national 
agricultural relief coordination act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee would consist of a membership of up to 21 members: 
three nominated by the minister of agriculture: one nominated by 
each provincial agricultural minister; five should be 
representatives of farmers and be nominated by such organizations 
representing farmers; and three should be representatives of 
industry related to agricultural products and be nominated by 
such organizations representing the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last example of an ad hoc assistance program, the AIDA 
program, was done behind closed doors with the bureaucracy of the 
department of agriculture.  The model was put forward and, after 
the fact, the minister of agriculture went out to sell it to the 
provinces.  As we recognized, a number of those provinces were 
not terribly receptive to the program model that was put forward 
by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does it not make sense that the 10 agricultural ministers should 
have a say in how agriculture is going to be dealt with in their 
own provinces?  Does it not make sense that rather than forcing a 
program onto the provinces that those provinces should be part of 
the negotiating process to put the program together in the first 
place? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had many problems when AIDA was first unveiled. The problems, 
quite frankly, were due to a lack of communications and the 
ability of the federal and provincial governments to work 
together.  This speaks to the lack of co-operative federalism that 
I see is so very important in trying to work with the provinces. 
I was told this did not happen because the provinces would not 
work with the federal government.  That comment came from a 
federal bureaucrat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My answer to that comment is:  Does that not cry for leadership? 
Should there not be leadership at the federal level that will 
bring the provinces together so that they can all agree on a 
package, on a program, on a philosophy and on a vision for 
agriculture?  Or, is it simply best to have a federal government 
design the program and then force it on the provinces?  It does 
not work nor does it speak to the bigger issue as to where we 
should be heading in the next decade or two decades and the 
philosophy that we should share for agriculture in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members are aware, there already exits a national safety net 
review committee.  My bill is an extension of that committee, 
expanding the role, power and membership in the committee.  This 
bill would give an advisory committee more teeth, more power and 
more ability to react and act in a positive fashion.  It would 
create a more permanent committee rather simply an ad hoc 
committee that is created at the whim of the minister and 
legislates the tabling of its reports before parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No longer can the minister simply strike a committee and then 
disband the committee at whim based on the old political optics 
of the day.  This bill would put into place and legislate the 
requirement of this committee with criteria and ground rules and 
with the ability to make a difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that the current advisory committee has not been 
able to have the desired impact on the safety net process.  Farm 
organizations spent a significant amount of time developing the 
efficient disaster relief program during the farm income crisis 
through the current national safety nets advisory committee.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day most of the recommendations were not taken 
into account when the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food 
designed the AIDA program.  What a waste of time when in fact the 
people who really understand and know the issues are not listened 
to.  This has to change.  Our industry has told politicians time 
and time again that we need to re-evaluate our income protection 
system for farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recent discussion surrounding the agriculture income 
disaster assistance program of the minister of agriculture is 
just one example of the need for a strong advisory committee with 
actual power to help in developing the policies and coordinating 
assistance programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Federation of Agriculture stated in a letter 
addressed to me: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The farm community has lost confidence in the process by which 
provincial and federal governments negotiate.  If the farm 
community is to regain its confidence in the safety nets debate 
of the future, a more honest, open relationship between industry 
and government has to be developed.  Therefore, the Canadian 
Federation of Agriculture is supporting your proposal to 
establish a national committee to develop policies and coordinate 
the delivery of federation programs. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, in a letter to the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food dated March 17, 1999, the CFA stated: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—a transparent process should be developed including 
consultation with all parties and full disclosure of all 
information. Therefore, we encourage you to create a committee 
composed of federal and provincial representatives, and farm 
organizations that will examine the safety nets package and 
identify different options. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly to what the bill speaks, exactly what not only 
the CFA but farm organizations across the country need: open and 
honest transparency where in fact we can sit down, share opinions 
with others and develop what is necessary for agriculture, not 
only for today but for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-387 speaks to the concerns raised by the CFA for more 
transparency and disclosure of information.  In fact the bill 
specifically calls for all reports to be laid before parliament, 
not the situation and certainly not the case right now with the 
national advisory safety nets committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, it is also important that we emphasize the word 
consistency when we talk about coordinating assistance programs. 
This committee would work toward alleviating any problems with 
achieving consistency in the delivery and co-ordination of 
assistance programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There must be consistency in determining the level of 
assistance.  It should not simply be based on the amount of 
publicity a disaster gets.  Ad hoc programs provide ad hoc 
solutions.  With the environmental and climatic changes that this 
country and the world are undergoing, it is vital now more than 
ever to monitor these issues on an ongoing basis and develop 
consistent policies which would help farmers deal with these 
changes both financially and realistically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consistency is the key word here.  One of the problems that we 
have when we deal with ad hoc programs, whether from a natural 
disaster perspective or from a commodity price perspective, is 
that we must be consistent among the regions.  One region cannot 
be pitted against another one.  We cannot just simply say that 
because there is more publicity for this area there has to be a 
difference in program.  The programs must be developed so that 
they are equal and have some equality within regions.  It is 
important that this tripartite committee be struck to do just 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the House for the time to put forward Bill C-387.  I can 
also suggest that not being a votable item this time it will be 
put forward again in committee.  Next time I hope it is votable 
so that the House can have a say in what happens. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I remind the 
House and the proposer of the bill that there is such a thing as 
short term memory and I think quite a few people are suffering 
from that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to remember that the AIDA program was put in place 
principally by the leadership of the federal government 
responding to the crisis in the farm community and with 
consultations with the provinces and consultations with the 
safety nets committee, co-chaired by the past president of the 
Canadian Federation of Agriculture.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember the day we announced our share of $900 million to go 
along with the provincial $600 million for a two year $1.5 
billion program.  The co-chair of the national safety nets 
committee, then president of the Canadian Federation of 
Agriculture, wholeheartedly praised our efforts.  He said this 
was done in record time, responding to the needs of the farmers 
from one end of Canada to the other on a farm by farm basis 
regardless of province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be whole farm and viewed as non-controversial by the 
World Trade Organization.  It fits with the agreements we made 
with the World Trade Organization.  When we got our $900 million 
in place intensive negotiations went on with the provinces.  As a 
result all provinces with the exception of Nova Scotia joined the 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The money has been flowing from the provinces that have disaster 
programs of their own.  Money has been flowing to the farmers and 
provinces that did not have a provincial disaster program in 
place.  Money will be starting to flow—it has been 
accelerated—this Friday, which is four to six weeks earlier than 
predicted by everyone involved in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has responded by setting aside $900 
million.  In the last budget it was accelerated to $600 million 
this year, in response to the needs of the farming community in 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Are you going to spend it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire:</B>  We certainly intend to spend it.  If 
there is a disaster on any farm in Canada, through the triggers 
that have been negotiated people will get disaster funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By this Friday every province will be in receipt of some money. 
The money will begin to flow from the federal and provincial 
organizations in response to the serious situations on many of 
our farms across the country, especially in the province where 
the hon. member is from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not just wait for problems to arise.  It 
will assist Canada's farmers.  We are continually working in 
partnership with the provinces and industry to help producers 
prepare to meet the challenges of the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The classic example of this is whole farm safety nets.  The 
federal government has signed agreements with all the provinces. 
We have a set of safety nets in place that are fully equitable, 
will minimize trade and economic distortions, and take provincial 
and regional interests into consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cornerstone of the safety net system is NISA, the net income 
stabilization account.  This is a volunteer program that provides 
a source of money for farmers when their income declines for 
whatever reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NISA is a well regarded program but the government is also 
committed to improving on the system currently in place.  The 
Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, along with the provincial 
ministers, are reviewing the current system and considering 
carefully how we will deal over the longer term with situations 
where exceptional circumstances seriously affect the incomes of 
farmers.  He has said that he wants to give farmers a whole farm 
safety net system that provides security but does not mask the 
natural signals of the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of complex issues the ministers are trying to 
address, including whether the funding allocated is the right one 
and whether the mix of programs meets the intended objectives. 
Ministers will continue working on the issues when they meet in 
Prince Albert this July. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also add that the Government of Canada is well aware of the 
need to meet our international trading commitments.  Our farmer 
assisted programs are designed and implemented with these 
commitments in mind.  We are committed to providing support and 
management tools to assist our farmers within the rules of the 
WTO, just as we ask other nations to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a medium size trading nation we are committed to a rules 
based trading system.  Canada is also going to the upcoming WTO 
negotiations intending to reduce trade distorting support and 
protection measures around the world so that our producers can 
compete on a fair and level playing field.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been doing everything we can to make sure we hear from 
all parts of the agrifood industry about their interests going 
into negotiations before we announce an initial negotiation 
position for Canada this summer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past two years there have been regional meetings, 
hearings by the House of Commons standing committee and the 
Senate agriculture committee, and both the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade and the Minister of Agriculture 
and Agri-Food have held extensive meetings with key industry 
groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just this past week there was a major conference attended by 
some 600 representatives of the agriculture and agrifood sectors 
and the provincial and federal governments to pave the way toward 
a strong initial WTO position.  We are now well on the way to 
developing a negotiating position that the provinces and all 
sectors of the industry can support.  Our aim is to ensure Canada 
continues to have economically viable agriculture and food 
sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The co-operative approach to farmer safety nets and 
international trade that we have been pursuing since the 
government took office has proven to be highly successful in the 
past and will stand us in good stead for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-387 would not improve our ability to plan for the future, 
either in the development of farmer support programs or in 
dealing with the requirements of the WTO.  For these reasons, and 
those outlined by my hon. colleagues, the government does not 
support the passage of this bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage—Lisgar, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in the House today to talk to 
Bill C-387. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Brandon—Souris has a lot of good points in 
the bill, but many of these issues have already been addressed. 
There is legislation in place to enforce some of these issues but 
governments in the past have failed to listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The safety net review committee and advisory committee are there 
to suggest to governments what should be happening as far as the 
three lines of defence are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first line of defence is the crop insurance program, of 
which every farmer is aware and is making use.  The second line 
of defence is the NISA program, which is very valuable to older 
farmers especially who are in a profit position.  NISA does not 
help address the issue of young farmers who have just started out 
and whose revenue has not been such that they could make use of 
NISA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals claim that in record time they set up the third 
line of defence.  The AIDA program is probably a joke, as far as 
I am concerned.  I was in my constituency for the last couple of 
weeks during the Easter break and did not find one farmer who 
would qualify for any aid from this program at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I talked to farmers, they asked me whether I could at least 
tell the banker that something is coming.  This is not bankable. 
The Liberal government promised before Christmas that the AIDA 
program would be bankable.  No banks will look at it today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone with whom I talked in my riding had looked into the 
AIDA program, had gone to accountants who did a summary.  They 
are wasting their money.  It will cost from $500 to $1,000 to 
fill out the forms for this AIDA package.  After that they 
probably will not recoup the costs of the accountants doing the 
job.  People are not even filing them because they are so 
ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The AIDA program has been designed for a few corporate hog 
farmers.  If the Liberal government does not realize that, it 
better go to western Canada and find out.  It has been invited a 
number of times by Saskatchewan farmers to come clean and come to 
talk to them about the AIDA program.  Nothing has happened.  Not 
even the parliamentary secretary has agreed to come to talk to 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the AIDA program is the third line of defence, God help those 
farmers.  They will die before they ever get a dollar out of the 
AIDA program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has been warned about this for the last five 
years by Reform.  We told the government in 1993 that all the 
subsidies on the rail transportation system when done away with 
should go into some kind of trade distortion program with which 
farmers could fight the huge subsidies thrown at them by the 
Americans and the Europeans.  This program will do absolutely 
nothing to resolve that problem. 
We need a long term fix for farmers in which they can 
participate.  We must design it so it is useful to them, so that 
in good years they can build up an account on which they can draw 
in later years when there are poor crops or when prices drop to 
the point where it is not profitable to farm.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will touch a bit on the Canadian Wheat Board.  For the past 
four or five years I have tried to bring in a private member's 
bill to have the auditor general audit the Canadian Wheat Board 
and to make sure farmers get a proper price for their grain.  I 
must thank and congratulate the auditor general.  A week ago 
Saturday the wheat board announced that the auditor general would 
have a look at the books, that he would do a value-added audit, 
more or less, to see whether farmers are getting a fair price. 
The auditor general has finally heard the cries of western 
farmers that we need something done with the auditing of the 
board so that we can respect the board and have confidence in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About 100 farmers are willing to go to jail and this government 
is prosecuting them and putting them in jail because they have 
sold a few bushels of their own wheat, in some cases as little as 
five bags.  And the government is talking about providing a 
safety net program?  Maybe being behind bars is a better 
livelihood than being on the farm today.  At least there they get 
food and clothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what the government is trying to do by prosecuting 
these farmers for selling their own product while we have sex 
offenders and robbers running loose on the streets.  Are these 
farmers violent criminals because they have taken four or five 
bags of grain across the border to demonstrate that they want 
some accountability in the wheat board?  Is that such a criminal 
act?  If that is a criminal act, we should probably all be behind 
bars.  I am sure that every member of this House has objected to 
some type of mechanism that is set out and that we have to abide 
by.  Income tax is one of them.  When I hear of the amount of 
income tax that is funnelled out through loopholes in the tax 
system, maybe every government and opposition member should be 
behind bars because they are objecting to overtaxation in the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what is going to be accomplished by Bill C-387. 
The idea is good.  I can support it and I know this type of idea 
has been floating in the agriculture community for the past 10 
years.  I have talked to people who sat on the advisory board who 
were designing the third line of defence.  The AIDA program does 
not have the character which people want in a third line of 
defence.  They want a line of defence in which they can be 
participants in terms of designing it and establishing a fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The AIDA program is really doing nothing.  I have held nine town 
hall meetings in my constituency.  People have been phoning me, 
telling me that they do not qualify.  What kind of line of 
defence is it if they cannot qualify when grain prices have gone 
from $5 a bushel to barely $3 a bushel?  That is almost half the 
price, while input costs are still rising.  Every year there are 
input costs for fertilizer and machinery.  We hear again that 
there has been an increase of three to four cents a litre in fuel 
prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How are farmers supposed to continue when they have no marketing 
power?  They cannot add one single cent of their costs to their 
product.  They have to accept what the market will offer them. 
This is very discouraging for farmers.  I see more young farmers 
having auction sales this spring than I have ever seen before. It 
is not the older farmers who are debt free and who can work on 
their savings for another year or two; it is the young farmers 
who over the past four or five years have risked everything and 
who are now at the point where they cannot dig themselves out, 
even if they have three or four good crops and good prices.  They 
are disillusioned with the whole agriculture sector and with the 
income their families receive, so they are throwing in the towel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government better realize that. 
If we lose this generation of young farmers there is going to be 
a real problem in the country.  It will not only affect the 
farming industry, it will affect any one of the agri-processors 
or agri-businesses:  machine dealers, fuel dealers, pasta plants, 
millers, whatever.

least $5 or $6 of economic value.  That is why the farming 
industry in western Canada has shrunk.   We have about half the 
farmers now that we had two decades ago.  If we want to continue 
this, let us simply follow the former Conservative and Liberal 
governments with their safety nets and we will have the situation 
very quickly where there will be no farmers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak today on Bill C-387, at the request of my 
colleague for Louis-Hébert. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this bill is to establish a national committee 
to administer government programs relating to disasters, or in 
other words any agricultural losses created by weather or pests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intention of my colleague for Brandon—Souris is praiseworthy 
and understandable, since it reflects the experiences of the 
farmers of his province as a result of natural catastrophes. 
As well, the Canadian west has suffered greatly from application 
of the agricultural income disaster assistance program, commonly 
called AIDA, which was recently introduced to compensate farmers 
who experienced drastic drops in income in 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore obvious that our colleague's bill is a cry of 
alarm triggered by the government's inefficiency.  For a number 
of farmers, it is a real tragedy to see a new growing season 
approaching when they are already deep in debt and now have to 
lay out sizeable amounts for fertilizers and seed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one in this House with any familiarity with agriculture is 
insensitive to the crises experienced by farmers who have 
unfortunately not yet received any compensation.  The complexity 
of the AIDA program, based in part on the farmers' income tax 
returns, ends up doing more harm than good, in the short term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Bloc Quebecois be moved by this sad state of affairs to 
support the bill introduced by the member for Brandon—Souris? 
No, because we do not think that the solutions put forward in 
this bill will help Quebec farmers, and our reasons are twofold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there is the income security aspect.  Quebec has its own 
program, which differs from that of Canada's other provinces, 
and it is not about to switch, because it wants to hang on to 
its autonomy in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have worked to improve our income security system.  We are 
continuing to do so in accordance with our own needs and model. 
During our farm crisis, we did not wait for the federal 
government to take action, particularly when hog farmers were 
having trouble last fall. 
We were proactive and advanced the funds required to save 
Quebec's hog industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For us, the AIDA program ended up being an account to account 
reimbursement between the federal and provincial governments. 
Rather than introducing another bill, a look should perhaps be 
taken at what Quebec has done and its lead followed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have some experience of the disaster program.  The flooding 
in the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean region and the ice storm are still 
very unpleasant memories, and compensation is still not 
complete.  The bill introduced by the member for Brandon—Souris 
offers no tangible solution to the problems people are 
experiencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the major problems is that the bill does not make it 
sufficiently clear who qualifies for compensation, and who is a 
full time and who a part time farmer.  Through experience, 
Quebec has acquired expertise in acting quickly and effectively 
in  disasters and does not want a slow acting federal committee 
to slow down its response time. 
It must remain a prerogative of the provincial government, 
within the framework of a partnership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has no interest in supporting this bill, because it does 
not see the relevance of a committee comprised, unfortunately, 
primarily of the representatives of industry.  It would mean 
that Quebec would be a minority member of the committee, whereas 
now it is totally autonomous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We might ask ourselves why a national committee would come to 
the aid of farmers in the event of a catastrophe in addition to 
managing income security programs.  Finally, the committee 
members would be appointed by the agriculture minister—another 
danger—directly or indirectly on the basis of choices made by 
the representative bodies.  We oppose this sort of practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My eminent colleague from Brandon—Souris mentions in his 
statement, and I quote “In providing aid to victims, the accent 
must be on consistency.  A lack of consistency in assistance 
programs for farmers can only create division among the farmers 
of this great country”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here again, we do not share his opinion.  There must be clear 
and uniform rules in the application of legislation on 
catastrophes, and fairness.  There is no consistency in 
agriculture.  The value of land varies as does the value of the 
different crops.  However, that the rules of the game must be 
the same for all, I agree with the member, who is skeptical of 
the scope of the publicity that often follows natural 
catastrophes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we realize farm producers face problems, which 
must be resolved.  And in this regard, the member for 
Brandon—Souris has shown his sensitivity towards farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also true that, as pointed out by the president of the 
Canadian Federation of Agriculture, Bob Friesen, “the farming 
community no longer has confidence in federal-provincial 
negotiations. To restore its confidence in the debate on the 
protection of farm income, there must be more honest and open 
relations between the industry and the government”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the Bloc Quebecois, the solutions proposed in Bill C-387 are 
not the most appropriate ones, since they would result in 
Quebec, and its farm producers, losing ground on the long road 
to autonomy and income security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This reminds me of the scholarships that allow our students to 
pursue a post-secondary and university education. Quebec 
developed a system that is the envy of the other Canadian 
provinces. 
The federal government has found a way, in the context of the 
new millennium, to try to torpedo a program that works very well 
in Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to income security, three provinces have well 
defined rules in the event of a major disaster: Alberta, Ontario 
and Quebec. Quebec is ahead of the other provinces regarding 
this issue, because the Quebec government believes in income 
security for its farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Brandon—Souris might consider putting 
pressure in that regard on the Government of Manitoba.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
very pleased to take part in this debate today on Bill C-387.  I 
congratulate the shy, quiet and soft-spoken member for 
Brandon—Souris for his initiative.  I only wish as well that 
this were a votable motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very good initiative.  It calls for the co-ordination 
and delivery of programs by governments in the case of 
agricultural losses or disasters created by weather or pests, the 
co-ordination of the delivery of information, assistance, relief 
and compensation and to study the compliance of such programs 
with the World Trade Organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Federation of Agriculture president has stated in 
response to this that it supports the initiative on Bill C-387. 
The Canadian Federation of Agriculture feels that the farm 
community has lost confidence in the safety nets debate both now 
and in the future and it requires a more honest and open 
relationship between industry and government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure part of the initiative for this bill comes out of the 
meeting 26 in Regina that the Canadian Federation of Agriculture 
had back on February 26.  It talked about the need to identify 
principles that are essential to initiate discussion for 
federal-provincial agreement on safety nets.  This document is 
not a policy study but it suggests fair and transparent 
guidelines which are essential to establish a long term and 
predictable safety nets package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened very carefully to the member for Brandon—Souris.  It 
would not be my intention to be as hard on the minister of 
agriculture as the member was.  I note last fall when we were 
discussing this program the minister of agriculture said a number 
of things publicly and privately. He said that it had to be a 
bankable program.  He said it had to be a whole farm program. He 
said it had to be a long term program and that the application 
forms had to be easy to fill out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By my calculations we have come out of this with one out of four 
of those. We have a whole farm program.  But as my colleague from 
Manitoba has said, it is not a bankable program.  The credit 
union manager in Dodsland is on the record as having said that. 
This is certainly not a long term program.  It is a two year 
program which certainly is no one's definition of long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the minister standing in this place last week and saying 
that only six forms have to be filled out, people that are in the 
accounting business for a livelihood say it is not just farmers 
who are dazed and confused by the rules governing the 
federal-provincial farm aid program.  Professional accountants 
are saying that it is extremely complicated.  It is so 
complicated a lot of producers may decide it is not worth the 
trouble and expense of applying for assistance under AIDA. One 
accountant also said that he hoped not but he thought it was 
probably going to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not blame particularly the minister of agriculture for what 
has happened.  I think that after December 10 the minister of 
agriculture was snookered by other members around the cabinet 
table, probably by the Minister of Finance. They wiggled and 
squirmed and dealt so that NISA was included and negative margins 
were excluded.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the parliamentary secretary, who I am pleased to see 
here today, of the meeting we had at the Agricore Founding 
Convention in Calgary last year.  He along with the mover of this 
bill, the member for Brandon—Souris, were present.  The Minister 
of Agriculture and Agri-Food predicted that the Government of 
Canada would be “very generous” when it came time to revealing 
the AIDA package.  There are no farmers whom I have spoken with 
in the constituency of Palliser or in Saskatchewan who think this 
program is generous in any way shape of form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an aside, I met with the organizers of the rally in Bengough, 
the same group that organized the rally in Regina, on March 6. 
They were in my office on Friday.  According to one of the 
organizers, he had found one individual who qualifies for some 
assistance.  The amount is less than $500, or less than the bill 
that he will receive from his accountant for this work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the Canadian Federation of Agriculture came out on 
December 10 or 11 and said that it was very pleased with this 
program.  This was before it realized that the devil was very 
much in the details.  On April 6 it went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The AIDA program...is a labyrinth so complex that very few 
farmers will be able to reach the financial assistance at its 
centre.  CFA continues to find new twists in how eligibility for 
coverage is calculated that only serve to exclude an increasing 
number of farmers and reduce the 70 per cent of support promised. 
After the math is done, the effective support may be as low as 40 
per cent for some farmers. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The former president, Mr. Wilkinson, has said that it is not the 
third line of defence that they requested.  The current 
president, Mr. Friesen, said that this program is more about 
saving money than saving farmers.  It is not what they wanted and 
not how they wanted to work with the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The farm stress line in Saskatchewan is overwhelmed with the 
number of calls that are coming in from farmers.  I want to read 
into the record a couple of extracts from the farm stress line as 
of February 4.  There is an update that I will get to in a 
moment.  It says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have noted an increase in the number of calls beginning in the 
fall of 1998.  The Farm Stress Line has received 1,581 (calls) in 
1998, representing the second highest number of calls in a year 
since the Line began in Feb. of 1992.  Thirty percent of the 
calls received in 1998 related to farm financial issues.  These 
calls may be considered as indicators of the crisis, but should 
not be considered as reliable statistical data. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Callers are bringing forward a wide variety of problems and 
issues, but it is apparent that financial issues dominate. 
Callers speak of cash flow problems, operating loans being at 
maximum with no ability to pay them down, and not being able to 
make land and equipment payments.  Others speak of an inability 
to pay their utility bills, and worry about services being cut 
off.  They also worry about how they will put in crop this 
spring.  We receive calls from families who are being pressed by 
collection agents, and others have noted little tolerance or 
leniency from lenders. Many of our callers feel that they have no 
control of their situation, whether it is commodity prices or 
input costs.  This situation makes it very difficult for people 
to be proactive and to find solutions. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was an update on April 5.  It said that the farm stress 
line received 430 calls from January 1 to March 31.  Of those 
calls, 37%, almost 160, were on farm finance issues.  Callers 
spoke again of no money to put in the crop, inability to gain 
operating money or refusal of a loan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier in the year some callers made inquiries on the soon to 
be announced support payments.  In February and early March as 
people became aware of AIDA they inquired about how the 
application form might be accessed.  In March some called to 
express their anger at the complexity of the form and the need to 
spend $300 or more to have an accountant determine if they 
qualified for AIDA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the majority of financial and/or insolvency calls, many said 
that they did not see a future in agriculture and were searching 
for other options.  Options discussed have been either off farm 
income to support the farm operation or exiting farming all 
together.  Some callers expressed the view that their employment 
options were limited and they required retraining, and it goes on 
from there.

</I></B></P><P align=left>These hit home.  These are the very real issues that are of 
concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just let me conclude by saying that we note the difference 
between what has happened south of the border and what has 
happened here in Canada.  I want to read into the record the 
statement that the secretary of agriculture, Dan Glickman, made 
last fall, November 16 to be precise: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Factors beyond farmers' control, record worldwide production, 
weak Asian markets and merciless treatment from Mother Nature 
combined to depress prices and threaten the livelihoods of the 
very people we count on— 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why this administration was resolute in its 
determination to get immediate emergency assistance to America's 
farm families. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking where is that immediate emergency assistance for 
Canadian farm families? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will I get an opportunity to rebut and have a bit of time at the 
end? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> Yes, you will have 
your five minutes reply at one minute to 12. 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to take this time to talk about Bill 
C-387 and how our government is already working to help our 
farmers who face difficulties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is rather interesting to notice the member for 
Brandon—Souris who, in his rather expansive way that seems to 
match his ample girth, will say if only the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food of Canada would listen to the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell the entire House of Commons that the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food visited my riding, the great riding of 
Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke last Thursday evening and spoke to 
the Lions Club.  It was farmers night for Renfrew county. During 
that time he listened to each and every concern that the farmers 
in Renfrew county had.  He listened to them.  They got their 
point of view across.  The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food 
spoke rather eloquently and most passionately about farmers and 
the farming situation for over 25 minutes.  After that 25 minutes 
when he opened it up for Q and A, there were no questions because 
he had answered each and every one of their questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada and all provinces have co-ordinated 
systems in place which are designed to help farmers— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  I am absolutely dumbfounded, 
speechless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier:</B>   I might add that we should on 
occasion try to help the opposition too. Perhaps we should muzzle 
them on occasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The systems are designed to deal with weather related 
disasters—I might say that the hon. member from the fifth party 
on occasion can be an unmitigated disaster; that is why he is 
sitting in the fifth party—and financial setbacks that are 
beyond their control.  It is not their fault that they are in the 
position they are. In recent years the effectiveness of those 
systems has been amply demonstrated on several occasions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, working in close partnership with the provinces, 
the Government of Canada gave badly needed assistance to farmers 
who were affected by the flooding in the Saguenay area of Quebec 
and in Manitoba's Red River Valley, as well as those who suffered 
losses due to the ice storm here in central Canada. We have also 
lent extensive expertise to farmers through Agriculture and 
Agri-Food Canada and organizations like the Prairie Farm 
Rehabilitation Administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally I do not believe that Bill C-387 would add anything 
to the government's ability to respond to the needs of Canadian 
producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a colleague in the House, the member for 
Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey, who is our residential chicken 
expert.  I notice the member for Brandon—Souris was talking 
about laying plans.  The member for 
Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey would know only too well that 
the member for Brandon—Souris is laying one big egg when he 
makes these nonsensical remarks about Bill C-387.  He is just a 
big yokel on occasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to look after one of the most cherished 
segments of our society, our farmers. 
We know what farmers mean to this country.  The Liberal Party 
will continue to do everything it possibly can to ameliorate the 
situation for farmers and will not indulge in scurrilous rhetoric 
in which the member for Brandon—Souris indulges.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
would like to thank members who spoke to this proposed 
legislation, with one exception.  Everyone spoke in a very 
professional manner and certainly understood the issues, with 
perhaps the exception of the last speaker.  The diminutive member 
obviously does not have a real handle on what is going on in 
agriculture today in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary spoke about short memories.  Perhaps 
we could refresh his memory just a little, as the member for 
Palliser just did.  The program that was originally proposed and 
supported by a number of people on the national safety net 
advisory committee suggested that there should have been negative 
margins brought into the equation.  There should have been an 
opportunity not to have to take the NISA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe short memory is something the Liberal government 
recognizes.  Its members have short memories as well.  The 
parliamentary secretary stands to take credit for the NISA 
program, which he said was a great program.  However, the hon. 
member does not recognize that the NISA program was brought in by 
another government and certainly not his party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has a short memory with respect to the GRIP 
program, which was a good revenue program.  Unfortunately the 
government decided in its infinite wisdom to take some short term 
gain for some long term pain and it got rid of the GRIP program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank the hon. member for Palliser, once again, 
for putting forward what I thought was a very interesting twist 
on this issue.  He understands the issues very well, certainly 
more so than the government.  We know that the current program 
will not affect any more than probably 5% or 7% of producers.  It 
is not working.  The whole gist of the bill that I put forward 
concerns the fact that it is not working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need an organization, a safety net committee, that has the 
ability to bring all levels together so that we can look at the 
issues before us in a logical manner.  That is not happening. 
Unfortunately, behind closed doors the programs are being 
developed.  They are very shortsighted programs.  They do not 
resolve the issues.  There is no equity and consistency in these 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government so insistent on continuing in this foolish 
direction?  Why would it not want to have some input from other 
people?  Why would it not want to sit down to co-operatively 
develop a program and a philosophy for agriculture?  I do not 
know why it will not do so.  Perhaps it does not know how to work 
with other people and other parties.  Perhaps it does not know 
how to work with other organizations.  Perhaps it is the 
autocratic way in which the Liberals have formed this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will come back and eventually perhaps even the 
department itself will have the ability to bring forward 
legislation to deal with this and make sure that we have some 
logical, well thought out policies.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>SECOND READING 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from April 22 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-78, an act to establish the Public Sector Pension 
Investment Board, to amend the Public Service Superannuation Act, 
the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act, the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police Superannuation Act, the Defence Services Pension 
Continuation Act, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Pension 
Continuation Act, the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances 
Act and the Canada Post Corporation Act and to make a 
consequential amendment to another act be read the second time 
and referred to a committee; and of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK17"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, you 
caught me a bit off guard.  I felt that this was a debate of 
interest to a great many people in this parliament, especially 
since Bill C-78 is an important bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is definitely a highly technical bill.  It addresses the 
various pension plans administered by the federal government, as 
well as creating some institutions of future importance.  It is 
a bill on which, as we have just seen, the government is very 
anxious to pass a gag order, or in other words to take away the 
right of the members of this House to speak, because it has seen 
how things are heating up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seemed just now that we were dealing with what, in criminal 
circles, would be called a return to the scene of the crime. 
When a criminal is interrupted while committing a theft, he 
takes off, but he always returns.  And that is what this 
government is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill has major consequences for the future of relations 
between the federal government and the employee contributors to 
the various pension funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-78 creates the public sector pension investment board. 
The mandate of this board will be to do exactly what we have 
been doing for more than 30 years in Quebec with the Caisse de 
dépôt et placement, which is to say managing various pension 
funds. 
There are three major funds, including the one for government 
employees.

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill amends the Public Service Superannuation Act, the 
Canadian Forces Superannuation Act, and the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police Superannuation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The board will manage the billions of dollars in these funds 
annually.  As I mentioned, the board's mandate resembles that of 
the Caisse de dépôt et de placement.  Over 30 years ago we had 
the bright idea to set up this caisse, which now manages several 
tens of billions of dollars of Quebeckers' retirement savings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the strength of its more than 30-year track record, I can say 
that we did well to introduce this caisse, just as the 
government is doing well to establish a public sector pension 
investment board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where it falls apart and where we disagree violently with the 
government has to do with the fact that there is a danger that 
the main players will not be represented on the board's board of 
directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now, these various funds have 275,000 members.  A total of 
160,000 retirees and 52,000 survivors receive payments from one 
of the three plans. 
None of these will, if we look at the probabilities, be 
represented on the board of directors of the Public Sector 
Pension Investment Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It involves the management of the contributions they made as 
employees and making the most prudent decisions possible so 
these funds will grow, remain viable and provide a good pension 
income on their retirement.  However, employees contributing 
currently will not be represented on the board of the pension 
investment board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Neither will those who are retired, who contributed in the past. 
Some decisions, including those involving unforeseen surpluses 
generated by the various pension funds, require those who have 
previously contributed and who are now receiving their pension 
to have a say and be involved in decisions.  But no, the 160,000 
retired individuals who have paid in and who are responsible for 
past surpluses have no right in this regard.  They will not be 
represented on the board of the pension board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why, we ask, will they not be represented?  For the following 
reason.  The members of the board of the Public Sector Pension 
Investment Board will be appointed under the following process. 
The President of the Treasury Board, in his usual dictatorial 
wisdom, establishes an advisory committee of eight persons under 
Bill C-78. 
It is him who appoints the eight members of the nominating 
committee. These eight people will submit to the President of 
the Treasury Board a list of potential candidates for 
appointment as directors of the pension investment board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This nominating committee will ultimately, with the approval of 
the President of the Treasury Board and the governor in council, 
determine who will sit on the board of directors and decide how 
the pension plans that I mentioned earlier will be managed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The President of the Treasury Board will appoint the chair of 
the nominating committee. He is the only one making that 
appointment. He will also directly appoint two members to 
represent him on the nominating committee, one of whom must be a 
public service employee. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1300"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT17"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT17"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1300
<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He will appoint a member among people who are in receipt of a 
pension. He will also appoint two members after consulting with 
the Minister of National Defence, and two members after 
consulting with the Solicitor General of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the eight people who will make up the nominating 
committee. Only two of them will represent pensioners and 
employees making contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When you are making a 50% contribution to a pension plan and the 
government—your employer—is contributing the other 50%, you expect 
equal representation from the beginning of the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, two out of the eight members of the nominating committee 
will provide the President of Treasury Board with a list of 
candidates for seats on the board of a body which will 
administer billions of dollars of present and future employer 
and employee contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we to believe that the majority of those suggested will be 
representatives of pensioners and workers?  Logically, using 
simple mathematics, if these members are two out of the eight 
contributing to a discussion within the advisory board on a list 
of candidates to be submitted for positions on the Public Sector 
Pension Investment Board as directors, then their propositions 
will be in a minority from the start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then, once the list has been determined by the nominating 
committee, it is submitted to the President of Treasury Board, 
who will have every prerogative. 
He is the one who will determine which people on the nominating 
committee list will be submitted to the governor in council, or 
in other words the Cabinet, to constitute the 12 directors of 
the Public Sector Pension Investment Board, who will have a 
3-year mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the President of Treasury Board receives this list from the 
nominating committee, if he does not feel like having any 
members representing pensioners or workers contributing to the 
plans, he will just do what is commonly called “cherry-picking”. 
He will just choose from the list the people whom he wants to 
submit to the Cabinet for approval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chances of any worker or pensioner representatives being on 
the executive of the Public Sector Pension Investment Board are 
about as unlikely as the chances of skating safely on the Rideau 
Canal this time of year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no logic in this, particularly since the committee 
struck by the President of Treasury Board a year or two ago, 
which tabled its report in December 1996, proposed, based on how 
things are done elsewhere, that there be equal representation of 
workers and pensioners and of government on the executive of the 
Public Sector Pension Investment Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the committee made this recommendation on representation, 
the government seemed fairly open to it, but last December its 
attitude changed and it decided this was no longer the way 
things would be. 
It decided to do as it does in its day-to-day management, which is 
to make quasi unilateral decisions, fill in the gap with unions 
and pensioners, act as it has usually done in its relations with 
unionized employees, and that is to proceed with special 
legislation and riot sticks.  When it is not the riot stick, it 
is cayenne pepper.  So, that is what it does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a dictatorship.  It is an abuse of power and the denial of 
the rights of contributors to be part of the decisions that 
concern their money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind members that 50% of the contributions in each of 
the three funds come from workers.  The other 50% comes from the 
government.  Could you not, when you have contributed 50% from 
your pay cheque, have some say when it comes time to make a 
decision? No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The President of the Treasury Board, on the example of the 
Minister of Finance, who dips into the employment insurance fund 
surpluses, decided to continue the tradition of this Liberal 
government of royally ignoring employees and pensioners and make 
unilateral decisions.  That is unacceptable.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to actuarial forecasts, there will be a surplus in the 
three main funds that could exceed $30 billion.  In Bill C-78, 
the government appropriates the right to use what it calls 
unforeseen surpluses, including that of $30 billion, as it sees 
fit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No question of discussions with the unions or those who 
contribute to the fund, no.  Unilaterally, he decided he would 
follow the government's practice of taking money from others, 
without warning, without speaking to anyone.  Bill C-78 enshrines 
the practice by providing that the government will use the 
actuarial surplus as it sees fit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the government could use part of that surplus to 
reduce contributions or eliminate them temporarily. But on this 
side of the House, when we look at what happened to the 
employment insurance fund, we are convinced that the government 
will use that $30 billion in a manner that totally ignores the 
fact that it should benefit public service employees, and 
particularly pensioners and surviving spouses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his usual wisdom—which is selective when the time comes to 
present his case—the President of the Treasury Board says “Yes, 
but in the past, when there was a deficit in the various pension 
plans, it is the government that put up the money to eliminate 
such a deficit”. Indeed. 
But let him show the actual figures indicating what amount the 
federal government had to provide in recent years to eliminate 
such deficits in the pension plans. Is it $4 billion, $5 billion 
or $6 billion? Could the President of the Treasury Board commit 
to table the figures on the federal government's contribution, 
which is estimated to be around $5 billion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal government did indeed provide $5 billion to 
absorb the deficits in the three pension plans, could it be 
that, out of the anticipated surplus of $30 billion, there is 
$25 billion that do not belong to it, or that only half of that 
amount belong to it since the government and the workers both 
equally contribute to these plans? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could it be that the President of the Treasury Board is very 
selective in his arguments? He is using closure precisely 
because he does not want to hear the whole truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are prepared to consider that if, in recent years, the 
federal government contributed $5 billion to absorb any pension 
deficits related to an economic downturn, that leaves a surplus 
of $25 billion for which we could agree on a management 
structure. Decisions should be made in a collegial fashion. But 
the government does not know about that concept. There is an 
amount of $25 billion that does not belong to the government. 
The government may be entitled to half of it, but the other half 
belongs to contributors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consultation and management process for contributions and 
surpluses that is found in the legislation is a breach of 
democracy and it goes against what is done elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at what is done elsewhere. It is not just 
government pensioners, federal public servants contributing to 
pension plans who find themselves with greater actuarial 
surpluses than anticipated four or five years ago. 
This has happened everywhere because of low interest rates, 
higher rates of return and, perhaps, managers' talent.  The 
result is almost generalized surpluses that were not forecast by 
actuaries in almost all pension funds throughout the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What have others done with the unexpected surpluses?  They have 
agreed to a collegial system with plan members, pensioners and 
managers.  The federal government will not consider such an 
approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give the example of the Government of Quebec, with which 
I am very familiar.  The Government of Quebec has two pension 
fund management committees, one representing unionized workers 
and one representing managers.  There are two pension plans, one 
for unionized workers and one for managers.  Each of these plans 
has a management committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unions and the government are represented on each management 
committee in equal numbers.  There is real collegiality.  It is 
a democracy, not a dictatorship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last December, the way the President of the Treasury Board was 
talking, it sounded as though the government had seen the light, 
had remembered what democracy was and how to behave in a 
civilized manner, and would introduce a structure in which 
contributors and management would have equal representation. 
But no.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, there is a collegial approach to deciding how 
surpluses are handled.  Decisions are taken as well.  This 
committee, composed of equal numbers of unionized workers and 
representatives of the Government of Quebec, also decides what 
will be done with surpluses and what management directions 
should be taken.  In co-operation with the Caisse de dépôt et de 
placement du Québec, it decides on the best growth vehicles for 
contributions and for part of the surplus of workers and 
managers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would have been so easy to get it right for once. All the 
elements were there.  But instead this government's cynicism has 
prevailed. 
This government is thick.  I have said so often, but not often 
enough, in my opinion.  The government is close-minded.  We try 
to get it to understand some common sense, we try to tell it 
that it might be a good idea at some point to look calmly at the 
possibility of collaboration with the public servants and public 
service pensioners, rather than confrontation.  But with the 
government, it is always confrontation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is trampling on the most fundamental right, a minimal right I 
would call it, to have representation.  It makes no sense. 
Contributors to a fund would like to take part in the decisions 
on how that fund is managed, particularly since later on, 
depending on what decisions are made, and on whether or not 
there is contributor participation, they are the ones who will 
benefit, or not benefit, from the administrators' decisions. 
Here we are faced with a structure in which contributors are 
completely pushed aside. 
This is not normal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, here is how things work 
elsewhere when there is a surplus: a joint decision is made on 
what to do with the unexpected surplus.  Judging by a sampling 
of some thirty funds over the past three or four decades, often 
it has been agreed to improve the plan and its benefits, and 
also to improve survivor's benefits.  Often, survivor benefits 
are less than the worker's pension was during his or her 
lifetime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plan has been improved, and now even includes certain 
provisions for part time workers, but it has always moved in the 
direction of improving people's lot. 
This government's only motivation is the general improvement of 
the state of the surpluses, with the Minister of Finance 
shamelessly dipping into surpluses in the employment insurance 
fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The President of the Treasury Board has just got into the habit, 
unless the two are one and the same, unless the Minister of 
Finance is ordering the President of the Treasury Board, as the 
future leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, who is preparing 
his race for the leadership and who wants an extraordinary 
performance to be able to announce this race where he succeeded 
while others failed spectacularly. But he is doing this on the 
backs of others.  Everyone is going to remember that.

Is the Quebec government pension plan a shared risk, shared 
management plan? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Madam Speaker, I do not understand the hon. 
member's question.  There are two major pension plans in 
Quebec's public service, plans that are entirely usual.  There 
are risks in investing just as there are benefits in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I mean is that it is the contributions of employers and 
employees that are paid in part into the Caisse de dépôt et 
placement, which manages the surplus on behalf of these two 
funds.  What the committees keep is what they need to pay the 
pensioners' benefits.  So the plan is not more risky than any 
other. The risk is shared, because the employer's and the 
employees' contributions are pooled and managed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Caisse de dépôt et placement has the mandate, trough two 
management committees, to manage part of those assets, so as to 
generate enough money to pay pensioners. There is not much 
difference between the three major federal pension plans and the 
ones in Quebec. They are essentially similar, except that Quebec 
has been doing for about 30 years what the federal government 
wants to do with the pension investment board, and we are very 
proud of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that my presentation did not include any 
negative comments about the pension investment board. It is a 
great idea. What we disagree with is how the funds will be 
managed and the inadequate representation. Normally, the main 
stakeholders are involved in managing the funds. Our second 
point is that the government is once again making off with the 
contents of the till, like a thief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not mention any names. I just said that the government was 
acting like a thief. This is not unparliamentary. Nothing 
prevents me from saying that this government is acting like a 
thief when it keeps helping itself to the EI fund, for instance, 
and its $25 billion surplus. Very few Canadians and Quebeckers 
agree with this approach. 
<P><A NAME="LINK19"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
comment and a question for the member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it is terrible that debate is so limited on a bill that 
is almost one inch thick.  It is a very important bill in our 
country, which has a public sector pension plan.  The government 
wants to help itself to $30 billion of the surpluses and pull 
the same stunt it pulled with EI.  This year, the surplus in the 
EI fund will reach $27 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have already said in the House, there are still people in 
this country who open their fridge in the morning and find 
nothing in it.  They have nothing to feed their children before 
sending them off the school.  Workers have been robbed; there is 
no other word for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know whether my colleague agrees with me. 
Is a precedent not being set with this bill in the House of 
Commons?  The government is going to help itself to surpluses 
without workers' consent.  It is opening the door for 
corporations, which have long wanted to get their hands on 
pension fund surpluses.  Workers have always been opposed, as 
have governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the government is setting a precedent.  It will no longer 
have any argument against big corporations that want to dip into 
their workers' pension funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will no longer have any argument when big corporations tell 
it they want access to surpluses in order to invest them 
elsewhere.  Employees are going to have to pay higher and higher 
premiums, because there will not be enough money in these 
depleted pension funds, as the corporations will have got their 
hands on the money. 
This is an unacceptable precedent.  The government ought not to 
be taking the country in that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear the comments of my colleague from 
Saint—Hyacinthe—Bagot on how important it is for the government 
not to act in this way, and particularly on how little time we 
have to debate this bill.  We parliamentarians are not even 
being given the opportunity to say what we think.  We cannot 
come to the House to express our opinions, to explain our point 
of view on behalf of the Canadians who sent us here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes no difference whether one is on the left or on the 
right.  We no longer know which way this House is going to go. 
Every time the Liberals want to pass a bill,  they stop us from 
speaking in this House.  They take away our rights as 
parliamentarians to defend Canadians.  This is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear my colleague's comments on the two 
questions I have asked, because the Liberals are not doing their 
job in this country at the present time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member is right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In dealing with a problem, a dispute in a large firm, for 
example, because there are surpluses in the workers' pension 
fund, we will no longer have any valid arguments.  It can no 
longer be said that this is not how it works, when the federal 
government allows itself under Bill C-78 to do everything it is 
not supposed to do, namely go off with the money.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will no longer have any valid arguments.  My colleague is 
right on that.  I recall a time not so far off when one of 
Conrad Black's businesses was at issue, and Conrad Black said 
“The surpluses do not belong to the employees anymore, they 
belong to me”. How can we argue that he is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, given that contributions are made by both sides 
and the future of the pensions of today's workers is at stake, 
how can we say “You should sit down and discuss this”?  We have 
reached a point where we no longer have any valid arguments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing I would like to point out, in connection with 
what the hon. member mentioned about the employment insurance 
fund, is that the government has just legitimized a fraudulent 
practice—that of going off with the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recall the Minister of Finance saying last November “I 
foresee the possibility of introducing a bill on the management 
of the employment insurance fund surplus”.  He had a bill like 
this one in mind.  However, faced with popular opposition—that 
of the Bloc Quebecois and the other opposition parties in the 
House—he backed away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Minister of Finance dreamt of having this 
legitimacy, since at the moment, it is not yet certain that he 
is within the law when he dips into the employment insurance 
fund, and there are cases before the courts at the moment. 
Among others, the CSN is making representations on this issue, 
on the grounds that the finance minister's interpretation of the 
Employment Insurance Act is stretching the point somewhat. It 
might snap, because the Employment Insurance Act includes pretty 
clear provisions on the use of surpluses, and reducing the 
deficit and paying off the debt are not options. The EI 
surpluses must not be used for such purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance dreamed about tabling a bill like that, 
but he does not have the same agenda as his colleague, the 
President of the Treasury Board. He has a different and more 
secret agenda, but everyone knows about it. I am referring to 
the leadership race. It would have been terrible for a 
politician to table a bill legitimizing the use of funds that do 
not belong to the government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Ianno (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the 
Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is nice to see the amalgamation and 
the marriage of the united left.  The Bloc and the NDP have sort 
of the same mindset. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the hon. member.  He did not understand 
the difference between shared risk and shared management. Taking 
into account the $30 billion surplus, the government is 
responsible for the deficit or the surplus.  It is unfortunate 
that in his whole presentation we were not able to understand the 
premise of his argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he like to try to explain to the House what he meant, 
taking into account he was not aware of the shared risk 
management concept? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Madam Speaker, if the hon. member is 
suggesting that I do not grasp the concept of risk, he is badly 
mistaken. In fact, one of my main arguments is that, if he 
claims that past pension deficits were absorbed by the federal 
government, then the President of the Treasury Board should 
table the figures. According to our calculations, the federal 
government's contribution in that respect is around $5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, given a contribution of $5 billion and an anticipated 
actuarial surplus of $30 billion, this leaves some $25 billion 
that does not fully belong to the government; this amount 
belongs equally to taxpayers and the government. 
This is why we are advocating a collegial approach to managing 
the funds and related risk, instead of the dictatorial approach 
proposed by the President of the Treasury Board through Bill 
C-78. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I clearly understand the concept of sharing risk. In fact, when 
I did my masters in university, part of my thesis dealt with 
that issue. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Ianno (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the 
Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, last week the government tabled 
legislation that set out the first major improvements to the 
public service pension plans in more than 30 years.  The 
legislation aims to ensure the long term sustainability of 
Canadian public service pension plans, improve the financial 
management of the pension funds, and upgrade the benefits 
currently offered to government employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise today to express my support for Bill C-78 and to 
underline more particularly its beneficial provisions on the 
management of public pension plan surpluses and deficits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under existing legislation the government assumes responsibility 
for deficits in the pension accounts but is not entitled to 
manage existing surpluses.  Obviously this is an anomaly that 
must be corrected. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1325"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT22"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT22"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1325

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also under the present system when projections show an account 
to be holding more than necessary to meet the future obligations, 
both the employer and the employees must nevertheless continue to 
contribute to the accounts as legislated.  This provision means 
that surpluses can thus continue to exist and even grow 
indefinitely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For private pension plans, however, the Income Tax Act sets a 
limit at which a growing surplus must be managed according to 
specified terms; but this is not the case for public service 
pension plans.  This has become an issue of very real importance 
since 1991.  In 1991 surpluses started to accumulate in the three 
federal government superannuation plans.  They now total some $30 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These surpluses show the difference between the balances of the 
accounts and the amounts estimated by the actuaries needed to 
actually pay for all future benefits earned to date by plan 
members.  It makes no sense to keep forcing the Canadian taxpayer 
to credit ever growing employer contributions to pension plans 
that continue to generate a surplus far in excess of the needs of 
plan members and what the Income Tax Act allows for other plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the President of the Treasury Board said earlier the 
government wants to be fair to government employees, but we would 
not be acting fairly toward other Canadians if we were to give 
federal public servants financial advantages that were not 
available to all.  Bill C-78 will provide the government with the 
authority and mechanism for managing pension surpluses in a 
manner consistent with the rules for registered pension plans as 
set out by the Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The management of the surpluses raises another issue.  Who has 
the ownership of the $30 billion surplus?  Canadian taxpayers 
have always assumed the risk of the public service pension plans 
since their creation in 1964, and these are not empty words. 
Since 1964 Canadian taxpayers have poured into the government 
employee pension plans $13 billion to cover for deficits.  Since 
the government has carried the full load of the risks in all 
those years, it is only fair that we would also be responsible 
for any surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present surpluses would gradually be reduced to the 
allowable level over a period of up to 15 years.  The amounts 
will be debited over the chosen period so that at the end of the 
period the remaining surplus or excesses is at most no greater 
than 10% of the estimated liabilities.  This 10% cushion is in 
line with Income Tax Act maximums that apply to all pension plans 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-78 will also permit Treasury Board ministers to determine 
the use of any future surpluses.  They could decide to institute 
a contribution holiday for plan members, the employer or both, or 
to withdraw all or part of the surplus.  Surpluses could also be 
used to improve benefits though this would require special 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that the government would continue to assume 
all financial risks for the public service pension plans and to 
be solely responsible for making extra contributions to cover any 
future account deficit.  This is a further argument in favour of 
giving the government responsibility for managing an eventual 
surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the legislation now before us, before deciding what to do 
with an eventual surplus the Treasury Board would consult with 
the ministers responsible for the three pension plans and with 
those responsible for the financial management of the plans.  As 
the President of the Treasury Board noted, the same principle 
will be applied in the case of the new Canada Post pension plan 
structure which will also take effect on October 1, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any future surplus in the CPC pension plan will be managed by 
Canada Post which has responsibility for all the risks and 
management of the fund.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This surplus could be used to reduce contributions or to further 
enhance benefits, or a combination of the two.  As previously 
announced, Canada Post will be meeting and discussing the pension 
plan with all bargaining agents over the coming weeks and months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the government first announced its intention to take 
responsibility for future pension plan surpluses it has been 
accused in some quarters of acting unilaterally without due 
regard for the opinion and interests of pension plan holders.  In 
fact the government did not move earlier on this issue precisely 
because it was hoping to reach agreement with plan members on a 
new joint management framework for the future of pensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thorough consultations have been held in the seven years since 
1992 on this subject between the Treasury Board and employee 
representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In November 1992 the President of the Treasury Board asked his 
advisory committee for the public service pension plan to conduct 
a review of the fundamental elements of the plan, including its 
management and financing.  The committee reported to the 
president in December 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After studying the report in February 1998, the President of 
the Treasury Board announced the start of a consultative process 
with employees and pensioners aimed at developing a package to 
reform the public service plan.  Among other things this 
consultative committee was offered to negotiate an agreement on 
sharing the risks of the pension plans that would allow our 
employees to share surpluses in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee met from February to December 1998 and, though 
significant progress was made on the issue of future deficit and 
surplus sharing, discussions broke down last December.  Despite 
the fact that employees have not shared the cost of past 
deficits, their representatives insisted on receiving a 
significant share of the accumulated surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I explained previously, since the government has carried the 
full load of the risks in the past, it is our view that we would 
also be responsible for any surplus.  Even though the employer 
offered joint management and significant improvements to our 
employee pension plans, the offer was deemed insufficient by 
employee representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Faced with this impasse, after having consulted for several 
years with employee and pensioner representatives, the government 
decided to move ahead simply because it could not afford to wait 
any longer.  By delaying indefinitely the necessary changes that 
are being proposed today the government would have in fact 
created an even more intractable position for all concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it would have also shirked its responsibility to all 
Canadian taxpayers if it did not act to put public service 
pension plans on a better financial footing, as well as 
modernizing and improving their administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members should recall, however, that the President of the 
Treasury Board, on behalf of the government, stated on more than 
one occasion that the door remained open for future negotiations 
on the management of pension plan deficits and surpluses.  So 
far, far from being insensitive to the preoccupation of public 
service pension holders, I think the minister has shown himself 
to be very open-minded in his approach to this question.  We 
should applaud his willingness to reopen discussions at the 
opportune time in the best interests of all parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too hope very much that employee representatives will soon 
resume discussions on a joint management plan for our public 
pension plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all hon. members of the House to support the proposed 
amendments to the public service superannuation acts.  I believe 
they are fair to our employees and fair to the Canadian taxpayer 
and that they will bring about much needed and overdue changes to 
government pension plans.

Finance being able to brag about finding extra revenue, what 
benefit will this be to the taxpayers of Canada?  Canadian 
taxpayers are not going to see the cash.  Presumably the money is 
going to end up reducing the government's debt, which has been 
run up over the last 30 years.  That is downright criminal, but 
nonetheless it is there.  What is the benefit for the taxpayers 
of Canada?  What is the benefit for the employees?  Is the 
benefit to make the Liberal government look good? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Ianno:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is nice to hear the 
Reform Party complaining about a debt or a deficit going down. 
It is an interesting reversal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have stated many times, and I know the hon. member agrees, 
the surplus was created by the government putting into the 
legislated plan the amount of money which an actuarial evaluator 
determined was required each year to ensure that enough money was 
available to pay for the service.  Unfortunately, because of the 
way the legislation was written, we cannot take the whole plan 
into account even when there is a surplus and determine that the 
government put in less money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, taking into account that CPP premiums have been going up 
and the percentage of employee contributions was maximized at 
7.5%, which became less of a percentage overall, that meant that 
the government had to continue putting more money in to satisfy 
the needs of the pension plan on a current year basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that the government correct this difference so 
that all Canadians are treated fairly.  I know that the hon. 
member would want that.  Taking into account what this would do 
for Canadians at large is an important step.  We take into 
account the added moneys the government put into the plan to 
ensure that the actuarial evaluator was satisfied.  Even though 
it was more than the government needed to put in, it will allow 
the government to deal with its finances and to ensure that the 
needs of Canadians with respect to health care and all other 
needs are met.  We have to ensure that we are not paying the $42 
billion interest payments per year solely for that, which I know 
my hon. colleagues in the NDP and the Bloc are concerned about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is correct in stating that the $2.5 billion will 
be a benefit to Canadian taxpayers.  That money will be available 
to put into the programs that we all care about, such as child 
poverty and homelessness.  Unfortunately the NDP is making sure 
that its union friends are protected in this process.  They too 
know, as other pension groups know, that this money belongs to 
Canadian taxpayers.  We on this side of the House want to ensure 
that all Canadians benefit from the money that Canadian taxpayers 
pay.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec East, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
astonished at the hon. member's remarks.  I wonder whether he is 
not in fact trying to mislead the public.  I could point out 
many things he said that are really very far removed from the 
truth, one of them being that the minister sponsoring this bill 
is acting with open-mindedness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no open-mindedness when a minister tries to impose the 
government's will, as is happening here, without establishing a 
committee where pension fund contributors would be represented. 
It is more like an abuse of power on the part of the government. 
I cannot see any open-mindedness in what the minister is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is also trying to make people think that the government is 
acting in the interests of pensioners and taxpayers.  Making 
people pay twice, as this bill does, is robbery.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is as if the people who have contributed to this pension 
fund, whose surplus is some $30 billion, were being made to pay 
twice, because the government is acting contrary to the 
interests of pensioners and the general public by grabbing huge 
amounts of money rather then turning them back to the people who 
paid into the fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is double taxation.  This is a hidden tax.  That is the 
truth.  My colleague was trying to convince people that he is 
working in the taxpayers' interests.  That is a falsehood.  Our 
colleague has made a deliberate and intentional error. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically, the government's intention is not to act in an 
open-minded way. 
It has even imposed a gag on debate, scarcely an hour ago, 
because it was so anxious to stifle the debate on this 
misappropriation of Canadians' pension money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not being open-minded.  This is not defending the 
interests of pensioners or taxpayers.  It is making the 
taxpayers pay twice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would therefore call on my colleague to comment this.  Does he 
still maintain that the minister who introduced this bill is 
showing open-mindedness, and is making the taxpayers pay twice 
for this pension fund really seeking to help them? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Ianno:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is interesting that 
even within the same party the knowledge of this bill is 
different from the front to the back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He stated that somehow employees contributed to the surplus, to 
the $30 billion process.  They contributed, but the number 
nowhere nears the amount the government contributed, taking into 
account that the government always had to put in the extra money 
which the actuarial evaluator determined and taking into account 
that the CPP kept increasing to the point where it was 70% from 
the employer and 30% from the employee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member indicated that he would have liked another six 
months of discussion.  That is the reason for time allocation. 
Otherwise, if we had the views of the hon. members opposite, the 
discussion would have continued for another six months, which 
would not have changed the facts that we have before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The President of the Treasury Board has been open minded.  That 
is important.  As we stated, the offer may not be on the table 
directly, but the unions can participate in the discussion with 
respect to the surplus and the new investment fund that is being 
set up by this bill.  Unfortunately the unions have balked at 
that.  They want the surpluses, but they do not necessarily want 
to participate in the potential deficits that may exist in the 
future.  It is one sided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member says that the Canadian taxpayer is double taxed. 
I think with the track record of the Bloc that is something which 
is far-reaching. 
<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I have 
a very straightforward question.  I listened very carefully to 
the parliamentary secretary.  He said that the federal government 
has put $13 billion into the program over the years.  If it has 
only put in $13 billion, why is it trying to take out $30 
billion?  Why is it not sharing it with retirees and current 
employees? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Ianno:</B>  Madam Speaker, we know the NDP's track 
record when it comes to finances.  It left a $10 billion deficit 
in Ontario and in B.C. with its abysmal record on finances.  Once 
again its members do not understand the basic elements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member overheard that somewhere.  It is 
interesting that when the facts are on the table the member feels 
awkward.  Only when he hears it from comments will he then 
respond appropriately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has paid the surplus.  That is why there is a 
surplus and that is what we are dealing with.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, for 
a very short period of time, and I emphasize a very short period 
of time, we are debating Bill C-78 which was first debated last 
Thursday morning.  We talked about it for a little while last 
Thursday and immediately the government introduced closure saying 
that we have talked enough about this on the very first day of 
debate.  Today is the last day of debate at second reading. As 
far as I can tell, it is the government's desire to rush this 
thing right through committee, report stage, third reading and 
into legislation before the people of Canada and the public 
servants can realize what is going on.  They will be presented 
with a fait accompli. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the first time the government has done something like 
this and I doubt it will be the last time.  Every time the 
Liberals do it I think it is atrocious that they would treat the 
democratic process this way, but they feel this is the way they 
want to run the democratic process in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am shocked that the government thinks that a 200 page bill 
with clause after clause of technical writing that is difficult 
to understand can be rushed through parliament in a very, very 
short period of time.  Shame on the government for even thinking 
about doing something like this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had a chance to take a look at some of the small points 
and the bigger points.  We have been talking about the $30 
billion surplus the Liberals are going to help themselves to, 
raid the piggy bank I say and help themselves to the employees' 
pension funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right at the very beginning the government talks about 
privatizing the pension plan.  The government will set up a board 
of directors to run this pension plan, which is normal.  We need 
to have somebody to run it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A member of a pension plan such as the Public Service 
Superannuation Act, the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act or the 
Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superannuation Act, is not entitled 
to participate in the management of the plan because obviously 
there would be a conflict of interest.  We would not want anybody 
who participates in the plan being part of the management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill also amends the Members of Parliament Retiring 
Allowances Act.  Members of parliament are somewhat affected by 
this bill but they will not be precluded from sitting on the 
management board.  This is a little omission which I think speaks 
volumes about who this Liberal government intends to put on the 
management board.  Ex-Liberals collecting a pension of course are 
the first to come to mind.  We will leave that to debate in 
committee, but we have to take a look at these little things in 
detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary tells us that the government feels 
it is entitled to the $30 billion surplus.  Why?  He says because 
the government assumes all the risks.  The government of course 
means that the taxpayer assumes all the risks.  The government 
does not have any money, only the money that the taxpayer gives 
to it.  Therefore, the parliamentary secretary would have been 
quite clear in saying that the taxpayer is assuming the risk, not 
the government.  There is a huge difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary pointed out that in the past there 
has been a deficit and the taxpayer, not the government, had to 
come up with $13 billion to offset that deficit.  Now that there 
is a surplus the government says it should have the money.  I 
believe that taxpayers should be protected so that they do not 
have to come up with another $13 billion down the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gets a little bit complex here.  I hope that I can make my 
argument clear enough for the simple minds on the other side to 
understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a mix between the contributions by the employees and 
the employer.  The two add together to make the contributions. 
Contributions are invested and there is investment income as 
well.  Now we have a surplus.  The government says “We assume 
the risk and therefore we are entitled to the surplus because if 
there is a shortfall we will put it back in”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plan says that the government intends to increase the 
premiums of the employees.  Therefore the employees are obviously 
accepting part of the risk of the financial health of the plan. 
If the employees are accepting part of the risk of the financial 
health of the plan, then the government does not have the right 
to say “We assume all the risks, therefore, we are entitled to 
all the surpluses”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That logic is wrong.  It is faulty.  It cannot stand the test of 
scrutiny.  That is why we are saying the government is being 
heavy handed.  That is no doubt one of the reasons that there is 
closure already.  The government does not want debate to continue 
on this bill.  It knows it cannot substantiate and support its 
flawed logic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at why we have the $30 billion surplus today.  As 
the parliamentary secretary stated, it has only been accrued over 
the last six years.  It started to build in 1991.  It started to 
build for three reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the government imposed a wage freeze on civil servants. 
Since 1991 they have not had an increase.  The actuaries in the 
1980s had anticipated that salaries would go up.  As salaries go 
up the cost of benefits go up too because they are based on a 
percentage of salaries.  If salaries are frozen, benefits are 
frozen.  Therefore the anticipated extra costs of benefits did 
not materialize, hence a part of the surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the civil service pension plan is fully indexed for 
inflation.  It is one of the few, if not the only one, that is 
fully indexed for inflation.  What happened to inflation in the 
1990s?  It virtually disappeared. Therefore the actuarial 
assumptions that inflation was going to increase the cost of 
benefits did not materialize, hence adding to the surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third point is that the money that is in the plan is 
invested in 20 year government bonds.  Back in the 1970s and 
1980s, because of inflation the interests rates were high. Today 
the plan is still benefiting from these high interest rate bonds. 
As they mature and are reinvested in lower interest rate bonds 
or in the private sector, and perhaps the capital markets will 
not continue to do as well as they have in the past, the return 
on the plan is going to start going down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that we no longer have a wage freeze, we can anticipate that 
benefits are going to start going up again because we are 
granting wage increases to the civil service.  Thankfully the 
government recognized that it could not keep a lid on good 
employees forever.  They will either walk away and get a job 
somewhere else or the government is going to pay them what they 
are worth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increases in salaries automatically guarantee increases in the 
cost of benefits.  We will see a lower rate of return on the 
plan.  We know that that increase in the surplus is going to 
stop.  It may peak at about where it is now and potentially it 
may go into a decline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government takes the $30 billion, massages the books and 
then tells us what a wonderful job it is doing, a few years from 
now it will turn around and tell the taxpayers “We are sorry 
folks, there is a deficit in the plan.  You have to pay more 
taxes. You have to pay more cash”.  I do not think that is a 
justifiable position. That is why I proposed on numerous 
occasions that the surplus stay in the plan.  We know the 
Liberals are going to say that that is going to cost the taxpayer 
some money.  But they have already stopped paying interest on the 
surplus.  Therefore that does not cost the taxpayers a penny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The money should stay in the plan to cover the shortfall.  All 
the Liberals want to do is a simple bookkeeping entry, reduce the 
size of the pension plan, reduce the size of the debt and then 
stand back and say what a wonderful job they have done.  Any 
bookkeeper that knows anything about debits and credits can do 
that but what has he accomplished?  Nothing.  He has just reduced 
the assets and the liabilities and nothing has been achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore this bill is only to make the Liberals look good at 
the next election where they can say that they have reduced the 
debt.  But they did not do it by themselves.  They did it 
courtesy of the pension plan of the civil service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier about privatization, there is going to be 
a board.  The plan is going to be privatized over a number of 
years.  That perhaps is not a bad idea.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that the capital markets are overly inflated 
right now.  We certainly hope the Liberals can guarantee a decent 
return on the funds invested.  If they cannot, they will be back 
to the taxpayer.  Remember what the parliamentary secretary told 
us, that the taxpayer is on the hook fully and completely for 
this fund.  I can see them coming back to the taxpayer in short 
order, after the election of course, saying “Oops, 
miscalculation, we need more money”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to protect against that.  We want to make sure that does 
not happen.  That is why we are fighting vigorously for the money 
to stay where it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not advocating that it go to the unions.  We are not 
advocating that it reduce the premiums paid by the civil 
servants.  We are not advocating that we increase the benefits. 
All we are saying is protect the taxpayers.  Protect them now, 
protect them next year and protect them the year after.  There is 
nothing this government wants to do other than make itself look 
good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the Minister of Finance is building up surpluses here, 
there and everywhere.  I have talked about them before.  He has 
$2.5 billion tucked in a bank account for the millennium 
scholarship fund.  It was paid for last year but it is providing 
no benefit to any taxpayer today.  It is sitting there waiting 
for the year 2000-01 which coincidentally happens to be before 
the next anticipated election.  At that time the cash is going to 
flow and students are going to say “Wow, this is great, I 
finally got some cash”.  In the meantime that money could be 
spent now for the benefit of students and it is not.  That is why 
it is smoke and mirrors from that party.

decreased pollution and related health care costs, decreased need

better transit service. All taxpayers benefit from the cost 
savings associated with less single occupancy vehicle use.

to accept the motion of our NDP colleague to consider making 
employer provided transit passes an income tax exempt benefit. 
The proposal would be an excellent step in the federal

the few incentives available to support public transit use.  I 
would urge this government and the Minister of Finance to 
seriously consider this initiative.

comparing himself and his caucus to the Fathers of Confederation 
no less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform leader has even taken to comparing himself to George 
Brown, which is bizarre to say the least since Brown was the 
leader of the Grits and one of the founders of the Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the Reform leader's thoughts of grandeur, it is no wonder 
that the united alternative has received such a cold reception, 
especially in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An Angus Reid poll taken after the UA convention in Ottawa 
reported that only 30% of Albertans are in favour of the united 
alternative.  Even more important, amongst Reform voters it did 
not receive majority support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the Reform leader should listen to the growing group of 
dissenting MPs in his caucus.  If he cannot stay true to his own 
fundamental principles, Canadians will never ever have any reason 
to support him.

possible to get the security council to have a resolution.  That 
would be a very major step forward.

support.  I think that will require that again there be some

</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the embargo being placed is an embargo that is being 
agreed to by countries from the European Union.  We hope many 
other countries will also agree to that. If there is a decision 
to deploy the naval force, for one thing, and if Canada 
participates in it, which is a government decision yet to be 
made, then that is the kind of scenario we are talking about, not 
one which would in fact put a blockade against Russian ships

Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Agriculture and

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my understanding that last week some Reform MPs met with 
their political brethren in the United States to discuss border 
trade problems.  Does the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food 
believe that this kind of initiative will affect the trading 
relationship we enjoy with the United States? 
<P><A NAME="LINK120"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the government welcomes all initiatives 
to improve the trading relationship between Canada and the United 
States.  That is why over five months ago with the United States 
we embarked on a 17 point plan of action including a consultative 
committee to address issues before they became hotter issues 
between our two countries.  Progress is being made.  We are 
pleased that five months after we did that, the Reform Party has 
started to participate.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is up to Transport Canada under the Transportation of

not an original, that it had been altered and changed and did not 
meet the court's continuity principle requirement.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The meeting he was quoting from was an in camera meeting of the 
Standing Committee of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, 
which was held on April 13, 1999.  <I>Beauchesne's</I> sixth 
edition, citation 851, reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a committee chooses to meet <I>in camera</I>, all matters are 
confidential.  Any departure from strict confidentiality should 
be by explicit committee decision which should deal with what 
matters should be published, in which form and by whom. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without divulging the discussion of the in camera meeting, I 
will only say the committee did not make a decision to make the 
minutes public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is further disturbing, and I would add a further contempt, 
is the fact that the member has misrepresented the confidential 
information by also misquoting me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I cannot divulge the confidential minutes of the 
committee, I can correct the record of <I>Hansard</I> which is 
public.  The member should have accurately quoted me as saying 
that I urged the committee to increase the base funding being 
proposed by the Indian affairs committee at that time because the 
Nisga'a legislation was coming down and I wanted to ensure that 
we had adequate funds available for the committee to travel to 
British Columbia.  I in no way asked that the committee move 
quickly on the Nisga'a treaty, as the parliamentary inaccurately 
stated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 20, 1999 the matter of the government leaking a 
government response to a report of the Standing Committee on 
Foreign Affairs was raised in the House.  The next day the 
government House leader apologized for the leak and assured the 
House it would not happen again.

Northern Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has come to my attention that the information he made 
available to the House in responding to a question the other day

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  The hon. member across says “It was 
not”.  I do not know how he can make that affirmation without 
having seen the proof that the hon. member will be bringing to 
the attention of the House.  I understand from conversations I 
have had that such was the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As soon as the hon. member for Provencher returns, I will ask 
him to reply directly to what the hon. member has said, in 
particular bearing in mind the information I received from him 
which is to the effect that the information in fact was in the 
public domain already.  I will nevertheless ask the hon. member 
to address that upon his return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I think we have set the stage.  We have an 
allegation by one hon. member about something that was said.  He 
quoted it directly.  It was said in the House of Commons.  There 
was nothing written.  It was said in the House of Commons and it 
is recorded in <I>Hansard</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point I would like to hear what the hon. member for 
Provencher has to say, so I will wait until he is in the House 
and we will hear what he has to say about it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the present context, where eligibility rules have been 
tightened, I think this is a simple way to give an important 
part of the EI fund surplus back to workers when they are 
unemployed. A person who earns $400 a week would receive two 
more weeks of benefits at $220, which would give that person an 
interesting refund on the EI fund surplus.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, this bill seeks to decriminalize, not

quite simple.  In our justice system today, the resources our 
police have to do their job and to prosecute are severely 
limited.  In my province of British Columbia six courts have been 
closed.  As a result, serious offences like rape and assault are 
not being prosecuted to the fullest extent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is intended to seek a fine for those who are found 
with simple possession.  That money could then be used to engage 
in prevention.  It could be put into education programs for

issues.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I move that the 48th report of the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs presented on Tuesday December 8, 1998 
be concurred in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure how much of a pleasure it is to speak to this 
motion.  I should not have to be standing here in the House today 
speaking to it.  This motion should have gone forward and should 
have been dealt with in the House some time ago.  Nevertheless I 
am going to take my time and go through several issues relating 
to this committee that were supposed to have come from the 
procedure and House affairs committee to speak to the report on 
televised committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some questions have to be asked.  Why is it necessary to begin 
speaking about a seemingly isolated report from a committee?  Why 
was the report not dealt with by the House of Commons?  What is 
in the report that the government does not want to deal with in 
the House?  Since the report was adopted by all parties, why has 
the pilot project contained in the report not gone ahead?  Where 
do we go from here? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will address the question of why it is necessary that we are 
here today speaking about this issue.  This is indicative of most 
committee work in the House of Commons.  A lot of members in the 
House of Commons spend a lot of time doing committee work. In 
this particular committee when we were dealing with getting more 
television coverage in committee, we spent a great deal of time 
in the House on the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did we all disagree in committee?  No.  In fact we all agreed, 
including the government whip and members opposite who were 
sitting on the committee.  They said that it was not a bad idea, 
that we were approaching the year 2000 and perhaps we should 
allow committees to have television coverage equal to other media 
coverage like newspapers, radio and so on.  So we said, why not 
try a pilot project in the committee.  Sounds good.  We all 
agreed on it. If we all agreed on it, where did it go from there?

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It came out of the committee, into the House, a report was 
tabled and non-action.  Why no action?  Presumably somebody over 
on the government side, I guess the cabinet, said, “We do not 
want more coverage by the television networks in committees so 
let us just drop it”.  Nothing happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked three times in House leaders meetings, “Where is this 
committee report?  What are you doing about it?”  The response, 
“Ho hum, we just do not want to deal with it now”. Finally, I 
went to a House leaders meeting several weeks ago and the 
government House leader said, “I have a new deal for you. Why do 
we not equip one more committee room and spend the money on 
television cameras and so on and we will treat it like the only 
other room we have,” which is room 253-C I think it is in the 
House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Out of the blue the government House leader made an offer 
totally unrelated to the results of the report and the results of 
the committee.  I am going to show that in a few minutes.  We are 
supposed to accept this kind of deal under the table and get on 
with life.  He totally disregarded all of the work of all of the 
members on the committee.  He totally disregarded all of the 
recommendations and came up with his own little brainstorm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has to ask therefore, what is the value of a committee in 
the House of Commons?  Do they all work like this?  Yes, many do. 
A lot of members in this House of Commons go to committees. They 
undertake hard work on behalf of their constituents and on behalf 
of people who believe in what they are doing.  They think that 
after a report is dealt with, something valuable is going to come 
of it.  However, once it gets outside and in the House of 
Commons, zero, nothing.  Is it any wonder that we think and are 
convinced committees are all but useless in this House of 
Commons.  I do not think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess we can look at it that maybe there are better things to 
do.  Why not look at how petitions operate in this House of 
Commons.  Same thing.  People go all around the country getting 
signatures for things they believe in, things they trust that 
they can change, and what happens?  It comes into the House of 
Commons and I hate to tell everybody, it goes nowhere, absolutely 
nowhere.  It does not even come to a vote in the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is going to be more of a discussion on what is wrong with 
committees in addition to why can we not have televised 
committees.  There are reasons we want televised committees, by 
the way, and we will cover that as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is in this report?  I must say when I was first approached 
by this, I was quite impressed by the representation in 
particular from LeeEllen Carroll, the director of the Canadian 
parliamentary press executive, who is very forthright in her 
positions and a professional indeed.  There were no hidden 
agendas with this individual.  She came to me and said, “Look, 
what is fair is fair.  Why do we not have televised committee 
meetings in all committee rooms?”  It sounded great to me and in 
fact she made a very professional presentation to the committee, 
along with Craig Oliver, a well respected and renowned individual 
in media circles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of this information was taken by committee members and 
thought to be very well done.  The end result of course is 
“Well, that does not matter”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the recommendations.  These are some of the 
comments in the report that came from the committee to the House: 
“Much of the coverage of the House of Commons is focused on 
question period.  This is only part and, arguably, a distorted 
view of the work of the House and involves only a handful of 
members”.  That is absolutely correct.  Look at the House today. 
Listen to this.  There are more people in a committee than are 
in here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of good work in 20-some committees goes on in the House. 
Unfortunately, the results of those committees are basically 
taken with a grain of salt by the government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report acknowledges that room 253-D is used for broadcasting 
purposes in the House.  The experience appears to have been very 
positive and has been well received by members of parliament and 
the public.  Are there concerns with the way things are televised 
in that room?  No, there has not been.  Should there be concerns 
with televised proceedings in other committee rooms?  I do not 
think so.  Experience has not led us to believe that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Members feel that it would now be appropriate to expand the 
coverage of committee proceedings to permanently equip another 
room for broadcasting committees.  However, it is not feasible or 
desirable at this time”.  This is interesting.  Should we have 
permanent facilities, much like we do in 253?  No, we think there 
is a better idea, we say.  Let us find out what that is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, the report says that there should be no 
discrimination between electronic and print members of the press 
gallery in carrying out professional duties.  I wholeheartedly 
agree with that and so did the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What else does it say?  “We note that the essential purpose of 
broadcasting committee meetings is to enable Canadians to better 
understand the work of parliament and to make the House and its 
work more accessible and transparent”.  This is an excellent 
idea, a good idea.  Let us implement that.  That was one of the 
recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are some specifics:  “All committees should be given an 
opportunity to have some meetings broadcast”.  Good idea. 
“Provisions should be put in place to ensure broadcasting by the 
House of Commons broadcasting service and that it is balanced 
among all committees.  The committee intends to monitor this”. 
Great idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“The electronic media will be allowed on a trial basis to June 
30, 1999 to film any public committee meetings held within the 
parliamentary precincts in Ottawa, subject to certain 
guidelines”.  Good idea.  “It should be gavel to gavel 
filming”.  Great idea.  “The filming must respect the spirit of 
an electronic <I>Hansard</I> and will be subject to the same 
general guidelines, rules and policies as applied to the 
broadcasting of the proceedings of the House itself”. Excellent. 
I would concur with that, as did all members on the committee. 
“That they”—the electronic media—“deposit with the House of 
Commons a copy of the complete tape of each committee meeting 
that is filmed under these guidelines as soon as possible after 
the completion of the meeting”.  Good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“The cameras must be in fixed positions while the committee is 
in session”. Great idea.  Nobody has complaints about that. “No 
more than three cameras will be permitted in a committee room at 
one time”.  Good.  “Cameras and other equipment must be set up 
and dismantled as quickly as possible to minimize the 
disruption”.  That is fine, no problems.  “The existing room 
light and committee sound system are to be used”.  Who could 
argue?  “Camera operators will be required to be members of the 
parliamentary press gallery”.  No problem. “A member of the 
parliamentary press gallery wishing to televise a committee 
meeting must notify the clerk of the committee at least 24 hours 
prior to the meeting”.  That sounds sensible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“We should respect the principle of balanced coverage to 
reflect the work of all committees of the House”.  No one will 
argue with that.  “Those members of the press gallery who wish 
to take advantage of these arrangements will be required to first 
sign an agreement with the House agreeing to be bound by the 
guidelines”.  I could not agree more. “A subcommittee 
consisting of various members should be set up to oversee and 
monitor the implementation of this report”.  This is great. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If these are not such bad concepts, if these are not so tough, 
why is it that this is just another report from another committee 
that goes nowhere in this House of Commons?  What is it on the 
other side of the House that says “If it does not come from our 
cabinet, it is no damned good”?  It is wrong what those folks 
are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the report was adopted by all parties, why is it that a 
pilot project like the one I have just described cannot be 
undertaken?  Somewhere in cabinet is there somebody who says “I 
did not think of it so it will not be done”?  Is it that the 
House leaders did not get an opportunity to see it first so it 
will not get done?  No, that is not the case.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it just possible that all members, when television cameras 
get in a room, speak articulately enough that it embarrasses 
those people in portfolio positions across the way?  Is it 
possible that someone on the other side is concerned about 
somebody having a bright idea?  Is it just fundamentally possible 
that a committee could work better than the chambers of the House 
of Commons?  I may be treading on some soft ground, but I 
sincerely believe that is the problem is here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about grassroots' input as compared to top down?  Is it 
just possible that people who work in committees and travel 
around the country for input to bring into a committee know more 
than the ministers in cabinet about any specific issue?  I think 
it is possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where do we go from here?  There is a certain bias against 
television and the media in these committee rooms.  I respect all 
the media that are in these meetings, but there seems to be a 
fear on the other side that television will actually display 
incompetence, bias or a lack of knowledge on issues.  If that is 
the case, would it not be better to have television cameras in 
the committee and have the skills and abilities of individual 
members improved? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee that is most often on television is the finance 
committee in room 253.  I have never really seen any untoward 
comments made in that committee, nor have I seen anything 
inappropriate.  In fact, I thought the level of debate was really 
quite high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are looking at why we cannot proceed from here, the 
question has to be, why?  Backbenchers, in particular on the 
other side the House, do not get much television time.  I think 
the government House leader was overheard to say “It is just so 
the Reform Party members can get their faces on television”.  If 
we want that we can come in here anytime and speak to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not about getting one's face on television.  This is 
about opening up the House of Commons to the real issues and real 
debates instead of going in camera.  I might note that the 
pension debate we are facing right now is about to head into a 
committee.  This is an important issue and yet it is likely it 
will not be televised.  Why not?  What is wrong with it? Why 
should we not have it open?  Why should the Nisga'a agreement not 
be televised?  There is nothing wrong with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time the House of Commons got into the year 2000 and 
beyond.  I am sick and tired of our members wasting hour after 
hour, day after day in these committee meetings working on 
reports that go nowhere and end up in here even after all the 
Liberals in the committee sign those darned things off.  They 
agree with them and yet they still go nowhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am about to take issue with this.  They will be hearing this 
speech time after time until such time as I get a reasonable 
argument as to why we cannot deal with this issue.  It will be 
either that or maybe I will just have to start pulling our 
members out of committees until I get some kind of guarantee from 
the government that their time will be worthwhile and that the 
reports will be listened to. 
Something has to give here because I am not going to put up with 
it any longer.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has this report fallen on deaf ears?  Why has nothing 
happened?   For goodness sake, if the media, the very people 
government members depend on for their press releases and so on, 
cannot be given respect by hearing the government say “this is 
why we do not want this and why we are going to vote it down”, 
or whatever it wants to do, then there is something wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not just sit on this and have yet another useless report from 
a committee going nowhere but into the annals of government. What 
the government has to do is treat the media and the members of 
those committees with a modicum of respect.  It must make their 
work worthwhile.  Government members should not take the position 
that regardless of how sound a judgment and how great a decision 
some of these things are that because it was not their idea they 
are not going to do it.  That is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The backbenchers over there, however few there are in here 
today, should have the courage of their convictions and stand up 
and say “Yes, why do my reports not come in here for a vote?” 
What is wrong with the people over there?  Why do they not insist 
on it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the first of many times that I will get up and speak to 
this until such time as I get an adequate answer.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
the chair of the standing committee concerned.  We are dealing 
with concurrence in our report No. 48.  The member has picked out 
this report.  Our committee, I believe, is now in the seventies 
in terms of reports that it has submitted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will make some comments about the report that the member 
quoted from selectively.  There are five main recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first one deals with the situation the member described.  At 
the present time, as many viewers of CPAC will know, there is a 
committee room that is equipped for committee hearings and they 
are televised.  Those proceedings are broadcast through CPAC when 
the House of Commons is not sitting.  That has been quite 
successful.  There is a procedure whereby committees go into that 
particular room.   Recommendation one of the report dealt with 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second one dealt with the fact that the House of Commons 
already has portable television equipment which can be moved 
around and can go into committee rooms and particular committees. 
There is a procedure for doing that.  Their proceedings can be 
taped and, in the same way, can go out over the CPAC channels at 
times when this room of the House of Commons is not in operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the House leader for the Reform Party referred in 
part to that.  Our House leader, very soon after the report was 
presented, made the suggestion that it might be very useful, as a 
point of departure for discussion, to discuss fully equipping 
another room so that committees could be broadcast from it.  That 
was the second recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third one, which is very important, was the recommendation 
with respect to CPAC.  A consortium of cable companies tapes the 
proceedings in the same way as they are taping what I am saying 
now. It goes out across the entire country on the parliamentary 
channel.  CPAC deposits a tape of these proceedings which becomes 
the electronic record of the proceedings of the House of Commons. 
There is a discussion about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that the CPAC arrangement, if one talks to 
people across Canada, has been very well received as a creative 
way for getting what the House of Commons does.

<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The channel already has very creative programs, such as the 
scrums, the extended interviews with ministers and other people, 
and a variety of programs about the way the House of Commons 
operates.  In my experience they have been very well received. 
The committee's recommendations on that are very important 
because it is basic to the healthy broadcasting of the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth recommendation deals with the fact that the standing 
committee was very concerned, as is the hon. member opposite, 
that members' work in committee be better represented on the 
airwaves across Canada.  We then came to the point of the pilot 
study, which was the focus of the House leader's speech.  A 
proposal was made for a pilot study by the media with certain 
constraints, which he described. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report contains four recommendations, which the hon. member 
has brushed over.  The member was concerned about one of the 
recommendations, although he admitted that our House leader, very 
early on, proceeded with a suggestion which actually was a 
stronger presentation of one of the recommendations; the 
equipping of a second full time committee room where proceedings 
could be televised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the point of view of this debate, I will go back to the 
fact that my committee, which is one of 20 or 25 standing 
committees and subcommittees of the House, has presented over 70 
reports.  The normal procedure when reports come in is, if they 
are substantial and involve considerable changes, as this one 
does—and the hon. member is quite right about that—there is 
healthy discussion between the parties and the House leaders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from the Reform Party is the leader in the House of 
his own party.  Normally there is discussion about the reports 
because sometimes reports come in and some parties like one part 
and some parties like the other part. It is a healthy discussion 
and something comes from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, I would suggest that healthy discussion was 
stifled by the Reform Party which did not take up the opening 
offer, as it were, of our House leader which was to go beyond one 
of the recommendations here and fully equip a second committee 
room. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that reports coming into the House be 
thoroughly considered.  One of the best ways of doing that is for 
the House leaders to look at them, discuss them in great detail 
and then come back to the House and make recommendations which 
can be supported by all parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the Reform Party members express great interest in the 
matter, it is also of great interest to me personally as chair of 
the committee and to my hon. colleagues on this side of the 
House.  It disappoints me that they did not engage in the normal 
dialogue that follows the tabling of a report in the Chamber.

</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
In the Gladstone decision the Supreme Court of Canada ordered a 
new trial to consider whether the limitations imposed on the 
Heiltsuk were justified, not to “establish the extent of 
licences that ought to be available” to the Heiltsuk First 
Nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a)  Spawn-on-kelp licences:  Existing spawn-on-kelp licences 
were not purchased and transferred to the Heiltsuk First Nation 
because of the high cost of spawn-on-kelp licences and because 
constraints on the allocation transfer program do not alllow for 
sufficient capacity to be retired from the spawn-on-kelp 
licence category.  The Department of Fisheries and Oceans, DFO, 
facilitated the voluntary retirement of herring gillnet licences 
from the commercial fishing fleet to offset harvesting capacity 
resulting from the addition of new communal spawn-on-kelp licences in 
accordance with departmental policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b), (c), (f) and (g)  Economic and market impact:  An 
economic/market assessment regarding spawn-on-kelp was conducted 
in 1997.  The spawn-on-kelp technical working group has not 
conducted a formal review, but the issue has been discussed with 
industry participants.  The 1997 study determined that the 
state of the Japanese economy is a critical factor in the demand 
for spawn-on-kelp, particularly Japanese income levels and 
exchange rates.  The study also found that a previous increase in 
the number of licences had a temporary effect on prices, and 
therefore it recommended that future quantity changes should be 
gradual.  The situation has been monitored since then, but no 
formal review of the economic or market impact has been 
conducted, nor have there been recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In retiring herring gillnet licences and creating communal 
spawn-on-kelp licences, the objective is to keep overall harvest 
effort on herring stocks constant.  The management plans reflect 
changes to the number of herring gillnet and spawn-on-kelp 
licences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) and (e) Biological impact:  Biological assessments of B.C. 
herring stocks are conducted every year.  The herring gillnet, 
seine and spawn-on-kelp fisheries are monitored throughout the 
fishing season.  Assessments based on in-season monitoring and 
other factors are used to determine the total allowable catch and 
herring management plans for subsequent years.  The spawn-on-kelp 
technical working group did not do a formal review, but the issue 
was discussed and industry participants provided advice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The harvest of macrocystis kelp used in spawn-on-kelp 
operations is carried out under the authority the B.C. ministry 
of fisheries.  The B.C. ministry issues marine plant harvest 
licences, which include licence conditions on the area and 
quantity of kelp that may be harvested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(h)  The Supreme Court of Canada, in the Gladstone decision, 
1996, found that the Heiltsuk tribal council had an 
unextinguished aboriginal right to trade herring spawn-on-kelp on 
a commercial basis.  While the court did not quantify that right, 
some guidance was provided on matters that might be considered to 
determine whether the external limitations were justified.  As 
part of the aboriginal fisheries strategy, AFS, discussions, DFO 
then consulted with the Heiltsuk on the number of licences to be 
issued for the 1997 and 1998 seasons.  The minister considered 
the impact of additional licences on existing licence holders. 
Some commercial harvesting licences have been removed from the 
fishery.  The spawn-on-kelp fishery is a limited entry fishery, 
which is open only to those who hold a licence.  Public access 
has not changed as a result of the issuance of licences to the 
Heiltsuk tribal council.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>PUBLIC SECTOR PENSION INVESTMENT BOARD ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK217">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-78, an 
act to establish the Public Sector Pension Investment Board, to 
amend the Public Service Superannuation Act, the Canadian Forces 
Superannuation Act, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police 
Superannuation Act, the Defence Services Pension Continuation 
Act, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Pension Continuation Act, 
the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act and the Canada 
Post Corporation Act and to make a consequential amendment to 
another act, be read the second time and referred to a committee; 
and of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to continue the debate that was interrupted by question 
period and the proceedings since that time. I have largely 
covered the issue regarding the surplus in the plan at this point 
in time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other major issues in the bill include the splitting 
of the CPP from pension plan contributions.  As we know, 
employees of the civil service are the only employees in the 
country who have been making a combined CPP-pension plan payment. 
Now that the government has decided to increase CPP contributions 
dramatically over the next number of years it has split that out 
so that employees will have to pay the same CPP increases that 
everybody else is going to have to pay and perhaps pay more into 
the pension plan as well, if that is warranted at a later date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intention is to privatize the fund over the next number of 
years so that as new contributions are made, starting April 1, 
they will go into a new plan.  Benefits will be paid out of the 
old plan, but new money will not go into the old plan, so when 
the old plan is broke and finished and fully disbursed, by that 
time it will be fully privatized.  It is complex stuff that shows 
the length the government is prepared to go to try to get its 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the other things the government does is to redefine terms 
in the dictionary.  I am looking at page 51 of the bill under 
“persons considered to be married”.  I find this rather 
interesting.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the purposes of this Part, when a contributor dies and, at 
the time of death, the contributor was married to a person with 
whom the contributor had been cohabiting in a relationship of a 
conjugal nature for a period immediately before the marriage, 
that person is considered to have become married to the 
contributor on the day established as being the day on which the 
cohabitation began. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the marriage ceremony is irrelevant.  The government 
has redefined the definition of the term marriage.  As soon as 
one enters into a cohabitation arrangement, by the government's 
definition, one is married, regardless of what the dictionary 
says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will leave that point for Canadians to contemplate.  As many 
people are concerned about the changes taking place in our 
society today, we now have the government leading the way in 
redefining the very simple word “marriage”, which I think for 
generations has meant a ceremony in which people commit 
themselves to each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we have the other issue of it not only being people of the 
opposite sex but people of the same sex.  The government has run 
into a real conundrum in trying to define a defined relationship, 
while at the same time leaving it open for virtually any kind of 
relationship to apply. 
I could not put on the record the complex terminology that 
government members have had to use in trying to say that the door 
is shut and open at the same time.  As we can see, they have had 
to go through contortions to define that.  That debate will 
continue on another day.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said at the beginning of my remarks, I think it is dreadful 
that a 200 page bill with complex legal language, dealing with 
issues as complex as actuarial assessments of pension plans, who 
benefits and who does not, who pays and who does not, who shares 
in the risk and who does not, and so on, should all be wrapped up 
in less than two days of debate because the government has 
introduced closure.  That is an affront to the democratic 
process.  I would hope that members opposite would hang their 
heads in shame for having trampled the rights of members of the 
House who have a right to speak on issues before the House, to 
express the wishes of their constituents and to express their own 
opinions on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a 200 page bill and the government says after a few 
hours of debate “That is enough.  Thank you very much.  We will 
move it to committee”.  We will no doubt have closure at 
committee.  We will likely be refused to hear any witnesses. 
Government members will say that the job is done and that it 
should be brought back to the House.  I can see closure being 
moved at third reading.  That is how arrogant the government has 
become. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that Canadians start to take this point seriously and 
start calling Liberal members of parliament to ask why they are 
doing this.  Why are they putting a muzzle on parliament?  Surely 
if free speech means anything it means free speech in this place. 
We do not have free speech.  We do not even have the right to 
speak any more because of closure.  It is a dreadful day for 
Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Ianno (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the 
Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is interesting how my hon. colleague 
puts on his sleeve what his real concern is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform members are confused.  They came here talking about their 
concern for the taxpayers and their money.  This is a great 
opportunity for the member opposite to deal with this issue. 
However, because of the fear that somehow or other we might get 
credit for defending the taxpayers and their money, members of 
his party are unfortunately trying to find themselves once again, 
even though we know there is the united alternative, which some 
in his party want to kill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many issues that come to this table.  The member 
realizes that it is taxpayers' money, but he is trying to figure 
out where we can take this money.  He stated earlier that it is 
taxpayers' money.  It is not the government's money, it is the 
taxpayers' money.  Yet he wants to take that money and put it 
into some safe somewhere and say “Do not give it to the 
government. Do not give it to the employees”, because it is not 
for the employees, but somehow it should stay there because some 
time in the future there might be a deficit.  Is that not 
interesting? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want their money back now.  They want to know that the 
government is guaranteeing the pensions of its employees, and it 
is doing that.  However, if there is excess money in a surplus, 
they want their money back, so that in effect they can have all 
of the services that they need and require, including receiving 
tax back, if necessary, on the issues at hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member stated that the Canadian taxpayers paid for the 
surplus and they are entitled to their money.  Does he believe 
they should get it back?  If not, what does he recommend we tell 
Canadian taxpayers that is different from what he has stated in 
the last several years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have to laugh when 
government members say they are protecting the taxpayers. How 
much tax relief are they offering because of this bill?  It is a 
big, round zero.  They are offering the taxpayers absolutely 
nothing in this bill because they know that they will stand one 
day and reduce the debt by a bookkeeping entry and say “Look 
what we have done”, but they offer the taxpayer nothing.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said, the surplus arose because of circumstances.  We 
have reduced inflation thankfully, after this government let it 
run out of control.  We have a debt that it let run out of 
control. Thankfully, because we have been here pushing hard it 
has brought that under control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have a situation where the taxpayer is potentially at 
risk so the government can look good for the next election.  That 
is what this bill is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to an article in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> on March 4, 
1997.  I cannot say his name but it talks about the Minister of 
Finance's hidden cash, “Government raids $24 billion public 
service pension surplus”.  It is a raid.  The civil servants are 
finding that their contributions into the plan are being taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are saying leave the money in the plan to protect the 
taxpayer.  We know that if the Liberals stay on that side of the 
House they will be soaking the taxpayer for a tax increase the 
minute it runs into a deficit.  They cannot have it both ways. 
They should be honest and say what their position is. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to the member's remarks with great interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to draw his attention to the fact that the Canada pension 
plan was roundly criticized and condemned because the investments 
were primarily in government instruments, in government bonds, 
and consequently the CPP did not grow anything like the rest of 
the economy.  By contrast, Quebec, which manages its own plan, 
the QPP, invested in market instruments and indeed attained a 
better level of solvency than the CPP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me we are doing precisely the same thing with the 
public service pension plan.  By taking it out of low risk, low 
return government instruments and giving the government an 
opportunity to invest it into the marketplace, we have an 
opportunity to benefit the taxpayer.  Any money that is earned on 
that $30 billion surplus will ultimately go directly or 
indirectly to lowering taxes. I would appreciate the member's 
remarks on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have to remember that 
the government has already stopped paying any interest whatsoever 
on this actuarial surplus of $30 billion.  There is absolutely 
zero cost to the taxpayer at this point in time.  That is saving 
the taxpayer about $2.4 billion a year, give or take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why if the money stays in the plan it will not cost the 
taxpayers anything but it will protect them against tax increases 
at a later date at the whim of this government the minute there 
is a deficit.  Surely a little buffer is not that bad because we 
know at the first opportunity the government will tax and squeeze 
more money out of the taxpayer.  That is what we are trying to 
stop. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want 
the member for St. Albert to clarify something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentioned that the government is no longer paying interest on 
the surplus, but over the years it did do that.  As a result, the 
money that was supposed to be set aside for pensions increased. 
While the government was considering that amount to be part of 
Canada's deficit, that it was money owed, it is now considering 
that same money to be part of a surplus that it will now use to 
offset the deficit.  Does the member find the government's 
approach in its bookkeeping a little strange? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there are an awful lot of 
strange things in the government's bookkeeping.  There are many, 
many things and this just happens to be one of them.  The 
Liberals are going to say that they have done a wonderful thing. 
It is going to kick in before the election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying before question period, they have $2.5 billion 
sitting in a bank account for the Canada scholarship fund.  It is 
already paid for.  The taxpayer has put up the cash and nothing 
is coming down until next year. There was $3.5 billion for the 
big announcement on health care. Again, it will not be available 
until next year.  There was $800 million for the centre for 
innovation that was paid for a couple of years ago.  The money is 
sitting in the bank and is not going to be disbursed until next 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here the Liberals are taking the money from the pension plan. 
Presumably they will apply it to the debt just before the 
election and will say “Boy, we are doing everything”.  But when 
we look at the bookkeeping we find it is a front and that is not 
the way it is.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to ask my colleague to comment on the following. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me there is one commonality between what is 
happening here and what has happened to the EI fund, namely, the 
government is raiding a surplus. In the case of the EI fund, it 
took the money away from employers and employees and it has 
absolutely no intention of giving it back.  It just brings it 
into general revenue.  Now it is raiding this fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member to comment on how those two 
situations are similar and on any differences he might detect in 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a good question. 
The government raids every piggy bank it can find if it is going 
to make the government look good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a little bit of difference between the EI fund, which 
is paid for by employers and employees, and this one.  The 
taxpayer puts cash into the plan and they are not going to get 
this cash.  We are not talking about tax relief.  Not a penny of 
this is being promised as tax relief to the taxpayer, not a 
penny.  The government wants to make a simple accounting change 
to reduce the debt and say how wonderful it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals tried to tell us how wonderful they were when I 
think it was Pierre Trudeau who said “Don't worry about the 
debt.  We owe it to ourselves”.  Look at the mess we got 
ourselves into courtesy of the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the government think it is going to fix it with some smoke 
and mirrors type of accounting policies?  No way.  Taxpayers have 
worked darned hard.  They have had to slog and pay high taxes. 
Now this government is going to put a smile on its face and say 
it is doing a wonderful job with smoke and mirrors accounting.  I 
say that is the wrong way. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is interesting to rise today.  It is déja vu all over again 
for me, having gone through the experience of merging some 
teachers pension funds in the province of Ontario when I was in 
that legislature and arguing whether or not the government of the 
day, the David Peterson government, had the authority to merge 
pensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson:</B>  That was a great government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  The hon. member says that was a great 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The experience we had there would be rather enlightening to 
members opposite, were they to look at the impact.  In reality we 
had one pension in a deficit and another in a huge surplus. 
There were arguments about whether or not the contributions being 
made by the teachers were sufficient or fair in light of 
contributions being made by other employees in the public sector, 
and indeed in the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can say that people in the private sector would be delighted 
to have a pension plan similar to the one we are discussing today 
and certainly similar to the one the teachers enjoyed and still 
enjoy in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can see that we are changing the guard.  I should clarify for 
the Chair that I was told by the whip's desk that I should be 
discussing this for a full 20 minutes, as opposed to sharing my 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, the results of that legislative change in the 
parliament of Ontario were that we took a teachers pension fund 
that was in one sense in some jeopardy and by increasing the 
contributions and by taking the surplus into proper use, we were 
able to create one of the strongest pension funds in all of 
Canada, perhaps even all of North America.  In fact, look at what 
it owns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  The entire world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  It could be the world. You never know. 
I am not sure of the European, Asian or African experience, but 
it is very strong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It owns the Toronto Maple Leafs, who are about to go on and 
defeat Philadelphia this evening, hopefully.  It has amazing 
investments that are making wonderful returns for its members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For whose benefit?  That is what we hear in this place from 
members opposite.  Who is going to benefit from these changes? 
They are trying to suggest that this is simply for the benefit of 
the Liberal Party or the Liberal government.  That is absolute 
nonsense.

<A HREF="#LINKT56"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is for the benefit of all Canadians and in my view, the 
changes here are for the benefit of those who will draw on that 
pension.  This will ensure that that pension is sustainable for 
many years to come for the tens and possibly hundreds of 
thousands of pensioners who will draw upon it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to point out something which I find rather interesting. 
We went through the exercise of having a vote in this place. We 
voted on a motion to adjourn the debate. I am sure the public who 
were watching were somewhat confused.  Why would we be voting on 
a motion to adjourn the debate and what debate were we 
adjourning? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House leader for the official opposition put forward a 
motion on debate that we should have televised coverage of every 
committee operated from this place.  On the surface that would 
seem to make sense.  Why would we not want to have all the 
debates open to the public and televised?  The reality is, and 
the reason I raise this point is that instead of getting on with 
the debate on a very important issue such as this bill and the 
changes to the pension act, what we got was a filibuster that is 
meant to do nothing more than put a wrench in the wheels of 
government.  It is not substantive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite knows full well that there are dozens of 
committee rooms throughout the parliamentary precincts. The rooms 
are in various buildings, across the street in the Wellington 
building, in West Block, East Block and Centre Block.   They are 
all over the place.  If we were to attempt— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I would like to bring to the member's attention that we 
moved off that subject when we had the vote.  We are now on Bill 
C-78 which has nothing to do with cameras and committee rooms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The hon. member for 
St. Albert does have a point.  I would ask the member for 
Mississauga West to make a link between what he is saying right 
now and the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Madam Speaker, all I need is a bit of 
time to do that.  I can see the link quite clearly.  I heard the 
member who just rose on a point of order stand here and complain 
about closure.  I do not know how that had anything to do with 
this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What it had to with was the attempt by the opposition to delay 
this parliament, to stop us from having the opportunity to speak 
about this bill.  That is exactly what it was about.  Now we face 
the threat from the House leader who came halfway across the 
floor to say “You guys have had it now.  We are going to keep on 
delaying”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of getting on with the issue of whose surplus it is, 
instead of debating with my hon. friend who chairs the public 
accounts committee and does a commendable job at it, instead of 
getting to refute some of the points the member makes, we wind up 
wasting time.  It is now five o'clock and question period was 
over at three o'clock.  So what do we do.  We kill the better 
part of two hours in this place because the members opposite 
simply want to stand up in an obstreperous manner to try to delay 
the proceedings of parliament with nothing whatsoever to be 
gained on the bill involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question here is, whose surplus is it anyway?  Let us look 
at the facts.   We have a collective agreement.  While I find the 
position of the Reform Party, in the usual fashion, somewhat off 
the wall, I want to at least give some credit to the NDP critic, 
the member for Winnipeg Centre.  Even though I do not agree with 
the position the member is taking on this, at least the NDP is 
being consistent on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read from <I>Hansard</I> the NDP's view. This came from 
the member for Winnipeg Centre:  “It is a basic tenet of the 
trade union movement that all pension surpluses are the sole 
property of the employee.  They are not the employers' money to 
use as they see fit.  They are deferred wages.  It is our money 
speaking on behalf of working people”. 
That has long been a position of the New Democratic Party.  That 
is absolutely clear.  Its stated philosophy or goal in life is to 
stand up in its own way and defend what it sees as the rights of 
the union. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT57"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we get the other extreme that comes from members of the 
Reform Party.  They say it is the position of the official 
opposition that these surpluses belong to neither the government 
nor outright to the unions.  It is the taxpayers who are the 
forgotten partner in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have pretty extreme positions dealing with an issue. 
Interestingly enough it is easy to take extreme positions when 
they sit in opposition and are accountable to no one.  It is up 
to the government then to make a decision as to what is fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a pension fund where contributions have been made by the 
employees and the employers alike at a ratio of 70% by the 
employer, which happens to be the taxpayer, and 30% by the 
employee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not make sense, if we believe in the position of the 
Reform Party that the taxpayers are the forgotten elements, to 
use the surplus that has built up as a result of a 70% 
contribution over many years to pay down the debt?   I find it 
astounding that members opposite could stand in their places, as 
I think the previous speaker said, and say that $30 billion is 
only a small amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has been successful in eliminating a $42 billion 
deficit-overdraft.  For the first time in over 40 years it has 
actually put a dent in the debt of the country by some $20 
billion.  Now we have an opportunity staring us in the face to 
further reduce the national debt by $30 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand where the NDP is coming from.  It is fighting for 
its brothers and sisters in the union.  It is consistent. However 
I cannot understand where the official opposition is coming from 
when it stands and says that we should leave it alone, not touch 
it.  It does not belong to the union.  It does not belong to the 
government.  Somehow it belongs to taxpayers but we are to leave 
it alone and not give it to the taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Did we say that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  The member asks whether they said 
that.  How else would we interpret the fact that I have heard 
members of the official opposition say that the surplus moneys 
should be left in surplus and simply allowed to grow? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somewhere the NDP talks about the potential growth going to $100 
billion.  Let us turn around and extrapolate it.  We leave the 
$30 billion in the account as members opposite are suggesting. 
That account then grows to $100 billion as a result of a 
contribution agreement that is 70:30.  Benefits are being paid 
out. Obligations are being made.  Pensioners are secure.  We 
should leave $100 billion in some kind of surplus savings account 
while taxpayers on the other side of the argument struggle with 
the burden of carrying a $550 billion or $560 billion debt?  It 
makes no sense whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time all of us in this place, regardless of political 
stripe, agreed with the taxpayers who say to me that we should 
pay down the debt.  Yes, they want tax relief, but they want debt 
reduction.  The reason they want debt reduction is that they know 
that debt will fall on the shoulders and come out of the wallets 
of their kids and their grand kids.  There is absolutely no doubt 
about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They can point fingers if they want and say that the reason the 
debt is so high is this or that government.  We could blame all 
kinds of people and parties, most of them not in this place, for 
the size of that debt.

<A HREF="#LINKT58"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that society has changed.  Our country has 
matured.  It is my view that we have matured to the point where 
we recognize something which I think was recognized in many 
municipalities around the country in the late seventies, that we 
cannot simply continue to borrow and mortgage the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what this is all about.  I find it a rather incongruous 
position for the opposition party to stand in this place and say 
we should leave it alone, ignore it, pretend it is not there and 
save it for a rainy day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to another point.  Whether it be an employment 
insurance fund or a superannuation fund for the RCMP or for 
anybody involved in the public service, who ultimately is 
responsible to ensure that the pension commitments are made? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It is not complex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  No, it is not complex.  It is pretty 
straightforward.  I would submit the people of Canada have signed 
the bargaining agreements and employ these individuals.  It is 
the Government of Canada representing the people of Canada that 
is ultimately responsible for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of the surplus is key just because of the size of it, 
it being a $30 billion impact.  If I thought for one minute we 
would take the $30 billion out of this fund and simply spread it 
around and spend it, that would be irresponsible.  That is not 
what we are talking about.  This is an unprecedented opportunity 
for the government to show leadership in fiscal responsibility 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would follow on the last budget and the one before and the 
takeover in 1993 when the government put the country of Canada, 
along with the tremendous help and sacrifices of Canadians, on 
the route to fiscal responsibility by eliminating the deficit and 
starting to pay down the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They can say all they want about disagreeing with government 
policies.  They can say all they want about criticizing the 
direction or philosophy of the government.  They cannot dispute 
that since 1993 the overdraft in the country has been eliminated 
and the debt is starting to be paid down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it is an important part of the whole issue surrounding 
these pension amendments, the primary purpose is to establish 
something that once again members opposite, notably the New 
Democrats and the Reform, should be supporting, that is a public 
sector pension investment board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An argument has gone on and on at various levels of government 
about who will control the money.  Who will make the decision 
about where it is to be invested and how much it returns?  This 
is an absolute breath of fresh air because the board will operate 
at arm's length from the government, something I would have 
thought we would have heard cheers about from members opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be arm's length from employees and pensioners.  No 
member of parliament will be allowed to sit on it.  That is the 
way it should be.  There should be no conflicts or perceived 
conflicts in the establishment of such a board.  There will be 12 
qualified directors to be appointed by the government.  I do not 
know who else would appoint them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ultimately at the end of the day it is the government that is 
responsible, that is liable for anything which goes wrong, and 
there is no question it is the government's responsibility to 
ensure that there are 12 competent, highly qualified individuals 
on that board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will require quarterly or annual financial statements to be 
provided to the ministers responsible for the funds.  An annual 
report will be tabled in the House, I say to the chair of the 
public accounts committee, which is something he is always 
calling for.  There will be an opportunity to debate that report. 
We can refer it to committee.  There is no question the 
accountability is there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mention particularly for members of the New Democratic Party 
mandatory advisory committees for each of the three major plans 
with at least half the committee members to be employees and 
pensioners shall be established.

<A HREF="#LINKT59"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is saying there is an opportunity for co-management, an 
opportunity for input.  I am sure the New Democrats would rather 
turn it over unilaterally to the union.  I understand that 
position.  That would be once again consistent with the 
philosophy of that party, but that is not the position the 
government wishes to take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Turn it over to management.  That is 
what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  I do not think it should be turned 
over to management either.  This is an opportunity to work 
together on this fund and it makes absolute sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question of managing ongoing surpluses is critically 
important as is the whole issue of how we determine over a 15 
year period what is to be done in relationship to any surplus 
that might amount.  We do not need to be going through this every 
15 years.  This is causing some stress, some anxiety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the labour position.  I would expect nothing less 
than for labour to stand through its representatives in the House 
and fight on the basis that it thinks this is its money and it 
should have control of it.  I understand that. I just do not 
agree with it.  Neither does the government agree with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand the position of the official opposition, 
however, that would continually simply take a position that is 
contrary.  Somehow Reform members think every day when they get 
up in the morning that whatever they do we will disagree with and 
take a contrary position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is responsible legislation.  It is fair to the taxpayer. It 
is fair to pensioners that will need this pension for their 
future protection. 
<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I appreciated the speech to some degree, although I have a number 
of questions for the hon. member for Mississauga West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that a third of the bill deals with redefining 
or changing the terms widow, wives, spouse, spouses.  They are 
all taken out of the bill and he did not make any mention of 
that.  They have been replaced with the following, and I read 
from the bill itself: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the purposes of this part, when a person establishes that he 
or she is cohabiting in a relationship of a conjugal nature with 
a contributor for at least one year immediately before the death 
of the contributor, that person is considered to be a survivor. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key is “cohabiting in a relationship of a conjugal 
nature”.  Nowhere in the bill does it define what that is 
exactly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member for Mississauga West be so good as to tell 
us how the government will determine who qualifies and who does 
not based on that definition? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, would two roommates who are close and share 
expenses but have no conjugal or intimate physical relationship 
be excluded based on physical intimacy?  Is this the policy of 
the party whose leader once said that the government had no place 
in the bedrooms of the nation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would appreciate if he could clarify for the House how they 
intend to approach that issue with the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am sure it caused 
some consternation in the Reform Party when its members saw what 
appeared to be some attempt to dodge the same sex issue.  They 
would like to simply turn this debate around on that one issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris:</B>  Give us a break. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  I will give the member a break all 
right. What has happened here is that the government has put in 
place an amendment which frankly takes that issue off the table 
and settles it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us deal with the important issues.  The important issues in 
this are not whether someone is having a conjugal relationship 
with a same sex partner.  We are not redefining family.  We are 
not redefining marriage.  I believe the important aspect of 
benefits paid to a survivor under any pension plan is how the 
premiums were paid.  Were they paid on a family basis and are 
they recognized in that capacity? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill goes a long way to setting a new standard that 
Canadians will understand.

Madam Speaker, while we appreciated whatever the member just 
said, he did not answer the question from the member for Calgary 
Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He stood up for 20 minutes in debate and seemed to have at least 
assured himself that he was talking about a subject he knew 
about, so the member for Calgary Centre asked him a question 
regarding the definition of the relationship of a conjugal 
nature.  He wanted to know if two roommates who were close and 
shared expenses but had no physical relationship would qualify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member did not answer the question.  I would just like to 
give him an opportunity to specifically answer the question that 
the member for Calgary Centre asked him and which I put to him 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Madam Speaker, this proves my point. 
The Reform Party members would simply like to turn this into an 
issue of same sex relationships instead of— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  You are the one who put it into the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Well, they are trying to understand 
what the word conjugal means.  I will allow them to go to their 
own dictionaries to figure that one out.  It would be highly 
unlikely that I would take the time in here to try to conduct sex 
education classes for members opposite.  I am not sure that they 
would be able to grasp it in any event. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issues in this bill are about improvements to the benefits 
of the people who will collect the pensions.  The issue very 
clearly lays out the fact that survivor benefits can include 
people in that kind of relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know why those members do not just stand up and say 
what it is they want to say.  Frankly, I do not think they would 
like the reaction of the Canadian public when they do that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, in 
response to the member's answer and his position that the issue 
in the bill is to improve the benefits for the pensioners, why 
are we not reinvesting the surplus and improving the pension 
benefits to those women who have been in the service for 20 years 
and will get $9,600 a year in pension?  Why are we not doing 
that?  Why are we taking that money out and using it to make the 
government look like it has a surplus and is doing a great job 
with our finances? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for a relevant question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me first deal with the improvements.  The formula for 
calculating retirement benefits will be changed to five 
consecutive years instead of six.  That is an improvement.  The 
hon. member's own critic said so in <I>Hansard</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The formula by which the plan benefits are integrated with the 
CPP or the QPP will be changed in the plan member's favour; life 
insurance to ensure the government's pension package for its 
employees, in keeping with the opinions of the courts; the issue 
of survivors' benefits under the major plans, including the 
pension plans for members of parliament, will be amended to 
extend survivors' benefits to same sex partners on the same basis 
as survivors' benefits are now available to opposite sex partners 
in a common law relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A dental plan will also be included in the amendments.  The bill 
will include authority for the Treasury Board to look at the 
surpluses that get accumulated every 15 years.  I have outlined 
lots of benefits that will be improvements for the members. There 
are more, but I know that my time is limited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member should read her own critic's <I>Hansard</I>.  He 
actually praises many of the changes in the bill on behalf of the 
retirees.  I would not want to mislead the House by saying he 
agrees with everything, but he does point out that there are a 
number of very positive improvements.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Ianno (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the 
Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is interesting to watch the Reform 
members sort of stumble in this process.  They realize that what 
we are doing is something that they probably would consider doing 
if they were on this side of the House.  However, because they 
see this as good government, they have to try to find things that 
will go to the worst part of their being.  It is unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for my hon. colleague.  It is interesting how 
the member for St. Albert indicated that by putting the money in 
the black box and not giving it back to the taxpayers or to the 
employees is the best route.  Reformers used to idolize the debt 
board.  They used to get up and look at it as it turned every 
second along the way, yet when the opportunity is here, because 
it is the taxpayers' money and being returned to the taxpayer, 
they are against that. 
I just do not understand how they would put Canadian taxpayers at 
risk by trying some cockamamie idea of placing $30 billion in a 
black box for some rainy day.  Will the hon. member please tell 
me how they can deal with this hypocrisy?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Madam Speaker, I agree with the 
sentiment expressed by the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having worked with the member for St. Albert on public accounts, 
I have found him to be one of the few members on that side whom I 
would give some credit to for being a responsible individual when 
it comes to this.  I am therefore astounded when I hear him say 
that this money belongs to the Canadian taxpayer, not to the 
government nor to the union.  I understand that position. 
However, why do we not put it to the best use possible that will 
benefit the Canadian taxpayer? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the people I have talked to in my riding and clearly those 
across Canada, they want us to reduce the debt.  They understand 
the burden on their kids and their grandchildren. They want us to 
use every available excess dollar, every available surplus that 
we possibly can to reduce the debt.  That is what this will do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is astounding that Reform would simply see us leaving it in a 
black box, as the member said, or in some kind of bank account 
and not putting it to proper use and to the benefit of all 
taxpayers in Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the first 
question I would put concerns the role of the legislator.  I 
have been a member of parliament for nearly six years now, and I 
often wonder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a parliament or a government has employees it is 
responsible for, it becomes sort of judge and jury, and the 
current government is much more judge than jury.  On a number of 
occasions, whether it involves back to work legislation or any 
law concerning employees, we have seen that it opposes workers 
and unions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder how long it will continue to abuse the rights set out 
in the various laws of parliament or in the provisions of 
collective agreements or right to strike measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has become almost impossible today for public servants to 
enjoy the right to strike.  We saw this recently with the 
legislation forcing employees back to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The position of the government in this debate is coloured 
anti-union or anti-worker, because it often reneges on its 
signature.  It refuses to negotiate in the knowledge that it 
will legislate in the end.  It is perfectly natural to question 
the powers of the legislator.  I think it risks falling into a 
trap, that of thinking it can dictate because of its majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government seems to be saying “We have a majority.  The 
opposition can do what it likes, in the end, we will implement a 
measure”. 
Unfortunately, this is what happened again today with the 
infamous time allocation motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there are safety valves in society and parliament is one of 
them.  When the opposition parties are deliberately gagged, it 
seems to me that these safety valves are being bypassed. 
Canada's unions, its labour legislation, its collective 
agreements, and its opposition no longer matter.  All that 
counts is the dictatorship of the majority.  I think it is 
important that we be able to start by looking at this state of 
affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have often accused the government of relentlessly crusading 
against workers and we have further proof of this today.  If we 
look at this government's track record, there is nothing 
surprising about it wanting to get its hands on the surpluses in 
federal public servants' pension funds today.

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw this with the rail workers, when parliament sat for one 
whole weekend to force them back to work.  Recently, there was a 
typical example of this, when the government forced federal 
public servants, who incidentally had the right to strike, back 
to work. The government deliberately held up negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, these federal public servants had not had a pay 
increase for six years. All the government had to do was sit 
down and deliberately hold up progress at the negotiating tables 
in order to later be able to force them back to work.  This is 
yet another example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of my colleagues pointed out the parallel between the bill 
before us today, through which the government wants to grab the 
surpluses in the federal pension funds, and what happened and 
still goes on with EI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, the Bloc has been bringing up for several years the huge 
surplus that is accumulating in EI fund. That surplus is 
currently estimated at about $25 billion. The government used 
this surplus to solve its deficit problem. There were many other 
options. For example, the government could have reduced the 
premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have said repeatedly that any reduction in EI premium creates 
jobs. Nonetheless, the government ignored that option. 
All it is interested in is grabbing any surplus that may have 
accumulated, no matter where. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other approach suggested by the Bloc Quebecois to solve the 
EI surplus problem was to improve the plan. When we raise this 
option, the minister often calls us old-fashioned and accuses us 
of trying to use the EI fund for regional development purposes. 
But we must face reality. There are many have-not areas in Quebec 
and Canada where the unemployment rate is very high and which 
would benefit from an improved plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the government is not interested in improving the plan or 
lowering premiums, even though that would create jobs. It wants 
to get its hands on the surpluses. 
It has already done it with the employment insurance fund. In 
fact, this government has a propensity to get its hand on any 
surplus, no matter where. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And there are other instances. The government has also cut 
transfers to the provinces. Now it is after the surpluses in the 
public service pension plans; not to mention the number of years 
for which it has refused pay equity for women in the federal 
public service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is simply in the process of grabbing anything it 
can. Unfortunately, this means less money for the regions, and 
that is something we have to repeat constantly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at what we have before us today, we can see that 
there is a $30 billion surplus in the federal public service 
pension fund. 
Granted, half of this surplus, or $15 billion, comes from 
contributions made by the government and its employees. This is 
the kind of surplus we are talking about in the federal public 
service employee's pension plan. There is also a $2.5 billion 
surplus in the RCMP pension fund and a $13 billion surplus in 
the Canadian Forces pension fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I represent a riding that is home to many federal public 
servants, and to a large military population since one of the 
largest bases in Canada is located in my riding. This bill will 
affect current and future pensioners for many reasons. These are 
similar to the reasons set out with respect to the employment 
insurance fund, as I tried to demonstrate earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the government not interested in improving the federal public 
service employees, RCMP and Canadian Forces pension plans? No, 
it is not interested in doing that, just as it is not interested 
in improving the EI program. It just wants to get its hand on 
any surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it interested in reducing contributions substantially or 
giving a holiday on premiums, as is often the case? The 
government shows no interest at all for this solution because it 
wants to get its hands on as many billion dollars as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, could the government not reduce penalties on early 
retirement, which would be another way to create employment? No, 
the government is not interested in that, because it is obsessed 
with the $30 billion which it wants to grab.

<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same thing happened with the $25 billion in the employment 
insurance fund, which the government wanted. Similarly, the 
government reduced transfer payments because it wanted to 
accumulate money and reduce its payments to provinces. 
Meanwhile, the government has not even put its own backyard in 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It did not even make the necessary efforts to streamline all 
departments, but it forced all others to streamline their own 
operations. The government now wants the surplus in the public 
service employees' pension fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only thing the government wants is to get its hands on the 
money. It says “Look how good administrators we are”. 
Conveniently, this government is almost at mid term and is now 
getting ready for the next election. It will be saying “See how 
good the Liberal government is and how well it is managing 
things”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well, they managed on the backs of everyone, including the 
unemployed, the provinces—with the cuts in transfer payments—and 
now its employees—with the pension fund surplus. The government 
also managed on the backs of women working in the federal public 
service. According to some people, this policy has allowed the 
government to save between $5 and $6 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How easy it is to manage this way and say “We will ask everyone 
to make an effort, but we will not. 
Moreover, we will control anything that relates to negotiations 
or that has a significant impact on the federal budget. We will 
block negotiations at the bargaining table and we will impose 
back to work legislation and salary freezes”. And the government 
just goes merrily on its way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is outrageous. Let us not forget that we are all members of 
parliament, that we represent our ridings. Such measures prevent 
retirees from getting a little more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding, members of the Canadian forces or the federal 
public service make an average annual salary of $30,000. When 
these people retire, their income will be around $21,000. 
Instead of trying to help them a little more and put money in 
circulation in every region, the government prefers to 
appropriate that money. This is absolutely outrageous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the government's argument to the effect that if 
there is a deficit, it pays for it. But it is Canadian taxpayers 
who pay for the deficit. When there are surpluses, Canadian 
taxpayers should benefit from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know how many deficits there were. What was the 
amount of these deficits? I truly believe that the current 
surpluses in the plans exceed all the previous deficits 
combined. It might be interesting for the government to say “We 
do not want to lower contributions. We do not want to improve 
the plan. Therefore, let us deduct all the previous deficits 
from the surplus. Then we will make sure the money is properly 
shared among those who contributed to that plan”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not what the government is doing. It is ignoring all of 
that and simply grabbing the plan's surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss not to mention at this point the Singer 
employees. A few years ago, the Bloc Quebecois fought to get 
justice for the employees of the Singer Company because the 
government was a trustee of the company's pension plan. Today, I 
understand why the government objected to that. If it had opened 
the door, it would never have been able to follow through with 
its plan to raid the federal public service pension fund as it 
is doing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It refused to budge. I submit that the Singer employees were the 
first victims of the government's plan that is becoming reality 
today . Nevertheless, the injustice still remains. In those 
days, the government had allowed the Singer Company to stop 
paying premiums. For years, it did not contribute, whereas its 
employees were still paying. Then the company shut down and took 
off with what was left in the fund. 
Not only did it not contribute, but it made off with the 
employees' contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe today this should weigh heavily on the government's 
conscience. Singer workers, who are 83 years old on average, 
receive a monthly pension ranging from $20 to $50, thanks to the 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the Liberal government lets people who have been paying 
full premiums all their life retire, but it refuses to enhance 
their plan, saying the Canadian taxpayers would have to pay for 
it, which is not true.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just the Canadian taxpayer.  It is not just the 
government that paid for all of this. The federal public 
servants also paid for it.  Some of them paid in for 25 or 30 
years, and now, when they are in need of it, they are being told 
“We are going to freeze benefits where they are, and take the 
surplus”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be no surprise to learn that the Bloc Quebecois cannot 
agree with this.  I have often made the claim that the Bloc 
Quebecois was the party that most supported the workers in this 
House.  It is the one that has come to their defence the most. 
Most of those who voted for all of the members of this House are 
workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it is right to take the side of the worker by 
administering the federal budget in a responsible way. 
Unfortunately, in this House only the Bloc Quebecois has held a 
consistent position as far as workers are concerned, in all the 
issues I have listed.  It is the only party that has defended 
them.  No matter what bill was introduced, it was the only party 
to come to the workers' defence.  All of the other parties, at 
one time or another, have taken a wrong turn, have given up 
caring about the workers, but not us, ever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nor will we today.  We will fight this bill to the utmost of our 
limited abilities.  We have very little leeway.  The government 
has announced “Debate will be over at 6.30 p.m.  Then there will 
be a vote”.  What is going to happen in committee, because the 
bill will be referred to a committee?  The same thing, probably. 
At one point they will say “That is enough.  We will move on to 
clause by clause adoption”.  It will come back at third reading, 
and the government will probably impose closure again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that this government uses closure to excess.  The 
opposition parties help ensure the government does not fall into 
dictatorship by majority.  It denies the right to speak to those 
who are trying to bring about more specific things or to do a 
little damage control.  We have a government that is not only 
judge and jury outside the House through negotiation, but judge 
and jury in the House because it limits the opposition's time 
for debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, and for these reasons, the Bloc Quebecois will 
oppose this bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to the member's speech and to the 
debate generally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me one precious part of this argument is missing. 
There are two different types of pensions in the private and 
public sectors.  One is called the defined benefit program.  The 
other one is a fluctuating benefit program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fluctuating benefit is determined by the amount of money 
that is invested in the plan.  In other words, it is an actual 
calculation of how much money is invested and then the benefit 
level is determined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This plan is a defined benefit plan.  It means very simply that 
the benefits are predetermined.  It is irrelevant how much money 
physically is in or is not in the plan.  The beneficiaries will 
get the same pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party's position is even more ludicrous.  The Reform 
Party is saying to leave the money in the plan. But there is no 
money.  It is a notional amount that does not exist.  There is no 
bank account with $30 billion in it. Whether we left it in the 
plan or took out it will not improve the employees' benefit 
levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This particular intervener talked about defending the workers of 
Canada.  I suspect that those workers are also taxpayers.  What 
he is talking about is giving this $30 billion of the taxpayers' 
money that has built up in this fund to somebody else.  I just 
said that it would have no impact on the calculation of people's 
benefit packages.

</I></B></P><P align=left>How could the member justify taking a predetermined benefit 
package and increasing people's benefits for which there is no 
legal framework to do so, in other words, taking it off those 
very workers he claims to defend and giving it to another group 
of workers?  It makes no sense. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand:</B> I would respond to my colleague by 
saying that if we cannot improve the plan—and I have my doubts, 
because as legislators here, the plan must be approved by the 
Parliament of Canada—I suppose it is possible to change the 
terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But even if there were not a way to change the terms of a plan, 
could we, for example, lower the contributions employees pay 
weekly, daily, from their paycheques so they keep the plan they 
have now? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of solutions open to the government, but 
unfortunately it is not interested.  It changes the figures when 
it is time to be judge and judged, in order to save money and 
then turn around and help itself to a surplus it often generated 
itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was reading a very interesting article this morning written by 
a Mr. Paquet, who has worked in the union sector for quite some 
time.  He says that plans are often based on actuarial forecasts 
that <I>x</I> billions of dollars will be needed to keep a plan going 
for <I>x</I> number of years.  Yet actuaries are frequently wrong, and 
he compares them, quite surprisingly, to Quebec's JoJo Savard, a 
fortune teller. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there are surpluses in the plan, there are two ways of 
using them.  But that assumes one is not trying to help oneself, 
that one wishes to help workers and those wanting to see their 
regions benefit from these surpluses.  The plan can either be 
improved, or contributions suspended for a while.  These are 
ways of reducing the surplus, but this is not what the 
government is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is maintaining contribution rates at existing 
levels, or very nearly, and claiming that the surpluses belong 
to it.  This is completely wrong, in my opinion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Ianno (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the 
Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is interesting to listen to the hon. 
member from the Bloc and his colleagues who preceded him.  They 
believe that the investment fund, especially the Quebec pension 
plan, worked really well.  They liked the model. Taking into 
account that it is a shared risk management, on that basis it 
would be shared by those participating in the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the member fails to address the issue that 
employees now contribute 30% of the plan with a maximum 7.5% of 
the amount when we take into account that CPP has gone up and 
reduced the amount they actually contribute to the pension plan. 
This surplus has been created because the actuarial evaluator 
determines for the government how much it should put into the 
plan on a current year basis taking only that year into account. 
Had they taken the whole process into account, then the 
government would not have to put in extra money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the future plan that is being set up, the investment fund, 
which I know his party endorses, does the hon. member believe he 
should advise the unions to participate in the risk management 
sharing?  In effect any surplus in the new plan could be shared 
through holidays for the employees or the employers or both on 
that basis.  In effect the risk is also taken into account and if 
a deficit does occur they will also put in. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is true that the Quebec 
public service pension plan is properly managed. It is so 
because of a tradition of effective negotiations with the 
central labour bodies in Quebec on how the plan should be 
managed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes without saying that the government has certain 
prerogatives. At some point, it can say that there are problems, 
that the fund is accumulating more slowly, or that it owes too 
much money to the fund. The government will then sit down with 
the central labour bodies and negotiate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec tradition in this regard is rather effective. As far 
as I am concerned, it is better than the federal approach I have 
seen for the past six years. The federal government ignores the 
unions, either slows down negotiations or stops them altogether 
and ends up pushing back to work legislation through the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that workers should have a responsibility if there is a 
deficit or a surplus. But there are surpluses right now. The 
government did not provide the figures for the previous 
deficits, but we have had surpluses since 1995. 
I am sure that the surpluses exceed the deficits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not right for the government to now take the money and say 
“Continue to pay. We will not improve your plan; we are only 
interested in taking the money”. Again, this is not right.

available to every member of parliament.  These notes make it 
very clear that this legislation is about giving survivor 
benefits to same sex couples.  It notes in the notes that I have 
that this is merely following in concert with various court 
decisions that have come down recently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the member for Calgary Centre in the House.  In his 
remarks he focused on the issue of giving survivor benefits to 
people in conjugal relationships.  He has a very important point, 
because rather than the bill specifying very clearly that the 
intention is to provide survivor benefits to same sex couples, 
the bill seems to have, shall we say, gone around the corner the 
long way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have the bill here.  What it has done is taken the section in 
the original bill that deals with survivor benefits, and that 
section in defining who is eligible for survivor benefits uses 
words like person of the opposite sex to whom the contributor was 
not married, the surviving spouse, the spouse of the contributor, 
become married to the contributor on a certain day and so forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the existing section of the act talks very 
specifically about spousal relationships and marriage 
relationships as defining the people who are to be eligible for 
the survivor benefits.  Because they are talking about spouses 
and marriages it is assumed that it is a heterosexual 
relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the purpose of the act this area was changed in various 
places, but to avoid use of the word spouse, married or anything 
like that, the act defines the relationship.  It says for the 
purposes of this part when a person establishes that he or she 
was cohabiting in the relationship of a conjugal nature with the 
contributor and so on and so forth.  The key word, as pointed out 
by the member for Calgary Centre, is the word conjugal.

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is the problem.  I for one believe it is high time for this 
government to recognize that there are special relationships, 
that there are same sex relationships that are dependent 
relationships and are very emotionally tied together in almost 
every way we can imagine.  Whether there is sex involved or not 
there can be relationships between two individuals that have the 
force of a marriage, even though they are not a marriage, but are 
not necessarily conjugal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that when we use the word conjugal we not only 
imply but we actually say that the relationship we are talking 
about is the married relationship.  More than that, when we use 
the word conjugal, depending on the dictionary we use, we are 
even implying a heterosexual family relationship involving 
parents and offspring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I see as a result of this problem is that the government 
may be missing on the very thing that it wants to achieve.  In 
other words, by saying conjugal in this bill the government may 
be leading the courts to strike down any attempt to apply these 
survivor benefits to same sex couples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Calgary Centre had a point but he did not pursue 
it in sufficient depth.  What is really wrong here is not that 
the government is trying to pull the wool over our eyes or go 
around some corner to do something the public does not want it to 
do.  The government has been very open with respect to its 
intention to try to honour what the courts have said and to 
honour what most Canadians are saying, that there are certain 
special relationships that do justify people receiving survivor 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I think the government has erred dreadfully in using 
the word conjugal rather than actually coming out and saying it 
for what it is.  If we do not want to use the term same sex 
relationship then dependent relationship could be defined 
elsewhere in the legislation, the word dependency.  The use of 
conjugal in this context may lead to problems with this 
legislation.  I hope the government will re-examine the way it 
has written these particular clauses. 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will certainly do my best to respect the time constraints.  I 
must first excoriate the government for again moving closure on 
an issue like this one.  This is the 51st time it has done this 
since it has been in power, exceeding the record of the previous 
Mulroney government.  It is something the Liberals railed against 
the Tories for in the past.  Now they are doing the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously the bill is hugely complex.  Not only does it chart 
new ground on the pension field, but in my judgment it charts new 
ground when it comes to issues of same sex benefits.  I think the 
government is doing this in a sneaky way.  If it wants to have a 
serious debate about it, it should bring it forward naked as it 
were in legislation so we can have a discussion and invite the 
public's involvement.  Instead it has made it part of a bill and 
hides behind the skirts of the courts whenever it can.  In doing 
that it abdicates its responsibility as a legislator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say one brief word on this point.  I mentioned to my 
friend from Wentworth—Burlington that according to the 
<I>Canadian Law Dictionary</I> conjugal rights are the rights of 
married persons which include the intimacies of domestic 
relations.  <I>The Concise Oxford Dictionary</I> states that 
conjugate means to unite sexually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question in this legislation is how are they to determine 
whether people are uniting sexually.  Will they have sex 
inspectors going into the bedrooms of the nation, something the 
leader of the party across the way promised we should never do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a good question and I do not see anybody on the government 
side answering it.  They have talked all around it.  The member 
for Mississauga West blew a lot of smoke when he was up but never 
did get to the point on that issue.  The government has some 
answering to do on this issue and I appreciate the member for 
Wentworth—Burlington having the courage to take this on head-on. 
We appreciate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many issues here.  The issue I want to talk to first 
and foremost is the fact that the government is breaching a 
principle. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1755"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it struck a deal with the Canadian public on the Canada 
pension plan many years ago, it promised that we would never see 
premiums rise above 5%.  They are now at almost 10% and almost 
certainly going to go beyond that at some point in the future. 
That was a promise it made and ultimately broke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw the same thing happen with Employment Insurance.  We saw 
a fund being set up ostensibly to provide benefits to the 
employees who subscribe to that plan.  They pay in all kinds of 
contributions and expect that they will get the contributions 
back.  If they do not and a surplus is run up, they will get the 
surplus back.  What does this government do?  It raids that $26 
billion fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see that same theme happening yet again with this bill, the 
public service pension fund.  A $30 billion surplus has 
accumulated and it says “The means justify the end.  We will go 
ahead and strip this fund of that surplus because in our judgment 
we can use it for something better than what that money would go 
toward if it were left in there”.  I think that is 
reprehensible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there no pool of money that is beyond the reach of the 
government?  Should we not establish a principle that there are 
some pools of money, especially ones that are jointly funded with 
the public, that the government cannot get its grubby hands on 
and that belong to the people who kicked it in, in the first 
place?  Should that not be some kind of a principle, or does the 
government feel that it can have access to every cent the public 
has ever put into a plan?  What is next?  Will it be RRSPs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am alarmed that the government would do this and then cut off 
debate by moving closure for the 51st time and basically ensuring 
that the NDP, the Reform Party and the rest of us who strongly 
oppose this and other people who have strong interests in it do 
not have a voice on this issue.  The government should be ashamed 
of this, but we see it over and over again.  I guess I cannot 
appeal to its pride on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has simply taken the point of view that it does not care what 
the public thinks any more.  It is going to push ahead with this 
and do what it will.  It should be absolutely ashamed.  People on 
this side of the House want to see an honest and open debate. 
Sadly we will not get it from that gang over there. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to enter into debate on Bill C-78.  I want to reiterate 
some of the things I said earlier during questions and comments 
concerning the nature of the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I discussed the aspect that this is a defined benefits plan. 
That is very specific because what it says is that it is based on 
certain things.  For instance, the last six years of employment 
earnings is how they go about calculating the pension one will 
receive in retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly it has nothing to do with the money sitting in the 
plan.  One could actually even have a plan of this nature which 
has no money in it whatsoever, as long as the employer was of 
sufficient calibre to make the payments.  The reason there is a 
notional plan is that it involves the actual contributions by the 
employees and the employer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Various legislative bodies from time to time say that should be 
invested.  The whole concept of investing it occurs within the 
private sector because we are not so sure the employer will be 
there to make the final payments.  Most of us agree that it has 
occurred by way of convention that most people believe the 
government will somehow continue to be here and somehow continue 
to honour their pensions.  The reason there is a surplus is that 
there has been some kind of actuarial decree which is some kind 
of inexactitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out another very basic aspect of this 
plan.  Most private plans require contribution ratios of the 
employees of at least 40%.  This plan has had a contribution 
ratio from the employee of only 30%.  The employer, the 
government, has actually paid 70%.  Most people would conclude 
that this has been a very generous plan.

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier today I heard the minister say that civil service 
employees are good workers, that we honour that and we are happy 
to give them a very generous plan.  However, our generosity has 
to stop when we start talking about this notional surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How would members opposite deal with the surplus?  Would they 
physically give money or enhance the benefit packages of the 
beneficiaries?  That would be breaking the original terms of the 
agreement.  That would be saying that we are going to pay even 
better benefit levels than those which were originally agreed to, 
as generous as they were.  Or would they reduce the premiums, 
even though the premiums are some of the lowest of all the 
pension plans in the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, because it is based on 7.5% of earnings, less the amount 
of Canada pension plan contributions, members' contributions to 
the plan have been decreasing, whereas everybody else in the 
country has been paying higher premiums into their pension plans, 
realizing that to have an enhanced pension plan it has to be paid 
for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no justification for the argument that somehow the 
money belongs to people other than the people who originally put 
in the money, who are the taxpayers of the country.  I am very 
surprised by the attitude of Reform members.  They say that we 
have to reduce deficits and then suddenly they say “Leave the 
money in the plan”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is no plan and there is no physical money in the 
plan.  The plan is financed from the general revenues of the 
Government of Canada.  They are saying “Take money out of the 
tax revenues this year and give it away to these people”. Reform 
members are saying that the taxpayers should somehow shell out 
more money for a plan that has been very well put together, at 
great benefit to the employees of the civil service, who are 
already receiving the benefits they were guaranteed under the 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this called progress?  Is this called integrity or 
accountability?  It is ridiculous.  I am surprised.  I hope we do 
cut off debate because the debate which is coming from that side 
of the House is not very meaningful. 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have been waiting most of the day to speak.  I 
think the real question is, can Canadians trust the Liberal 
government?  If Canadians could trust the government they would 
probably say that the promise to take the $30 billion and pay 
down the debt is a good thing.  However, considering the numerous 
promises that have been broken since the Liberals came to power 
in 1993, can we really trust them?  We in the official opposition 
certainly cannot.  The Liberals have given us an overwhelming 
amount of reasons to mistrust them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the dreaded fear that when Liberals get their hands on 
money like $30 billion they simply will not do what they say they 
are going to do.  As my colleague from Medicine Hat pointed out, 
the Liberals said they were going to scrap the GST during the 
1993 campaign.  They went house to house, doorstep to doorstep, 
telling potential voters that if they were elected they would 
scrap, kill, abolish the GST.  This is 1999 and the GST is still 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the member for Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam is 
still paying GST.  When he goes downtown to buy a can of Lysol he 
still pays GST on it.  We are getting a little closer to the 
truth now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members are telling us once again “Trust us.  We 
are going to appoint this board and, by the way, in case 
Canadians do not know, this board will not be subject to the 
scrutiny of the auditor general, the chief watchdog of crown 
money”. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1805"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This board will not be accountable to the auditor general.  This 
is the same thing we argued when we protested the propriety of 
the board which oversees the multibillion EI fund.  The 
government staunchly refused to allow that board to be 
accountable to the auditor general.  It is doing it again with 
the public service employee pension fund.  One can only look at 
the Liberal record and say “Can we trust them once again?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing that really bothers us is that once again the 
government has cut off debate.  This is something which the 
Liberals, when in opposition, railed against.  Former Prime 
Minister Brian Mulroney, whom we are all thankful is gone, and 
the dreaded Tory government brought in closure time after time. 
Liberal members said that was the most disgusting thing a 
government could do.  What have they done?  They have beaten the 
record of the Tories.  They have gone way past the Tory record. 
We are up to the 53rd or 54th time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, they paid down the debt.  However, they have raised taxes 
by some $40 billion since 1993.  These are tax increases, not 
simply the increase in revenue that the minister talks about 
because the economy is paying that.  They raised taxes in 39 or 
40 different areas to the tune of about $40 billion.  They beat 
the deficit on the backs of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the member for Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam talks 
about it.  The residents of that town tell me they are very happy 
he is in Ottawa and not still the mayor.  That was his best 
campaign promise:  “If you elect me in the federal election I 
will leave town and go to Ottawa”.  Boy, did he pull in the 
votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to close by reaffirming that this is all about trust. 
Who can trust the Liberals?  The record speaks for itself.  They 
have broken many promises and we should not give them the 
opportunity again. 
<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate having an opportunity to say a few words.  I have been 
listening to the debate all day, however, I have yet to hear how 
the $30 billion surplus accumulated.  There has been some 
acknowledgement that the employer and the employees have paid 
into it, but so far very little has been said about the interest 
that is earned on the investment, and there is a significant 
amount of money earned in that manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was debated back in 1992 under Bill C-55, and I am not 
speaking about the split-run magazine bill.  The current minister 
responsible for the Treasury Board makes a great fetish of how 
this is taxpayers' money and it must go back to them.  However, 
if we look over the last 40 odd years, in 1955-56 the employer 
contributed 33.9% to pensions while the interest earned at that 
point was 36.8%.  It peaked in 1975-76 when the employer 
contributed 37.4%, although the interest earned was up to 49.4%. 
By 1993-94 the employers' contribution was only 14% and 75.1% of 
the money came from interest earned.  All of this has been 
documented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous auditor general criticized the plan and noted, for 
example, that in 1991 there was a pension holiday.  The 
government did not contribute any money in that year, a saving of 
some $760 million dollars. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1810"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Treasury Board projections to the parliamentary committee that 
looked at it at that time forecast a reduction in employer 
contributions of $5 billion over 10 years, or $500 million a 
year.  Once upon a time the Liberals even saw through this 
perspective.  Not any more of course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Treasury Board study of 1986 concluded that the Public 
Sector Superannuation Act would likely earn an additional 2% 
interest if the government had stopped borrowing money while 
determining unilaterally what tiny bit, if any, interest it would 
repay to the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who has been affected is another question.  It has been 
documented that the 20 year average for people at the low end of 
the wage scale, especially women, employees who endured wage 
freezes and did not receive pay equity, is about $9,600 per year 
in pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no wonder that the Professional Institute of the Public 
Service says that people are amazingly upset at what the 
government is about to do with this $30 billion surplus.  The 
president says it does not seem to matter how much we discuss 
anything, because if the government does not get its way it just 
writes legislation and imposes its will on us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992, here is what the Liberals proposed on Bill C-55.  They 
proposed binding arbitration to resolve disputes, including 
disputes around the disposition of pension plan surpluses. They 
also proposed that there be minimum employer contributions of 10% 
to the Public Sector Superannuation Act, 12% to the Canadian 
Forces Act and 14% to the RCMP Act.  All three plans would be 
subject to the Pension Benefits Standards Act with right of 
access to data estimates and projections by all interested 
parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened between 1992 and 1999 is the complete 
reversal?  Obviously in 1992 the Liberals were on this side of 
the House and in 1999 they are on the government side of the 
House.  It reminds one of the old Irish proverb which I have used 
before:  You can vote for whichever party you like but the 
government always gets elected.  It is certainly true and nowhere 
more true than in this country where for 132 years Canadians have 
switched back and forth between Liberals and Conservatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In opposition we hear nothing but promises, promises, promises: 
promises on pension reform, electoral reform; tax reform, health 
reform, and reform of committees to give MPs more power and 
influence.  Once they get on that side of the House how quickly 
they forget.  They even promised parliamentary reform when they 
sat on this side of the House.  What do we get today?  We get a 
few hours to debate a very important piece of legislation, a 
document of more than an inch thick.  It is a total sham. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case it is even more odious because hundreds of 
thousands of retirees probably do not even know what this latest 
smash and grab is by the government.  It reminds all of us of the 
former prime minister's admonition that the boys are cutting up 
the cash in the back room. 
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as far 
as the pension account is concerned, all those affected will get 
their pension money regardless.  In fact they will get their 
promised benefits for the law requires the government to make 
sure that there is always enough money in those accounts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the editorial in the Toronto <I>Star</I> today 
entitled “Whose Pension Surplus”, the government has always, 
even in times of deficit, covered this particular plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fearmongering we hear on the other side has absolutely no 
basis in fact.  The government has done exactly what it has done 
in the past, that is keeping up with its responsibility of 
assuming all of the financial risk of the public service pension 
plan.  We will do that again if and when the need arises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members on the opposite side would prefer that deficits be 
allowed simply to lie where the accounts, unattended, increase to 
no end and to no purpose.  We are asking for a purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform Party members in the past supported the government 
position.  Talk about changing positions.  They flip flop as if 
they are acrobatics on the other side. 
Canadian taxpayers feel secure in knowing that it is covered.  We 
are clearly showing prudence and doing the right thing.  Every 
member will in fact be protected by the actions of the 
government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
recently I had an opportunity to pose a question to the Minister 
of Health with regard to the subject matter of breast milk 
substitutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raised it because it had come to my attention through some 
research I was doing on early childhood development issues that 
Canada supported a WHO position with regard to breast milk 
substitutes.  It included such things as no samples to be 
provided in hospitals, no pictures of babies to be on the 
labelling, no advertising, and a number of other positions which 
basically said that breast milk substitutes were not to be 
represented as a viable or as an important alternative for infant 
nutrition. The majority of hospitals do not follow those rules. 
They provide substantial samples, et cetera of breast milk 
substitutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In doing some of this work, I wanted to share with the House a 
little bit of information with regard to the importance of breast 
feeding.  The research highlighted the significant benefits of 
breast feeding.  It even found a lower incidence of matters such 
as sudden infant death syndrome, accidental deaths and sicknesses 
causing deaths.  The exposure to a broader range of environmental 
risks, travel risks, et cetera were all associated with 
circumstances where breast feeding did not take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The research is very clear.  The health benefits of breast 
feeding cannot be overstated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998 the Canadian Paediatric Society announced its unanimous 
endorsement with the World Health Organization's new recommended 
guidelines that mothers should breast feed for at least one year 
for optimal health outcomes of their children.  The president of 
the Canadian Paediatric Society also announced that it would not 
be party to any contraventions of the WHO code and that it would 
not be involved in the distribution or promotion of breast milk 
substitutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Research on breast feeding clearly confirms its importance for 
optimal infant health.  It also enhances the bond between the 
mother and the child which is a significant factor affecting 
healthy outcomes.  In addition, and I found this very 
interesting, a family can save up to $4,000 in the first year on 
the cost of baby formula which significantly affects the 
economics of a decision to provide direct parental care. Dr. 
Fraser Mustard said: “Breast feeding can provide a perfect 
nutritional and emotional nurturing to endow an infant with the 
important capacity needed for a full and productive life”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that as background, I want to again pose the question to 
the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health with regard 
to Canada's position on the WHO recommended guidelines on breast 
milk substitutes.  It seems to me that endorsing those without 
enforcing them has a contradiction, particularly when it means so 
much to the healthy outcomes of our children.  I ask the 
parliamentary secretary for her comments.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to acknowledge the 
member's interest in promoting infant breast-feeding as the most 
optimal form of feeding of infants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the World Health Assembly in May 1981, Canada and 117 other 
countries strongly endorsed a code of marketing of breast milk 
substitution.  Canada has implemented the code through 
collaboration, education and health promotion.  Health Canada 
continues to support this position and has consistently promoted 
breast-feeding as the optimal form of infant nutrition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The promotion of breast-feeding is an integral part of several 
Health Canada programs.  These include the postpartum parent 
support program, a video entitled “Welcome to Parenting”, the 
“Breastfeeding Promotional Kit”, “Breastfeeding—A Selected 
Bibliography and Resource Guide” and two widely distributed 
breast-feeding pamphlets “10 Great Reasons to Breastfeed” and 
“10 Valuable Tips for Successful Breastfeeding”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The National Breastfeeding Guidelines for Health Care 
Providers, 1996, developed by the Canadian Institute for 
Child Health, has been distributed by Health Canada to each 
postpartum parental support group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international code of marketing of breast milk substitutes 
has markedly influenced actions to promote breast-feeding in 
Canada and the results have been positive.  When given accurate 
and reliable information, mothers and health professionals make 
the correct choices to support appropriate infant nutrition 
through breast-feeding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an ongoing effort by Health Canada.  It is one that we 
are working co-operatively with all of our partners.  We believe 
that the actions we have taken are resulting in the best approach 
for achieving widespread breast-feeding for infants in Canada.  I 
applaud the member's efforts in raising this issue.  We will 
continue to support these actions.

have been adopted. Accordingly this House stands adjourned
