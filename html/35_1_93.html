	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a motion I would like to put with unanimous consent.
<P>
	It deals with the 28th report of the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs. It was concurred in yesterday by 
the House with consent. Apparently it has caused some 
difficulty in the committee's branch to have this report take 
effect as of today. It would prefer to defer the implementation of 
the report, which deals with the allocation of rooms for 
committees, until October 3.
<P>
	Accordingly, I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the committee room assignment system contained in the 28th report of 
the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs and adopted by the 
House of Commons on September 19, 1994 come into effect on Monday, 
October 3, 1994.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I think there would be unanimous consent for that motion.

	Motion agreed to.

	<B>Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have the 
honour to table a petition containing approximately 75 
signatures which was forwarded to me by a constituent in my 
riding of Cambridge.
<P>
	The petitioners pray and request that Parliament not amend 
the human rights code, the Canadian Human Rights Act or the 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms in any way which would tend to 
indicate community approval of same sex relationships or 
homosexuality.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions from 
constituents of mine in the two districts of Burstall and Maple 
Creek. The petitions are very similar in content so I will read 
only one of them.
<P>
	Whereas the Criminal Code of Canada, section 241, states 
that anyone who counsels a person to commit suicide or aids or 
abets a person to commit suicide is guilty of an indictable 
offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 
years; whereas the Supreme Court of Canada recently upheld 
section 241 of the Criminal Code of Canada in the Rodriguez 
decision, recognizing that section 241 was enacted to protect all 
individuals, including the disabled, the terminally ill, the 
depressed, the chronically ill and the elderly; and whereas if 
section 241 were to be struck down or amended such protection 
would no longer exist, we, your humble petitioners, therefore 
pray that Parliament not repeal or amend section 241 of the 
Criminal Code in any way and uphold the Supreme Court of 
Canada decision of September 30, 1993 to disallow assisted 
suicide or euthanasia.
<P>
	I concur with these petitioners.
<P>
<B>(1005 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
accordance with Standing Order 36 I would like to present four 
petitions from various districts of my constituency. All are of 
similar content.
<P>
	The petitioners request that Parliament not amend the human 
rights code, the Canadian Human Rights Act or the Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms in any way which would tend to indicate 
societal approval of same sex relationships or of homosexuality, 
including amending the human rights code to include in the 
prohibitive grounds of discrimination the undefined phrase 
sexual orientation.
<P>
	I concur and support these petitioners and would like to 
present these petitions.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="WITNESSPROTECTION">WITNESS PROTECTION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
three petitions this morning.
<P>
	The first petition contains 1,018 signatures from across the 
country concerning the subject of witness protection. This 
simply adds to the total of thousands upon thousands of 
signatures that I have presented in this and the last Parliaments 
dealing with the subject of witness protection and calling on the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5854"> 5854 </A></B>
<P>
Parliament of Canada to enact a witness protection and 
informant law.
<P>
	I draw to the attention of the House that my bill on this subject 
will be coming up for a final hour of debate and vote on 
September 26.

second petition is signed by people from Scarborough, Ontario 
and points close thereto concerning the Young Offenders Act 
calling on Parliament to provide heavier penalties for those 
convicted of violent crime.
<P>
	I remind them that we are currently debating a bill in the 
House on this subject.

	<B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough West):</B> Finally, Mr. 
Speaker, I have a petition signed mainly by people living in the 
city of Etobicoke in the municipality of metropolitan Toronto.
<P>
	The petitioners call on Parliament not to amend the Canadian 
Human Rights Act or the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in any 
way which would tend to indicate societal approval of same sex 
relationships and to ensure that no amendments are passed using 
the undefined phrase sexual orientation. I completely concur.

	<B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to place before the House a petition signed by over 1,000 
people from St. Catharines and surrounding area.
<P>
	The petitioners state that they abhor crimes of violence 
against persons. We believe that killer trading cards offer 
nothing positive for children or adults to admire or emulate but 
rather contribute to violence.
<P>
	The petitioners ask Parliament to amend the laws of Canada to 
prohibit the importation, distribution, sale and manufacture of 
killer cards in law and to advise producers of killer cards that 
their product, if destined for Canada, will be seized and 
destroyed.
<P>
	I have spoken in the House before about the harm to society of 
serial killer cards. I would like to reiterate my support for this 
petition.

Grande-Anse over the short, medium and long term?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> The port of 
Saguenay has sought approval to develop a new forest products 
terminal at Grande-Anse. It proposes that on the basis of its own 
traffic forecasts, current facilities will soon be at capacity and a 
new facility is required.
<P>
	Port Saguenay is administrated by the Canada Ports 
Corporation, a commercial crown corporation. Infrastructure 
developments undertaken by the corporation must be 
commercially viable.
<P>
	The proposal to expand the Grande-Anse terminal was only 
put forward on the basis of $23.5 million in grant funding being

<BLOCKQUOTE>What effect do the new unemployment insurance measures contained in the 
Budget have on the accounts kept for the Unemployment Insurance Account, 
and what impact will they have on balancing the books for the Account?</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons):</B> The answer is as 
follows: The changes to the Unemployment Insurance Program 
announced in the February 24, 1994 budget will reduce benefit 
expenditures by $500 million in 1994, $2.1 billion in 1995 and 
$2.4 billion in 1996. These are calendar years. The planned 
annual surplus for 1994 in the Unemployment Insurance 
Account is $240 million, which should bring the accumulated 
deficit down to $5.6 billion, by December 31, 1994.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
	Premiums rates will be rolled back to their 1993 level in 1995

	<B>The Speaker:</B> I have received an application pursuant to

<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise under the 
provisions of Standing Order 52 to ask that the House now 
adjourn to examine what can only be considered to be a crisis on 
the west coast of Canada.
<P>
	The disappearance of 1.3 million salmon from the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans management surveys ought 
to give rise to an immediate examination of our policies on the 
west coast. This crisis is now attached to the commercial 
fishery, to the aboriginal fishery and to the sports fishery in the 
salmon sector, to say nothing of other species as well.
<P>
	Considering what has occurred on the east coast as a result of 
years of ignoring the reality of what was happening to the 
resource, a similar situation may exist on the west coast. One 
point three million salmon have disappeared and no one knows 
what has happened to them. This ought to result in a special 
debate in the House of Commons. It is a non-partisan issue, a 
non-political issue, but one that I know all political parties here, 
as well as others, would feel very strongly about.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>June 21, 1994-The Solicitor General of Canada-Second reading and 
reference to the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs of Bill C-45, 
an act to amend the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, the Criminal 
Code, the Criminal Records Act, the Prisons and Reformatories Act and the 
Transfer of Offenders Act.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-45, an act to amend the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, 
the Criminal Code, the Criminal Records Act, the Prison and Reformatories Act 
and the Transfer of Offenders Act, be referred forthwith to the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to open debate on this 
motion to refer Bill C-45 to the justice and legal affairs 
committee before second reading.
<P>
	This approach makes it easier for the committee and the 
government to consider changes to the bill in light of the 
proceedings of the committee. I am pleased to present this bill 
under the new House rules, which I sponsored as House leader 
last February and which were adopted unanimously by all 
parties.
<P>
	Again I express my appreciation for the approach to these rule 
changes on the part of the various parties in the House. As I said 
at that time, the government was implementing a number of 
commitments that we made during the election campaign in the 
red book, and subsequently in the throne speech, aimed at 
revitalizing the House of Commons. In particular, we wanted to 
give members the opportunity to be more actively involved in 
the development of legislation.
<P>
	Changing the rules of the House does not on its own bring 
about this revitalization. It is the extent to which the new 
procedures are used that makes the difference. It is up to 
members on all sides of the House to make the changes work. 
Therefore I am pleased to help bring these changes into effect in 
a meaningful way by proceeding with Bill C-45 under the new 
framework.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	Turning to the bill, I believe it is important because it 
addresses significant issues of public protection in the area of 
corrections and parole. These are issues on which this 
government promised action in that same red book as part of its 
agenda to bring about safe homes and safe streets for Canadians. 
With this bill we are delivering on these promises.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, this government is sensitive to the public's 
concerns about criminal justice. Canadians are particularly 
concerned about violent crimes and sex offences, especially 
when the victims are children. With this bill, we will be able to 
tackle these problems.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Time is limited as each of us has only 10 minutes to speak in 
this debate. I want to highlight a few of the important provisions 
of the bill. I will discuss others in more detail when we go to 
committee.
<P>
	This bill will change the test for the detention to the end of 
sentence for those offenders who commit sexual offences 
against children. At present, the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act permits the National Parole Board to detain sex 
offenders and certain other high risk offenders until the end of 
their sentence if they cause serious harm and are likely to 
commit an offence causing death or serious harm if released.
<P>
	In the case of child victims, serious harm caused by an 
offender may not be evident for a number of years. The victim 
may be too young to adequately communicate the impact of the 
offence. Therefore it is difficult for the parole board to make a 
determination that serious harm was caused to a child so that the 
offender should be detained until the end of sentence.
<P>
	The amendments in the bill would make it easier for the parole 
board to detain in penitentiary until the end of their sentence sex 
offenders who victimize children by removing the requirement 
that serious harm must be established as the criterion for 
detention. This would give the board authority to detain such a 
sex offender if a further sex offence against the child is likely.
<P>
	I should point out the measures in this bill are needed not 
because we say that sex offences against children are considered 
more serious than those against adult victims, but because the 
current legislation has proven less effective in cases involving 
children.
<P>
	We will also be making other improvements in the availability 
of treatment for sex offenders in the community and in prison.
<P>
	Another area of concern to the Canadian public is the 
credibility and accountability of the National Parole Board. Our 
priority is the protection of the public. One way of achieving this 
is through a responsible and well managed conditional release 
process.
<P>
	In most cases gradual transition from custody to the 
community under supervision and control and with support and 
assistance is the safest way to release offenders. It enables 
parole authorities to gauge an offender's ability to maintain a 
law-abiding life and to return him or her to custody should the 
level of risk appear to be increasing. Successful adjustment by 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5857"> 5857 </A></B>
<P>
offender during the conditional release period provides the best 
chance for his or her continuing law-abiding behaviour and as a 
result for long term public safety.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the adequacy of the people designated by the 
National Parole Board is critical if judicious decisions are to be 
made. We undertook to have commissioners selected on the 
basis of merit and qualification. I would say that the latest 
appointments made by this government, particularly in the case 
of the president of the board, did meet these high standards.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In addition, board member training has been strengthened 
especially around the difficult process of risk assessment. This 
will become an ongoing process. A code of conduct has also 
been finalized. The bill before us will strengthen the 
accountability of the board by establishing a disciplinary review 
scheme for board members.
<P>
	Let me turn to another matter which has rightly been the cause 
of strong expressions of concern. I am talking about the way our 
present law requires the calculation of sentences of offenders 
serving multiple terms. Because of the formula set out in the 
present law, it can happen that an offender on conditional release 
who receives a new sentence of imprisonment can remain 
eligible for release and even stay out of custody. Under Bill 
C-45 however, people reoffending while on parole will have to 
serve a substantial portion of any new sentence before even 
being considered for parole.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	Finally, dealing with the issue of post-sentence detention, 
which is not treated directly in this bill, I want to remind the 
House that we are working with a special federal-provincial 
task force on high risk violent offenders. It is studying 
legislative and policy changes that would improve public 
protection from high risk and violent offenders once their initial 
sentence has expired. The task force is expected to release its 
report at the end of this year. In the light of this report, I and my 
colleague, the Minister of Justice, will move to develop 
practical, workable responses and measures to deal with the 
issue of post-sentence detention.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In closing, I would add that this bill and related initiatives 
make for a balanced response to the legitimate concerns of 
Canadians and their request for reform. A stronger system will 
thus improve public protection.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This bill is part of a strategic framework of initiatives that 
work together in order to carry out our red book agenda and 
demonstrates our commitment to safe homes and safe streets for 
all Canadians.
<P>
	I look forward to the committee review process and anticipate 
productive discussion of amendments which will reinforce the 
intent of the legislation. The end result I am sure will be the 
improved safety of the public. Therefore, I conclude by formally 
moving:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, pursuant to Standing Order 73(1), Bill C-45 be forthwith referred to the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I now recognize the hon. member for 
Bellechasse for l0 minutes as he knows.
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives 
me pleasure to speak on Bill C-45, particularly with the new 
rules of procedure under which it is now possible to refer a bill 
to parliamentary committee before second reading. These rules, 
which we have unanimously ratified in this House, will permit 
broader debate, as the positions of the government and the 
opposition will not have hardened before debate at second 
reading.
<P>
	The various provisions in Bill C-45 are of great interest and 
address a concern of a large majority of Canadians and 
Quebecers, especially the release of criminals determined likely 
to commit a repeat offence immediately or at some time in the 
future. In this regard, the bill is on the right track.
<P>
	One might, however, question the manner proposed by the 
government for detaining likely repeat offenders. It is the 
National Parole Board which is given these powers under Bill 
C-45.
<P>
	We have a different approach. We would much prefer that the 
decision to detain potential repeat offenders be left to a court of 
law rather than to a quasi-judicial tribunal, appointments to 
which would often be open to criticism. I will come back to this 
in a few moments.
<P>
	We cannot have it both ways-either we choose the approach 
of mandatory sentencing, of sentence without parole handed 
down by the trial judge, or another possibility would be to leave 
this decision with the Parole Board, with the possibility of 
appeal to a court of common law, the right to review by another 
tribunal to which judges would be appointed according to 
generally accepted and well known criteria.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	Which brings me to the subject I touched on earlier, the Parole 
Board. The process to appoint Parole Board members should be 
much more open and we have an excellent opportunity to look at 
what other parliaments did, that is, hold confirmation hearings 
on the appointments this government wants to make. Before 
securing an order-in-council appointing someone to the Parole 
Board, the government should have to submit the names of the 
candidates either to the Standing Committee on Justice or to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5858"> 5858 </A></B>
<P>
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs and 
appointments should be subjected to confirmation hearings in 
such a way as to avoid media circuses like we saw in the U.S. 
during confirmation hearings for certain candidates to the  
position of Supreme Court judge. In my opinion, this 
confirmation process would enhance the work of 
parliamentarians and the role citizens want to see them play in 
this Parliament and in all parliaments in general.
<P>
	Until the appointment process for Parole Board members is 
reviewed, Canadians have a right to ask questions on how these 
people are appointed, on the decisions they make and on the 
validity of these decisions, as they prevail every time.
<P>
	Some of the provisions in Bill C-45 seem a little strange at 
first and perhaps should be reviewed by the parliamentary 
committee. First of all, clause 12 of the bill before us states that 
inmates are not entitled to a hearing when their case is being 
reviewed. Why deprive inmates of such a hearing? Is there a 
valid reason to do that? I think the burden of proof should rest 
with the government, with the minister introducing this bill, 
who should demonstrate that inmates should not have the right 
to be heard when their case is being reviewed, because there may 
be new evidence justifying a hearing. I think it would be much 
wiser to preserve the right to a hearing, even if it must be cut 
short if no new evidence is produced.
<P>
	Clause 25 of the bill stipulates that the head of the Parole 
Board may automatically allow a person to serve the rest of their 
sentence. The institutional head may do so automatically or at 
the inmate's request. If it is at the prisoner's request, we would 
have to see under what circumstances he could ask to serve his 
full prison sentence, if he does not consider himself fit to be 
released, but if the institutional head can act on his own 
authority, there would have to be a hearing before a judicial 
tribunal. I have trouble seeing a public official who is not a 
judge deciding issues of basic rights like an offender's release 
on his own say-so, without the possibility of having his decision 
reviewed by a judicial tribunal. I have some concerns about this 
provision.
<P>
	Clause 27 provides a new definition, a flagrant example of 
expansionist centralizing federalism. Clause 27 as it now stands 
defines the board as the National Parole Board. The new clause 
27 would define it as the National Parole Board and adds:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>and includes a provincial parole board where it exercises jurisdiction in 
respect of parole as provided by section 112-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	But if provincial parole boards are to be included, would it not 
be preferable to do so under clause 27 at the request of the 
lieutenant governor in council of a province? Why force the 
provincial parole boards to join? Since it is not the case now, 
why bring them in, unless it is at the province's request? That 
would show respect for provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	A rather disturbing provision is that those in detention for less 
than six months could not be paroled. Such prisoners are usually 
held for minor offences. Why would there not be a fast-track 
procedure in such cases so that a request for release from a 
person held for less than six months could be heard quickly, in 
summary fashion, especially given the overcrowding in prisons 
in Canada and Quebec. These matters should also be reviewed.
<P>
	Clause 56 would add to the Act. It provides for the 
appointment of a judge to review the conduct of members of the 
parole boards. It is all well and good to add clause 56, but 
subsection 7 says that the judge conducting an inquiry is not 
bound by any legal or technical rules of evidence and may 
receive and base a decision on evidence adduced in the 
proceedings and considered credible or trustworthy in the 
circumstances of the case. The judge could act on hearsay; he is 
not bound by any rule of evidence.
<P>
	I think that the judge named to investigate the actions of a 
member of the Parole Board should do so in accordance with the 
rules of evidence in Canada and the other legal provisions that 
ensure the supremacy of the rule of law. I find a provision like 
56.7, which sets no rule of evidence for an investigator to 
follow, to be unacceptable.
<P>
	Finally, section 155.1 as it now stands allows the minister to 
act as soon as the judge's report is filed; if it is unfavorable to the 
person under investigation, the minister can revoke that 
person's mandate. I think that an appeal procedure should be 
allowed at this point.
<P>
	That is, the minister should not decide immediately once the 
judge's report is filed with him; rather, the judge's report should 
be filed with the Federal Court and any interested party should 
have a certain period, say 30 days, to appeal to the Appeal 
Division of the Federal Court so that the issue can be discussed 
in a judicial forum, in the absence of specific rules of law that 
are not mentioned in the Act.
<P>
	These are the brief preliminary remarks that I had to make; in 
committee, we will no doubt be able to improve what is 
proposed in Bill C-45, which on the whole meets our concerns.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to talk to the particular aspect of Bill C-45 which is 
going to committee.
<P>
	Several items in the bill are actually good points that we could 
support. However the proposals are yet another example of the 
Liberal government wanting to do something to convince 
Canadians that it is really getting tough on law and order. In 
many cases it is much to do about nothing. This is the story of 
our lives in Canadian government in 1994-95, is it not?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5859"> 5859 </A></B>
<P>
	We support some of the points. We obviously support the 
measures to counter child sexual abuse. Full term sentence 
before release is and has been a Reform position since time 
immemorial, since the party was started. We obviously support 
it and agree the government should pursue it in Bill C-45.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	We also support empowering any law enforcement officer to 
detain and return an offender violating parole requirements. 
That is a good step. The government is to be complimented on 
that. It is not often I stand in the House to compliment the 
Liberal government on something it does.
<P>
	The other item I wish to compliment it on is expanding 
offences wherein an offender must serve full term sentences to 
include serious drinking and driving offences, criminal 
negligence causing bodily harm or death, criminal harassment 
or stalking, and conspiracy to commit serious drug offences. 
That is also a positive move in the right direction.
<P>
	Let us get down to some of the concerns that are obviously 
omitted. This is where we get into the flaccid approach. I always 
said the dictionary term for flaccid means limp wristed and so 
on. I like to think of flaccid meaning the federal Liberals are 
crafty Conservatives in disguise. I will explain that at the end of 
my 10 minutes.
<P>
	The legislation does not insist child sex offenders must 
receive treatment during or after their incarceration. How could 
that be missed? The country must stress that no serious child sex 
offender should be allowed to enter society whether or not full 
sentence completion exists, without assurances that future child 
sexual abuse by the offender will not occur. They should think 
about that when they are sitting on the committee. It is 
something that is very important to Canadian citizens. If they 
look at the area I come from in the lower mainland of British 
Columbia they will see this is a serious problem.
<P>
	Mandatory treatment must take place. Currently if an 
offender refuses treatment no treatment is forced upon the 
offender. If an offender refuses treatment during incarceration 
some means must be at the disposal of correctional services that 
force the individual to take treatment. The offender should not 
be allowed to re-enter society until assurances are received that 
the offender will not reoffend.
<P>
	There are no provisions in the legislation to account for sexual 
offenders that stalk and with violence violate adult women. It is 
not only young sex offenders we are looking at. They had better 
get real serious about looking at all sex offenders.
<P>
	The proposed legislation does not force mandatory review of 
parole board decisions that go wrong. The legislation states the 
chair of the parole board may recommend such a hearing take 
place. This is really preposterous considering some of the 
boondoggles parole boards have been undertaking. We know 
that in many cases they are patronage appointments. Liberal 
Party  hacks came into the jobs. Perhaps their qualifications and 
abilities do not quite match the job they are used to.
<P>
	However let me give a little indication about a fellow by the 
name of Wayne Perkin in my area who was supposed to do six 
years for taping up a young lady's arms, beating her over the 
head with a hammer and sexually assaulting her. He served 
about 14 or 16 months and the parole board let him out. After 
that he bludgeoned to death Angela Richards in Langley, and the 
story goes on.
<P>
	When I went to the sentencing in this particular case I thought 
how ironic it was the parole board was not even represented 
there to listen to the damage that was done after it let this person 
out. I really think accountability of the parole board has to come 
into play. It is not in the legislation and I suppose those folks 
over there will let it go by. The committee should really look at 
the matter. I know that Reform members of Parliament will be 
talking to it extensively at committee level.
<P>
	The chair of the parole board has a vested interest to keep 
foul-ups by board members as quiet as possible unless media 
make a big fuss about board foul-ups that forces the chair to ask 
for an inquiry. Why would the chair of a board actually critique 
what happened in the bad mistakes made by a board? It would do 
our country well to have some of the Liberal MPs involved in 
assessment at committee level of Bill C-45 go to a parole board 
hearing. They might have their eyes opened.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	The proposed legislation still leaves board members as 
investigators and decisive people in parole. Nowhere does the 
legislation insist frontline workers like case workers, prison 
guards and those types of people, make direct representation at 
hearings. The frontline people know the serious offenders very 
well. Their input would offer board members details that 
otherwise may escape their investigations. Let us think about 
that. The onus is on a parole board to assess whether or not an 
individual should be eligible to get back on the street. What it 
really needs is the maximum amount of input it can get, not the 
minimum amount.
<P>
	The legislation makes a half hearted attempt at correcting a 
problem with short shrift eligibility for parole violators. Instead 
of saying parole violators must serve one-third of a new 
sentence the legislation should state that if an offender commits 
another crime while on parole the offender should be forced to 
fill the entire remaining period of the old sentence, face a 
minimum sentence for committing a crime while on parole, and 
face full term for the offence committed while on parole.
<P>
	It is rather ironic to talk about the next item since I raised it in 
the House in the last session. It is nice the government wants 
criminals to contribute toward their room and board. What about 
the victim? If the criminals have any income that income must 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5860"> 5860 </A></B>
<P>
be directed toward restitution to the victim prior to or as well as 
the cost of their upkeep. Once again the victim is forgotten.
<P>
	We disclosed in the House in last session that the 
government's benevolent attitude is allowing criminals in our 
system to get old age security, income supplement, GST rebates 
and CPP. What I heard from the Solicitor General was that it 
really did not work and they would make a change. Then I saw in 
the change they would have to pay 30 per cent of it, which is 
ridiculous.
<P>
	They should not get one cent of old age security, the people I 
checked up on. There was one person in for a double murder who 
was getting old age security. The government should tell me the 
logic of that. Why should that money not go toward the victim? 
Why should all that money not go toward board and upkeep? For 
the government to suggest that it is going to take another tough 
measure, that it is going to take 30 per cent, is ridiculous.
<P>
	The Liberal government will have to smarten up one of these 
days and look at what is right in the country. It should not be too 
shy about being tough.
<P>
	Currently our investigations have discovered that there are far 
more sexual offenders needing treatment than there are 
treatment facilities. We have been told of 1,800 serious sex 
offenders currently incarcerated. There are only 200 slots for 
treatment at any one time. The legislation only promotes 
treatment for sex offenders abusing children. What about 
offenders who assault teenage or adult women? Once again the 
victim is forgotten. Where is the treatment for victims of 
assault? Have you not remembered the victims? It should keep 
that in mind.
<P>
	How will the government pay for increased treatment? We 
must push for treatment for all violent or sexual offenders. At 
the same time where will the money come from? I know they are 
not overly concerned about where the money comes from in 
Canada today, but they should try to think about it in Bill C-45.
<P>
	I have a final point. This was a fine opportunity for Liberals 
concerned about guns to include full sentences served for 
offences where any gun is used. Why did you not do this? Why is 
it not in here? Where is it going to be?
<P>
	Once again I do not think the courage exists on the other side 
to deal with the tougher issues about taking away money that the 
criminal element should not have in our prisons, about dealing 
with gun laws, about dealing with violent sex offenders from an 
adult point of view, and about dealing with the victim.
<P>
<B>(1045 ) </B>
<P>
	I hope that in Bill C-45 they look at these issues in committee.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> We have just come back and I again 
would ask members to please direct their remarks through the 
Chair. The theory is that it will reduce the conflict between 
members if remarks go through the Chair rather than back and 
forth across the Chamber.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Arseneault:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I will not 
take much of the time of the House.
<P>
	Today is sort of an historic day in the sense that it is the first 
time I believe that Standing Order 73(1) has been invoked. I 
would like to point out to the House that on May 11, 1994 I stood 
here on a point of order. At that time I was introducing a private 
member's bill and I pointed out to the Speaker that I would like 
to invoke Standing Order 73(1) for my bill. I pointed out some of 
the problems as the standing order presented itself where a 
minister of the crown could send any public bill to committee 
before second reading and this would include a private 
member's bill sponsored by a private member.
<P>
	In reply the Speaker took it under consideration and made a 
ruling on June 1 at which time he suggested the redrafting of 
Standing Order 73 to grant the sponsor of a private member's 
bill the same prerogatives with regard to that bill that a minister 
of the crown enjoys with regard to a government bill seems to 
merit further consideration. He referred that issue to the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs and asked 
it to take that into consideration.
<P>
	I realize the standing committee has been very active and very 
busy on a number of subjects. I would ask on my point today, Mr. 
Speaker, that you again ask that committee, seeing that this 
standing order has been invoked for the first time and could be 
invoked again for other opportunities, since the matter is an 
urgent one, especially for private members, backbenchers, that 
we would like to have a ruling on that as soon as possible.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I thank the hon. member and I thank 
the member for giving notice of the point of order. He is 
absolutely right that the Speaker on June 1 did suggest that the 
committee look at the matter. As the member will know the 
Speaker does not have the power to direct, as I understand it, any 
committee to consider any matter.
<P>
	If I can characterize what the member has said, he is really 
asking the committee to deal with the matter as quickly as 
possible. I see the chairman of that committee nodding. I hope 
he will take under advisement what the hon. member has said.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have this opportunity to 
discuss the government's plans to solve the pressing problem of 
public protection as it relates to the correctional process.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5861"> 5861 </A></B>
<P>
	The amendments proposed in Bill C-45 will allow for a better 
control of those who generate the greatest fears, namely violent 
offenders. The changes proposed by the government will be 
supported by improved treatment programs for sexual 
offenders.
<P>
	These changes are an essential component which the 
government intends to use to deal with violent crimes and to 
improve the public's faith in correctional services as well as in 
the conditional release program.
<P>
	The Solicitor General pointed out that to pass harsher 
legislation to alleviate the public's concerns is not enough. 
Indeed, if we are to solve the social problems within our 
communities, we cannot merely increase the number of inmates 
in our jails.
<P>
	In recent months, the media have given a lot of coverage to the 
serious and increasing public concern regarding some issues 
related to the judicial process.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Almost every day there are story headlines, news broadcasts, 
telling us of the violence which is present in our communities. 
The television programs we watch also recount quite 
graphically at times details of violent crime, whether real or 
fictional. It is difficult to escape the feeling that violence 
pervades in our lives.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This is why most Canadians believe that crime is on the rise in 
their communities. It must be remembered that studies on 
victimization, not the media, best describe the current crime 
trends.
<P>
	These studies show that, in 1993, global rates remained stable 
or decreased compared to 1988 levels. Moreover, they show that 
the crime rate dropped by 5 per cent in 1993, the biggest 
decrease since we started keeping statistics on crime, over 30 
years ago.
<P>
	Statistics show a substantial decrease of some 15 per cent in 
the case of murders, for the second consecutive year. The figure 
for 1993 is 27 per cent lower than the all-time high of 1975. 
Nevertheless, Canadians are more and more concerned about 
crime and are asking the government to find solutions and put a 
stop to its presumed higher incidence.
<P>
	It must also be recognized that certain ways of dealing with 
crime and the fear that it generates can have results opposite to 
their objective. One only needs to look at the situation in the 
United States to realize that some strategies against crime can 
have unpredictable and serious consequences.
<P>
	Do you know that 13 states have abolished their parole 
system, essentially in an attempt to slow down the rise in crime? 
Yet, studies show that crime rates in these states have not 
decreased and are, in several cases, among the highest in the 
country. Canada is second to the United States as regards the 
incarceration rate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Correctional Services Canada has determined that if the 
current rate of admissions to penitentiaries continues there will 
be over 18,000 offenders in federal penitentiaries by the year 
2002. This would represent a 30 per cent increase in the next 
eight years. The cost of housing these offenders is not 
decreasing. On average it costs the Canadian taxpayer over 
$50,000 for each incarcerated offender.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	While the public is concerned about the consequences of 
criminal activities, we are increasingly recognizing that, for the 
most part, crime arises from social problems, like 
unemployment, poverty and illiteracy.
<P>
	As members of Parliament, we are responsible for protecting 
the public and, like all our fellow Canadians, we must look 
beyond the immediate repercussions of crime and take into 
consideration the underlying causes of criminal behaviour. That 
is why our government has implemented a national strategy on 
security and crime prevention in urban areas.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	One of the key elements of this national strategy is the 
creation by the Minister of Justice and the Solicitor General of a 
national crime prevention council this past July. The objectives 
of the council are to unify crime prevention efforts across the 
country and to give them focus and direction.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Despite the creation of this national crime prevention council, 
we have to realize that repression and crime prevention are not 
the exclusive responsibility of the criminal justice system. To 
come to grips with the many social and economic issues leading 
to crime requires a multidimensional and integrated approach. 
We must co-operate and work in partnership with every segment 
of our society, including parents, teachers, social services 
organizations and all levels of government.
<P>
	As the Solicitor General said earlier, in order to undertake an 
effective and in-depth reform aimed at protecting the public 
against crime, the federal and provincial governments must 
work together to find overall solutions.
<P>
	However, the federal government realizes that control of 
violent offenders is a complex problem for which it would be 
pointless to seek a universal remedy.
<P>
	As you know, governments share responsibility for criminal 
justice, but mental health is a provincial jurisdiction.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5862"> 5862 </A></B>

<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	Since searching for ways to deal with high risk offenders is 
not the exclusive responsibility of any one level of government, 
a federal-provincial task force on high risk violent offenders has 
also been set up.
<P>
	The task force is reviewing all policies and legislation that 
could help to treat, manage and monitor high-risk violent 
offenders.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In closing, let me emphasize that the legislative reforms of the 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act proposed in this bill 
are clearly measures that will contribute to the protection of the 
public; balanced measures augmented with comprehensive 
activities such as crime prevention through social development, 
through strengthening meaningful partnerships with other 
levels of government and through community involvement in 
order to ensure safer homes and safer streets for all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard St-Laurent (Manicouagan):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
going through Bill C-45 raises a great concern about sexual 
offenders and sentences that they are given. In these days, 
sexual offences make headlines in all the media everywhere in 
the country.
<P>
	Our duty, as elected people, is to legislate in such a way that 
the action we are taking will have positive results. Public safety 
is everyone's responsibility. But there is no point in passing 
legislation just to pretend we have done our job and this piece of 
legislation must be the least confusing possible. It is important 
that its enforcement be as easy as possible and, finally, this 
whole series of action must be efficient. Killers must not kill any 
more, thieves must not steal any more and rapists must not rape 
any more.
<P>
	I will deal mainly with clause 3 of the proposed bill. It says, 
and I quote: ``The Commissioner may in writing designate any 
staff member, either by name or by class, to be a peace officer, 
and a staff member so designated has all the powers, authority, 
protection and privileges that a peace officer has by law in 
respect of an offender subject to a warrant, and any person, 
while the person is in a penitentiary''. It is that point I have a 
problem with.
<P>
	I knew that the job of a correctional officer in a penitentiary 
was not well known, but I am very disappointed to see how badly 
it is known. In that clause of Bill C-45, it is clearly written that 
the commissioner may in writing designate, for instance, a night 
security officer from some warehouse to be a correctional 
officer in a penitentiary. I have nothing against security officers 
who protect warehouses and other buildings and I am sure they 
do a very good job. But that has nothing to do with the job and 
responsibilities of a correctional officer in a penitentiary. 
Absolutely nothing!
<P>
	A correctional officer is a person who has been very carefully 
chosen. The time is long gone when people would offer their 
services as a policeman or a prison guard because they could not 
find jobs and had big muscles. That was the case at the beginning 
of the century. But this should not be the case at the end of this 
century. For instance, if there is no corrections officer around 
inside a penitentiary, it is highly unlikely anyone would try to 
break in. In fact for centuries, the tendency has been for people 
to try to break out.
<P>
	However, in a warehouse without any security, it is very likely 
some people will likely help themselves, in the absence of 
security personnel. I mentioned earlier that corrections officers 
are very carefully screened. Among the many qualifications 
these people must have, there are some that everyone should 
have, including honesty and impartiality. I think we can assume 
every upstanding citizen has those qualities, but he must also 
have above average judgment and tremendous self-control.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	He must also have very acute powers of observation. His 
personal safety and the safety of his colleagues and the public 
depends on it. And last, but not least, he must pass an impressive 
battery of tests to determine his personal and interpersonal 
strengths. Government personnel departments, also known as 
human resources, invest many months' worth of tests, analyses 
and studies in each case before they select the individual or 
individuals best suited to perform the duties of a corrections 
officer.
<P>
	Do you know that at the Port-Cartier penitentiary, which 
opened in 1988 or 1989, more than 23,000 applications were 
received and processed? Port-Cartier has about 250 employees, 
including 188 corrections officers. The selection process took 
more than 20 months, from the day the initial advertisement was 
published in the media to the first day on the job.
<P>
	In the same area, the Government of Quebec regularly takes 
from 16 to 20 months to complete its selection process. I am sure 
this also applies to the nine other provinces as well.
<P>
	We must not wait until something terrible happens to take the 
proper action. We must act now, as soon as the bill goes to 
committee, to consider the impact some clauses may have. You 
do not wait until a book is published to correct the proofs.
<P>
	About the proposed deductions from inmates' income 
mentioned in cluases 21 and 26, it seems inmates might see the 
cost of room and board deducted from their income. How would 
this measure be implemented? That is a question Bill C-45 fails 
to answer. What would it cost to introduce such a measure? Here 
again, the bill does not deliver.
<P>
	Finally, and this may be why the bill does not provide an 
answer, how much will these measures save the Treasury? We 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5863"> 5863 </A></B>
<P>
cannot afford to introduce measures for  their own sake. Getting 
four quarters for a dollar is certainly not worth the trouble.
<P>
	On the subject of parole, the bill proposes that individuals 
serving a second sentence for the same offence should not be 
eligible for parole. We must look at this very carefully. People 
complain that some individuals were poorly assessed before 
their release on parole. If we deny an individual the opportunity 
to be released on parole, this means there will be no evaluation, 
either negative or positive, in his file. Once he has served his 
sentence, he will be forced back into a society he has not seen for 
months or, in many cases, years. He will be on his own in a world 
that has continued to evolve and grow and which will certainly 
have changed. Do we have the moral right to do this?
<P>
	In concluding, I wish to say that we in the Bloc Quebecois will 
work on improving this bill, in committee and in the House. We 
will do our utmost to make this bill as transparent and, above all, 
as efficient as possible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Colleen Beaumier (Brampton):</B> Mr. Speaker, in last 
year's federal election members on this side of the House 
listened to Canadians express their desire for the federal 
government to introduce reforms to the criminal justice system.
<P>
	We listened to Canadians tell us that they no longer feel safe 
walking on our streets and that they fear for the safety of their 
children, a fear that has never been felt before in this country.
<P>
	We listened as Canadians from all walks of life and from all 
parts of this country told us that they want a criminal justice 
system that is responsive and effective in dealing with the 
criminal element in our society.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	When we took office we committed ourselves to reforming 
the criminal justice system to more closely resemble the kind of 
system that Canadians want. We continue to listen to Canadians 
and to their ideas for reforming our system. We listened as 
Canadians told us that they want the red tape of government 
replaced with the common sense of concerned citizens.
<P>
	It is because this government is committed to listening to the 
concerns of Canadians and to acting in a constructive manner 
that I am pleased to speak today on Bill C-45.
<P>
	Bill C-45 introduces amendments to key pieces of legislation 
resulting in a criminal justice system which is more consistent 
with Canadian values. The protection of our children must be 
our primary concern in the justice system. It is clear that more 
needs to be done in this area.
<P>
	The statistics are staggering. Fifty-three per cent of females 
and 31 per cent of males are the victims of unwanted sexual acts. 
Eighty per cent of these assaults occur when they are children or 
youths. This is horrendous and totally unacceptable.
<P>
	Under existing laws, the National Parole Board is able to 
detain an individual who has committed a sexual assault against 
a child only if the offender has committed serious harm to the 
child. Serious harm is defined as severe physical injury or 
severe psychological damage. Proving serious harm so defined 
with respect to a child is difficult because the psychological 
harm caused by an offender may not be visible for years to come.
<P>
	Bill C-45 addresses this problem by removing the 
requirement to demonstrate serious harm for a sexual offence 
involving a child. This legislation authorizes the National 
Parole Board to detain an offender where it is satisfied that an 
offender is likely to commit another sexual assault involving a 
child before the expiration of their sentence. This really means 
no parole. This measure is in direct response to concerns 
expressed by Canadians that our justice system is too caught up 
in red tape to respond to the common sense concerns of 
Canadians and to the protection of our children.
<P>
	Such a move cannot be made in isolation and Bill C-45 
provides the necessary accompanying changes to ensure that the 
removal of the serious harm criteria with respect to child sex 
offenders is done in a responsible and effective manner. 
Rehabilitation programs for sex offenders will be strengthened 
under this legislation to ensure that the time which those 
convicted of a sexual offence against a child or an adult spent 
behind bars is constructive.
<P>
	The strengthening of our rehabilitation programs is greatly 
needed. A recent study found that 40 per cent of convicted sex 
offenders reoffend within five years after being released from 
prison. This is simply unacceptable.
<P>
	While significant progress has been made by the correctional 
service of Canada in recent years in the treatment of sex 
offenders further improvements are needed. Bill C-45 contains 
provisions to ensure that the Correctional Service of Canada has 
the resources to improve its capacity to treat offenders by 
allowing it to make deductions from an offender's income for 
room and board costs. This covers part of the spending.
<P>
	The removal of the serious harm provision also places greater 
importance on the expert abilities of members of the National 
Parole Board. This legislation strengthens the accountability of 
the parole board by establishing a mechanism for the discipline 
or removal of National Parole Board members in instances 
where a member is clearly not performing up to acceptable 
standards.
<P>
	Bill C-45 moves to fulfil a number of our red book 
commitments to promote safer homes and safer streets.
<P>
	In addition to the provisions I have already mentioned which 
deal with the treatment of child sex offenders, this legislation 
expands the list of offences for which an offender could be 
ineligible for parole until the end of their sentence. Bill C-45 
adds stalking, conspiracy to commit drug offences and serious 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5864"> 5864 </A></B>
<P>
drinking and driving and criminal negligence offences which 
result in bodily harm or death to the list of offences for which an  
offender could be referred for detention until the end of their 
sentence.
<P>
	The recognition of stalking and drug offences in particular as 
social societal problems in need of intensive treatment is 
relatively recent. This bill acknowledges their severity in law. 
By designating stalking, drug offences and drinking and driving 
as offences for which offenders could be detained until the end 
of their sentence we are bringing key criminal justice legislation 
into the 1990s.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	These reforms are the product of consulting Canadians on the 
issue of justice reform. A representative of the Canadian Police 
Association has described the reforms contained in Bill C-45 as 
the best improvements in the overall corrections and parole 
system in this country in the past 15 years. I concur and attribute 
the responsiveness of this bill to concerned Canadians who have 
demonstrated a strong commitment to Canadian society. It is 
their willingness to address these issues in a frank and open 
manner which has shaped the proposed changes to the criminal 
justice system.
<P>
	I congratulate the hon. Solicitor General on Bill C-45 and 
thank Canadians who participated.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to discuss Bill C-45, one component of the Solicitor 
General's safe streets package.
<P>
	I have to confess that I am not very pleased as I stand here. 
Like most of the Liberal agenda for change, this bill tinkers with 
it. There is no bold face of change at all. The bill has taken an 
alarmingly wrong turn in making neighbourhoods safe for 
Canadians when considering changes to the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act.
<P>
	My Reform colleagues and I have often spoken of the need for 
widespread criminal justice reform. In order to demonstrate the 
poignancy of our arguments we often refer to specific cases. 
When we do members from across the floor dismiss our 
arguments as irrelevant because they are exemplified by 
anecdotes. However, we do not trot out examples to whip up 
public sympathy but to demonstrate in clear, understandable 
human terms what the real life implications are for Canadians 
when the justice system goes wrong and fails to protect the 
victims.
<P>
	Today I will share with the House the real life tragic story of a 
woman and her family who live in fear. As I explain the 
particulars of the case it will be evident where and when 
mistakes are made in the processes involved for conditional 
releases, escorted temporary absences, known as ETAs, and 
unescorted temporary absences, UTAs.
<P>
	In 1983 Robert Paul Thompson was issued a day pass from 
prison. He had committed numerous assaults dating back to 
1969. Obviously his proclivity for violence was at that time not 
deemed sufficiently problematic and he was given a day pass. 
While out on this day pass Thompson went to the home of his 
former common law spouse Brenda Fitzgerald, the daughter of 
Mrs. Helen Leadley, a constituent of the riding I represent, 
Calgary Southeast.
<P>
	When he arrived at Brenda's home Thompson found her in the 
company of another man. He tried to kill the man by beating him 
with a hammer and stabbing him. His viciousness was 
completely unleashed as he brutally stabbed Brenda Fitzgerald 
to death. How stupid, how irresponsible that he was issued a day 
pass.
<P>
	For this brutal murder and attempted murder Thompson plea 
bargained and pleaded guilty to second degree murder. He was 
sentenced to life which made him eligible for parole in the 
spring of 1995.
<P>
	The case does not end with his conviction and sentencing 
unfortunately. Two and a half years after his incarceration in 
December 1985 Thompson stabbed two prison guards and took a 
63-year old prison nurse hostage. During the hostage situation it 
took 10 guards to restrain Thompson. For these subsequent 
crimes Thompson received a sentence of 11 years to be served 
concurrent to his original sentence with parole eligibility still in 
April 1995.
<P>
	Thompson has been denied two requests for conditional 
release since his last conviction. In 1992 he was denied day 
parole and in 1993 he was denied an ETA. These decisions are 
extremely important for the Leadley family's safety. Since his 
incarceration this man, Thompson, has managed to get a letter to 
Mrs. Leadley threatening to kill the family. From prison a 
convicted murderer has been able to violently threaten the 
family of the woman he murdered. The family lives in fear and 
any quality of life has virtually disintegrated. The grandchildren 
have been given different names and moved out of the city and 
Mrs. Leadley is not even able to see her own grandchildren.
<P>
	However, the reason that I stand here today should be of 
concern to the members of this House, as it is to me.
<P>
<B>(1115 ) </B>
<P>
	Thompson recently applied for an escorted temporary 
absence. His brother has a non-life threatening illness and is in 
hospital. Thompson wishes to visit him for two hours. In its 
infinite wisdom in an eight-page decision, the parole board has 
recommended that the ETA be granted.
<P>
	The parole board gave its reasons for denying his first parole 
request: the viciousness of all of his crimes. Now has something 
happened in the past 12 months since his last denial to make the 
board suddenly comfortable with this man's criminal character?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5865"> 5865 </A></B>
<P>
	The parole board cites the fact that Thompson has participated 
in some rehabilitation programs since his last request for release 
as reason for its sudden change of heart. In 1993 he was a 
dangerous criminal but just 12 months and a few courses later he 
is suitable for release it suggests.
<P>
	To justify its new position, the parole board refers to anger 
management courses that Thompson has taken. He was required 
to participate in a program that required only one hour per week 
for 10 weeks. Are these 10 hours of participation enough for the 
board to have changed its position? Also in its decision the 
board encourages Thompson to request to be transferred to a 
lesser security prison.
<P>
	These are the decisions and recommendations of a parole 
board that alleges its reason for being is to protect the Canadian 
public. There is certainly no accountability here. I fail to see 
how such decisions protect the Canadian public.
<P>
	The parole board is saying to this criminal that he deserves a 
special treat for having been a good boy for 12 months. The 
irony of the situation is that the case management team supports 
Thompson's request, as does the warden of the prison and the 
parole board. The Canadian public does not support this request. 
I do not support it and the Leadley family does not support it.
<P>
	The Liberals keep saying they want safer streets but I do not 
believe it. Whenever they get a chance to make a tough decision 
to make the streets safe, they balk. They fail to act. I sent a letter 
to the Solicitor General, the National Parole Board chairman 
and to the Minister of Justice. My office has had numerous 
contacts with these offices since the board rendered its 
reprehensible decision on September 13. The Solicitor General 
has the power to overturn this ridiculous decision but has done 
nothing. Not one of these people has acted yet nor has responded 
to my letter and phone calls requesting the reversal of the 
decision of the parole board.
<P>
	In fact, the chairman of the National Parole Board has 
demonstrated his complete disdain for the safety of the 
Canadian public by responding to my requests by saying: ``Mr. 
Thompson will be escorted. I really do not see what the big deal 
is''. It is no small wonder that Canadian confidence in our 
criminal justice system is so low. What reason do they have to be 
confident when such ignorance is demonstrated by the National 
Parole Board?
<P>
	In the board's decision for Thompson's pass, it is mentioned 
in a section on general statistical information on recidivism that 
two out of three offenders will not commit an indictable offence 
after release. The corollary of this is that 33 per cent will 
reoffend after release. This is a substantial number, an 
unacceptably high number. Further to this frightening figure is 
the amount of recidivism of day parolees. The number of people 
who have breached a condition of release or reoffended has 
increased by 41 per cent in five years.
<P>
	Despite these alarming figures, the National Parole Board 
chairman still fails to see what the big deal is in letting a 
convicted murderer out on an ETA. I am absolutely furious. The 
irony is that it is his job to protect the Canadian public.
<P>
	The big deal is simple. In the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act, section 17(b) grants to convicts the privilege of 
receiving escorted temporary absences for the following 
reasons: medical; administrative; community service; family 
contact; personal development for rehabilitative purposes; or 
compassionate reasons, including parental responsibilities.
<P>
	These people demonstrated no compassion when they killed 
their fellow man. Escorted temporary absences are expensive 
luxuries which should not be so easily obtained, especially for 
violent offenders.
<P>
	As well, section 17(c) states that an inmate's behaviour while 
under sentence does not preclude authorizing absence. This 
section should be struck from the act and is worth pursuing at the 
committee stage.
<P>
	Thompson's example is one case in point. He was out on a day 
pass when he committed murder. This fact should necessarily be 
considered when he applies for subsequent passes. In fact, it 
should be sufficient reason to deny all subsequent requests.
<P>
<B>(1120 ) </B>
<P>
	I have used the Robert Paul Thompson case to demonstrate 
some of what this bill fails but ought to do. In retrospect, the 
decision in 1983 to issue a day pass was flawed. I am very 
personally connected to this situation.
<P>
	I challenge the Solicitor General on this matter. If he really 
cares about making Canada safer for all of us, then he can begin 
here and now by reversing the terrible and disgusting decision of 
the parole board to grant Robert Paul Thompson a day pass for 
family contact. Canadians demand no less.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to address the 
House today on Bill C-45. As a former prosecutor for Essex 
county in Ontario I recognize the need for changes in this area to 
provide Canadians with greater public protection and a greater 
sense of security. Police officers, prosecutors and victims 
groups with whom I have discussed these amendments tell me 
that this is a wonderful and a strong step forward in this area.
<P>
	The Liberal red book told Canadians that we share their 
concerns. It told Canadians of our promise to take steps to help 
protect our citizens from repeat offenders. Safe homes and safe 
streets are a theme for this government, but it is a theme that 
goes hand in hand with our other themes of job creation and of 
respect for human rights. Indeed, these themes of prosperity, 
security and human rights merge to make Canada the kind of 
country that really is the envy of the world.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5866"> 5866 </A></B>
<P>
	These amendments address the issue of public security. With 
these amendments our government is following through on our 
commitments to the public, commitments published in our red 
book, commitments we have consistently followed up on and 
that you can literally check off as we go through our mandate. 
They are sensible commitments which help to improve our 
security and our rights in this country.
<P>
	Public safety is the primary consideration in putting forward 
these changes. As we follow through on our red book 
commitments we are improving protection from repeat sex 
offenders. These changes are part of ongoing reforms to increase 
and improve our handling and our management of these 
offenders within the federal corrections system. In particular we 
have focused on those offenders who victimize children, 
although of course others are included in the sweep of this 
legislation.
<P>
	These changes will help to restore public confidence in the 
corrections process by closing gaps and by responding directly 
to shortcomings that have been perceived by the public. We will 
tighten the system for those convicted of sex offences against 
children. We will pass changes which will allow us to detain in 
the penitentiary until the end of their sentence sex offenders who 
victimize children.
<P>
	Other offences will be caught within the mandate of this 
legislation. Those include: serious drinking and driving 
offences; criminal negligence offences which result in bodily 
harm or death; criminal harassment, more commonly known as 
stalking laws; and conspiracy to commit serious drug offences. 
All of these will be added to the list of offences for possible 
detention until the end of sentence.
<P>
	Of those offences however I think all Canadians find crimes 
against children to be among the most reprehensible acts. That is 
why it is so important to increase the powers of the National 
Parole Board to enable that body to keep repeat sex offenders 
behind bars for their full sentence.
<P>
	Under the existing legislation the National Parole Board must 
establish that serious harm was done to a victim during the 
commission of the offence or that it is likely to occur during a 
future offence involving a child. This criterion of serious harm 
can be difficult to identify among children who often do not 
exhibit the full effects of the trauma until later in their lives.
<P>
	This legislation seeks to improve the protection of children 
and is also a response to the report on serious harm by the 
Standing Committee on Justice and the Solicitor General.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	In addition to strengthening the sentencing side of sex 
offences the legislation will also strengthen and expand 
treatment programs for these crimes. This is another part of our 
red book commitment.
<P>
	As important as it is to keep repeat sex offenders in 
penitentiaries as long as they remain a risk, it is equally 
important to recognize that their sentences will inevitably 
expire and that we must therefore strengthen our rehabilitation 
programs. Although we have made some strides in this area in 
the past, it is important to keep our focus in that direction and to 
make sure these programs improve. These amendments will also 
provide additional reasonable resources for those programs.
<P>
	We are also following through on a commitment to create a 
mechanism for the discipline or removal from office of National 
Parole Board members where members are not performing 
competently. This proposal, together with increased training, 
the continued advertising of board vacancies and the 
appointment of qualified, competent board members will 
further increase the accountability of the board. This is 
something Canadians have demanded, something we have 
promised to Canadians and once again, something we have 
followed through on.
<P>
	While this legislation targets repeat sex offenders and other 
serious criminals specifically, it also addresses the issue of 
sentence calculation. There has been a longstanding concern 
about the way sentences are calculated. Changes to the process 
will ensure that offenders on parole in the community who are 
convicted of a new offence are automatically returned to 
custody, and would serve a substantial part of the new sentence, 
at least one-third, in penitentiary before being eligible to be 
considered for parole.
<P>
	Like other legislation we have promulgated since our election 
and which we will table throughout our term this act is the result 
of consultation with Canadians. I speak specifically to my 
friends across the way when I say that unlike some legislators, 
Liberals do not limit their consultations only to those who share 
their own view. We have the nerve, we have the mandate and we 
have the strength to dare to involve all Canadians. We are not 
afraid to hear other views. We do not sit with narrow, little 
minds hiding in a hot house. Instead, we go to all Canadians. We 
seek to widen our horizons. We seek to criss-cross the country 
and to consult widely in both languages.
<P>
	That is something the Solicitor General has done. I know my 
friends on this side of the House join me as should those across 
the way in commending him for this consultation and 
commending him for having the guts and the courage to go out 
and speak to all Canadians.
<P>
	I ask all members in this House to support this bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Solicitor General had been promising major amendments to the 
current legislation in order to crack down on adults who commit 
crimes against children. In particular, the government said it 
would take extremely harsh measures in view of the demands of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5867"> 5867 </A></B>
<P>
a society totally  disgusted with the courts' failure to deal with 
child molesters.
<P>
	Like all Canadians, I was expecting a massive overhaul of the 
current legislation. It seems, however, that the Solicitor General 
does not have the same perception as the vast majority of 
Canadians on this point. It seems that the government has 
chosen to continue to favour administrative justice, which is 
arbitrary and secretive, over the courts. Clearly the Liberal 
Party does not want to toughen the act with regard to with rapists 
and child abusers.
<P>
	If I understand this bill correctly, individuals serving a 
two-year sentence following assault on children, will be 
referred to the Parole Board which will determine whether they 
can be paroled at the time legally set or whether they should be 
kept in jail until the end of their sentence or subjected to special 
control measures.
<P>
	People should not be led to believe that the amendments 
proposed by the Solicitor General could be used to keep these 
individuals in jail after the end of their sentence.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	You should not think either that this is tougher for abusers and 
pedophiles or that it would apply to all sexual offenders.
<P>
	All the Solicitor General is doing is proposing to give the 
Parole Board the discretionary power to parole before the end of 
their sentence individuals guilty of sexual crimes against 
children.
<P>
	This measure already exists for violent offenders and drug 
dealers; we are merely adding pedophiles.
<P>
	Two observations before I move on to more legal aspects. 
Sexual crimes against children are probably the most horrific, 
the most despicable and the most repugnant crimes that a court 
can find an individual guilty of.
<P>
	It is not without reason that nearly every crime of that nature 
is punishable by maximum penalties going from a 10-year 
prison sentence to life.
<P>
	When an adult sexually assaults a child, he destroys the 
person within the child, the child's vision of the world as well as 
his or her trust in mankind. Such crimes are no less serious when 
the victim is an adult, but the latter is already equipped with a 
psychological immune system that might help him or her get 
over the pain and suffering. The assaulted child dies inside.
<P>
	I feel no sympathy, no mercy for molesters; I despise and 
loathe these cowards who take advantage of a child's innocence 
to satisfy their narcissistic drive. Until proven otherwise-the 
burden of proof rests on the criminal's shoulders-I do not 
believe that rehabilitation is possible. I do know that in certain 
rare cases there appears to be a change in behaviour, at the cost 
of tremendous personal sacrifices and after a painful process. 
But certainly not as a result of some ridiculous prison therapy 
criminals agree  to with the sole objective of improving their 
chances to get paroled.
<P>
	Crimes of a sexual nature against children deserve the 
maximum sentence; those which leave them injured, mutilated 
or harmed in their physical or moral integrity should result in a 
life sentence for the offenders.
<P>
	This brings me to publicly question once again the 
professional competence of the members of this inept 
organisation, namely the Parole Board.
<P>
	I do not question the need for a parole monitoring body or its 
usefulness. Every western nation relies on such government 
agencies responsible for closely monitoring criminals in the 
community at large, until the end of their sentence.
<P>
	However, I am extremely sceptical about the professional 
competence of the Parole Board members who are all political 
appointees.
<P>
	This body has become the haven for the friends and survivors 
of defeated governments or governments reaching the end of 
their mandates, whichever the case. The good faith of these 
people in carrying out their duty is not at issue, but I cannot help 
but notice that the lack of professional hiring criteria sheds a 
cloud of doubt on the credibility of their decisions.
<P>
	And yet, the Solicitor General has decided to entrust this 
board with the authority to release criminals convicted of 
abusing or raping children.
<P>
	The board's job would amount in fact to reviewing the 
sentence imposed by the court. If at least the Solicitor General 
had given authority to the court to impose a prison sentence 
without parole in the afore-mentioned cases, we would be closer 
to a reform. But such is not the case.
<P>
	The court already has the power to give very harsh sentences 
to child abusers. Every sexual crime involving children is 
punishable by penalties that the court should not hesitate to 
pass.
<P>
	The court already has in hand all the elements necessary to 
determine the sentence. We will discuss later, probably at the 
end of the day, the amendments that Bill C-41 brings to 
sentencing principles. The court will have all the facts at hand 
and will be able to evaluate all the factors relevant to the case, 
including elements of the pre-sentence report describing in 
detail the personality of the accused.
<P>
	I believe that by simply giving the courts the power to order 
that the sentence imposed be served completely before a 
criminal can be released, we could have achieved what the bill 
seeks to do.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5868"> 5868 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	I am against giving this new quasi-judicial role to an 
organization which has neither the stature nor the competence to 
assume such responsibility towards society. We must give the 
courts all the necessary latitude to reach the legislation's goals. 
Those were my comments, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
my pleasure to speak on Bill C-45 brought in by the Solicitor 
General as part of the strategic framework of initiatives to which 
the government committed itself in the red book during the last 
campaign. It seeks to implement the safe homes, safe streets 
strategy which is being very much demanded by Canadians from 
coast to coast to coast as we in all parts of the House know.
<P>
	The bill recognizes the all time low level of confidence 
Canadians have unfortunately demonstrated in our courts and in 
our current parole system. I must confess that this low level of 
confidence is justified and as a Canadian I certainly share it to a 
large extent.
<P>
	Contrary to some opinions we have heard today from other 
members of the House, the bill is worthy of support. It is a major 
step in the right direction. It puts forth several important 
initiatives much awaited by Canadians and I would like to speak 
to them briefly today.
<P>
	It adds several offences to the list of serious crimes for which 
people can be required to serve their full sentence such as 
drinking and driving and drug offences, to name two.
<P>
	There is an important initiative in that the bill would seek to 
increase the accountability of the National Parole Board by 
establishing a mechanism to discipline and remove members 
that have performed in an unacceptable and indeed incompetent 
manner in some cases. Unfortunately we know that this could be 
the case and the provision is badly needed.
<P>
	The bill seeks to strengthen rehabilitation programs for sex 
offenders. This is one of the most important initiatives 
undertaken. All too often repeat sex offenders such as 
pedophiles come out of the institutions in which they were 
incarcerated just as unbalanced individuals as when they entered 
incarceration. This is simply unacceptable and must be 
addressed. The bill seeks to do that.
<P>
	The bill increases the authority of officials to make 
deductions from the income of offenders to help defray the 
increasing costs of incarceration. This is something which 
Canadians will applaud no matter what is their overall view of 
the bill. It is obviously a very important initiative and makes 
good common sense.
<P>
	In my personal view the most important guiding principle in 
our system of criminal justice should be that violent criminals 
will be considered in a category altogether separate from 
non-violent criminals. Violent  criminals should be 
experiencing stricter sentences from our courts and much 
stricter conditions for early release.
<P>
	It is my view that the almost automatic release after one-third 
of the sentence of criminals has been served, even the most 
violent criminals, is a big mistake. Violent criminals, whether 
they be sexual offenders or non-sexual offenders, should be 
serving much closer to the full sentence. I would hope to see the 
day when repeat violent offenders will be serving the full 
sentence.
<P>
	Bill C-45 moves substantially in that direction. It permits the 
retention for full sentence of criminals that have offended 
against children. While I applaud it as a step in the right 
direction I hope to see the day when such heinous crimes will be 
met with a mandatory serving of a full sentence for violent 
criminals, be they sexual offenders or non-sexual offenders. 
This is very important in the case of someone who has 
demonstrated a pattern of repeat violent offence.
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	Canadians know, and we in the House know, that in many 
cases sentences have been too light and out of all proportion to 
the nature of the crime and to the incredible harm inflicted on 
the victim, be they children or adults. For any adult who has 
been a victim of violent crime, particularly violent sexual crime, 
it is an horrendous experience to try to live through.
<P>
	Bill C-45 requires an offender on parole who reoffends to 
serve at least one-third of his or her sentence for the latest crime 
before being eligible for parole. I applaud that. I say again I hope 
to see the day when repeat violent offenders serve their full 
sentence and not one-third. I hope to see the day when they 
forgo any opportunity for early release if they have established a 
pattern of repeat violent offences. The bill is a major step in that 
direction.
<P>
	The issue of the serious harm provision against children is 
very important. The bill removes that condition and states it is 
not required for serious harm to be demonstrated. This makes 
good sense. For me personally violent crime is by definition 
serious crime. It inflicts serious harm on the victim especially if 
the victim is a child. Violent crime of a sexual or a non-sexual 
nature against an adult obviously is serious and should be 
treated in such a manner.
<P>
	I very much applaud Bill C-45 and the Solicitor General for 
the initiatives he has undertaken. It is not a perfect bill. I 
suppose we see very few of those in this land or any other. I 
personally hope to see the day when we will go further, when we 
will be stricter on repeat violent offenders whether they be 
sexual or non-sexual offenders, and when we will be much more 
vigilant on early releases than what we have been.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5869"> 5869 </A></B>
<P>
	The bill is a major step toward the stricter approach being 
called for by Canadians from coast to coast to coast.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Prince Albert-Churchill River):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on this occasion to speak in favour of Bill C-45 
which was given first reading in the House last June.
<P>
	Since 1984 there has been a marked increase in violent crime 
across the country. Dealing with this growing incidence of crime 
was certainly listed as one of the priorities of the Liberal Party 
and the new government as set out in the red book.
<P>
	There is no doubt that for many years Canada was viewed and 
is still viewed, and rightly so, as a non-violent nation. It was a 
nation in which all of us could carry on our business, our daily 
affairs, without fear for our personal safety or for the personal 
safety of our loved ones. However in the last decade Canadians 
have become less certain about that reality as we have seen 
example after example played out across our television screens 
and in our newspapers of violent crimes being perpetrated 
within our communities.
<P>
	Our government believes the issue of safe streets is not 
achieved simply by strengthening legislation in relation to 
criminal behaviour such as the Criminal Code, the Young 
Offenders Act or the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, 
the present legislation. There are some in the House who tend to 
simplify the issue of public safety to the extreme by saying that 
by making harsh incarceration rules, by sentencing people to 
long sentences or by introducing corporal or capital punishment 
our streets will suddenly or magically be safe.
<P>
	Some would have us believe that if we toughen our parole 
release provisions to the extreme in all cases suddenly there 
would be no more crime and we would not suffer from violence 
to our person and to our families. The government disagrees 
with that approach.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	We recognize that in order to reduce the incidence of 
criminality within our society that society must provide 
meaningful employment opportunities for all people. The direct 
link between economic hardship, lack of opportunity and 
criminality is well known. To that end the government has 
implemented policies which allow for economic growth.
<P>
	Roughly 275,000 new jobs have been created since the new 
government took office. The Canadian economy has grown by 
4.2 per cent annual growth rate in the first quarter and an 
astounding 6.4 per cent in the second quarter. This assists to 
reduce the incidence of criminal behaviour within our society.
<P>
	Another factor that certainly helps reduce the crime rate and 
the violence within our society means doing something to 
alleviate underlying social conditions which create an 
environment where criminal behaviour can  flourish, whether it 
is poverty, racism, hunger or whatever the social issue might be.
<P>
	We have begun to address those issues as a government. We 
must continue to alleviate negative social conditions which 
create an environment where crime can flourish, whether it is 
fighting racism or increasing educational opportunities or 
providing our young people with experience in the workplace 
through the Canada youth corps. We are moving toward safer 
communities in our nation once again.
<P>
	No doubt there are other things that governments and 
communities can undertake to increase public safety. The 
creative nature of our communities will make this happen from 
coast to coast. I am not saying that the government cannot move 
to improve the Criminal Code, the Young Offenders Act or the 
legislation currently before the House where it makes sense to 
do so.
<P>
	The government recognizes that action to combat crime must 
be a multi-pronged approach involving the enhancement of 
criminal laws, the Young Offenders Act, the parole legislation 
where it is reasonable to do so and demonstrably justified. 
Where flaws are located in the current legislation we must move 
to correct those flaws. We have a responsibility to do so.
<P>
	Not only must our economies be strong, not only must our 
social programs be relevant and scratch where the country itches 
but also we must deal with our criminal legislation through these 
various criminally related statutes and to fix them where they 
have proved inadequate.
<P>
	We see this approach being taken whether it is in this bill 
brought forward by the Solicitor General or whether it is other 
bills such as the Young Offenders Act being brought forward by 
the Minister of Justice or amendments to the Criminal Code. 
These types of approaches allow for the House and our society to 
improve, to enhance the laws which govern our land, the laws 
which make it safe for all of us to enjoy our communities and to 
enjoy our homes without fear of violence.
<P>
	Within this specific legislation a number of changes have 
been made which will make our parole system better, our 
criminal justice system better and will ultimately improve the 
safety of our communities across the nation.
<P>
	The individual legislative proposals which I support make it 
easier to detain in penitentiary until the end of sentence sex 
offenders who victimize children by removing that serious harm 
must be established as a criterion for detention in these cases. 
There is no doubt that the young person by having to provide 
testimony as to serious harm is revictimized and we certainly 
see no need for that. The fact that an offence has been committed 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5870"> 5870 </A></B>
<P>
certainly establishes beyond doubt that serious harm has been 
done.
<P>
	This legislation will also establish a mechanism for the 
removal from office of National Parole Board members who 
become incapacitated from executing their duties by infirmity 
or misconduct or have failed to carry out their role in a manner 
that is expected of them. This is to maintain the integrity of the 
system. We certainly will reduce the number of errors that are 
made in releasing people who should not be released.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	In addition to these types of changes, we are also expanding 
the list of offences for which an offender could be referred for 
detention until the end of sentence. These offences include 
serious drinking and driving and criminal negligence offences 
which result in bodily harm or death. In addition there will be 
more emphasis placed on the rehabilitation of people through 
programs. This is also a very important step forward.
<P>
	What is typical of the government is that we are utilizing 
some of the parliamentary reforms we have brought forward in 
this term to allow individual members more say in the 
development of legislation.
<P>
	I want to commend the Solicitor General for referring this bill 
at this stage to the committee so that we can, as individual 
members, provide input and make additional changes. Certainly 
where it is clear and obvious that changes ought to be made the 
government has made those changes but it is allowing the 
opportunity for further changes, for further amendment, as the 
bill moves along.
<P>
	This is a very progressive step. Through the committee stage 
we can hear what Canadians think of these changes and write a 
bill that reflects the desires of our people for a safe society but 
one balanced with our desire always to ensure that people can 
have the opportunity to be rehabilitated.
<P>
	I am very proud of the efforts the government has made so far 
and will support these legislative changes as the bill moves on to 
committee.

	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada)</B> moved that Bill C-41, an act to amend the 
Criminal Code (sentencing) and other acts in consequence 
thereof, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, as I rise to begin the debate on second 
reading of Bill C-41 with respect to sentencing, may I first 
observe that the bill is a response to and product of over 14 years 
of effort to achieve comprehensive reform in the sentencing 
process as part of the criminal justice system in Canada.
<P>
	Indeed the need for such reform in the sentencing process has 
been long recognized by judges, by parliamentarians, by 
lawyers, by Canadians themselves.
<P>
<B>(1155 ) </B>
<P>
	For over a decade there have been calls for such reform: a 
royal commission on the subject, the law reform commission, 
the Canadian sentencing commission which reported in 1987, 
and in 1988 an all-party committee of the House which had a 
comprehensive set of recommendations with respect to 
sentencing, conditional release and corrections.
<P>
	Many of those recommendations are reflected in this bill. It is 
in recognition of that need for reform that my party gave its 
commitment last year during the election campaign to introduce 
this legislation.
<P>
	I tabled Bill C-41 on June 13 last and today I recommend to 
the House that it be considered and approved in principle and 
referred to the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal 
Affairs.
<P>
	The bill we are considering today is a significant one. By its 
terms, for the first time Canadians would have a say through 
Parliament on the purpose and the principles of criminal 
sentencing. No such statement exists at present in the Criminal 
Code. Parliament's role to date so far as sentencing is concerned 
has been limited to setting certain maximum levels of 
incarceration and rarely minimum levels rather than dealing 
with the policy objectives of the sentencing process.
<P>
	Bill C-41 brings together first, a statement of the purposes 
and principles of sentencing; second, the rules governing 
procedure and the admissibility of evidence in the process; and 
third, the various sanctions that the courts may impose to 
punish, to deter, to rehabilitate, all in a form that represents the 
collective view of Parliament.
<P>
	The changes proposed in this bill have been broadly accepted 
by criminal justice professionals, by the provinces and by the 
territories. The establishment of these statements of purposes 
and principles has been endorsed by the Canadian Sentencing 
Commission, by the justice committee of this House and the 
former Law Reform Commission of Canada. I would not want it 
to be thought that Bill C-41 is the product only of the  so-called 
elites, the professionals, the government administrators of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5871"> 5871 </A></B>
<P>
system. The bill reflects rather, in my respectful view, the 
broadly based need, the widely felt need in Canada for uniform 
and effective statements in the code for what sentencing is to 
achieve.
<P>
	I believe that sentencing practices in Canada must 
consistently reflect the values that Canadians have told us are 
important to them in the treatment of offenders. But considering 
the fact that criminal sanctions provide for one of the most 
serious intrusions by the state into the lives of individuals, 
indeed depriving them of liberty, it is really quite remarkable 
that the criminal law to date has not contained such a policy 
statement.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Through this bill, Parliament provides the courts with clear 
guidelines. Parliament stresses the need to punish certain types 
of behaviour by clearly stating that the purpose of sentencing 
must be to denounce unlawful conduct, to deter offenders and 
other persons from committing crimes and to separate offenders 
from society, where necessary.
<P>
	In addition, the statement of the purpose and principles of 
sentencing provides that the sentence must take into 
consideration the will to protect society, to assist in 
rehabilitating offenders and promoting their sense of 
responsibility and to provide reparations for harm done to 
victims or to the community.
<P>
	The bill also defines various sentencing principles, for 
instance that the sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of 
the offence and the offender's degree of responsibility. When 
appropriate, alternatives must be contemplated, especially in 
the case of Native offenders.
<P>
<B>(1200 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The bill provides courts with clear policy direction from 
Parliament. The elements of punishment are addressed. 
Denunciation is there, as are deterrents and separation from 
society. The bill is a comprehensive and detailed one. I would 
like in the moments during which I will speak to the House today 
to highlight a number of issues that I feel are particularly 
important.
<P>
	First, the statement of purpose and principles augments the 
normal sentencing practice of considering extenuating factors 
by specifying two important circumstances. It provides that 
when the evidence demonstrates that an offence has been 
committed by a person who abuses a position of trust or 
authority in relation to the victim, that shall be considered as an 
aggravating circumstance in determining the penalty.
<P>
	Numerous recommendations have been made respecting 
breach of trust for offences involving violence against women, 
for example, and involving vulnerable persons including 
children. The 1993 violence against women survey by Statistics 
Canada demonstrated that almost one-half of women reported 
experiencing violence during their lives by men known to them. 
In too many  cases positions of trust were exploited, for 
example, by adults against children or a physician against a 
patient.
<P>
	The 1984 Badgley committee called for protection of children 
from persons they already know and trust. Including this 
specific aggravating circumstance will express Parliament's 
determination to extend criminal law for the purposes of 
protecting such persons, persons made vulnerable through the 
disarming effects of a trusting relationship.
<P>
	The bill also specifies that if an offence is motivated by bias, 
prejudice or hate, this shall be considered an aggravating factor 
in determining the sentence. It seems to me that this provision 
responds to growing concerns about hate motivated crime.
<P>
	The last report of the league for human rights of the B'nai 
Brith established that the number of reported anti-Semitic 
incidents has grown significantly over the last few years.
<P>
	Moreover, hate motivated violence against individuals based 
on the offenders bias toward other sexual orientations has 
sparked public anxiety. General concerns have been raised about 
the pervasiveness of racism in Canada.
<P>
	Recognition in the Criminal Code of hate motivation as an 
aggravating factor in sentencing will send an important message 
to minority communities and to the public at large.
<P>
	A second feature of Bill C-41 merits special treatment in this 
debate. The bill reflects also the importance of our recognizing 
the plight of victims of criminal acts. Bill C-41 goes some 
distance in achieving that objective.
<P>
	The statement of purpose and principles specifically indicates 
that objectives for sentencing include the provision of 
reparation for harm done to victims or the community and the 
promotion of a sense of responsibility in offenders, an 
acknowledgement of the harm done to victims and the 
community.
<P>
	It goes further, specifically in relation to section 745 of the 
Criminal Code. That is the section that makes it possible for a 
person who has been sentenced to life with a period of parole 
ineligibility longer than 15 years to apply after 15 years for 
permission to seek parole. Such an application is heard by a 
court composed of a judge and jury, and two-thirds of the jury 
must agree before such a person is given permission to apply for 
parole.
<P>
	The section has become controversial and it is alleged that life 
should mean life, that no such application should be permitted. 
Against that there are those in the correctional system who insist 
that persons who are rehabilitated after 15 years should have the 
opportunity to appear before a court and seek not parole but 
permission to apply for parole, to establish that they have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5872"> 5872 </A></B>
<P>
changed and society's best interests would be served by their 
being considered for parole release.
<P>
<B>(1205 ) </B>
<P>
	Earlier this year I met Marie King Forest, a woman from 
Saskatchewan whose husband was a member of the Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police, murdered in the course of his duties.
<P>
	Mrs. King Forest attended court earlier this year during the 
hearing of an application under section 745. She was 
accompanied at the meeting by three other women whose 
husbands had been police officers and who had been killed in the 
course of their duties.
<P>
	Mrs. King Forest described to me the anguish she felt at 
reliving the tragedy of her husband's death and at the whole 
process surrounding the 745 application. It is out of respect for 
that anguish, for the feeling on the part of the families of murder 
victims, homicide victims, that they should have some role to 
play in the process.
<P>
	Bill C-41 proposes a change to section 745, a change that 
would specifically require the court to take into account on such 
an application the perspective and the evidence of the victim's 
families in deciding whether permission should be granted to 
the applicant to seek early parole.
<P>
	While it does not go as far as some would have it go-indeed 
they would have us revoke the section-that change goes a long 
way toward accommodating the concerns that have been 
expressed by, among others, the Canadian Police Association 
and the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police. I believe it 
achieves a balance. It permits the court to take into account at 
the time of such an application the continuing anguish and loss 
of the victims' families and measure it against other societal 
values and objectives, including the importance of reintegrating 
into society someone who has been rehabilitated and who can 
demonstrate so at the time of the hearing.
<P>
	Still on the subject of victims in the criminal justice system, 
the restitution provisions which have been in the Criminal Code 
for some years, since they were passed in 1988, have largely 
remained unproclaimed due to provincial objections with 
respect to the complex procedures that they contemplate.
<P>
	Bill C-41 sets out a new set of measures respecting restitution 
developed co-operatively by the federal government and our 
provincial colleagues. There is a priority given to restitution. If 
a court finds it appropriate to award both a fine and restitution, 
the priority will go to the victim. Restitution must be honoured 
first.
<P>
	Provision is made to ensure that restitution orders can be 
enforced by the civil courts. One can register them, like a 
judgement, then ask that they be executed upon so the property 
or the money of the offender can be seized to satisfy the order.
<P>
	Finally, the Criminal Code will specifically state that any 
restitution ordered by a criminal court will not limit a victim's 
right to sue for damages in the civil court. A victim will be able 
to take a restitution order to the civil court for execution.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	At the present time, nearly a third of the people liable to 
incarceration in provincial jails are in that situation because 
they did not pay fines. Studies have shown that Natives are the 
most at risk of being incarcerated for failing to pay fines. Since 
we know that these offenders rarely go to prison for long periods 
and, in fact, often do not spend any time in jail, the 
administrative burden involved in treating these cases is heavy 
and of little use.
<P>
	The bill recognizes this situation.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	These provisions state that the court must be convinced that 
the offender can pay the fine contemplated before imposing it. 
In case a fine is not imposed because the offender would not be 
able to pay it, the offender will be liable to other penalties such 
as probation or community service.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Measures are provided in the bill to help provinces collect 
outstanding fines. Provinces will be able to use the same 
mechanisms to enforce fines under the Criminal Code as they 
use for provincial statutes. Persons designated by the court will 
be able to make adjustments to the order. Provinces will be able 
to refuse to issue or to renew permits or licences until a fine is 
paid. They may refer the case for civil enforcement. 
Incarceration would be retained only as a final enforcement 
option.
<P>
	Ultimately I believe that these proposals will result in less 
crowded institutions and should decrease the costs for the 
system. They will do this without compromising the 
effectiveness of criminal justice and its administration.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In the last few years, we have learned a great deal about the 
administration of justice, about how to protect the public better. 
Incarceration must remain an option for offenders who need this 
form of punishment and must be separated from society to 
ensure the safety of the population. It is worthwhile to remind 
the House that Canada's incarceration rate is extremely high 
compared with other industrialized countries.
<P>
	Furthermore, studies show that for minor and first-time 
offenders, incarceration is not very useful or effective and may 
even be harmful if the goal is to turn the person into a 
law-abiding citizen.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5873"> 5873 </A></B>
<P>
	The provisions of this bill concerning alternative sentences 
for adults and the new approach to collecting fines, which I 
talked about earlier, will allow the courts to handle cases 
differently according to their specific sets of circumstances by 
expanding the range of options available for serious and minor 
offenders alike. Our goal is above all to create a more equitable, 
less costly and more effective system which Canadians can 
trust.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A general principle that runs throughout Bill C-41 is that jails 
should be reserved for those who should be there. Alternatives 
should be put in place for those who commit offences but who do 
not need or merit incarceration.
<P>
	What alternatives will be available? For the first time Bill 
C-41 introduces diversion for adult offenders. At the discretion 
of the investigating officers and the appropriate authorities 
persons charged with a minor offence, particularly the first time, 
can be sent into a parallel stream away from the courtroom to be 
counselled or to be helped to overcome whatever problem led to 
the infraction.
<P>
	Courts will continue to have probation as an appropriate 
sanction in the cases which require it. Fines, as mentioned, will 
be improved. There will be a new sentence provided for in Bill 
C-41 called the conditional sentence. I will speak to that remedy 
for a few moments.
<P>
	Where a court imposes a sentence of imprisonment of less 
than two years and where the court is satisfied that serving the 
sentence in the community would not endanger the safety of 
society as a whole, the court may order that the offender serve 
the sentence in the community rather than in an institution.
<P>
	Offenders who do not comply with such conditions as may be 
imposed at that time can be summoned back to court to explain 
their behaviour, to demonstrate why they should not be 
incarcerated. If the court is not satisfied with that explanation, it 
can order the offender to serve the balance of the sentence in 
custody. This sanction is obviously aimed at offenders who 
would otherwise be in jail but who could be in the community 
under tight controls.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	It seems to me that such an approach would promote the 
protection of the public by seeking to separate the most serious 
offenders from the community while providing that less serious 
offenders can remain among other members of society with 
effective community based alternatives while still adhering to 
appropriate conditions. It also means that scarce funds can be 
used for incarcerating and treating the more serious offenders.
<P>
	There is much in the bill to remove uncertainty and mystery 
about the sentencing process. The principles and purposes are 
spelled out once and for all. The theme of the bill is that such 
matters should not be left just to the  justice professionals but 
should be there for all members of the public to see.
<P>
	In keeping with that approach there is a provision in C-41 
requiring reasons for sentencing to be given in all cases. This 
measure will encourage well-reasoned decisions, will assist 
courts of appeal in dealing with appeals from sentences and will 
serve an educative function.
<P>
	Giving reasons will assist the courts in expressing their 
objectives in demonstrating how they are applying the 
principles of sentencing and should enable the public better to 
relate to what is done in sentencing and to the policy approved 
by Parliament. Without overstating the provision, I hope it will 
help us to evolve sound government policy in criminal justice 
with broad and better informed public support.
<P>
	All of these proposals and C-41 in its entirety are designed to 
increase public accessibility to the law concerning sentencing, 
to make it more understandable and to make it more predictable. 
The bill includes a complete restructuring of part XXIII of the 
Criminal Code of Canada. It brings together most of the 
provisions relating to sentencing now in the code. It presents 
them in such a way as to make them, I hope, more logical and 
more accessible both to criminal justice professionals and to the 
public.
<P>
	With this bill and with the other initiatives in the area of 
criminal justice the government is providing a balanced and a 
comprehensive approach to the challenge of crime in Canada. 
Improving the process and clarifying the principles of 
sentencing is not going to solve all of our social problems but 
the bill will, I hope, contribute along with crime prevention 
initiatives to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, 
peaceful and safe society.
<P>
	Jails and prisons will be there for those who need them, for 
those who should be punished in that way or separated from 
society. We must remember as well that only 10 per cent of all 
crime is violent and that over 53 per cent of all crime involves 
property, not people. Therefore, this bill creates an environment 
which encourages community sanctions and the rehabilitation 
of offenders together with reparation to victims and promoting 
in criminals a sense of accountability for what they have done.
<P>
	It is not simply by being more harsh that we will achieve more 
effective criminal justice. We must use our scarce resources 
wisely. It seems to me that Bill C-41 strikes that balance and I 
commend it to this Chamber for its consideration.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert):</B> Mr. Speaker, before 
stating my position on Bill C-41, I would like to point out both 
in my own name and on behalf of all voters in the sovereigntist 
federal riding of Saint-Hubert the resounding victory of the 
Parti Quebecois in the elections. The party was voted in with a 
much higher  global percentage of votes than the one allowing 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5874"> 5874 </A></B>
<P>
the Prime Minister of Canada to claim to be governing on behalf 
of all Canadians in Ottawa.
<P>
	I speak as a sovereigntist member of Parliament and, whether 
we debate Bill C-41 or any other issue, the laws of this country 
entitle me to do so as a member of the Official Opposition in 
accordance with the mandate I was given by nearly 60 per cent 
of the voters in the federal riding of Saint-Hubert. I did not hide 
my stance. Must all those who strive to disprove the logic and 
legitimacy of our position be straightened out at the beginning 
of this new session? My sovereigntist beliefs do not interfere 
with displaying all the judgement and competence required to 
carry out my duties as Official Opposition critic for matters 
under the jurisdiction of the justice minister.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	To those who, contrary to all rules of democracy, dispute our 
right to sit in this Parliament as the Official Opposition, I say 
this: my voice and that of my 52 colleagues joins the chorus of 
the 77 sovereigntist members elected in Quebec. Sovereigntists 
now account for about 70 per cent of the total deputation in both 
Quebec City and Ottawa.
<P>
	May those who dispute our legitimacy and continue to doubt 
that our constituents voted for our program stifle their fantasies. 
The voters in Quebec like anywhere else in Canada vote 
according to their beliefs and with their heads, contrary to what 
the Prime Minister would have the rest of Canada believe.
<P>
	This Prime Minister, whose party barely managed to muster 
one third of the vote in Quebec and a little over 40 per cent in the 
rest of the country, has no qualms of conscience about claiming 
to have been elected by all of Canada, while in fact more than 
half of his caucus comes from Ontario, where 45 per cent of the 
vote ``from coast to coast'' was concentrated.
<P>
	I maintain that the legitimacy of the Parti Quebecois in 
Quebec and that of the Official Opposition in this Parliament is 
stronger than that of the federal Liberals. I would add that the 
Prime Minister would never have won the latest elections in 
Quebec and that Canadians should be aware of who speaks for 
Quebec from now on.
<P>
	In my analysis of Bill C-41, I speak for all the people of 
Quebec and the 60 per cent of voters from other provinces who 
did not vote for the Liberals. The Parti Quebecois is now in 
power in Quebec, with nearly two thirds of the seats in the 
Assembly. It was voted in with 53 per cent of the francophone 
vote and massive support from the community which says ``no'' 
to stupor and lethargy and refuses to be bogged down in the 
status quo.
<P>
	If the Prime Minister did not want to hear any more about the 
Quebec issue and if he thought that the pitiful attempts of Meech 
and Charlottetown would end the debate, he now realizes, after 
the September 12 election held in Quebec, that he was fooling 
himself as well as Canadians.
<P>
	Just as I am about to do regarding Bill C-41, the Bloc 
Quebecois will always fulfil its role of Official Opposition 
loyally in this Parliament. As long as Quebec remains an 
integral part of Canada and as long as Quebecers pay their share 
of taxes to the federal revenue minister, the Bloc Quebecois will 
play its opposition role and fulfil the mandate it was given by 
Quebecers on election night, October 25, 1993.
<P>
	I now open the debate on Bill C-41 as the official opposition 
critic on justice. I will never give up my responsibilities and my 
convictions in this House for the sole reason that my opinions on 
the future of this country differ from those of the Prime Minister 
of Canada and his regional caucus.
<P>
	It is with these principles in mind that I now turn my attention 
to Bill C-41. The Minister of Justice will be pleased to learn that 
I have no hesitation in saying that this legislation is a positive 
one, even though the minister did not make the full necessary 
reform to protect the rights of victims.
<P>
	I see that all of Part XXIII of the Criminal Code is amended to 
make way for new measures to deal with offenders through an 
appropriate reform of the sentencing process. Thus the bill 
introduces a measure similar to the procedure we find in the 
Young Offenders Act, to deal with suspects who admit their guilt 
by using alternatives to judicial proceedings. According to the 
bill, alternative measures designated under a provincial 
program may be substituted for the usual trial, conviction and 
sentencing proceedings.
<P>
	Our courts, especially our criminal courts, have a huge 
backlog of cases that never go to trial because they are 
constantly postponed. The courts are dealing with an 
ever-increasing number of criminal cases, mostly cases that 
should be tried on summary conviction.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	Visit the courts when they are in session, and you will get a 
good idea of the frustration felt by witnesses, victims, 
investigators and, in fact, all those who are faced with the 
inefficiencies of an outdated system that puts a heavy financial 
burden on governments and taxpayers.
<P>
	Our current criminal procedure requires the presence of the 
accused and witnesses at every stage of the trial, even in the case 
of a guilty plea.
<P>
	In most cases where there is so much evidence that a 
preliminary hearing is a waste of time and a trial an 
unnecessarily costly 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5875"> 5875 </A></B>
<P>
exercise for the government, although compulsory for the 
accused, the case could have been dealt with by administrative 
means.
<P>
	By proposing alternative judicial proceedings to deal with 
cases where suspects are prepared to co-operate, the minister 
has opened the way to some very interesting changes in criminal 
proceedings.
<P>
	If efficiency is the goal, I think that will be achieved. 
However, I can imagine how some people will react. They will 
say this is another case of criminals getting off scot-free and 
legislation that is more intent on encouraging crime with these 
ridiculous measures than on punishing criminal behaviour. I 
suppose some people might have that impression.
<P>
	I would be the first to say that the law should concentrate, first 
of all, on preventing and punishing crime. We must pass laws to 
protect society. That should be our only objective. The 
rehabilitation of offenders comes later, when society has all the 
instruments it needs to protect itself.
<P>
	That being said, I suggest that those who may tend to react 
hastily take a very careful look at this bill. In section 717(1)(<I>a</I>) 
they will see that provincial jurisdictions may designate the type 
of offences to which the legislation will not apply when they set 
up their program.
<P>
	In other words, provincial governments will be able to 
develop a program of alternative measures according to their 
perception of the priorities and views of the majority.
<P>
	I am very pleased to say that if this bill is passed, it would 
restore much of the initiative in this area to the provinces. It will 
give the provinces greater flexibility to implement these 
measures in line with the interests of the local community, as is 
the case for alternative measures programs under the Young 
Offenders Act.
<P>
	Is the Chair signalling?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> No, and I would point out that you have 
20 minutes left.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne:</B> So that might have been a nervous tic I noticed.
<P>
	In addition, this would allow the courts of each province to 
clear thousands of minor cases or summary proceedings through 
admissions of guilt, thus sparing the taxpayer enormous legal 
costs. This is a laudable attempt to reduce public expenditure 
and contribute to administrative efficiency and I congratulate 
the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	However, the bill seems to be trying to cover too many bases.
<P>
	In fact, in order to attain the stated objectives, it is not 
necessary to subject co-operative suspects to publicity not 
imposed on those electing to be tried in a court of law. Thus, for 
example, the police will always have a suspect's fingerprints 
and photograph on file. And this file will be open, with the 
appropriate authorization, to various parties, including 
insurance companies, government departments and agencies, 
the courts and the general public so that the interests of justice 
may be served.
<P>
	There is a large measure of naïveté here. We must ask 
ourselves what will motivate a suspect to co-operate with the 
police if his file can be accessed for two years by just about 
anybody and he is still subject to criminal proceedings, despite 
his desire to settle the matter once and for all through an 
alternative measure.
<P>
	It should be obvious to the Minister of Justice that those who 
drafted this bill have never seen a suspect in their life, or have 
never witnessed the plea bargaining that takes place on a large 
scale just outside our courts of law.
<P>
	For these alternative measures to be attractive and the 
program to work, the file must travel a private, administrative 
route, without publicity, eventually reaching the offices of the 
provincial ministers of justice, after all conditions have been 
faithfully met by the offender.
<P>
	It is wishful thinking to believe that a suspect will co-operate 
with the police for the pleasure of repenting twice and having a 
file that resembles that of a criminal who has already been 
sentenced.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	The bill also consolidates a number of sentencing principles 
which are, for the most part, laid down in our case law and 
applied by our courts across the country.
<P>
	The need for a codification of guiding principles regarding 
sentencing is obvious. Most of the applicable criteria and 
factors have become standard with time. They have been used 
and considered in criminal cases since the first Criminal Code of 
Canada was published. While the common law tradition gives 
preference to case law over written law, it may be a good idea to 
set some general guidelines to be followed by the courts in their 
consideration of the circumstances of each case. The criteria 
proposed in the bill, including the statement of principles, are 
not restrictive but cover a range of actions wide enough to apply 
to most cases.
<P>
	There is nothing very novel about this. I would point out 
however that in the part dealing with the purpose and principles 
of sentencing, the bill very vaguely refers to the maintenance of 
a just, peaceful and safe society. I do hope that these words make 
sense to the people of Canada and that they will mean something 
to the courts because, as far as I am concerned, they simply 
reflect good intentions that the legislative background of the 
Liberals does not uphold. I would be inclined to believe that 
such principles could even lay the foundations for political 
courts. It all depends on what partisan view the power takes on a 
``just, peaceful and safe society''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5876"> 5876 </A></B>
<P>
	Was it not just, peaceful and safe in the eyes of the Nazis to 
exterminate the Jews? What kind of just society do we have in 
mind now in terms of sentencing? That of the 60s? Is it through 
sentencing that we achieve just society status? Does the 
Minister of Justice leave it up to his predecessors, the illustrious 
instigators of Canadian liberalism, these great humanists who in 
1970 had no other means to create their just society but mass 
imprisonment under the War Measures Act?
<P>
	It all depends on one's perception of what constitutes a just 
society. From this flows the question: can a just society be 
achieved through sentencing?
<P>
	This is the kind of wording you come up with when you do not 
have a clue what to do to look good in an enactment. Everyone is 
for virtue and against evil; everyone wants a just society. I 
simply wonder about this need for preserving a just society 
through sentencing in the country best liked in the world by its 
citizens.
<P>
	This is hardly surprising on the part of the Liberals, always 
inspired by the model of generosity that was the former boss of 
the present Prime Minister, himself closely connected to the 
decision center in 1970. But this unfortunate legislative slip that 
the Liberals themselves must be embarrassed about must not 
prevent us from recognizing that this bill also contains 
innovative ideas that should be favourably considered.
<P>
	For example, the principle of mitigating or aggravating 
circumstances is introduced in positive sentencing law. 
Aggravating circumstances include all aspects of an offence 
which reflect bias, prejudice, breach of trust and abuse of power.
<P>
	Let us take for example the therapists recently convicted of 
sexually abusing their female patients. These professionals who 
were then in a position of authority abused their patients' trust. I 
would have liked a better French translation for the expression 
``position of trust'' found in the English version but I imagine 
the courts will take this into account.
<P>
	Offences committed within a therapist-patient relationship 
would come under this provision and the courts would be 
authorized by law to impose sentences more in keeping with this 
type of offence.
<P>
	Finally, again with respect to the purpose and principles of 
sentencing, it is deplorable that the bill tries to sneak through the 
back door the concept of a parallel system of justice for 
Aboriginals. It is so well hidden that it is almost necessary to 
read Clause 718.2(<I>e</I>) twice to discover this enormity hidden 
under nine sneaky words, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>718.2 A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the 
following principles:</BLOCKQUOTE>
We have (<I>a</I>), (<I>b</I>), (<I>c</I>), (<I>d</I>) and
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>e</I>) all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the 
circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the 
circumstances of aboriginal offenders.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	The French text fails, unintentionally no doubt, to point out 
like the English text that the said sanctions would exclude 
imprisonment.
<P>
	Why should Aboriginals, who make up less than 2 per cent of 
Canada's total population, benefit from a legal system different 
from that which applies to all other Canadians? Why should an 
Aboriginal convicted of murder, rape, assault or of uttering 
threats not be liable to imprisonment like any other citizen of 
this country? Can we replace all this with a parallel justice, an 
ethnic justice, a cultural justice? Where would it stop? Where 
does this horror come from?
<P>
	Why should Aboriginals, who are adamantly opposed to the 
distinctiveness of Quebec society-which is still subject to all 
Canadians laws without exception-, who claim full Canadian 
citizenship, who take full advantage of the generosity of our 
welfare state and who enjoy tax exemptions and benefits, be 
treated differently from other Canadians when they commit 
crimes? If such is to be the case, I ask that all criminal laws 
applicable to the Quebec nation be transferred to the exclusive 
jurisdiction of Quebec's National Assembly.
<P>
	Other aspects of this bill deserve special attention. Not 
because it proposes reforms but because these reforms are 
incomplete, when we had an opportunity to correct some clearly 
unacceptable shortcomings of our criminal justice system.
<P>
	The government seems concerned about the fate of victims in 
criminal trials. It seems to care, but its intentions are expressed 
so timidly that we cannot take them seriously. Indeed, the bill 
adds nothing that could reassure Canadian society that this 
government wants to protect victims.
<P>
	I agree with all those who tell you that it is time to forget about 
the fate of unfortunate criminals and think of the victims, it is 
time to punish crime and compensate the victim, it is time to 
silence the criminal and listen to the victim. This talk about 
rehabilitation puts us to sleep or revolts us when we see that 
victims are obviously pawns in criminal proceedings, mere 
witnesses tossed about as the court case drags on and called at 
the whim of the Crown's lawyers.
<P>
	We must finally see that the victim is the key person in the 
criminal trial when the crime involved a violation of the person 
or his property. The victim is the one who was assaulted or lost 
property, so the criminal's sentence should depend on the 
victim. The victim should be what drives the criminal justice 
system and gives society the opportunity to impose just sentences on criminals in order to prevent them and their kind from 
making more victims.
<P>
	Countless pressure groups in all provinces denounce 
lawmakers for their laxity in treating victims of crime. It is time 
to think of the victims of crime.
<P>
	Despite the public outcry, the calls for redress and the 
continuous pleading from these thousands of women, men and 
children who are victims of horrible acts, what does the bill give 
us on this score? A timid concession made very 
condescendingly, probably in the name of archaic common-law 
principles. That is why a victim's written statement on the 
damages suffered can be read during sentencing. If the public 
prosecutor wants to consider the loss or damage incurred, he can 
ask the judge to impose a financial penalty that would have the 
effect of a judgement rendered by a civil court.
<P>
	All the groups dedicated to the protection and support of 
victims, mainly women, will tell you that such measures are 
quite simply insignificant and insultingly inadequate. They are 
insignificant in that they are trifling and ridiculous because they 
will have no real effect on the outcome of the trial and the 
judge's decision. What should be done, and I ask the House to 
set partisanship aside, is more radical.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	That the victim has the right to examine the accused and the 
witness; that the victim may object to the admission of evidence 
and has the same right to contest the evidence as the prosecution 
and the defence; that the victim may make representations on 
sentencing and, if necessary, appeal the verdict and the 
sentence.
<P>
	I may refer to the French penal system where the victim may 
take part in the proceedings. We see this in cases involving 
non-political crimes, and we saw this at the trial of the Nazi 
criminal Barbie for crimes against humanity, where survivors 
and parents of victims who had died took an active part in the 
trial.
<P>
	Under this system, the victim is able to play an effective and 
active role in the proceedings. I am convinced that when the 
victim is able to take part in the proceedings on the same terms 
as the Crown and the  accused, instead of being a mere witness, 
at the mercy of parties who do not share the victim's 
involvement, the outcome will not be the same.
<P>
	I am not saying that the trial is all about the victim. It is not. I 
have no intention of introducing a concept in our criminal law 
that would be entirely alien. I am simply saying that the victim is 
one of the parties concerned, on the same terms as the Crown 
and the accused. There is no rule of law that justifies excluding 
the victim, and we cannot afford to do so if we are to rehabilitate 
the victim's status in a judicial system that still lets many 
criminals escape or diminish its authority; a system that most 
Canadians see as a sinister farce in which criminals and their 
lawyers ``get away with murder''.
<P>
	I know that is not true and that the vast majority of offenders 
are found guilty or plead guilty. I do not deny that, but I have a 
problem with the way criminals are treated by the system.
<P>
	What is the use of finding a rapist guilty of rape if he only gets 
six months? I find that outrageous, Mr. Speaker. Let the victim 
take part in the proceedings and, mark my words, there will be 
some major changes.
<P>
	I will conclude on this note, Mr. Speaker, and I want to say 
that I am pleased nevertheless with this very prudent attempt 
which I see as a sign of progress, considering this government's 
generally conservative approach to criminal law and criminal 
proceedings.
<P>
	I would have liked to take this opportunity to say that 
personally, the whole field of criminal law should be turned over 
as soon as possible to the provincial legislatures, but I will have 
plenty of opportunities in the course of this session. The usual 
unavoidable overlap between bureaucracies will provide a 
splendid excuse.
<P>
	I also want to say that the Minister of Justice can count on my 
full co-operation in preparing legislation that would change the 
status of the victim in criminal proceedings. It is a matter of 
great concern to me, and I believe we urgently need to address 
these issues. I would ask all groups and individuals who share 
my concern to get in touch with me.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there comes a time in the affairs of a nation when the 
opportunity is at hand to change the course of events. Most often 
at that particular moment, little notice is given and the 
significance of the missed opportunity arises only in retrospect 
when we search for the cause or the seeds of some disaster. Such 
may be the situation before us today with Bill C-41.
<P>
	We have in this bill many technical amendments to the 
Criminal Code which the public may not deem as momentous or 
strategic. It will be interesting to see if the press gives this bill 
much more than a day's worth of print. This is a sad and 
disheartening situation. In many respects the Canadian Criminal 
Code is a national document, is a particularly Canadian creation 
and has  been one of the things that has bound us together as a 
nation. How we as a society write down the limits of personal 
conduct and define our sense of national morals reflects the 
basic character of what it means to be a Canadian. The written 
code gives substance to the national sense of community.
<P>
	In the Criminal Code we are dealing with life and death, with 
the very tools of peace, order and good government. In a most 
basic way it is an aspect of how we as Canadians describe 
ourselves, who we are. We are not American or European but 
distinctly Canadian in our interrelationships with one another in 
our local communities.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5878"> 5878 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	The Criminal Code is a statement of how we as a national 
community attempt to protect our society. The Criminal Code by 
reflection describes what Canadians hold dear and value. It can 
also reveal the limits of our ability to govern ourselves through 
our institutions. Unlike the United States and most of the less 
viable principalities of the third world, our Constitution does 
not include a lofty statement of transcendent national principles. 
Nor do we have a charter mythology.
<P>
	We are very permissive in allowing our fellow citizens, 
provincial governments and business establishments, to fly the 
flags they prefer for allegiance or anticipated commercial 
advantage. We have disloyal parliamentarians in the Chamber 
who have given up on Canada and who are working to have the 
representative voice of their great province no longer heard 
from these desks.
<P>
	July 1 is our Canada Day but some Canadians get more 
emotional satisfaction out of celebrating St. Jean Baptiste, 
Christopher Columbus or Robert Burns. No doubt for a few here 
and there it would be Queen Victoria or even Joey Smallwood. 
When a most gracious and forbearing lady visits one of the 
countries under whose constitution she continues to be the head 
of state, she is met by most Canadians with respect and 
adulation, some with indifference and a few with discourtesy.
<P>
	If nationhood is sharing and Canadians seem to share few 
common sentiments, what are the bonds of Canadian 
association? It is meaningless to say we share a common 
territory, that citizens of Windsor share a common territory with 
their fellow citizens of Halifax or Yellowknife but not with their 
neighbours in Detroit, only because of the way the national 
boundaries are drawn. It is not very helpful to say that Canadians 
share a common citizenship without some account of the 
obligations and the privileges of that citizenship.
<P>
	There is perhaps an alternative definition of nationhood. A 
national community is based on a sharing of claims both 
individual and collective. These claims are made against 
individual citizens, private groups and public authorities both 
within the nation and outside the nation. These claims are 
honoured by a structure of political relationships that 
acknowledges no superior authority. In the idea of shared claims 
and responsibilities  we find the reality of Canadian nationhood 
in such places as the Statutes of Canada and the Public Accounts 
of the Government of Canada. Here are some things Canadians 
share.
<P>
	The first is a national Criminal Code and rules of criminal 
procedure. In these are embodied some of the most important 
mutual claims of citizens and the Canadian community. 
Canadians share a common system of penitentiaries for the 
incarceration of those guilty of the graver offences against these 
laws.
<P>
	Second, we have a national commitment to the Canadian 
social safety net to be implemented through joint action of the 
federal, provincial and local authorities. The most important 
elements are the various programs of income maintenance and 
the removal of financial barriers between citizens and their 
access to medical, hospital and educational services.
<P>
	Canadians can move freely throughout the nation without 
thereby suffering a termination of health or income security 
benefits. Yet within these national characters Quebec has been 
permitted the freedom to go its own uncoordinated way and 
create duplication in medicare, unemployment insurance and 
immigration.
<P>
	As Canadians we are proud we have a national commitment to 
the alleviation of regional economic disparities and to 
interprovincial fiscal equalization. We have had a national 
commitment to the support of the arts, letters and sciences, 
along with other creative activities in broadcasting, film 
making, et cetera. We have a commitment as a nation that 
wherever practical Canadians will have access to the 
Government of Canada and its departments and agencies in the 
official language the citizen chooses.
<P>
	Through trade and tariff policies and national taxes we have a 
national assertion that Canadian capacity to produce can be 
shared on a nationwide basis. This list is by no means 
exhaustive. Other items might be added in terms of 
environmental policy, public legal aid, equality before and 
under the Canadian law, foreign ownership rules, the extension 
of broadcasting services to remote uneconomic areas and a 
national approach to international competition in sport.
<P>
	Only in terms of national community is it possible to explain 
or defend the magnitude of the budget of Indian affairs 
compared to the absence of Canadian assistance to other 
traditional peoples undergoing the strains of modernization 
elsewhere in the world. Only national community justifies 
Ottawa's help for Newfoundland fishermen and its lack of help 
for the people in similar circumstances living in nearby St. 
Pierre and Miquelon.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-41 is certainly a measure of the view of the 
government about what it thinks is going on in our Canadian 
society and community. Amendments to the Criminal Code can 
be a measure of the government's sense of the need to move, to 
change or to alter the status quo. The bill represents the status 
quo, business as usual  and perhaps maybe even a cynical view 
of Canada. It sends the message that the best we can do is a little 
maintenance and housekeeping, and that a sense of vision of a 
new and better Canada is not worth seeking. More likely the 
vision of a new Canada is not within the capability of the 
government.
<P>
	The sense of urgency I hear from constituents about the grave 
need of government to mind the store, to take care of the 
business of the people and to reform the justice system is a 
theme that comes from every region of Canada. Like so many 
other things for which the government has lost the sense of 
proportion, the lack of fundamental inspiration to govern 
responsively is clearly evident in this timid housekeeping bill. It 
seems that the times have passed by the government. My 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5879"> 5879 </A></B>
<P>
colleagues across the floor do not seem to have heard the cry 
from Canadians concerning law and order.
<P>
	My Reform colleagues represent, therefore, a new wave of 
change. In Bill C-41 we can see the comparison that the 
government is stuck in the past. The bill is clear evidence that 
the old line parties which embody the old line attitudes and ways 
of thinking do not adequately address community expectations 
of today.
<P>
	From this side of the House we have been calling upon the 
government to wake up. We call it to action to deal with the 
needless tragedy we are facing from debt and deficit, to rethink 
the responsiveness of our democratic institutions, and most 
especially to address law and order reform.
<P>
	I am here to tell the government benches that the justice 
system is not sound. The justice system needs more than 
tinkering from a Bill C-41. There are few, save those within the 
professional criminal justice community, that have any respect 
or even basic tolerance of how the government minds the store 
concerning crime. They know the justice system does not work 
sufficiently well.
<P>
	It is from within this context that Bill C-41 and Bill C-42 
come to the floor of the House of Commons. It certainly is a 
measure of where the government is at. I do not need to get into 
name calling for evidence of inadequacy and the lack of vision is 
on the table for the nation to see. Bill C-41 will do little to 
respond sufficiently to what the community wants and needs. 
Here we have a piece of legislation that is interesting in parts, 
irritating in others, but utterly fails to respond to what the 
country is asking for in terms of reforming the criminal justice 
system.
<P>
	The government desperately needs to get the machinery of the 
justice system moving to respond to community needs. I have 
heard the pleas of my constituents and have responded by stating 
them clearly in the House. The time has come for the 
government to listen to all Canadians.
<P>
	At some point one must draw a line in the sand, draw attention 
to a bill and then the attitude it represents, the magnitude of the 
inadequacy, the missed opportunity and  the disappointment of 
the community when comparing results with promises. The bill 
is such a disappointment.
<P>
	As Canadians begin to understand that in bill after bill the 
same pattern emerges, that there is no vision or comprehension 
of what the community wants, they will likely elect Reformers 
in sufficient numbers to govern. The nation then can get on with 
real law reform and build a criminal code that would probably be 
half as long but clear and resolute, understandable and, above 
all, would operate in a manner that represents mainstream 
Canadian values.
<P>
	The change that my election to the House represents is a new 
type of change. Reformers represent not business as usual, 
incremental change as reflected in Bill C-41, but discontinuous 
change that is not part of old patterns. The courage to make bold 
changes is sometimes confusing and disturbing, particularly to 
those in power and to those who are being left behind like the 
authors of the bill.
<P>
	It is sometimes small, fundamental changes that can make the 
biggest difference to our lives. Even if it goes unnoticed at the 
time it is the changes in the way we view our relationship to our 
constituents that make the biggest difference in the way we 
legislate. If we can change the justice system, this nationally 
shared structure, we can demonstrate that in all areas we can 
build a Canada where all its citizens will want in for the 
goodness we share rather than want out to keep for themselves 
what serves their own purpose.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	The discontinuous change I am talking about, the vision of a 
new Canada, may require upside down thinking different from 
the old patterns even if the bold changes appear not 
understandable or discordant at first sight.
<P>
	Certainly the self-described Quebec militants on this side of 
the House have a quest that has outlived its usefulness. Their 
aspirations longed for in view of the problems we all face cannot 
be fulfilled by the passé dreaming of the militants for a former 
age. No longer can they squarely respond to the problems in a 
world of new international realities. We are all in the same boat. 
Indeed the ship of state is leaking and the tired ideology of the 
current government can only think of patching a little here and 
there as evidenced by the inadequacy of Bill C-41.
<P>
	There is a leaner ship to be built of a new order of technology 
and thinking. For the militants to use a lifeboat to try to separate 
from the old ship will only bring them to a situation of drifting 
through rough seas in a small boat with no protection or capacity 
to ride the storm waves of international change. It will not 
accomplish the results they seek.
<P>
	There is too much crime in Canada. We want safer streets. We 
want community mechanisms to break the cycle of violence. 
The Criminal Code sets the standards  and the boundaries; our 
community institutions must fill the need.
<P>
	Change begins with the recognition that a problem exists. In 
Canada everyone knows we have a crime problem that is at 
unacceptable levels. Our justice system is operated apart from 
the community. It is time the justice system accounts for its 
results and what it has done on a delegated basis on behalf of the 
community.
<P>
	Who owns the justice system anyway in the long run? Crime, 
and society's response to it, is a big industry. A lot of precious 
community resources are spent on its seemingly unaccountable 
operations. The way it operates Canadians could believe that it 
is the insiders in the criminal justice community that run things 
for themselves.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5880"> 5880 </A></B>
<P>
	We need an interrelated sequence of process in the 
administration of criminal justice that is simple and cost 
effective. There must be consistency in philosophy from the 
moment an offender has the first contact with the police to the 
time of final discharge. The new thinking required hopefully 
will bring a general policy which woven into the entire system 
would guide the various services with a uniform theme.
<P>
	The community intuitively knows a coherent philosophy to 
integrate the various stages of administration of criminal justice 
does not exist. The system as a whole is more like subsystems 
within which pragmatic guidelines have been developed to 
enable the professionals involved to fulfil their occupational 
roles as they perceive them. This situation must change.
<P>
	For example, what frustrates an outrageous public opinion is 
justice delayed. It is offenders roaming the community 
unaccountable. It is sentencing that does not reflect mainstream 
community values. It is the misplaced priorities of an offender 
focused system. It is a system that by its poor account of itself 
fails to earn the confidence and support of the community it is 
supposed to serve.
<P>
	Specifically in the bill we have heard the government side 
describe the efficacious substance of Bill C-41. It is a reworking 
of Bill C-90 from the last Parliament. I like some things in the 
bill as it codifies what we have been doing in British Columbia 
for years, specifically alternative measures in the adult system 
akin to the provisions of the Young Offenders Act. In B.C. the 
crown simply exercises its prerogative to refer files to the B.C. 
corrections branch where probation officers will explore 
alternatives to court and arrange dispute settlement 
arrangements. We have even had some private contracts for 
offender-victim reconciliation projects.
<P>
	The form of the law is now following the function of the law. 
However, what the government gives with one hand in 
modernization in this section, it takes away with the other by 
denying victims assistance in establishing responsibility in civil 
proceedings. Disclosure of records of diversions can be made to 
insurance companies but cannot be used to establish liability in 
civil proceedings.  A nice double standard. The records of the 
alternative measures cannot be used in evidence in subsequent 
offences after two years. This is unacceptable.
<P>
	Specifically section 718.2 goes in the right direction by 
outlining sentencing principles but the aggravating 
circumstances section is incredible to say the least.
<P>
	A vicious assault based on hate criteria is to be dealt with 
more harshly than an equally violent assault that was done for 
money or just for kicks.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	In this section interestingly the grounds listed are the same as 
in the charter of rights except this bill has added sexual 
orientation.
<P>
	Section 718.2 goes in the right direction in part (b) by saying 
that a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on 
similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar 
circumstances.
<P>
	This notion has always been an operative principle of 
argument at the sentencing stage of the court process. However, 
with our tremendous capacity to quantify statistics with 
computers we have the ability to produce a comprehensive 
sentencing grid of what currently is happening across the nation 
in sentencing. A rational sentencing grid that plots the hierarchy 
of offences with their prevailing tariffs against the culpability 
and history of the offender could go a long way in responding to 
the inequities of sentencing and the lack of public confidence in 
the system.
<P>
	If there are no benchmarks to compare the principles of 
specific deterrence to the individual and general deterrence to 
the community it fails to operate very well. In producing a 
national sentencing grid document the community could then 
deal with appropriate retribution as distinct from revenge.
<P>
	Retribution is based on the principle that the punishment 
should fit the crime and be properly meted out and controlled by 
the state. Revenge on the other hand is characterized by 
lawlessness and its excesses.
<P>
	The government had an opportunity here to be bold in this 
respect and it has failed. This bill outlines old principles but 
then fails to provide the tools to accomplish them. Then to top it 
off the very next section in part (c) reads, and pay attention now 
because I know my community will chortle at this one: ``Where 
consecutive sentences are imposed the combined sentence 
should not be unduly long or harsh''. What is the sense of this 
type of language in the Criminal Code?
<P>
	While I am talking about basic sense I can hear the insult to 
aboriginals inherent and implied in section (e) of this part: ``All 
available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable 
in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders with 
particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal 
offenders''. Here we go with paternalism again.
<P>
	Further in this section it is time that a sentence including a 
fine, some jail and probation be possible rather than just two of 
the three. Again this bill fails to modernize and provide latitude 
for innovation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5881"> 5881 </A></B>
<P>
	It is heartening to see that in the last few years because of 
community agitation the victim is gradually being written into 
the statutes as having standing in law and a valid interest and 
stake in criminal proceedings. Nevertheless the wording of 722 
prescribing what is permissible in victim impact statements is 
far too narrow.
<P>
	Nowhere is the relationship of the victim to the offender 
allowed to be described. Neither are the views of the victim 
concerning appropriate consequences allowed to be heard. This 
paternalistic controlling view over victims at court is out of date 
and not worthy of this well intentioned but inadequate bill.
<P>
	In section 722.1 a similar controlling attitude is reflected in 
the letter of the law where the clerk of the court shall provide a 
copy of a document after filing. At the behest and convenience 
of the author presentence reports and psychological evaluations 
should optionally be made available directly to the offender or 
counsel and the prosecutor. There is no need for the clerk to 
control or have complete ownership of the transmittal of 
documents. Here is another case where the law should follow 
function and practice but it does not.
<P>
	In section 724(e) proof beyond reasonable doubt is 
unreasonably harsh for the crown to refer to any previous 
conviction by the offender. In the same vein section 727 is 
completely archaic and unnecessary as it does not accomplish 
any tangible objective.
<P>
	It is an anachronism to have special procedure requiring the 
crown to give special notice that a greater punishment would be 
sought because a criminal is a repeat offender. There should be 
no such item in the code.
<P>
	Section 732.1 is irritating in sub (3)(g) where an offender's 
permission is needed for the judge to be able to sentence them to 
a treatment program when offenders have specific problems 
such as substance abuse or sexual problems.
<P>
	Sentencing is given to an offender in court on behalf of the 
community. There is not a community meeting to explore 
palatable choices to the likes of the offender. Here we have 
1960s thinking again that invokes all the arguments about the 
utility of court ordered treatment.
<P>
<B>(1305 ) </B>
<P>
	We are long past this mentality with the vast experience of 
dealing with sexual offenders. I suppose the justice minister's 
advisers hang on to their old fashioned notions about criminals. 
The outdated principle is repeated again in section 747.3 
concerning hospital orders.
<P>
	Certainly a probation order should be able to be extended 
beyond three years for special cases. Under section 732.2(1) an 
offender can be called back to court by the initiative of the 
probation officer. The section allows the offender and the 
prosecutor to be heard in such circumstances, but what about the 
probation officer who initiated the proceedings in the first 
place?
<P>
	When an offender is messing up or revealing new or 
previously undisclosed problems new, more onerous conditions 
should be allowed to be added to an order. This only makes sense 
but the law prohibits common sense response.
<P>
	Additionally when a probationer violates the order of the 
court section 733(1) should involve a reverse onus provision for 
the offender to show cause why a sanction should not be applied 
for breach of the sentence and make the section parallel to 
section 742.6(9) of the breach of the conditional sentence.
<P>
	Section 743 states: ``Everyone who is convicted of an 
indictable offence for which no punishment is specially 
provided is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five 
years''. Simply put, it should read 10 years.
<P>
	I now come to section 745.6. This section is so disturbing it 
alone brings the law into disrepute. This section allows first 
degree murderers to apply parole after serving only 15 years of 
their sentence. Private members' bills have been introduced to 
repeal this provision. There is little support from the community 
for this measure. I cannot emphasize enough how fast this 
procedure should be done away with.
<P>
	The minister is all too well aware of the national feeling on 
this clause, yet he persists. It is utterly incredible and an insult to 
Canadians.
<P>
	Section 750 spells out when holders of public office such as 
members of Parliament will be vacated for conviction. Five 
years in jail is a most lenient if not absurd standard. I suggest the 
mere conviction of an indictable offence should be sufficient.
<P>
	Section 751.1 outlines the civil option to recover costs for 
defamatory libel. Of course unless the personal bankruptcy 
provisions are also changed in other statutes this provision is 
meaningless as it is for civil court judgments arising from 
deliberate and malicious harm.
<P>
	This bill really does nothing to address bringing greater 
certitude to the criminal sentencing process. Despite the 
codifying and writing down of the purpose and principles of 
sentencing judges will still have too wide a latitude in imposing 
inconsistent sentences. The aggravating factors section 
certainly flies in the face of the principle of equality before the 
law.
<P>
	How can we on this side of the House support this most 
disappointing bill? I call on the government to bring in some 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5882"> 5882 </A></B>
<P>
amendments so we can speed the bill on its way. Let this bill 
reflect Canadian values and bring  forward Criminal Code 
amendments that are needed, rather than just tinkering with the 
system.
<P>
	A needed change for example is the category of sex offences 
that are just summary and not dual which removes these 
offences from the identification procedure. Street prostitution is 
dealt with by the issue of a street-side ticket, a consequence of 
the summary status of section 213.
<P>
	In this bill where is the ban on replica firearms and the needed 
amendments to section 85 of the criminal use of firearms? 
Where is the section on the public disclosure with respect to 
dangerous offenders and also the designation of such to be done 
at any time during a sentence, not just at the beginning? Where 
is the provision for the collection and analysis of DNA testing? I 
could go on.
<P>
	The picture is clear. This government is in no mood to give 
Canadians the legal climate desired because it is not predisposed 
to renew a system that we have inherited from its type of 
outdated thinking. Criminal justice in Canada is not particularly 
systematic. At the heart of the system is the necessary conflict 
between the competing value systems of crime control and due 
process.
<P>
	The administrative and legislative responsibility for its 
functioning is fragmented between different agencies 
responsible to different levels of government and in some cases 
between a number of private organizations and different levels 
of government. There will always be the task to balance 
individual rights and the general security of the community. I 
had hoped that Bill C-41 would have clarified what is 
paramount in this regard but it does not.
<P>
	The next step needed is to inculcate a sense of the 
interdependence of the criminal justice system with broader 
social and political processes which have an impact on every 
Canadian.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	The criminal justice system in turn is part of a larger whole, 
the social forces such as health care, education and welfare 
services which bear upon the quality of Canadian life.
<P>
	Those who have the disposition to resist the disintegration of 
the Canadian community from within or its absorption into the 
maw continentalism from without have for too long been on the 
defensive. We have been too slow in formulating the credentials 
of this glorious community, too bemused by academics who 
would rather define it out of existence, too preoccupied with the 
emotional, symbolic and cultural dimensions in nationhood.
<P>
	It remains that as far as the political order is concerned, there 
is only one Canadian question. How can the over 27 million 
people who live within our national boundaries establish and 
sustain governmental institutions which are at once humane, 
effective and responsive?
<P>
	The times now require a national community to be held 
together by a national government of a first class, triple-A 
rating; one that is approachable, accountable and most of all 
affordable. The bonds that we do have, the national values and 
national commitments of this country, are concretely embodied 
in particular measures for honouring the mutual claims and 
responsibilities of citizens and governments for each other.
<P>
	If the present claims and ties can be sustained and new 
definitions agreed upon such as a renewed justice system, 
Canadian nationhood may need nothing more to reflect the 
greatness of the human spirit working together in common 
enterprise.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my 
privilege and honour to rise in this House to speak to Bill C-41, 
an act to amend the Criminal Code, sentencing and other acts in 
consequence thereof.
<P>
	Legislation regarding criminal justice reform has always been 
of great importance to me. The legislation before us today on 
sentencing reform is no exception to that rule. As stated in our 
red book, this government has committed itself to introducing a 
broad range of crime and justice initiatives to reserve Canada's 
growing crime and violence rates.
<P>
	People across this country have said that they want significant 
changes to the criminal justice system. Thankfully this 
government, through the work of my hon. colleague, the 
Minister of Justice and the Attorney General, has not only taken 
the time to listen to the people but we are doing something about 
it.
<P>
	So far this government has introduced legislation in several 
key areas of criminal justice such as the recent amendments to 
the Young Offenders Act, amendments to the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act and amendments to the Immigration 
Act. These initiatives are reflective of a balanced, fair and 
reasoned approach to the changing and challenging times and of 
course our criminal justice system.
<P>
	Bill C-41 marks yet another important step in the delicate 
process of criminal justice reform. As the minister has 
indicated, the proposed legislation contains a number of key 
provisions including a statement of purpose and principles, 
measures to strengthen the level of fairness in our system of 
fines, greater penalties on offenders who have breached their 
probation, the introduction of conditional sentences, 
clarification of rules of evidence and procedures for sentencing 
hearings, as well as amendments to part 23 of the Criminal Code 
in order to create a more coherent and understandable method of 
documenting provisions related to the sentencing process.
<P>
	Perhaps the most significant provisions of Bill C-41 are those 
related to enhancing the rights of victims. In this regard the 
Minister of Justice has proposed what I believe to be 
unprecedented amendments to section 745 of the Criminal Code 
which 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5883"> 5883 </A></B>
<P>
deal with early parole hearings for persons sentenced to life in 
prison.
<P>
	During the last Parliament through my private member's bill, 
Bill C-330, I attempted to introduce similar changes that at the 
very least would allow victims of violence to present 
information during a judicial review or early parole hearing.
<P>
	Consequently I applaud the minister's intent to amend section 
745 of the Criminal Code in order to provide victims of violence 
with the opportunity to make a meaningful impact on the 
criminal justice system by presenting victim information when 
convicted criminals apply for early parole consideration. This 
measure will ensure that victims of violent crimes have the 
opportunity to speak out about the harm done by the offender. 
This means that the victim's experience will be taken into 
consideration when deciding whether the parole eligibility 
period should be reduced.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	This particular provision also has been advocated by various 
victims rights' organizations and advocacy groups such as the 
Canadian Police Association, which has publicly acknowledged 
the merits of the proposed amendments to section 745 of the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
	In fact, as I speak, right in downtown Hamilton in my riding of 
Hamilton West, the Canadian Police Association, the Centre for 
Victims of Crime and CAVEAT, an acronym for Canadians 
Against Violence Everywhere Advocating its Termination are 
concluding a three-day conference on various criminal justice 
issues including victim's rights and parole reform.
<P>
	Today representatives of the 150 or so conference delegates 
will be tabling further recommendations to the federal 
government that will help us continue along the challenging 
road of criminal justice reform.
<P>
	According to National Parole Board statistics there are over 
2,000 offenders serving life sentences in the Canadian 
correctional system. According to the National Parole Board, on 
average approximately 40 offenders per year will be eligible to 
apply for a judicial review over the next 15 years. At the 
beginning of this year there were 128 offenders eligible for a 
judicial review.
<P>
	The sheer volume of impending parole eligibility hearings 
which will take place in the immediate future necessitates swift 
action in the area of parole reform.
<P>
	Crown attorneys tell me they are not prepared to handle the 
workload that is about to come crashing down on them. That is 
why it is necessary to take swift action.
<P>
	Getting back to the statistics, as of March of this year, 42 
decisions were made on early parole applications by first degree 
murders. Of those 42 decisions, 32 parole eligibility reductions 
were granted. That means 76.2 per cent of the offenders who 
applied for early parole consideration had their parole eligibility 
period reduced.
<P>
	Many questions arise from this scenario. For example in each 
of these cases and in the first instance the accused must be 
convicted of his or her crime by a unanimous jury decision. Yet 
at the judicial review early parole consideration can be granted 
to that first degree murderer based on only a two-thirds decision 
of that jury at judicial review. Why?
<P>
	In my humble opinion the status quo is unacceptable. I look 
forward to addressing these and other equally compelling 
questions when Bill C-41 is referred to the Standing Committee 
on Justice and Legal Affairs.
<P>
	The government recognizes the shortcomings of section 745 
and is ready, willing and able to initiate the ongoing process of 
change.
<P>
	In closing I would like to encourage my hon. colleague, the 
Minister of Justice, to vigorously pursue his criminal justice 
reform agenda by continuing to weed out those inappropriate 
provisions such as section 745 of the Criminal Code in order to 
develop a balanced, fair and reasonable criminal justice system 
in this great country of ours. In doing so the government will 
fulfil its commitment to the people of Canada who have so 
passionately expressed the need for meaningful and progressive 
criminal justice reform.
<P>
	With the support and co-operation of the concerned members 
of the House, the challenging work going to be faced by 
members of the justice committee and indeed the concerned 
citizens throughout this nation I am sure we will be able to meet 
the challenges we face in the process of rejuvenating Canada's 
criminal justice system.
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
speak on Bill C-41 which is an amendment to the Criminal Code 
regarding sentencing.
<P>
	I want to focus specifically on what the hon. member had 
touched on in his speech, that is, section 745 of the Criminal 
Code. This bill leaves section 745 in the code which makes a 
mockery of the term life imprisonment.
<P>
	In 1976 the government abolished the death penalty and 
assured us that society would be protected by sentencing 
murderers to life imprisonment with no chance for parole for 25 
years. However Bill C-84 which was to accomplish this 
contained a little known clause which created section 745 of the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
	Section 745 nullifies the term life imprisonment and grants 
murderers the right to apply for parole eligibility after serving 
only 15 years of a life sentence. Section 745(1) of the Criminal 
Code reads: ``Where a person has served at least 15 years of his 
sentence he may apply to the appropriate Chief Justice in the 
province in which the conviction took place for a reduction in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5884"> 5884 </A></B>
<P>
his number of years of imprisonment without eligibility for 
parole''.
<P>
	This section makes a complete mockery of the so-called life 
sentence which was a trade-off for the elimination of capital 
punishment in our statutes.
<P>
	One parliamentarian in support of section 745 called it ``a 
glimmer of hope if some incentive is to be left when such a 
terrible penalty is imposed on the most serious of all criminals''. 
This parliamentarian reflects the typical, irresponsible, 
unaccountable, bleeding-heart mentality that underlines so 
much of the legislation passed in this House over the last 25 
years, including our parole system, our Young Offenders Act, 
our Immigration Act. The same mentality has created the federal 
debt of half a trillion dollars and produced a budget that will add 
$100 billion to that debt in the next three years.
<P>
	This irresponsible, unaccountable, bleeding-heart mentality 
has ignored the rights of the victims of crime, their families and 
society. This is the type of mentality that has betrayed our 
country. What murderer ever gave a victim a glimmer of hope 
when he or she viciously tore life from the victim?
<P>
	Did Norman Clairmont give the 19-year old Potts girl a 
glimmer of hope when he brutally and savagely murdered her in 
1978? No he did not. Did Larry Sheldon extend a glimmer of 
hope to the nine-year old girl he raped and murdered in 1974? 
No he did not. Did Charles Simard offer a glimmer of hope to the 
two teenagers he murdered in the province of Quebec? No he did 
not.
<P>
	Now these murderers are lining up to take advantage of a 
glimmer of hope they denied our sons and daughters, our 
brothers and sisters, a glimmer of hope provided by 
irresponsible politicians and governments.
<P>
	Murderers, rapists and vandals lose all their rights the 
moment they launch their deadly attack upon the life of another. 
In spite of this undeniable fact, we have watched the 
bleeding-heart politicians restore the rights of these criminals 
through legislation devoid of common sense, legislation like 
section 745 of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	In a judgment rendered on April 28, 1994, Judge Demetrick of 
the Alberta Provincial Court declared that portions of the 
definition of a firearm contained in section 84(1) of the Criminal 
Code is so convoluted as to be ``legal fiction'' and ``twice 
removed from reality''.
<P>
	How is it possible that the Government of Canada is 
producing legislation so convoluted that it is declared by our 
courts to be fictitious and twice removed from reality? The 
answer to this question is that the thinking that is producing this 
type of legislation has to be equally fictitious and twice removed 
from reality. It is the kind of thinking that comes from an ivory 
tower mentality, the kind of mentality that produced the Young 
Offenders Act, the Immigration Act, the national debt, this 
government's approach to gun control legislation. It is the kind 
of mentality that produced section 745 of the Criminal Code 
which returns rights to the murders of Canadian citizens.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	In March of this year the hon. member for York 
South-Weston introduced a private member's bill to get rid of 
section 745 of the Criminal Code which gives convicted killers 
the right to apply for early parole. I can tell the House that this 
member has a great deal of support from our party and I believe 
from Canadians all across Canada. We will watch to see how 
much support he has from his own governing party.
<P>
	We will see if the ivy tower mentality, the twice removed from 
reality mentality identified by Judge Demetrick still controls the 
agenda in the Liberal caucus. If it does, then the only alternative 
the people of Canada have is to wait until the next election and 
remove this government from power as decisively as they 
removed the Tories from office in the last election. I stand in 
opposition to this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
question for the hon. member.
<P>
	As I said in my earlier statement I too had a private member's 
bill and my question is to the hon. member who just spoke. 
Those irresponsible bleeding-heart politicians that the member 
referred to did help the courts to create the best country in the 
world according to the United Nations. It is not as though we are 
all going to hell in a handbasket on one bill.
<P>
	I would hope that the member opposite is not so opposed to 
this bill, as he stated at the end of his remarks, that he would not 
consider coming to the justice committee when it deals with Bill 
C-41 in order to give us his background, knowledge and 
expertise on section 745.
<P>
	It is very easy for anyone to stand up in this place and 
condemn. I used to do it myself four years ago from across the 
way to the government. I always took the opportunity, when 
given, to go before a committee to try to reason with the 
government on why it did not act, or attempt to team up with 
other members of Parliament who wanted change.
<P>
	I would hope that the member opposite will take the 
opportunity to make representations to the committee on justice 
in order to try to change the government's mind on section 745.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question. It is reasonable. As I have appeared before audiences 
all across certainly my constituency and other parts of Alberta I 
am quite prepared to appear before any committee or any 
assembly or any audience to put forward my concerns and my 
reasons for opposing section 745 of the Criminal Code.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5885"> 5885 </A></B>
<P>
	The premise on which my concern is based is that it was a 
betrayal of the people of Canada at the time capital punishment 
was being removed from the Criminal Code. We were promised 
that the substitution would provide the protection that society 
was looking for and that substitution was life imprisonment with 
a minimum penalty of 25 years.
<P>
	I have heard individuals, including open-line commentators, 
express outright disbelief when they heard about section 745 
and its implementation. Now these murders come forward and 
use it in order to gain early parole.
<P>
	My concern and my opposition is to the whole of the bill, of 
course. However with the time limit, I focused only on that one 
particular area and other members will focus on other areas of 
this bill.
<P>
	My specific concern is that section 745 should never have 
been implemented in the first place. It was a betrayal of the 
honest people who are prepared to give this whole idea of the 
removal of capital punishment from the Criminal Code an 
opportunity. That was based upon a life sentence with a 
minimum term of imprisonment for 25 years.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Judy Bethel (Edmonton East):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-41 
is a major step toward safer homes and safer streets. I am 
pleased to speak in support of it.
<P>
	This bill responds to many of the concerns about our justice 
system that I heard during the last election and that I continue to 
hear on the streets of Edmonton. It presents positive measures 
and practical common sense solutions, not rhetoric and 
sensationalism. Bill C-41 is effective action, not simplistic 
slogans, and that is what the people of Edmonton East voted for.
<P>
	Edmonton has established a strong record in crime 
prevention, reducing the crime rate by 25 per cent in the last five 
years while rates in other cities have increased. It has achieved 
that goal through community co-operation and community 
policing. Based on its experience Edmonton has been calling for 
changes in legislation to support local action.
<P>
	Today I would like to highlight a few of the specific measures 
of Bill C-41 that will be welcomed by the people in my city and 
other communities across the country.
<P>
	First there is a clear statement of principles as the basis for 
sentencing. People in Edmonton East get angry about what seem 
to be arbitrary sentences handed down by judges without 
explanation.
<P>
	How can one explain it when someone abuses a child, takes 
away the very foundation of her life and is back on the streets in 
a year or two with no change in behaviour? Edmonton East 
welcomes the provision requiring judges to take into 
consideration the misuse of a position of trust and authority as 
an aggravating circumstance.
<P>
	How can one explain it when a repeated offence by a john 
destroying the safety of a neighbourhood gets a mere $100 slap 
on the wrist, less than a traffic ticket these days? Communities 
in my riding will welcome the explicit requirement that judges 
take into account other aggravating circumstances.
<P>
	When a break-in leaves an elderly couple bleeding and dying 
and their house in shambles, the community understands the 
seriousness of the offence but the courts do not. We have been 
trying to make judges aware of the true costs of damage done by 
johns soliciting next to a neighbourhood school, an aggravating 
circumstance.
<P>
	When charges are laid against drug traffickers who use drug 
houses and destroy neighbourhoods, judges should be able to 
consider the considerable damage to the community. Hopefully 
the police will not need to go back time and time again and that 
will also save money spent on expensive policing efforts.
<P>
	The second is a greater voice for victims in the justice system. 
This bill responds to the public demand that victims have a 
greater role in several ways.
<P>
	First, victims and their families will be able to make 
representations to the court in early parole hearings. This is a 
welcome change. People who receive threatening letters from 
convicts and fear their release on parole will now have a voice in 
that decision-making process and decision makers will have 
more complete information on which to base their decisions.
<P>
	Second, restitution will now be a real option. Justice is not 
done when an elderly couple in our community loses most of 
their possessions in a vicious attack and at the end of the whole 
process they get nothing back. People are the victims of crime, 
not the state.
<P>
	Greater use of restitution was one of the recommendations of 
the Edmonton safer cities report. I am happy to see that its 
recommendation has been followed here.
<P>
	Experience with pilot projects has shown that offenders who 
understand the true impact of what they have done on another 
person are less likely to reoffend. For the first time Bill C-41 
puts some teeth into that basic truth by making restitution an 
integral part of sentencing.
<P>
	Third, Edmonton will welcome stronger rules for probation. 
Offences by people out on probation have eroded the public 
confidence in the justice system in my  riding. Yet probation is 
an important vehicle for the rehabilitation of young offenders. 
The provisions in this bill will go a long way to restore 
credibility of the probation system and by extension, the public 
confidence in the justice system.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5886"> 5886 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1335 ) </B>
<P>
	Community groups that have tried to provide opportunities 
for people on probation report that they need more support to 
make these programs successful. Better supervision will 
encourage communities to participate in programs designed to 
help offenders change their ways and find their place in the 
community again.
<P>
	Fourth, greater use of conditional sentences with clear 
penalties will be more effective than overcrowded jails. Canada 
has the second highest incarceration rate in the world next to the 
United States. One look south of the border is proof enough that 
high incarceration rates do not equal safe streets.
<P>
	My riding contains a number of correctional facilities, 
enough for people to know that jails do not change many people. 
In fact we see the evidence that jails are often schools for crime. 
Doing time can turn a minor offender into a professional 
criminal.
<P>
	For minor offences a conditional sentence with a severe 
penalty for breaking the conditions is a much better alternative. 
It will also allow us to spend our limited protection dollars on 
people who really need to be put away from society. The 
correctional service says it costs about $47,000 a year to keep 
someone in prison with little to show for it at the end.
<P>
	Finally, expansion of the alternative measures program will 
be welcome. Edmonton has a successful program for young 
people who are going to court for the first time, often for 
shoplifting. One of the recommendations of the safer cities 
report endorsed by city council is the expanded use of this 
program. Young people who have already had a brush with the 
law, perhaps in another place or on a reserve, would also benefit 
from a program that forces them to deal directly with the victim 
and understand the consequences of what they did. Bill C-41 
will allow that.
<P>
	I am happy that the federal government is responding to 
suggestions made by people who are close to the problem and 
who have put a lot of effort into identifying practical ways to 
deal with crime in our communities.
<P>
	In conclusion, Bill C-41 will have three positive results: 
better outcomes from our justice system; safer homes and 
streets; and better value for money spent on courts and 
corrections. That is what the people of Canada want for every 
community.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak to Bill C-41. Members have heard from our 
party why we feel so strongly about the government wimping 
out once again. However, we are getting used to that in this 
session of Parliament. There  are so many issues in Bill C-41 to 
talk about but the one I want to spend a particular amount of time 
on is victim impact statements.
<P>
	A case which comes to mind happened to Angela Richards, a 
young lady in my riding. I attended the verdict and the 
sentencing of Wayne Perkin, the individual who actually 
committed this horrendous crime. This individual had 
previously committed a sexual assault; he bound up a young 
lady and injected her with cocaine. He was subsequently 
sentenced and was then released by the parole board. Had he not 
been released, young Angela would still be alive today.
<P>
	However, it would not be appropriate for me to stand here and 
give some political rhetoric. I want to read to the House and to 
anybody listening a victim impact statement provided by 
Corinne Schaefer, the sister of Angela Richards. This victim 
impact statement probably says it all about what is wrong with 
our system in Canada today. I will sum up with comments about 
Bill C-41 that truly identify what the problems are and why this 
government is so very ineffective. This victim impact statement 
was given on June 30, 1994 in Vancouver:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Two years have just passed since learning of Angela's murder. It is extremely 
difficult to write down the impact of her death.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am confused about the value of this. A part of me feels this statement will 
have no bearing on whether or not an ``appropriate'' sentence will be handed 
down as I do not think there is any punishment great enough. I tend to think this 
may only be a therapeutic exercise for my benefit.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	Already it can be seen that Corinne's confidence in the 
system, as much as anybody else's in this country today, is lost.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The other part of me wants to scream and cry out to you in my anger and pain. 
I want this statement to really make a difference. I know this is my only chance 
to finally have some say in this matter. All those days in court were gruelling and 
particularly upsetting when defence presented false allegations about Angie. It 
is awful to go through such tragic and deeply personal accounts of her death and 
do nothing but sit and listen. Now the opportunity for this statement presents 
itself, yet I am told I cannot comment on sentencing, nor how much I hate the 
accused and wish him dead. So through my fury and rage I will do my best to put 
into words how just two years ago my carefree and wondrously happy life was 
shattered upon learning that my precious baby sister was murdered.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I love Angie very much, more than words can say. How can I make you 
understand how much I miss her when I am still denying her death? I do not 
want to believe this and though I know in my heart that it is true, my heart has 
yet to accept it. Angie was not only my sister. She was my friend. There were no 
secrets between us. She was funny and witty and bright and loving and mostly 
always happy. She was everything that the accused is not. And now she is dead.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I want so desperately to know and believe that she was truly struck ``out like a 
light'' before being so viciously stabbed but I will never know, no matter how 
many times I replay that night in my mind. How horrible for her. I cannot help 
but feel guilty at not being there to somehow save her.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>How did we lose such a beautiful and vital human being? She is gone from our life. 
Yet we are plagued with remembering her murder for the rest of our lives. A despicable 
excuse for a person, a criminal with such an extensive history, a parolee, a repeat </BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5887"> 5887 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>offender, someone I hope you will consider to be a dangerous offender, considering 
the current charge he is facing: 13 counts of sexual assault with a minor, and 
administering a noxious substance.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This kind of person the victim is describing is the kind of 
person the government is talking about getting parole after 15 
years.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It makes me sick to write his name. I wish him dead so I do not have to worry 
about when he appeals parole and the day he gets out, which could be in 15 years. 
Every day I fear for his next victim, my life and for his. I figure I will be barely 50 
years old and he will be out on the streets and I will still have it in me to kill him. 
Who can predict what the future holds? I wonder if I will ever be kind and caring 
again. I certainly will not be forgiving of this. I have become cynical, hard and 
very sarcastic. I am humiliated by the person I have become. I also tend to be 
paranoid. After all, who can you trust?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is a victim impact statement and is not made up by me. It 
is by someone who is affected by the laws this government is 
bringing into place.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Even my dreams are nightmares and often show Angie's body cut up and 
floating in water or in a dumpster. Once I dreamt that she was brought to the 
hospital and was going to make it. The reality hit once again upon waking.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For a while there I wished for my mom to die as I could see how much pain 
she was in. I cannot talk to mom about my sad feelings and how much I miss 
Angie because I hate to see her cry. She has cried so much I do not want her to 
see me cry because I do not want to upset her any more than she already is. It's 
crazy. Even though I need mom more now than ever I can't turn to her. I hate to 
see the pain on her face, how disoriented and scattered her thoughts have 
become, how tiny and frail she is to us all. It is disgusting and totally 
unforgivable. I am at a loss as to what life is all about.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The joy of my sons' births were diminished greatly by my grief. They have 
been cheated out of what would have been innumerable wonderful moments 
with their Auntie Angie. I wonder why I brought them into such a horrible 
world.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am just now forcing myself to get therapy as I've exhausted whatever 
coping mechanisms I had and I'm starting to want to hurt myself badly. I'm 
scared I'm going to do something stupid. My husband is at a loss as to helping 
me. At times I just want to run away from it all and not accept this. My grief 
counsellor has assured me that I'm not crazy (which is somewhat comforting.)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>My job as an RN in emergency is affected. I'm not able to show compassion 
for IV drug users, especially cocaine users.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	This is what the convicted was.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In fact, I don't want to acknowledge them. There are increasing numbers of 
stabbing victims presented to emergency and I cannot help but think of Angie 
and how her beautiful little body was torn after 12 vicious stabs. I'm currently 
forced to look at alternatives.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The number one rule about doing unto others as you'd have them do unto you was 
taught to us at a young age. Angela understood and lived this rule; and only good 
should have come  her way. I now realize that there are no guarantees to a happy, long 
life, especially within our faulty Canadian justice system.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I do hold the system responsible for her murder. I have learned a lot about the 
justice system and parole board. The foremost message I've received is that 
criminals seem to be rewarded, rather than punished.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Does that sound familiar?
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>How many more victims is it going to take before we stop tolerating this?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am now compelled to join other victims in the fight to improve and strengthen 
our legal system in hopes that tougher sentences and less cushy prison 
environments will deter increasingly violent criminal activities.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Corinne knows what she is talking about. One has to ask why 
the government still includes a golf course at Ferndale 
penitentiary and so on. Where is the government coming from?
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Believe me. I would much rather spend my precious free time with my family, 
than to have to fight to keep a murderer in jail for the rest of his life. He should 
never be paroled again.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Does that sound familiar?
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The fact that he served only two years of a six-year sentence for attacking 
Ms. Eastman in 1986 is a joke. How lucky she is to be alive today. Again, I say, 
had he served his full sentence, my Angie would be alive today.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Why hasn't anyone taken responsibility for slipping up? How could he have 
been paroled so early? Are parole board appointees not aware of how 
manipulative these offenders are? Do they not realize that these criminals have 
nothing better to do than plan and plot for parole?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The emotional, mental and physical costs far outweigh any monetary losses 
we have encountered. I am however attempting to have the Criminal Injuries 
Compensation Board repay my mother over $800 for therapy she needed and 
probably should have continued, but for worry of the cost.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I'm also angry that reward money was used to entice certain individuals to 
give information. It is unfortunate but money talks. That $30,000 should have 
been used for a bursary in Angie's name at her high school. She would have like 
that.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>My life has been tarnished forever. I am sorry for the people near and dear to 
me who put up with my broken spirit. All I know is this: I did make it through 
yesterday and am cautious about the future.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For the love of Angie, I write openly, honestly and beg that my statement will 
make a difference.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I can say to Corinne that her statement does make a 
difference. It has been read in the House of Commons for the 
government and all other people to listen to. However it is more 
than a victim impact statement. This is a statement from an 
average law-abiding Canadian citizen, hoping the government 
will finally clue in to the fact that legislation has to be a little 
stronger these days. We have to think of quotes like the one my 
colleague from Crowfoot referred to. It bears repeating. One 
parliamentarian in support of section 745 calls it ``a glimmer of 
hope if some incentive is to be left when such a terrible penalty 
is imposed on the most serious of all criminals''.

	Where is the glimmer of hope for Angela Richards? Where is 
the glimmer of hope for all victims out there? A victim is not 
only the person who died. The victims are the direct relatives 
and friends of people who have been killed and maimed in this 
life. Where is the glimmer of hope? Why is a glimmer of hope 
being offered to the people who do this sort of thing?
<P>
	The government had better clue in or the next time there is an 
election it will be sitting over here.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It has sat here before.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> It has sat here before and 
can do it again.
<P>
	Angela's murder is not the end; it is the beginning. I sincerely 
hope what I have said here today not be considered a speech. It is 
an impact statement from a victim at a sentencing hearing. 
Government members whether ministers, backbenchers or 
wherever they sit in the House, and all other members, should 
remember this statement. It needs to be heard. It needs to be 
listened to.
<P>
	I do not know what else can be said about the matter. We could 
critique each and every clause as some of our members so aptly 
have done, but we must remember that the life and property of 
the law-abiding Canadian citizen should always be paramount 
in the country. The government should get off the track of 
looking for benefits and for a better life for the criminal who has 
committed the offence.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jane Stewart (Brant):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for sharing Corinne's plea with us. I suggest to him that 
Bill C-41 speaks directly to her request to be heard. During the 
hearings for early parole the impact statements of victims will 
be included. That is a very important part and a very significant 
addition to our situation. I believe better decisions will be made 
on whether or not criminals will be paroled as a result of this 
change.
<P>
	I suggest that you have made an important comment. I do not 
believe our bill is a wimpy bill. It speaks directly to the cries of 
Corinne.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I ask all hon. members to put their 
remarks through the Chair. The word you is to be avoided unless 
it is directed to the Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know 
how to get government members to clue in to what is said in the 
House. I spoke to an immigration issue yesterday and it went 
over their heads.
<P>
	This victim impact statement was read at a sentence hearing. 
What the government is talking about doing is hearing her again 
after 15 years and hearing her again after 20 years. We are 
saying we should not have to hear Corinne Schaefer again; we 
have already heard her. The government should clue in. This 
person has committed the crimes he has been convicted of. He 
stabbed this young lady 12 times. Why is the government 
looking for another impact statement to let him out?
<P>
	We have to understand that this person should not be out. He 
should not attend parole board hearings. He should be left in 
prison. He should stay there. I do not want Corinne Schaefer to 
show up at another parole board hearing. Neither does her 
family. Neither does her mother.
<P>
<B>(1355 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State 
(Multiculturalism) (Status of Women)):</B> Mr. Speaker, at what 
point does the hon. member consider the parole board ought to 
relook at such an impact statement?
<P>
	The person has been condemned to a period of serving his 
sentence in prison. Shall he just be released without any 
forewarning, without anything? In terms of his sentence at what 
point should there be any consideration of the impact on the 
victims and when should they have a say?
<P>
	I would like to ask an even more fundamental question, not in 
terms of the individual but in general. What would you do with 
all the people who have committed crimes? Where do you intend 
to house them and how do you intend to run those prisons?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before calling on the member for 
Fraser Valley West I would ask the minister, as I just asked her 
colleagues, to address all remarks through the Chair.
<P>
	Having members speak through the Chair is designed to keep 
tension down. It is not because we need to have all comments 
directed at us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was talking 
about Wayne Perkins. I already said that he was let out on parole. 
He had bound a young lady, sexually assaulted her and injected 
her with cocaine. After he was let out he stabbed another young 
lady, Angela Richards, Corinne's sister, 12 times.
<P>
	I am not talking about letting this fellow out. They have it all 
wrong. I am talking about keeping him there and leaving him 
there. I am asked how long. I am saying to leave him there, 
period, to close the door. Enough people have suffered.
<P>
	In that courtroom 50 people were crying. All of them are 
affected, from her mother, Lorna, to her sister, her 
brother-in-law and so on. I am saying to leave him there. If he 
gets out we are into the same problem again. It was already tried 
it once and it failed.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Life means life.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Life means life. What part 
of that does the government not understand?
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="5889"> 5889 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> Mr. Speaker, let me direct a supplementary 
question to the hon. member. I understood when he said Life 
means life. That is all very well and good. He is well aware of 
the fact, as I think many of us are, that the statistics on the level 
of crime show crime has gone down but the number of crimes 
being reported has gone up.
<P>
	If we fill our prisons what are we to do? How does the member 
plan to keep our prison population in control?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am a lot less 
worried about accommodating prisoners than I am with letting 
them out.
<P>
	Let me repeat the quote. It will tell us the philosophy of where 
the government is coming from. It says we should provide a 
glimmer of hope if some incentive is to be left when such a 
terrible penalty is imposed on the most serious of all criminals.
<P>
	What is a terrible penalty? Why is life such a terrible penalty 
to a person who has bludgeoned a young lady who would have 
been a contributing member of society? Why is that such a 
terrible penalty? Keep him in, keep him in. That is the answer.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 
30(5) the House will now proceed to statements by members 
pursuant to Standing Order 31.

rise today to pay tribute to that segment of our society we

declared this year the International Year of the Family it is 
appropriate to recognize the importance of grandparents in the 
traditional family structure.
<P>
	In provinces throughout Canada the second Sunday in 
September in each year has already been set aside as a day on 
which we honour grandparents.
<P>
	I wish to extend my warmest wishes to all grandparents. We 
must not forget their importance to the structure of the family in 
the nurturing, upbringing and education of our children. 
Sometimes the greatest gift a child will receive will be the 
wisdom and experience offered by a grandparent.
<P>
	I am certain many of us here today have experienced the joys 
of sharing a day or a special moment with a grandparent.
<P>
	I urge the government to recognize the important role they 
play in society and set aside the second Sunday in September in

admitted again yesterday that the military college in Kingston is 
not at all ready to receive French-speaking soldiers and give 
them the training courses they need. According to him, the

that of the Saint-Jean college.
<P>
	The commissioner also noted that only 6,000 of the 13,000 
so-called bilingual positions in the Canadian Forces are held by 
people with a sufficient knowledge of French. Why are 
francophones always underrepresented? Why does the federal 
government insist on closing down the only French-language 
military college in the country? The Liberals are showing their 
true colours. The facts are there: the government refuses to 
make room for francophones.

	The Ukrainian-Canadian community which has its roots in 
Manitoba and the greater west had long dreamt of independence

<P>
	Political independence needs economic prosperity to sustain 
it. Thus this conference is both essential and timely.
<P>

actions of the Albanian government toward its ethnic 
minorities.
<P>
	Last month the Albanian authorities held what can only be 
called a show trial against five leaders of the Greek-speaking 
minority. This show trial was held under the auspices of the 
penal code that was established by the communist dictatorship 
of Enver Hoxha and should not go unnoticed by the world 
community.
<P>
	These convictions were nothing more than a malicious 
attempt to silence the representatives of the Greek-speaking 
minority in Albania in their efforts to secure the rights that are 
guaranteed to all people through the United Nations declaration 
on human rights.
<P>
	I hope that our government will, should the opportunity arise, 
condemn the convictions of this ethnic leadership and 
contribute to the efforts to gain their release.

	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
CRTC has made public its decision on the new 
telecommunications regulatory framework. Despite what was 
promised in June 1992, basic monthly rates will rise by 50 per 
cent over three years in some regions. For the first time, basic 
telephone service, which is an essential service, is being 
undermined.
<P>
	Why such a sudden and rapid increase? Consumers are the 
ones paying for the CRTC's decisions. A less drastic hike could 
have been agreed to for the sake of poor people hurt by the 
recession.
<P>
	While Minister Manley plays with the idea of regulations 
allowing the convergence of cable and telephone networks, the 
CRTC announces that this sector will be almost completely 
deregulated and presents everyone with a fait accompli.
<P>
	The right hand does not know what the left hand is doing. That 
is another appalling example of the inconsistency of the federal 
system.

It has no legitimate role whatsoever and serves mainly to

claim that the flights disrupt wildlife in the area, which is their 
major source of food, and contaminate the environment.
<P>
	These public hearings are being held to evaluate a flawed 
Department of National Defence environmental impact 
statement that, according to scientists, contains more than 130 
deficiencies, including the proposal to create one giant training 
zone and the use of thin aluminum strips that make animals sick 
when they eat them. The Innu have called into question the 
timing of the hearings, and the fairness and independence of the 
assessment panel conducting the review.
<P>
	Therefore I call on the government to immediately suspend 
the hearings until the concerns of the Innu are addressed, and to 
consider the advisability of ending all low-level flight training 
over the territory of the Innu. The Innu people never ceded their 
land to Canada for military purposes. They have lived off this

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we were all relieved to hear that the U.S. army would 
intervene in Haiti without bloodshed. However, the main 
objective of the mission has yet to be achieved, and I am 
referring to the return of President Aristide, and there are still 
some major concerns, especially after the Haitian police 
brutally attacked a demonstration by supporters of President 
Aristide in the streets of Port-au-Prince last night.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
Has the minister been given assurances by the U.S. authorities 
that the return of President Aristide is imminent?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, it will be a pleasure to answer the hon. member's 
question, and I want to make it quite clear that the purpose of 
this UN initiative is to bring President Aristide back to his 
country so that he can take up his duties as president. I believe 
that what has taken place during the last few hours is an 
indication that the process to return President Aristide to his 
country is well under way and is irreversible.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I beg to differ with the minister's optimistic statement, 
since the events of the past few hours seem to contradict what he 
just said, and I am referring to the fact that President Aristide 
has just dismissed the agreement concluded between a puppet 
president and the U.S. military.
<P>
	Is the Canadian government still satisfied with the agreement 
concluded on Sunday between Washington and the military 
junta, now that president in exile Jean-Bertrand Aristide has 
publicly dissociated himself from this agreement?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, there is an important point I would like to make. 
President Aristide mentioned that as far as he was concerned, 
the Governors Island Agreement was the agreement he had 
signed and the agreement he intended to abide by. I can say that 
the Canadian government entirely agrees with his interpretation 
of the facts.
<P>
	Furthermore, we must realize that at this very moment, the 
country is no longer totally under the control of a Haitian 
military junta and is gradually coming under the control of a 
multinational force, which has a mandate, under UN Resolution 
940, to take control and ensure that President Aristide returns to 
his country as soon as possible.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, of course we share the same expectations as the 
minister, but today's events do give us some cause for concern, 
especially the fact that the military junta is still there and will 
be, at least until October 15. We can only hope that all this will 
be over with by October 15, but for the time being, the junta is 
there, side by side with the U.S. peacemaking force.
<P>
	I want to ask the minister if he could tell us whether Canada 
intends to send Canadian police officers to Port-au-Prince 
without the consent of President Aristide and without waiting 
for his consent, while there is still some uncertainty about his 
own return and the role of the military junta.
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition mentioned a date, October 
15, which is a very definite deadline for the Haitian military. 
Whatever they do and whatever happens, they will have to 
submit to the firm determination of the Americans and all those 
who supported and approved UN Resolution 940. Consequently, 
I am quite confident that President Aristide will be able to return 
to his country.
<P>
	The hon. member had a question about police officers. I have 
been in touch with President Aristide on a regular basis, and we 
will continue our dialogue. Any steps to be taken by the 
Government of Canada will respect the wishes of President 
Aristide.

the latest analyses of the Canadian financial situation are far

extremely urgent, for the government to reduce drastically its 
operating expenditures instead of blindly relying on economic 
conditions and opportunistically reaping the meagre benefits as 
it has done recently?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister

government expenditures must be examined. We said that we

the Prime Minister said that his first responsibility is to ensure 
the unity of this country. Surely that means refraining from 
actions that undermine people's confidence in the federal 
government. I have one particular action in mind.
<P>
	Canadians are now among the most highly taxed people in the 
world. If the federal government wants to make federalism more 
attractive to all Canadians, it simply must refrain from 
increasing the burden of federal taxation.
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister to pledge today, for the sake of 
Canadian unity, to refrain from increasing the burden of federal 
taxation during the term of his mandate. Would he make such a 
pledge today?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will have a budget in the month of February. We had a budget 
some months ago and there were no tax increases. We do not 
plan to have any tax increases. We want to give very good 
administration to the country and the Minister of Finance looks 
at all aspects of all problems all the time.
<P>
	Speaking about how long I will be Prime Minister, to promise 
that I will never increase taxes in the many, many years I will be 
Prime Minister makes it difficult for me to give a very 
categorical answer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would not worry about being around many, many years. My 
question is just asking for the term of the government's 
administration.
<P>
	Let me be more specific. The economies of Alberta and 
British Columbia are growing faster than the Canadian economy 
as a whole and the provincial government in Alberta is making a 
more strenuous effort to restrain its spending than any other 
provincial government. There is now growing concern in the 
west that the only reward for economic growth or spending 
restraint at the provincial level is going to be to attract a federal 
tax raid similar to the one that occurred in the 1980s.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister today assure western Canadians that 
his government will not try to solve the federal fiscal mess by 
launching a tax raid on their region?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
do not think that the leader of the Reform Party will be more 
successful with this trial balloon that he is trying to scare people 
with than with the so-called carbon tax that he invented, 
something we were not even talking about. Having nothing else 
to do, not being able to criticize anything we are doing, he is 
trying to invent problems.
<P>
	Do not worry, we have enough problems like that. We do not 
want you to feel that you help the credibility and the confidence 
of this nation when you invent canards like this one.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I know that although people who are 
responding to questions do not always look at me they are 
referring to me when they say ``you''. I am sure they are.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is not only westerners who will be unsatisfied by the Prime 
Minister's answer. There are other Canadians who are uneasy 
with respect to the federal government's tax intentions.
<P>
	Mismanagement by successive governments of the Canada 
Pension Plan and OAS have undermined many Canadians' 
confidence in the government's ability to provide pension 
income. In response, millions of Canadians have endeavoured to 
provide for their own retirement through private RRSPs. Now 
these Canadians fear that their only reward for making this 
provision will be to attract a tax raid by the federal government 
on their RRSP contributions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	Yesterday the finance minister was unwilling to allay fears in 
this regard. Will the Prime Minister state categorically that his 
government is not planning to launch a federal tax raid on RRSP 
contributions?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is very funny. We are in September, at the beginning of this 
session and the leader of the Reform Party cannot find anything 
more to do than create fear among the public. He should relax. 
There will be a budget in February and he will have his answer 
that day. In the meantime we will carry on with running the 
business of this country and will try to have the best figures 
possible, like the one this morning on trade: a $2.3 billion 
surplus in the month of July.

to ten billion dollars short of being able to keep its election 
promise of reducing the deficit to 3 per cent of the GDP by 1996.

the Prime Minister.
<P>
	There are 115,000 early Stuart sockeye missing from the 
Fraser River system. A report prepared by staff at the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans makes it clear that DFO 
mismanagement and lack of enforcement are responsible. 
Further, the report confirms that the minister ignored the advice 
of his staff and chose not to close the fishery even though there 
were inadequate numbers of sockeye returning.
<P>
	What does the Prime Minister intend to do about this 
incompetence which has led to the devastation of this sockeye 
run this year?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Parliamentary Secretary 
to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
hon. member for Delta. As he knows, there is a problem in that 
approximately 1.3 million sockeye are unaccounted for. This 
government has acted responsibly by asking for a full and 
comprehensive review of our present management techniques 
and the science.
<P>
	As the hon. member is from the fishing community he should 
know that science is not perfect. We need to look at a number of 
areas like water temperatures which have a profound effect on 
sockeye.
<P>
	We are looking for a full review, including all stakeholders, 
including the aboriginal community, to get to the bottom of this 
and to make the necessary changes to ensure we have confidence 
in the management of the fishery. We will do that and that is 
what the minister stated earlier.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister has 
provided unsubstantiated excuses for this loss of salmon and has

	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday in this House, the Solicitor General rejected 
the opposition's request to establish a royal commission to 
investigate the very serious allegations concerning the 
infiltration activities of the Canadian Security Intelligence 
Service.
<P>
	My question is for the Solicitor General. Is he giving us to 
understand that by setting up CSIS, a monster was created that 
no one, including Parliament, can control anymore, although it 
was created for the express purpose of ending the RCMP's 
illegal activities in Quebec in the 1970s?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
CSIS was created under a bill passed by this House. CSIS must 
work within this law, in a legal fashion. The Review Committee 
monitors CSIS and I think that we must wait for the results of 
our efforts in order to have an answer to the allegations which at 
this point are surely just allegations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, does the Solicitor General know that a creature of this 
Parliament already committed illegal acts in Quebec, in 
particular by stealing the membership lists of political parties, 
by burning barns and by planting bombs?
<P>
	Does the minister realize that by refusing a royal commission 
of inquiry, he is helping to recreate the same scenario as in 1970 
and thus failing in his duty as minister?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> This 
government stresses the fact that any branch of the government 
operates within a legal framework and that is why we want the 
Review Committee to submit its report as soon as possible. I 
think that the people of this country, especially Quebec, will be

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services.
<P>
	Many years ago the government started shifting civil servants 
around the country at astronomical expense with no apparent 
efficiency benefit except to try to get ministers re-elected more 
efficiently. Today we find out in documentation that the minister 
has struck a committee that is going to consider moving more 
public servants to Atlantic Canada for the same apparent reason.
<P>
	Is the minister honestly considering trying this experiment 
again?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member raises 
an important question.
<P>
	I wish to advise him and other members of the House that the 
mandate as indicated by the Minister of Finance in his last 
budget has asked each and every minister to do a review of his or 
her department to find ways in which to increase efficiency. In 
fact section 5(2)(a) of the Department of Supply and Services 
Act reads: ``investigate and develop services for increasing the 
efficiency and the economy of the public service of Canada''.
<P>
	I find nothing inherently wrong with the Government of 
Canada embarking upon a study to try to ascertain the 
efficiencies in order to do away with duplication and overlap.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are 
concerned that public servants not be shipped around the 
country like sacks of flour for some form of patronage.
<P>
	Will the minister demonstrate to the House, since we cannot 
get this program review from the other minister, that any moves 
for public servants will be made to save government money, to 
make government more efficient and not just to mess around 
with the lives of public servants? They have enough on their 
plates right now.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency):</B> Mr. Speaker, again I thank the hon. 
member. I thought he was going to stand in his place and 
congratulate the Government of Canada.
<P>
	I will give the hon. member a demonstrable item that the 
Government of Canada concluded with the province of Quebec 
in order to rid itself of overlap and duplication. We 
consummated an agreement relating to housing and the delivery 
of housing programs in the province of Quebec. It thereby costs 
less money to the Government of Canada and enables more 
Quebecers to take advantage of Government of Canada 
programs.

question is for the Minister of Health. The Canadian people are 
very concerned about the contaminated blood affair and the 
minister has an obligation to act openly to inform and reassure 
the population.
<P>
	Why, in these circumstances, did the minister at her 
September 12 press conference hide from the Canadian people 
that the FDA was conducting on that same day another 
investigation at the Halifax Red Cross Centre?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for her question. This government has 
always acted with transparency and honesty and from the very 
beginning we have admitted openly that every blood donor 
centre would be inspected by the FDA. The FDA has now 
decided to change its regulations and require a licence for each 
centre. The Red Cross is in the process of applying for this 
licence.
<P>
	Meanwhile, each of the 17 centres in the country must 
undergo the same inspection.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond):</B> Mr. Speaker, can the 
minister explain to me why she did not send a clear directive to 
the other Red Cross centres when she had in hand the American 
agency's report?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health): </B>Mr. Speaker, we 
must keep in mind that the FDA inspects these centres to enforce 
its own regulations. American regulations are somewhat 
different from ours because under the American blood 
collection system, donors are often paid, while the Canadian 
system depends totally on volunteers.
<P>
	This does not mean that their regulations are better than ours 
or vice versa. We are working with the FDA and the Red Cross to 
harmonize the various regulations, to ensure that we have the 
best regulations, so that our blood collection system continues 
to be among the best in the world.

	In my riding of York-Simcoe there are a number of 
responsible gun owners who have expressed concern over 
impending gun control legislation. These individuals along with 
other Canadians recognize the need for measures to curb the 
violent and illegal use of firearms.
<P>
	Will the minister give assurance to Canadians today that in 
any new gun control legislation responsible gun owners will not 
be unfairly treated and that his efforts will be directed against 
those who abuse the use of firearms?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, the proposals we are 
developing through caucus to bring forward to the House focus 
on three areas.
<P>
	First is the presence of illegal firearms in this country and 
what we can do to stop it. Second is the question of whether the 
criminal justice system should have a sterner response to those 
who misuse firearms in the commission of offences, and it will. 
Third is the question of whether the regulation of firearms in the 
hands of legitimate and lawful owners can be improved to 
enhance community safety and to work toward crime 
prevention, detection and prosecution.
<P>
	In that process we will indeed be respectful of the legitimate 
interests of firearms users. We understand and we respect the 
importance of hunting not only as a long tradition in this country 
but as an important economic activity. Those values will be 
reflected in the proposals we bring before the House.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Mr. Speaker, Michel 
Robert, a former Liberal Party president, has been given an 
untendered contract for $249,925 to act as an Oka negotiator. 
That is a whopping $74 under the limit for untendered contracts.
<P>
	Somebody said recently this government and this Parliament 
would serve the interests of all Canadians, not the interests of 
the privileged few no matter how well connected. I doubt few 
would be fooled by the sham of the tendering process. I do not

	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern

I find it passing strange the Reform did not realize it. Six months 
have passed. The Bloc asked a couple of questions at the time.
<P>
	May 25, 26 and 27 was a very volatile time at Oka. Trees were 
being cut down, with a threat of the army going in. I had to act 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5898"> 5898 </A></B>
<P>
quickly and I had to get competent  people. Judge Réjean Paul 
was available as a mediator and Michel Robert.
<P>
	As a result of questioning from the Bloc at that time I was able 
to put some of his background in <I>Hansard</I>. He was past president 
of the Canadian Bar Association, a fellow of the Ontario Bar, a 
former member of the military and an author. He has a 
tremendous, competent background. I was quite lucky to get him 
at the time.
<P>
	The result is that Oka is calm. Things are being worked out. 
We do not have the military there. We are not spending hundreds 
of millions of dollars on enforcement. I do not apologize for 
hiring competent people, albeit some of them may be Liberal.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I used Oka 
as just one example. That was just one of a very long list of 
patronage appointments. That was one example which I chose.
<P>
	We want to get to the bottom of the tendering process. It was 
put in place to ensure that the best people could be chosen 
through the competitive process. It is a safeguard against 
patronage and ensures openness in the system. Since May there 
have been dozens of examples of competent people who only 
happen to be Liberals.
<P>
	If Michel Robert was such a competent person as the Prime 
Minister and the minister maintains, why did he make a mockery 
of the tendering process itself, not that appointment? Why was 
he afraid to allow the contract to go through the competitive 
process to find the very best person for the job regardless of 
political stripe?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when we hire professionals on a contract like this one on a short 
term we look for very competent people who can do the job. If 
we had to wait for the tendering process, asking tens of 
thousands of lawyers to apply and to pass an examination, we 
would never get results.
<P>
	If the member had any guts she would try to prove that the 
person is not competent. Of course she will not. We are not 
afraid to get up in the House and say that this man was elected 
president of the Canadian Bar Association by lawyers in 
Canada. Yes, at one time in his career he had the good judgment 
of a Liberal. That is not a handicap.

that have not been approved, I am also prepared to tell you right 
away that all the projects announced by the Liberal Government

had to co-operate with Mr. Ryan and Mr. Bourbeau and I am

co-operation and the work that they have done on this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix):</B> Mr. Speaker, when the 
Minister of Finance refers to a misunderstanding, of course he is 
referring to his letter. How can the minister explain that he 
signed a letter that by his own admission is completely incorrect

	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and

similar questions, the future form or structure of the GTA is 
certainly a topic the government has under review as we deal 
with a variety of very important agricultural transportation 
issues in the country.
<P>
	I would point out though that during the course of the summer 
I have had a repeated series of meetings with not only the 
existing GTA but all major players in the Canadian western 
grain handling and transportation system to ensure that they are 
focused upon the huge challenge of moving a very large and very 
diversified crop this year through export positions into the most 
lucrative available export markets.
<P>
	I am pleased to say that in comparison to this time last year we 
have achieved a 40 per cent increase in the number of hopper 
cars in the grain car fleet in the country. We anticipate in the 
month of October that we will see unloads at the port of 
Vancouver perhaps twice as high as last year and unloads at the 
port of Thunder Bay 50 per cent higher than last year.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
that is a very broad answer to a very definite question.
<P>
	Farmers are again harvesting a crop under extreme weather 
conditions. They have a plugged railway system. Because the 
recommendation was not acted upon we now have a situation 
where a few large players are dictating the process of car 
allocation. Farmers, small grain elevators and shippers are again 
being discriminated against.

	What action is the minister prepared to take to solve the 
problem?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and

have been meeting with during the course of the summer have 
focused on a broad range of issues to try to deal with the 
challenge of throughput through all our export facilities.
<P>
	We have dealt with, at least in part, the issue of grain car 
allocation but obviously that is nobody's first choice in the 
system. We want to expand the capacity of the system and the 
throughput of the system. We will be introducing legislation this 
fall in the House to address some of those issues. Other reforms 
are under way already in an administrative manner.
<P>
	The good news in the system is that we have a huge volume of 
grain to move. We hope our system will have the capacity to 
handle it, but given the volume and the diversity of the 
particular crop there may be a requirement for some form of 
allocation as we go through the crop year.
<P>
	I have undertaken to the industry to monitor the allocation 
process as it is implemented to be sure it is fair to all players in 
the system including those who have reservations about it, 
namely the smaller shippers. I want to make sure they are treated 
fairly.

<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue):</B> Mr.

because in fact the public information return filed by registered 
charities is available to the public in accordance with section

information on non-profit organizations in accordance with the 
confidentiality provisions contained in subsection 241(1) of the

<P>
	I have been listening to concerns in this regard and I am sure 
that members can be very satisfied with the improvements and 
the strengthening of actions and sentencing around criminal 
acts.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I fully agree with the objective of this bill as well as with all 
its provisions. That being said, my remarks will deal with two 
points in particular: first, offences motivated by hate and 
second, offenders abusing a position of trust.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I believe that equality for all Canadians includes freedom 
from hatred and from harassment. Expressions of hatred have 
absolutely no place in Canadian society. Openness, 
understanding and sharing are features that shape our collective 
identity. Most Canadians believe that each one of us has the 
right to live free from hatred or expressions of hatred and 
actions that are motivated by hatred.
<P>
	I have always felt, and I have actually been convinced, that a 
crime motivated by hate based on one's race, religion, sex, age, 
sexual orientation, mental or physical capacity or any other 
form of that nature is a very serious crime and needs to be looked 
at in a particular light.
<P>
	With this bill, such hate motivations will be considered an 
aggravating circumstance in the Criminal Code for the first 
time. It therefore will define and ensure that these crimes will be 
treated much more severely.
<P>
	One of the strongest aspects of the new hate crime proposal is 
in its broad scope. It enshrines even further the principles that 
one finds behind section 15 of the charter which is a 
fundamental value for all Canadians.
<P>
	While we are generally more aware of hate crimes related to 
religion, racism or sexual orientation, we must not forget that 
women as a group also come under attack simply because they 
are women.
<P>
	In the aftermath of the massacre of 14 women at the École 
Polytechnique de Montréal in 1989, our country was shocked to 
discover the hatred that some men feel toward women. That was 
a very shocking moment and made many Canadians sit up and 
take note.
<P>
	Women's experience in the criminal justice system is 
primarily that of victim. The way they are treated in the justice 
system is critical in their efforts to achieve equality as a right. 
Our vision, reflected in Bill C-41 and other initiatives, is one of 
a society and a justice system in which all Canadians are full and 
equal partners, confident that their rights will be upheld by the 
law.
<P>
<B>(1510 ) </B>
<P>
	The disturbing increase in the expressions of hatred and 
discrimination in our society is well documented. Since 1989 
there has been a marked upsurge in hate group activity 
throughout the world, certainly right here in Canada. These 
groups are now better organized, they are far more subtle in their 
approach, and they have developed new strategies which really 
need to be addressed. One needs to be far more sensitive to read 
the message behind the message. It is subliminal in many cases 
and much more invidious in its intent.
<P>
	The Solicitor General has estimated that over 52 neo-Nazi 
groups and 85 other associations promoting hatred are currently 
operating in this country. I believe that is cause for serious 
concern.
<P>
	In its 1993 annual audit of anti-semitic incidents in Canada, 
the league of human rights of B'Nai Brith Canada recorded a 31 
per cent increase in anti-Semitic harassment and vandalism. 
The league documented a disturbing increase in hate group 
activity. They have, to quote the league: ``adopted a more 
militant and activist stance than in prior years''. I can tell the 
House that those acts of vandalism and those expressions of 
hatred, which I have seen on the walls of synagogues and 
buildings in my riding of Mount Royal, are really distressing 
and very disturbing. Young people who come to schools or go 
into the cemeteries are really quite shocked and it leaves a mark 
on them.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Often, our personal knowledge or experience of ways hatred 
can be expressed gives statistics a sense of reality and urgency. I 
am convinced that all the hon. members of this House can 
remember a specific incident or action intended to frighten or 
harm someone by reason of his or her race, religion, colour or 
sexual orientation, just because they were different.
<P>
	The increasing diversity of our population's make-up poses 
quite a challenge to Canadian society as a whole.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We all have a sense of pride and are all very thrilled when we 
read that the United Nations finds Canada the finest place in the 
world in which to live. Notwithstanding that, we have a series of 
warts. It is important to look at these and see how we can excise 
this unacceptable behaviour from our society.
<P>
	We know that Canada is a multicultural and multilingual 
country from its beginnings. Our native peoples, our aboriginal 
peoples, are multicultural and multilingual. They were joined by 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5902"> 5902 </A></B>
<P>
English and French,  both languages and both cultures, to form a 
beautiful mix. Now, according to the 1991 census, 42 per cent of 
Canadians have origins other than British or French.
<P>
	It is important to note that in Mount Royal riding-and I think 
it is a perfect example, although perhaps a little bit more 
concentrated than in other cities-the statistics show that 43.5 
per cent of the population is first generation immigrants to 
Canada. This does not take into account the balance of the 
population in my riding who are of ethnic origin and who have 
been here since the early 1800s. It is a very diversified riding 
and I am proud to have about 60 different ethnic minority groups 
represented. They speak the languages of the world. These are 
the languages and the cultures of multicultural business in this 
global economy. They are important to us for a variety of 
reasons and it is exciting because you can have the wonderful 
experience of living in such a multicultural society.
<P>
	They make up, all these Canadians, the majority in every 
major urban centre. By the year 2006 the proportion of 
Canadians who are visible minorities is expected to be between 
13 and 18 per cent. In Toronto, the city with the greatest 
diversity, some suggest that the proportion could be as high as 
50 per cent. These great urban centres reflecting our diversity 
make for culturally and socially exciting and dynamic 
communities in which to live, ones in which we can really 
flourish and grow.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	However, we have to be forever vigilant. Hate motivated 
crimes can be found in this kind of a mix if we do not take care, if 
we are not vigilant. It could be a threat to the social cohesion of 
these communities. It could impede equal and full participation 
for all. It leads to alienation, a sense of disenfranchisement and a 
feeling of powerlessness.
<P>
	There are some basic trusts we as a nation cannot afford to 
break. I will enunciate some: the right of all persons to enjoy 
their own language and culture; the right of a family to worship 
without fear of violence and distrust; and the right of women to 
walk safely on the streets in their communities.
<P>
	To avoid conflict and maintain social harmony, our 
institutions must redouble their efforts to develop policies, 
programs and practices that recognize the reality of Canadian 
diversity and move to ensure this social cohesion. We need 
access, understanding and respect if we are to live together in 
peace and harmony.
<P>
	Among those institutions that are ensuring this happens is our 
justice system, which has a great responsibility and a 
fundamental role to play in ensuring this trust and fairness. The 
system must demonstrate without ambiguity that hate crimes 
will not be tolerated in Canada. It is just not to be tolerated. It is 
not the Canadian way and it is absolutely not acceptable.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The provisions of this bill by which hate motives constitute 
aggravating circumstances for the purpose of sentencing should 
have been implemented a long time ago. They reflect this 
government's commitment to protecting the fundamental right 
of all Canadians to live without being afraid, to live in peace and 
security and to live as equals. Obviously, it does not suffice to 
ensure that hate will be deemed an aggravating circumstance, 
this must be part of an integrated approach to promote 
understanding and respect within the society.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We must work together in a broad range of legislative and 
non-legislative areas. It is the responsibility of the people in 
this House representing all Canadians to ensure that hate and the 
manifestations of hate are eradicated from this society.
<P>
	It is very important that we educate today's youth about hate 
crime: how to understand it; how to sense it; and how to speak 
out against it. We have to emphasize the determinant role they 
will play both in terms of prevention and in terms of the 
promotion of peace and goodwill.
<P>
	In that spirit our multiculturalism department in many ways 
with its cross-cultural and intercultural activities and its race 
relations undertaking and in partnership with society has 
developed many programs. Among them are the very helpful 
programs of educational materials developed for students and 
teachers on human rights, prejudice, racism and racial 
discrimination.
<P>
	We have acted in many ways with the schools. I have travelled 
across this country and have seen students in action. It has been 
a pleasure to listen to these young students who understand, 
recognize and respond to racism. They know prejudice when 
they see it. Unfortunately, it is when they get home that it often 
gets reinforced. It is very important that they learn the lesson of 
speaking out, so it never happens again.
<P>
	Our program uses a variety of public educational tools to 
speak out against hate and racism. It explains that each one of us 
can make a difference and that Canadians need to work together 
to ensure peace and harmony. It works particularly when we 
work in collaboration with different ministries, for example 
with the Solicitor General and the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	The multiculturalism department has done some very 
extensive work with the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, 
the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police and many other 
such structured institutions.
<P>
	This bill will give all of us another tool that can be used to 
educate while addressing the issues of hatred.
<P>
<B>(1520 ) </B>
<P>
	Unfortunately this century has and continues to demonstrate 
in many parts of the world the end result of unchecked acts of 
hatred based on who you are and not what you are. Canada is a 
place where this is not to  happen any more. Canada is one 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5903"> 5903 </A></B>
<P>
example to the world that we are determined to live in a 
respectful environment in a respectful society. Those who do not 
wish to share and participate in this Canadian experiment shall 
be given an appropriate sentence with this new bill which 
indicates we shall not accept these expressions in our society.
<P>
	I said I wanted to pay attention to two aspects of this very 
extensive bill. The other aspect I want to discuss is the key 
element of the amendment package, sexual assault involving a 
breach of trust.
<P>
	Under this bill if a person is found to be guilty of sexual 
assault and that person was in a position of trust or authority 
with the victim, that fact will be considered an aggravating 
factor which will affect the severity of the sentence. This is very 
important particularly for women and children for they are the 
primary victims of sexual assault.
<P>
	The fact that sexual assault involving breach of trust is a grave 
problem in this country is very disturbing on the one hand and is 
plain to see on the other. Canadian statistics revealed that in 
1993 over three-quarters of reported sexual assault victims 
knew their assailants. That StatsCan survey was a true eye 
opener. On taking the microscope and magnifying the study 
through the language in the Criminal Code we found statistics 
that were quite revolting with respect to sexual assault and the 
victims. This is just the tip of the iceberg.
<P>
	According to a national phone survey done by StatsCan, only 
6 per cent of the women who told interviewers they had been 
assaulted had never reported it to the police. They were 
frightened. Why? One of the reasons is that that women report 
sexual assaults they do not believe they will be treated fairly by 
the judge listening to the case within the court system.
<P>
	The new directions and the new directives on sentencing are 
going to help change that attitude. The judges will be 
enlightened as to what this government believes should be the 
proper action and the proper response given in these 
circumstances.
<P>
	In a society in which prejudice and stereotype still exist, a 
woman is often blamed for being sexually assaulted. What is 
happening as well is women are seeing the inappropriate 
sentences that are given to perpetrators. This helps reinforce 
their attitude that they are not being considered fairly in the 
decisions that are rendered.
<P>
	For too long our justice system has operated without any 
clearly defined understanding of breaches of trust in cases of 
sexual assault. Indeed in some cases the fact that the aggressor 
occupied a position of trust either as a good parent or a pillar of 
the community has even led to lighter sentencing. This is wrong, 
terribly and shockingly wrong. It is totally unacceptable. I am 
very pleased that the Minister of Justice acknowledges this and 
has brought to bear some changes in the system which will 
enlighten the judges in this regard.
<P>
	To state it plainly, when someone violates a position of trust, 
whether he is a relative, an employer, a teacher, a doctor or some 
other figure of authority, he may do even greater damage to the 
victim than the anonymous rapist who attacks in the dark alley. 
This is particularly true if the victim is young. I would like this 
House to know that 63 per cent of sexual assaults involve 
victims under the age of 18 years. I say this is wrong. It is 
terribly wrong and it has to stop.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Victims of aggressions involving breach of trust could well 
suffer irreparable emotional and psychological damage.
<P>
	Women and children who were molested by a friend, a family 
member or a mentor can no longer trust and love. They lose part 
of their humanity.
<P>
	It may be difficult for a woman who has been victim of an 
aggression to maintain healthy intimate relationships, whether 
with close male friends or members of their family and even 
with their own spouse.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	Many have to quit work, while others can no longer trust 
certain professionals. Their pain and suffering is often 
exacerbated by the fact that their aggressor does not face 
prosecution or gets off with a slap on the wrist.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A national study of court cases conducted by the metro action 
committee on public violence against women and children 
looked at how sexual assaults involving breaches of trust are 
dealt with in our justice system. It concluded that judges often 
fail to recognize a breach of trust.
<P>
	In the many court cases studied 47 per cent involved an 
offender who was a father, a paternal figure, a relative, a friend 
of the parent, someone in a position of authority, or someone in a 
professional role. They all had had privileged relationships with 
the victim. Yet in over 40 per cent of these cases this privileged 
relationship was not even mentioned in the judges' comments or 
in the discussion of aggravating factors.
<P>
	Furthermore when judges do recognize a breach of trust it is 
not always evident that they have given it appropriate weight in 
determining the offender's sentence. This bill will begin to 
rectify that situation by giving judges clear directives about 
what constitutes a breach of trust. The reformed Criminal Code 
will be better equipped to deal with this form of sexual abuse.
<P>
	This provision will also send a message to individuals in a 
position of power. It says that if you use your relationship to take 
advantage of women or children, you will be treated harshly by 
the system. In other words, the greater a person's influence, the 
greater the responsibility to treat others with respect, and the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5904"> 5904 </A></B>
<P>
greater the consideration of a stiffer fine and sentencing. Not 
even a fine, sentencing.
<P>
	The amendments in this reform package, especially those 
dealing with hate crimes and breach of trust, will help rebuild 
people's faith in our justice system. It will encourage women to 
be far more courageous and more open and to feel that they will 
be better treated if they bring the cases before the courts. That 
faith has been sorely tested in recent years as we have learned of 
the extent of violence against women and have lived through 
many incidences of hate motivated crimes.
<P>
	I am grateful to the Minister of Justice for moving swiftly to 
deal with these problems. This bill is an example of our 
government's commitment to a just and peaceful society, a safe 
society with safe streets. If those words sound familiar it is 
because I am repeating them. They are printed and published in 
our best seller, the red book. We have kept our promises. These 
proposals follow through on the commitments we have made. 
They are the result of extensive consultations and co-operation 
with the provinces and the territories on sentencing reform.
<P>
	In the name of all of our citizens, the women, men and 
children of this society, I am very pleased with this bill. I hope as 
it goes though this House people will recognize the importance 
of the fairness of this bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened very carefully to what the hon. member had to say. She 
mentioned hate, and I agree that is not acceptable. However, 
legislation does not necessarily make certain acts more 
acceptable. And she had something to say about what is 
legislated and what is not legislated, and she has a point. I would 
like to ask her something in this connection. When she started on 
the word hate, I thought: hate is the opposite of love.
<P>
	In Canada, there are broken families and broken individuals 
as well. She referred to big cities like Toronto and Montreal. 
And she is right.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	She referred to what happened at the polytechnical institute, 
which shook us all. These were young women with a brilliant 
future. Today, in our schools, even in our secondary schools, 
twelve, thirteen and fourteen year-olds have suffered because 
we have no comprehensive social plan, as far as I am concerned. 
We have no plan for families, and as a result, we end up with 
laws that are harsh and sometimes very much so.
<P>
	It is easy to say we have no choice, that the facts are there and 
crimes are being committed. However, if we look at the causes, 
and my question is all about this, could we not do a lot more in 
the way of prevention? Could we not provide more help for 
Canadian families? Could we not give more help to 
single-parent families and children? What about changing 
family allowance payments, considering the reduction in 
unemployment insurance benefits, and the increase in the 
number of hours people must work, since the unemployed have 
so much trouble making ends meet?
<P>
	I think we should look at the whole picture and not just this 
particular legislation, even if we must change it.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> Mr. Speaker, I must say that the question, if 
we can call it a question, was actually an expression of concern 
and an analysis of our society which, I think, is well-founded 
and I share the concerns expressed by the hon. member. As I 
believe I said at the beginning of my speech, legislation is part 
of the greater picture, which includes education, awareness and 
appreciating the differences in our society. And that is probably 
why I referred to the diversity that, to me, is a splendid aspect of 
our society but also a very fragile one, just as democracy is 
fragile. If we do not take care of it, if we do not approach it with 
that ``stirred in the pot'' love when we tend this splendid and 
colourful garden, if I may use this metaphor, our failure to do so 
will cause problems and a great deal of pain.
<P>
	The problems are caused by a lack of understanding, a lack of 
information and stereotypes that are rooted deep down. That is 
why the department of which I am Secretary of State, the 
multiculturalism department, is so important. For what it takes 
to buy one chocolate bar a year for everyone in Canada, we are 
setting up programs to bring people together, education 
programs, awareness programs and programs to promote what 
we are as Canadians and the mutual respect that should be part of 
everything we do.
<P>
	We must understand this. We must realize that when you come 
from another country, another culture, and speak a language 
other than English and French, you have a lot to learn, and it 
takes more than a year or two to do that. After a few years, you 
get to the point that you are in a position to learn and you can 
learn. The groups we find in our communities and our 
neighbourhoods are there to help each other, to give a helping 
hand to new residents and help them understand Canadian 
democracy, the way we act and the way we speak and what is 
acceptable and what is not, and that hate and any kind of sexual 
assault are not acceptable, period.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
before getting back into the routine, I would like to wish the 
Speaker, the Deputy Speaker and the Acting Speakers the very 
best for this session. Your patience no doubt will be tested and I 
pray you will continue to make the decisions that are in the best 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5905"> 5905 </A></B>
<P>
interests of all of the citizens of this great country. I wish you the 
best.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	I also bring greetings from the constituents of 
Yorkton-Melville in Saskatchewan to all the members of 
Parliament and sincerely hope that all the members will direct 
their efforts to the most serious problems facing us at this time, 
problems like the debt, the economy, unemployment, criminal 
justice reform, as we are dealing with now, and the desperate 
need to reform our social programs.
<P>
	I hope that we will focus on these things and apply ourselves 
to dealing with them.
<P>
	We have heard from a number of Reform MPs who have 
expressed their qualified support for certain provisions of Bill 
C-41. We have also heard of some of their recommendations for 
improvement. While I share my colleagues's support for the 
general principles and intent of this bill, it is clear that it is not a 
bill that a Reform government would have drafted.
<P>
	For example, section 745.6(2)(d) will now permit judges to 
receive and consider information provided by a victim at early 
parole hearings of murderers sentenced to life imprisonment 
supposedly without eligibility of parole. These people have 
been sentenced and now, under section 745, they have the 
possibility after 15 years of applying for parole.
<P>
	While Reformers would rather have seen the complete repeal 
of section 745 and have these convicted murderers stay behind 
bars and serve their full sentences, we commend the government 
for at least taking a step in the right direction by recognizing that 
victims do have some rights to be heard at these hearings.
<P>
	I am concerned that this specific amendment does not specify 
how the judge may receive the information from the victims or 
the victims' relatives. Will it simply be a victim's statement or 
will the victims themselves be allowed to appear in court and 
give evidence under oath? This has to be clarified during the 
committee stage. There is no clear evidence here that victims 
will have any more rights than criminals throughout this entire 
reform of the criminal justice system. That is a principle that we 
must clearly enunciate in our legislation and that has not been 
done in this amendment.
<P>
	The minister cited the experience of Marie King Forest. Will 
she have the right to appear before the parole committee and 
give evidence of the impact the murder of her husband, a 
policeman, had on her life and the lives of her children? That 
murderer is now applying for parole and these people are still 
trying to put their lives together. Will there be clear, ample 
opportunity for her to personally testify at these parole 
hearings? That is not specified in this amendment.
<P>
	After reading Bill C-41 I could not help but conclude that it is 
a make work project for lawyers. I was listening to the hon. 
minister a few minutes ago. I am convinced that this legislation 
will provide more and more work for lawyers in our courts. 
There seems to be more of a focus on bureaucratic procedures 
than imposing sentences and getting tough on crime. That is not 
acceptable and Canadians are calling for this government to get 
tough and not make more procedures and more work for the 
lawyers.
<P>
	When I see that certain murderers will get a more serious or 
stiffer sentence because their crime was motivated by hate 
rather than doing something for kicks, as was the case with this 
policeman, or for some other reason there is a serious flaw here. 
It will be a lawyer's dream to now work with this new 
legislation.
<P>
	Trials will now have this new added dimension. As they 
discuss this they of course will be accumulating revenue. Let us 
focus on the crime.
<P>
<B>(1540 ) </B>
<P>
	Now to my real concern about this bill. The Minister of 
Justice has spent the last six months getting Canadians all riled 
up about gun control. The first opportunity that he has to do 
something about it, the first opportunity that this government 
has to address this problem and to do something about the 
criminal use of guns, they do nothing. They have missed their 
chance. That is a major concern of mine and of many Canadians. 
Everyone knows that this is a serious deficiency not only in the 
use of section 85 of the Criminal Code but also in the sentences 
meted out by judges.
<P>
	For the benefit of this House and the Canadian people, section 
85 provides for a mandatory sentence for any person using a 
firearm in the commission of an indictable offence. The 
sentences can range from a minimum of one year to a maximum 
of 14 years for the first offence, and for a second or subsequent 
offence a minimum of three years and a maximum of 14 years. 
Section 85 also requires that the sentences be served 
consecutively, added on to their other sentence.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice talks about imposing more inane 
restrictions, empty foolish restrictions, on law-abiding, 
responsible gun owners while he did not take this opportunity to 
put more teeth into the sentencing of criminals convicted under 
section 85. That is a grave omission.
<P>
	I know the Minister of Justice has asked the provincial 
attorneys general to ensure that more charges are laid under 
section 85 rather than using it primarily as a plea bargaining 
tool. The studies show that even when section 85 is used by the 
police the sentences are rarely in line with what the public would 
consider punishment fit for the crime or anything near what the 
people would consider a deterrent-completely lacking.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5906"> 5906 </A></B>
<P>
	Before we look specifically at the sentencing under section 
85, we must look at the overall leniency of our criminal courts. 
In 1991-92 the Canadian centre for justice statistics completed a 
study of the sentencing of adult criminal provincial court in six 
provinces using a data base of over 600,000 criminal 
convictions. It found that the maximum penalties were imposed 
very rarely in adult provincial courts. Of the 52 offences 
carrying an identifiable maximum penalty, 31 of the crimes had 
never had the maximum penalty imposed; 17 had the maximum 
penalty imposed only one per cent of the time and only four had 
the maximum penalty imposed over 5 per cent of the time.
<P>
	I ask the members of this House is this what the government 
means by getting tough on crime?
<P>
	Let us look at this study and see what it tells us about 
sentences for the use of a firearm during the commission of an 
offence. First of all, the number of convictions is important to 
look at. The study by the Canadian centre for justice statistics 
found that in the 1991-92 year in just six provinces there were 
only 52 convictions under section 85 for using a firearm in the 
commission of an offence. Compare this with 12,287 
convictions for violent crimes that same year; 52 convictions 
out of 12,287 convictions for violent crimes under section 85 for 
using a firearm in the commission of an offence.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	Here is a breakdown of those violent offences: manslaughter, 
73 convictions; robbery, 2,181 convictions; sexual assault with 
a weapon, 94 convictions; assault with a weapon, 5,787 
convictions; careless dangerous use of a firearm, 2,130 
convictions; the possession of a firearm or weapon, 2,022 
convictions. Out of all of these, there were 52 convictions under 
section 85 of using a firearm in the commission of an offence. 
This is a total of 12,287 convictions for violent crimes.
<P>
	Granted I can hear some people saying we do not know how 
many convicted criminals actually used a firearm, but we are 
certain that it was a lot more than 52 times out of 12,287 in all of 
these violent crimes that I have given here. Robbery, 2,181-did 
all of these people rob without a gun?
<P>
	Section 85 is not being used. The Minister of Justice is trying 
to convince the provinces to instruct their police forces to use 
section 85 more. Let us look at the sentences for 52 section 85 
convictions in 1991-92. The minimum sentence under section 
85 of the Criminal Code is one year and the maximum is 14 
years.
<P>
	In all 52 convictions under section 85 every single one of 
them received the minimum one year sentence. That is getting 
tough on the criminal misuse of firearms? I find this statistic so 
amazing I have to say it again. In 100 per cent of the 52 
convictions for using a gun during the commission of a crime the 
criminals received the minimum one year sentence, one year in 
jail. This is proof positive that something has to be done with 
regard to sentencing for section 85 convictions.
<P>
	Bill C-41 that we have before this House must be amended. If 
the courts will not use the sentencing provisions of section 85 to 
deter the criminal use of guns then Parliament must. We must 
not neglect our duty. We must use the responsibility that people 
have entrusted us with to make our criminal justice system work 
in this country.
<P>
	If judges persist in sentencing criminals who use guns to the 
minimum time in jail then Parliament must act to increase the 
minimum mandatory sentence to three years. I think section 85 
should be amended to read ``use of weapons'', not just 
``firearms''. That is a serious loophole in the law that must be 
closed.
<P>
	I ask the government to do what makes sense and do what the 
vast majority of Canada is asking: get tough on crime. Do not 
look at legitimate gun owners and see what restrictions we can 
put on them. Target the problem where the problem exists.
<P>
	I cannot believe that this government left such an important 
provision out of the sentencing bill. What possible reason could 
it have for this oversight? Could it be that it is not serious about 
getting tough on crime? Could it be that all the focus of its 
efforts to control crime will be directed, as I have said, at 
law-abiding, responsible gun owners rather than at the criminal 
who uses guns? Why should it be left to Reform MPs to identify 
the major deficiency in Bill C-41?
<P>
	I hope now that it has been pointed out that all the members of 
the justice committee will support an amendment of this bill 
related to the sentencing for convictions under section 85.
<P>
	Let us look at how section 85 might be better applied in a 
recent case. Everyone has heard about the Just Desserts killing 
in Toronto on April 5. Four men walked in, robbed the patrons of 
the restaurant and used a sawed-off shotgun to kill one of the 
customers. Three men have been charged so far, one with murder 
and 12 robberies and the other two with manslaughter and 12 
robberies. As far as we know charges have not been laid under 
section 85 of the Criminal Code.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	Since the Just Desserts killing there have been calls for more 
gun control by people with the mistaken belief that controlling 
guns will somehow control crime. It will not. The criminals in 
the Just Desserts killing were already using a prohibited 
weapon, a sawed-off shotgun. What are we doing? Are we going 
to prohibit them even more than they already are?
<P>
	There have been very few calls for what is really needed, more 
crime control and not gun control. One way to control crime is to 
send a clear message to all prospective criminals that the public 
and our criminal justice system will not tolerate the criminal use 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5907"> 5907 </A></B>
<P>
of guns. The best way to send this message is to hand out tougher 
sentences.
<P>
	The persons in the Just Desserts killing should not only be 
charged with murder, manslaughter and 12 robberies but should 
also be charged under section 85 for using a firearm in the 
commission of an indictable offence, one section 85 charge for 
each of the robberies and another section 85 charge for the 
murder.
<P>
	This would give the judge the option of sentencing another 
182 years in jail for the sentences for each of these convicted of 
the senseless, horrific crime. What if, after the conviction, the 
newspaper headlines read: ``Just Desserts killers get just 
desserts, sentenced to a maximum of 507 years each''? ``Justice 
minister promises they will never get out to kill again''. This 
would be the maximum life sentence for the murder, the 
maximum life sentence for each of the 12 robberies and the 
maximum sentence of 14 years for using a firearm in each of the 
robberies and another 14 years for using a firearm in the murder.
<P>
	Would this not send a clearer signal to those who are going to 
use guns with criminal intent? Would this not be a clearer 
deterrent than making laws which ban guns which the criminals 
disobey anyway? They will still continue to saw off their 
shotguns and use them any way they want to.
<P>
	There will always be those who will be saying that sentencing 
a criminal to 507 years is ridiculous and of course 507 years is 
impossible to serve. However, it is even more ridiculous to let 
killers serving life sentences with no eligibility for parole back 
on our streets in 15 years by using the Liberal loophole of 
section 745.
<P>
	What is more ridiculous? Compare those two things. It sounds 
ridiculous to sentence somebody to 507 years but it is even more 
ridiculous to let them off easy. I appeal to this government to get 
tough on crime. The criminal misuse of guns,rather than what 
they are doing now should be addressed instead of putting in 
more stupid regulations on law-abiding citizens.
<P>
	Liberals are very famous for big government, higher taxes and 
intrusion into the lives of Canadians. More common sense is 
needed in this legislation. Do not just make it appear like the 
government is doing something. Really get to the root of the 
problem and solve it. Do not just talk the talk, walk the walk.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice said this morning that he has been 
planning this for 14 years. Why did the government not come up 
with something more substantive if it has had that much time? 
Surely it could have closed some of these loopholes and 
addressed some of these problems.
<P>
	The minister had many Canadians telling him this summer the 
ideas that he has been floating with regard to gun control do not 
get to the heart of the problem. He had an opportunity to do 
something and he never did it. I hope some amendments will be 
made in this committee. I look forward to making some 
suggestions to the minister.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to refer to the hon. member's comment about the Liberal 
loophole of section 745. The rationale I believe the member 
used for not removing section 745 entirely was the will of the 
Canadian people to get tough on crime.
<P>
	I would like to draw to the hon. member's attention that 
section 745 is a judicial review heard with a judge and jury 
where two thirds of the jury must make the finding for a 
convicted person to be released.
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member is that not dealing with the 
people through our judge and jury system, trial by our peers? 
What objection does he have to that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
question is a good one.
<P>
	If the member is familiar with what is happening with regard 
to section 745 at the present time, I do not have the statistics at 
my fingertips, but what is happening is that over half of these 
people are being released because a lot of the evidence is not 
admissible in these court trials and it is being used as a loophole 
to get these people off after 15 years.
<P>
	Part of the problem is being addressed by the legislation and I 
commend the government for doing that because it will allow 
victim impact statements to be submitted but it does not indicate 
how those victim impact statements will be used in these trials. 
Will the person be able to testify before this jury? At the present 
time they are generally not allowed to do so unless the judge 
rules otherwise in some provinces.
<P>
	In most cases those people who, if we had capital punishment, 
would not even be here are being released on to our streets. That 
is what people find unacceptable. These people who in more 
than half the cases were given a life sentence are now being 
released. That is the problem.
<P>
	Much of the testimony that should be given because of other 
legal loopholes is not even allowed at that trial. It is a very 
interesting study to see what is happening under section 745 and 
to see how the criminal element has more rights than the victim 
with regard to all of this legislation. That is why we would like 
to close some of these loopholes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
comment and a question for the member of the Reform Party.
<P>
	It seems like every time we deal with the issue of crime and 
justice which is certainly a very difficult issue, I get the 
impression that they would have us be like the United States of 
<P>

<B><A NAME="5908"> 5908 </A></B>
<P>
America with the death penalty and sentences that go into 
hundreds of years.
<P>
	The member made a comment about not talking the talk but 
walking the walk. I wonder if the member is aware of a number 
of studies that have been done particularly the one by Dr. 
Anthony Doob, one of the foremost experts in the area of public 
perception of the judicial system. The points Dr. Doob made in 
his conclusions were based on the following.
<P>
	He gave a group of people the transcripts of what actually 
went on in a court case. Covering the same court case, he had 
another group of people who got the reports from the printed 
media. The findings were that people who responded on the 
appropriateness of the sentences and who used the media as the 
source of their information in many cases had the same attitude 
espoused by members of the Reform Party such as the justice 
system is not working and that judges are being much too 
lenient.
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	The other group of people who had transcripts to refer to so 
they could decide if the sentencing judge had given an 
appropriate sentence concluded that the system was working 
quite well and that in some cases the judicial system was more 
harsh than it needed to be. The public even proposed that things 
like fine option programs and alternatives to incarceration 
should be tried.
<P>
	The question I want to pose is this. Surely the members of the 
Reform Party recognize that we do not, in Canada, follow the 
model of the United States in terms of criminology. We happen 
to be a little bit more enlightened. Surely the member of the 
Reform Party recognizes that Canada is a much safer society 
than is the United States. If capital punishment and the kind of 
justice they are talking about were to work, the United States of 
America would be a safe place to live. It is not. Compared to it, 
we are doing very well.
<P>
	I am really troubled with this pandering to the worst 
misconceptions that the member and his party seem to cater to.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome that question. I will address the first part of his 
question concerning capital punishment. We do not have to 
decide that question here. We can have a discussion.
<P>
	That question can be decided by the people of Canada in a 
binding referendum. That is who should decide it. I call on this 
government to hold that binding referendum.
<P>
	In reply to the other issue that was raised, if the hon. member 
has had any experience with the criminal justice system, if he 
has been wronged, if his constituents come to him and describe 
their experience with our criminal justice system, he will realize 
very quickly that it needs fixing.
<P>
	I could cite example after example of where people have been 
the victims of crime. Those people then go to the trials; they 
appeal to the judge for some justice; they go to the police and 
cannot get justice because people hide behind loopholes in the 
law.
<P>
	That is the kind of experience I am talking about now. People 
have had experiences like this. They see that horrific crimes 
have been committed. There was a murder in my constituency of 
an elderly man just a very brief time ago. One of the perpetrators 
got four years. Now he is eligible for parole. That man's wife 
cannot understand how this can be. You can use all the elitist 
arguments about how the biggest brains in this country know so 
much more than the ordinary person, but I do not buy it. That is a 
typical Liberal attitude: they know better.
<P>
	It is about time we listened to some of the people who have 
experience with the way the criminal justice system works and 
how they, the victims, have virtually no say in that system.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-41, an act to amend the Criminal Code (sentencing) and other 
acts in consequence thereof, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Telegdi:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The 
previous speaker referred to the fact that if one had some 
experience in the criminal justice system. I wish to inform the 
hon. member that for 15 years I worked with victims and 
offenders in the criminal justice system.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5909"> 5909 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I say respectfully to all 
our colleagues in the House of Commons that is not a point of 
order.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Roseanne Skoke (Central Nova):</B> Mr. Speaker, as a 
practising defence lawyer with 17 years experience in the  
criminal justice system I commend the Minister of Justice for 
introducing sentencing practices which are responsive to the 
concerns and values of Canadians and which address the many 
existing injustices inherent in the criminal procedure process 
and the practices of our criminal justice system.
<P>
	Bill C-41, an act to amend the Criminal Code of Canada with 
respect to sentencing is a bill which reflects the government's 
commitment to a renewed criminal justice system that is 
balanced, fair, and encourages respect for the law.
<P>
	Justice, law and equality are the fundamental elements 
required to maintain a balance within our criminal justice 
system. However, the determining factor is the human element.
<P>
	It is the human element that determines the success or failure 
of our criminal justice system. The human element includes 
ourselves as individuals who are to be law-abiding citizens, the 
community at large which develops public opinion, the role of 
our law enforcers which is to enforce law, the role of our 
prosecutors administering justice within the system, the role of 
defence counsel defending and protecting rights of the accused, 
the role of the judiciary rendering a decision, the role of our 
probation officers, psychologists, social workers, health care 
professionals, penal institution employees, our clergymen 
regarding the rehabilitation of the accused, and the role of we 
here today, the legislators, enacting the law.
<P>
	The success of the system does not primarily rely on 
legislation. The fundamental success of our criminal justice 
system relies on the ability of man to administer justice without 
abuse of authority and power, and the ability of man to 
administer justice coupled with equity and mercy.
<P>
	Justice, law and morality are inseparable. If a moral society 
existed there would be no need for criminal sanction. It is a 
requirement for this criminal sanction in our society that 
necessitates government to deter, to punish, to rehabilitate its 
members of society.
<P>
	Bill C-41 on sentencing reform introduces changes to the 
sentencing system while also reorganizing and rationalizing it. 
The reforms provide a balanced, sensible and broad range of 
options that address the public's need for safety, the victims' 
desire for restitution, and the important principle that serious 
offenders should be treated differently from minor or first-time 
offenders.
<P>
	The amendments are the result of extensive consultations in 
co-operation with the provinces and territories that are 
responsible for administering the criminal justice system.
<P>
	This bill provides the courts with more options to distinguish 
between serious violent crime requiring jail and less serious, 
non-violent crime that could be addressed more effectively at 
the community level.
<P>
	For those Canadians who demand equity in sentencing, Bill 
C-41 addresses this concern by introducing a statement of 
purpose and principles of sentencing within the Criminal Code.
<P>
	No statement of purpose and principles of sentencing 
currently exist in the Criminal Code. While court rulings have 
determined principles, these may vary from province to 
province. To date Parliament's role has largely been limited to 
setting maximum penalties for specific offences rather than 
dealing with the policy objectives of the sentencing process.
<P>
	Under the proposals, a statement of purpose in principles of 
sentencing will be added to the Criminal Code. This statement 
will provide direction to the courts and the fundamental purpose 
of sentencing to contribute to the maintenance of a just, peaceful 
and safe society.
<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	The statement describes the objectives of sentencing as 
follows: first, helping in the rehabilitation of offenders as 
law-abiding persons; second, separating offenders from society 
where necessary; third, providing restitution to individual 
victims or the community; fourth, promoting a sense of 
responsibility by offenders, including encouraging 
acknowledgement by offenders of the harm done to victims or to 
the community at large; fifth, denouncing unlawful conduct; and 
sixth, deterring the offender and other people from committing 
offences.
<P>
	In achieving these objectives the court will be guided by a 
number of fundamental principles: first, a sentence must reflect 
the seriousness of the offence; second, the degree of 
responsibility of the offender; third, courts must consider 
aggravating and mitigating circumstances; fourth, give similar 
sentences to offenders who have committed similar acts; fifth, 
when an offender receives more than one sentence, the total 
should not be unduly long or harsh; sixth, the offender should 
not be imprisoned if less restrictive alternatives are appropriate; 
and seventh, all reasonable alternatives should be considered 
when sentencing offenders.
<P>
	The statement of purpose and principles will also note the 
importance of crime prevention to public safety. In addition, it 
will recognize that wherever appropriate, alternative measures 
designed to meet the special needs of aboriginal offenders 
should be used. The statements of purpose and principles in the 
Criminal Code will emphasize unity and coherence in the 
criminal justice system. These measures will ensure greater 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5910"> 5910 </A></B>
<P>
consistency, balance and fairness within the criminal justice 
system as a whole.
<P>
	Adding a statement of purpose and principles makes the 
sentencing process responsive to public concerns by ensuring 
that it is governed by principles set out by Parliament. Clearly 
defining the purpose of sentencing also makes the system more 
understandable, predictable and accessible to the public.
<P>
	A national policy statement on sentencing will also provide 
the legal community with a more consistent direction on how to 
approach sentencing in Canada.
<P>
	The proposed statement of principles also says that when an 
offence is motivated by hate based on the race, nationality, 
colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability, or 
sexual orientation of the victim, this must be considered an 
aggravating circumstance.
<P>
	Any offence motivated by hate against any individual in 
Canada should not be tolerated. I wish to reiterate this 
statement, that any offence motivated by hate against any 
individual in Canada should not be tolerated.
<P>
	However, I wish to go on record today as taking exception to 
the specific inclusion of the wording of ``sexual orientation'' in 
the Criminal Code amendment. The inclusion of this wording in 
effect gives special rights, special consideration, to 
homosexuals. The reference to sexual orientation in the code 
and its proposed inclusion in the human rights legislation gives 
recognition to a faction in our society which is undermining and 
destroying our Canadian values and Christian morality. Such a 
special recognition of sexual orientation in our federal 
legislation is an overt condonation of the practice of 
homosexuality which is being imposed on Canadians. It has the 
effect of legislating a morality that is not supported by our 
Canadian and Christian morals and values.
<P>
	Canadians do not have to accept homosexuality as being 
natural and moral. Homosexuality is not natural, it is immoral 
and it is undermining the inherent rights and values of our 
Canadian families and it must not and should not be condoned.
<P>
	The public expresses legitimate concerns for victims of 
crime. Bill C-41 provides enhanced provisions for victims. 
Some courts have excluded victim information from being 
considered at section 745 hearings because this information was 
felt to be a form of victim impact statement, which according to 
the Criminal Code can only be heard at sentencing hearings.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	The amendments to the Criminal Code would allow victim 
information at section 745 hearings. This would ensure that a 
victim has the opportunity to speak about the harm done by the 
offender and that the victim's experience is taken into account in 
determining whether the period of parole ineligibility should be 
reduced.
<P>
	Bill C-41 addresses the concerns of Canadians with respect to 
the issue of restitution. The bill contains proposals that were 
developed co-operatively by the federal government and the 
provinces. They would allow judges to consider restitution to 
cover property and personal injury.
<P>
	Expanded restitution would also be available in situations 
where a person acting in good faith unwittingly becomes the 
victim of criminal activities by, for example, unknowingly 
buying stolen property that is later confiscated by police.
<P>
	Provision is made to ensure restitution orders can be enforced 
by the civil courts. Victims will also be notified of restitution 
orders. As well the code would specifically state that any 
restitution order by a criminal court would not limit a victim's 
right to sue for damages in a civil court.
<P>
	Bill C-41 also addresses payment of fines. Currently 
one-third of adult offenders in jails in Canada are there because 
they did not pay a fine. Research shows that aboriginal people 
are especially likely to be jailed due to non-payment of fines. To 
ensure that fewer persons are ordered to pay fines they cannot 
afford, the proposals would require courts to determine that an 
offender can pay the fine being considered.
<P>
	Offenders who cannot pay can instead be subject to other 
options such as community service or probation. A number of 
measures are also being proposed to help the provinces in 
collecting fines. These include authorizing the provinces to use 
the same mechanisms that they use enforcing fines imposed 
under federal statute.
<P>
	Designate officers of the court such as the clerk or registrar to 
enforce fines rather than the court itself allows for more cost 
efficient administration with respect to the collection of fines.
<P>
	Ultimately these proposals would result in less crowded, safer 
prisons as well as decrease costs. They would also lessen the 
potentially damaging effect of imprisonment on people unable 
to pay fines. However, maintaining prison as a last resort for 
people who can pay fines will ensure that the law is respected.
<P>
	Another important issue the bill addresses is with respect to 
reform regarding probation. The probation provisions of the 
Criminal Code have been changed to encourage better 
information for the court. Together with greater penalties for 
breach of probation this is intended to increase confidence in 
this widely used sentence.
<P>
	Under the proposals the Criminal Code would be intended to 
specify the basic information that must be included in a 
pre-sentence report. The provinces will also be given the 
flexibility to include in their own regulations any other 
information they wish to have included in this pre-sentence 
report.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5911"> 5911 </A></B>
<P>
	The criminal justice system often fails Canadians and 
therefore we need alternatives in Canada to court proceedings. 
Alternative measures are ways that disputes and minor offences 
can be dealt with rather than using expensive and unnecessary 
formal court proceedings.
<P>
	Alternative measures have two central aims: to prevent more 
criminal behaviour and to lessen the harm that can sometimes be 
done when minor offenders are dealt with through the courts.
<P>
	They also involve the community and put greater emphasis on 
victim-offender reconciliation than do formal court 
proceedings. At present the Criminal Code contains no 
provisions for alternative measures.
<P>
	The bill would allow the use of alternative measures for adults 
by permitting each province to set up and administer its own 
alternative measures program. This proposal is similar to one 
successfully used in various jurisdictions for young offenders. 
As a result first time and less serious offenders could be diverted 
from the courts. This would promote protection of the public by 
lessening the negative impact of incarceration on less serious 
offenders while freeing up valuable and scarce resources to deal 
with the more serious cases. Canadians should know that the bill 
would add a new sanction called a conditional sentence to the 
Criminal Code. Courts would be permitted to use conditional 
sentences when the jail term that would otherwise be imposed 
will be less than two years.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	A judge would impose certain conditions on an offender 
similar to the conditions of a probation order. At the same time 
the judge would impose a jail term but suspend it as long as the 
offender meets the conditions that had been imposed.
<P>
	Offenders who do not comply with these conditions can be 
summoned back to court to explain and to demonstrate why they 
should not be incarcerated. The court can cancel the suspension 
of the sentence and send the offender to jail for the remainder of 
the sentence, or it can impose new conditions.
<P>
	The proposal would mean that less serious and first time 
offenders who otherwise would be in jail could serve their 
sentences under tight controls in the community. This promotes 
protection of the public by seeking to separate more serious 
offenders from the community while providing less serious 
offenders with effective community based alternatives. It could 
also mean that scarce funds could be used for incarcerating and 
treating more serious offenders.
<P>
	As a defence lawyer I have great concern with respect to the 
existing rules of evidence and procedure for the sentencing 
hearing. At present there are no clear guidelines in the law 
governing the sentencing hearing to indicate when information 
should be made available to the court, what powers the court 
should have to obtain that information, or how that information 
should be assessed in determining sentences. Previous court 
rulings  may be referred to but they do not cover all situations 
and may differ significantly from province to province.
<P>
	The bill proposes amendments to the Criminal Code to clarify 
how sentences should be handled in the courts. The bill also 
requires every judge to present reasons for their sentences in 
cases. These amendments bring greater consistency and fairness 
to the sentencing process.
<P>
	The Criminal Code of Canada as a statute requires 
restructuring and in particular the restructuring of part 23 of the 
Criminal Code. Our current legislation with amendments leaves 
us with a piecemeal approach to our Criminal Code. The bill 
would amend part 23 so that most matters dealing with 
sentencing would be consolidated within this part of the 
Criminal Code rather than scattered throughout. Because of the 
restructuring in such a logical way our Criminal Code would be 
more understandable and accessible to criminal justice 
professionals and to the public at large.
<P>
	Often injustices arise in a criminal justice system on the basis 
of technicalities. Technical amendments are required and Bill 
C-41 addresses this point. A variety of technical issues are 
either not addressed by our current legislation or are being 
confused. These include when a probation order should begin, 
how a judge can direct the manner in which escape sentences are 
to be served in relation to previously imposed sentences, what 
happens to a sentence while an inmate is unlawfully at large and 
who can authorize the transfer of a probationer from one 
province to another. The bill intends to clarify some of these 
issues.
<P>
	In conclusion the reform and the renewal of the criminal 
justice system in Canada must be priorities with our 
government. Canadians demand justice and equity. They must 
be reflected within the criminal practices, procedure and 
process in our criminal justice system.
<P>
	The sentencing amendments proposed by Bill C-41 affords 
Canadians sentencing practices and procedures that are just and 
equitable throughout Canada.

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Thank you, 
Mr. Speaker, and I also wish you a good session, because I am 
glad to see you again after the summer break. I want to thank my 
colleague for her speech; to tell you the truth, I do not at all 
consider myself an expert on justice issues, but having listened 
very closely to the hon. member's speech, I feel some obligation 
to get into debate with her, in my capacity as human rights critic 
for my party, especially on one aspect of her speech.
<P>
	She said that this bill is a necessary reform and talked a little 
about homosexuality in what I thought were rather pejorative 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5912"> 5912 </A></B>
<P>
terms. She said that homosexuality was immoral and that 
Canadians were not prepared to tolerate it.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	I remembered the speech that her colleague, the Secretary of 
State for Multiculturalism and the Status of Women, gave 
earlier this afternoon, saying that Canadians should become 
more tolerant of one another.
<P>
	I feel the need to say so because I really have the impression 
that the present Minister of Justice will also propose some 
reforms concerning discrimination on the basis of sexual 
orientation, making it an illegal ground for discrimination.
<P>
	I would like to ask my colleague whether we as 
parliamentarians should not rather recognize that 
homosexuality is a different way of expressing one's sexuality. 
Should we as legislators not recognize, especially when 
discussing this kind of situation, that homosexuals are estimated 
to constitute about 10 per cent of the population in nearly all 
societies and that they are entitled to legal rights? Is calling 
homosexuality immoral not rather reactionary and intolerant, 
contrary to what the Secretary of State for Multiculturalism 
urged us to be?
<P>
	I would like to know what she thinks because I want to say 
where I stand when we have the opportunity to discuss these 
issues in connection with the amendments to the Canadian 
Human Rights Act that the Minister of Justice will present to us. 
I hope that, whatever side of this House we sit on, we will find a 
little more open-mindedness.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Skoke:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member raises a very 
important issue which I think has to be and should be addressed 
on the floor of the House. Certainly it is an issue that I have not 
shied away from. It is not always a very comfortable issue to talk 
about.
<P>
	My learned friend indicated 10 per cent of the population. We 
have the majority. We have a democracy. I am representing in 
my viewpoint the majority of Canadians. We have to concern 
ourselves with the fact that justice, law and morality are 
inseparable. We are legislators. When we are legislating and 
making laws we must ask ourselves whether our laws are just 
and moral.
<P>
	Morality is constant. Morality does not change with the tide. 
We cannot change morality to adhere to a particular faction or 
special interest group or to adhere to the whims of 10 per cent of 
our population.
<P>
	When we talk about sexual orientation we are talking about 
imposing upon and insisting that all Canadians condone what in 
my opinion is immoral and unnatural. We have natural law. I 
have gone on record as stating quite clearly that I am opposed to 
the inclusion of the words sexual orientation in our Criminal 
Code. I have also gone on record as saying in my speech that 
certainly in Canada we cannot and should not tolerate hatred of 
any kind toward any individual.
<P>
	As far as the moral issues that are raised here, we have to be 
very concerned and considerate of the rights of families in 
Canada. Families have inherent rights. Families have existed 
before the church and families have existed before the state. The 
rights of families in my opinion are being undermined and are 
being eroded because of 10 per cent of the population that is 
promoting special rights and interests for homosexuals. I am 
strongly opposed to that. I will continue to be very vocal about 
it. I feel it is time the majority of Canadians stood and were 
counted.
<P>
<B>(1630 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am one of the 10 per cent to whom the hon. member 
just referred. I am not a member of a special interest group. I am 
not a member of a faction. I am a member of a family and gay 
and lesbian people in this country, as the member should know, 
are also very much not only members of families but are also 
families themselves.
<P>
	I want to take a couple of minutes to respond to the comments 
of the hon. member. I want to tell the hon. member that what we 
are debating here is legislation which which will ensure that 
when a crime is motivated by hatred or intolerance or bigotry, 
whether it be based upon sexual orientation, religion, or race, 
that crime is punished more severely.
<P>
	A couple of weeks ago for example the brother of a young 
teacher from Toronto came to my office and told me about how 
his brother had been brutally murdered by five teenagers in a 
Toronto park. He had been kicked to death because he was a 
faggot according to them.
<P>
	I also met with people who were attacked and whose arms 
were broken by a group of thugs in a restaurant on Davie Street 
in Vancouver. They were attacked for no other reason than the 
fact that they happen to be gay.
<P>
	This legislation says that when attacks are motivated by that 
kind of hatred they should be punished more severely.
<P>
	I want to challenge this member and I want to leave her with 
time to respond to this. The hon. member, and I use those words 
advisedly, has suggested that ``homosexual couples are not 
families in natural law. They will not be family. To condone 
homosexuality which is an inhuman act would make us a pagan 
nation''. She goes on to suggest that gays and lesbians do not 
deserve any protection against discrimination and that 
homosexuality is in the same class as pedophilia and bestiality. I 
might say as well that I heard hon. members from the Reform 
Party saying ``hear, hear'' as she spoke.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5913"> 5913 </A></B>
<P>
	My question for the hon. member is a simple one. Will she 
now stand in her place and retract those hateful comments she 
made suggesting that people, homosexualists as she called 
them, were promoting and advancing the homosexual 
movement which is spreading AIDS. That kind of fear 
mongering, that kind of hateful conduct has no place in this 
House.
<P>
	I want to ask the hon. member to stand in her place and take 
this opportunity to withdraw those hateful words. Failing that, I 
want to ask other members of the Liberal caucus when will they 
end their silence and when will the Prime Minister end his 
silence and say that this woman has no place in the Liberal Party 
of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Skoke:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member and I have 
probably squared off on this issue before. I stand here in my 
place as a member of Parliament and under no circumstances 
would I ever retract the statements I have made. I have a right as 
a Canadian. I have a right as a Christian to defend the values of 
our country and to defend the traditions and to exercise my right 
of freedom of expression on this issue.
<P>
	My learned friend raised the issue that they were hateful 
comments. They are not hateful comments. They are true 
comments shared by the majority of Canadians with respect to 
issues regarding morality.
<P>
	My learned friend talks about families. The sole purpose, the 
sole agenda behind the homosexualists in our country is with 
respect to redefinition of family. I oppose that. I will fight 
strongly against that and I ask my colleagues to do the same. I 
ask all Canadians to do the same.
<P>
	Homosexualists enjoy the same rights as every other 
Canadian. They do not enjoy any special rights. I as a member of 
Parliament will work to ensure that the rights of the majority of 
Canadians and that the values and the morality of this country 
are upheld.
<P>
<B>(1635 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. It is my duty 
pursuant to Standing Order 38 to inform the House that the 
questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as 
follows: the hon. member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve-Human rights; the hon. member for 
Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing-Social spending; the hon. 
member for Yukon-National forum on health; the hon. member 
for Richelieu-Mass layoffs; the hon. member for 
Sarnia-Lambton-Great Lakes sport fishery.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to speak on Bill C-41. I am very 
pleased we are now dealing with the subject of amendments to 
sentencing and other aspects dealing with crime.
<P>
	It is surprising when we look at the economic difficulties this 
country has that the public's concern on economic issues is 
pretty well at the same level as its concern on crime and public 
safety. We have to ask ourselves why that is happening and what 
the reason is for this concern.
<P>
	First we have to say that on reflection our criminal justice 
system is working quite well. A lot of things need to be changed 
and that is what the Minister of Justice and this government 
hope to achieve in this Parliament. Then we will be able to say to 
the people in the next federal election that we have done a great 
deal to add to public safety.
<P>
	Before starting down that road however, we have to say that 
our system operates quite well. We could bring forward 
statistics which say that crime is not increasing to the level some 
people would have us believe but frankly, when it comes right 
down to it statistics are of limited value.
<P>
	What we have to face is the public perception of what people 
feel is their relative level of safety. That is what we have to deal 
with. Canadians must tell us what their concerns are and we have 
to listen. In that respect we have to dialogue with Canadians. We 
also have to bring forward laws that are going to work for 
Canadians, that are meaningful and are going to have an effect. 
This bill is very standard in that regard. The people of Canada 
have expressed concerns. This piece of legislation goes a long 
way in addressing those concerns.
<P>
	I want to mention some of these concerns and how this 
legislation has addressed them. First, the very question of 
balance is paramount. We have to balance the needs of 
Canadians with good judicial legislation. I think we have done 
that here.
<P>
	Bill C-41 addresses directly the purpose and principles of 
criminal sentencing. No such statement currently exists in the 
Criminal Code. There is no statement in the Criminal Code 
which deals directly with the purpose and principles of criminal 
sentencing.
<P>
	We compare that with other areas of activity in this country. 
For instance we compare it with taxation, international trade, or 
unemployment insurance. All of these areas deal with very 
important subjects. In one way or another all of them have 
purposes and principles set down as to what has to be achieved 
and how the desired effect is going to be achieved.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	That is as it should be. Bringing into this bill and bringing into 
the criminal justice system the purposes and principles in 
sentencing is paramount. In sentencing we are dealing with the 
very question of incarceration. There can be no greater 
infringement on the lives of individuals frankly, than to 
incarcerate them. So the very least we can do is to have purposes 
and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5914"> 5914 </A></B>
<P>
principles of criminal sentencing in the bill that deals with that 
very important subject.
<P>
	Sentencing is an area around which the whole court system 
revolves. When someone is charged and brought before the 
courts, the whole exercise revolves around the sentence this 
person is given. We have listened to the counsel on both sides, 
the prosecutor and the defence counsel; we have read the laws 
and the briefs they presented. We have tried to understand the 
societal implications. We are familiar with incarceration and the 
other penalties. With all of this knowledge, background and 
experience in our criminal justice system, we then bring forward 
a sentence. That sentence is vital. That sentence is tremendously 
important in the future of our community safety. If we do not 
sentence properly, we are not only abusing the system but we are 
not doing society a favour.
<P>
	If we incarcerate someone who perhaps could be 
rehabilitated, a young person who has not committed a violent 
crime, we are not really doing that young person justice nor are 
we doing society justice. Incarceration might make that young 
person bitter. Perhaps by putting that young person to work in a 
community program he or she could achieve a better 
understanding of his or her place in society. That is very 
important.
<P>
	This bill does another important thing. It sets out a number of 
objectives for the sentencing process. For instance, in this bill 
one of the objectives is that we denounce unlawful conduct. We 
also speak of separating the offender from society where 
necessary. I say where necessary because it may not be 
necessary or even preferable in certain circumstances.
<P>
	We also talk about rehabilitation of the offender. Regardless 
of how people feel the offender should be punished, in most 
cases that offender is going to leave incarceration and will be 
back in society. Part of our system has to cast an eye to that time 
when that offender is back on our city streets. We have to try to 
anticipate what kind of a person will be released back onto the 
streets. If we can make that person someone who is less likely to 
offend then that is also something we should consider.
<P>
	Another objective in this bill is reparations. This bill says that 
it is important to fine somebody, but it is also important to give 
that person an appreciation that while they cannot get away with 
the crime, that going to jail may not be the greatest punishment 
for them.
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	Maybe it is where they can do it that they should be made to 
pay back a certain portion of what was stolen or damaged that 
will give this person a true appreciation of exactly what the 
victim has lost. That may seem rather simplistic and silly but 
sometimes when people commit crime they do not put 
themselves in the place of the victim.
<P>
	They are only doing what they think they want and what they 
want to achieve. They do not in the heated moment when the 
crime is committed think of the victim and the ramifications for 
the victim. In that regard it is important that any person where 
possible who is going to be punished be made to think of what 
the victim has suffered and as distinctly and as carefully as 
possible that offender should be put in the place of the victim.
<P>
	Reparations would do that by having to pay back. It should not 
be necessary that the victim have to apply to a court that these 
reparations be made. The court should consider it and we are 
saying that these reparations should be a consideration as an 
objective of sentencing. The victim should not have to apply.
<P>
	We also in that same vein are trying to promote responsibility 
in the offender. We are trying to make the offender more 
responsible from that point forward. We are also saying that an 
objective is that the penalty should be proportionate to the 
seriousness of the crime and the degree of responsibility of the 
offender.
<P>
	These objectives are very important. It is a checklist for 
judges and those involved in the criminal justice system. We 
should be looking for and achieving this. As I said initially we 
should be looking for this balance in our criminal justice system 
so that there is repudiation and punishment but there should also 
be a benefit to society in reparations, fines and in the fact that 
when that person goes back to society we have looked to that day 
and tried to do everything we possibly could to make that person 
more acceptable and more responsible in society.
<P>
	No one would deny that punitive acts should be deterred by 
incarceration and that incarceration in most cases is a deterrent. 
There is no easy cause and effect relationship between the crime 
and the deterrent as to the value that is going to have. There is no 
magical formula which says that certain punishment is going to 
be the best way to deal with certain crimes.
<P>
	There are these intangible factors in dealing with human 
beings in our criminal justice system that do not allow anyone to 
make a hard and fast rule. This is the reason we have to allow the 
flexibility in the courts. This is why we need the best minds 
possible on our benches in Canada.
<P>
	We need the best judges we can possibly have and we need the 
best support system for these judges. We also feel, as I 
mentioned, that restitution be given priority in the courts. We 
think this is something that has to be considered.
<P>
	We have also looked in this bill at section 745 of the Criminal 
Code which allows for a review of life sentences and allows the 
person serving a life sentence to apply for parole after 15 years.
<P>
	We have not said that we are going to do away with that 
provision. We have said, however, that we want to include in that 
review victims' impact statements. Those impact statements 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5915"> 5915 </A></B>
<P>
have not been a part of the review  before now and the Minister 
of Justice certainly feels very strongly that they should be.
<P>
	I and the minister think that this is going to have a tremendous 
impact on the hearings and on final decisions on these section 
745 reviews.
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	We also state in this bill that where a victim impact statement 
is provided to a court the court shall consider the statement. That 
is not something that is just shoved in with exhibits and 
literature in a court hearing. The actual victim impact statement 
has to be taken into consideration.
<P>
	This is important because most people in the House have been 
conscious of the fact that victims certainly have not received the 
attention they should. Certainly victims have brought forward 
that message loud and clear. We have to in our legislation look 
more to the victims and what they are suffering, the loss that 
they have endured and how we can possibly make their point of 
view known at the time of the hearing and have the impact of 
what they have gone through and what they have lost impressed 
upon the mind of the judge and all of the pertinent officials.
<P>
	We also, where possible, need alternatives to incarceration. 
We can look at that from various points of view. The first thing is 
that one-third of all the people incarcerated in this country are 
incarcerated because they have not paid a fine or some other sum 
of money that they have been required to pay. In a lot of cases the 
people do not have the money to pay the fine or the required sum 
of money. We are putting these people in jail.
<P>
	We are also saying that people who commit sexual assaults or 
violent crimes need to be punished for longer periods of time. If 
we are saying that we want to keep some of these people who 
have committed violent crimes in our penitentiary system for 
longer periods, we have to look to our correction system. To put 
people in a penitentiary because they have not paid fines in this 
day and age really has to make us wonder, particularly if they 
cannot afford to pay.
<P>
	There has to be a better way of doing it. One of the ways would 
be public service. If they cannot pay the fine then why can they 
not be allowed or forced to provide some kind of public service?
<P>
	A second area that we are recommending is the curtailment of 
provincial services. If a person has not paid his or her fine then 
perhaps they should not be issued a hunting licence or a driving 
licence until that fine is paid. These are things that we with the 
provinces should look at to perhaps get away from incarceration 
for non-payment of fines. This would go a long way not only as 
far as having a better result, but it would give more respect to 
our criminal justice system.
<P>
	Another thing that we want to try as a result of Bill C-41 are 
conditional sentences. At the present time we have the process 
where a person is put on probation. If they reoffend they are 
brought back and charged, they go through the court process 
again and they are once again sentenced. Here we are saying that 
through conditional sentences a sentence will be levied on the 
person. The person then will be granted freedom to act in a 
diversion program in their community or an alternative to 
incarceration but the sentence has been imposed.
<P>
	If the person violates the terms of his or her sentence while 
they are in one of the alternate processes they are then brought 
back to court and it is determined if in fact they have broken 
their conditions. If it is determined by the courts that they did 
then what they must do is finish the unfinished portion of their 
sentence that was imposed on them initially. You do not go 
through the whole trial re-evaluating or reappraising their past 
history. The sentence is there. If it is proven that they have 
violated the conditions of that conditional sentence then the 
unfinished portion of their sentence has to be served. I think that 
will do a lot to ease the burden of our court system and once 
again be more meaningful to those involved.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	We are also saying to those who are on probation that if they 
break probation they break the trust of society. They are not only 
breaking the trust of the criminal justice system. They are 
breaking the trust of society that wants to give them a chance. 
We do not want to impose incarceration. We want to give them 
the benefit of the doubt as much as possible because we think 
they are worth it. Now if a person violates probation then he or 
she is breaching that trust.
<P>
	We are saying in Bill C-41 that there should be harsher 
penalties for those who breach their probation. We are also 
saying, as was brought up earlier, that if there is a hate factor in 
the committing of a crime then this is an additional motivating 
factor and should result in a harsher penalty. We are saying this 
unequivocally. We are saying this as a result of a good deal of 
dialogue and consultation we have had with minority groups and 
different religious groups all across the country. This is 
something they want very badly and which they feel is needed 
and it is something to which the Minister of Justice agrees.
<P>
	I think this bill is going to go a long way to help us fight crime 
in Canada and get back a lot of the respect for our criminal 
justice system that we have lost and will give the people of 
Canada more confidence that the government has control of the 
fight against crime and the restoration of safe streets in this 
country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
question for the hon. member opposite. First of all in terms of 
alternatives to incarceration you mentioned several possible 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5916"> 5916 </A></B>
<P>
alternatives. I am just wondering if you have considered 
seriously-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I know we are just 
coming back from the summer recess but I think we want to 
remind one another to direct questions, comments, any 
interventions through the Speaker. I know good habits are hard.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the hon. member 
if he has considered corporal punishment as an alternate 
deterrent to crime, an alternative to incarceration.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacLellan:</B> Mr. Speaker, no we have not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have this opportunity to address a 
question to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Justice.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary is a member of this House for 
whom I have considerable respect. We have worked together on 
the justice committee over the years. The member was present in 
the House a few minutes ago when one of his colleagues from his 
province of Nova Scotia made certain comments with respect to 
this bill and in particular with respect to the provisions dealing 
with crimes motivated by hatred, prejudice and bias on the issue 
of sexual orientation.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary may be aware as well of the fact 
that this Liberal from Nova Scotia in question has made a 
number of similar comments to those that she made in the 
House. In the House today she stated among other things that 
homosexuality was immoral and unnatural.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Right on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I hear a Reform Party member 
saying ``right on''. I hope that member will have the courage to 
stand in his place and defend that particular-
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. This is a debate 
that requires a great deal of sensitivity in which members want 
to give their utmost respect. I know the member for 
Burnaby-Kingsway is a very experienced parliamentarian.
<P>
	We want to make sure we direct everything in the respectful 
fashion that is owed to this topic and all topics within this 
Chamber.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do indeed look forward to 
hearing the comments of my colleagues from the Reform Party 
on this issue. Among other comments made both inside the 
House and outside by this member are the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There are those innocent victims that are dying from Aids and then there are 
those homosexualists that are promoting and advancing the homosexual 
movement and that are spreading Aids. Aids is a scourge to mankind and there 
will be no cure for Aids. So this love, this compassion between homosexuals, 
based on an inhuman act, defiles humanity, destroys family,-and is 
annihilating mankind.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She goes on to state, as I indicated earlier, that homosexuality 
is in the same class as pedophilia and bestiality.
<P>
	My question for the hon. member, the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Justice, is a straightforward 
question. This member is obviously entitled to speak as she 
wishes. It is a free country. She has freedom of speech. Will the 
parliamentary secretary undertake to raise the issue directly 
with the Prime Minister as to the appropriateness of this member 
continuing to sit as a member of the Liberal caucus, the Liberal 
Party of Canada, when she espouses views which, if they were 
spoken with respect to any other minority, perhaps a religious 
minority, a racial minority, any other minority, would be met 
with widespread outrage and anger by that member's 
colleagues?
<P>
	I want to ask the parliamentary secretary what action is he 
prepared to take to break the silence of the Liberal Party and the 
Liberal caucus on this question? I see the chair of the human 
rights committee of this Parliament who was present during 
those comments. Perhaps she may wish to comment on this.
<P>
	At this point I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Justice precisely what action is he prepared to take 
to ensure that Canadians understand very clearly that these 
kinds of hateful, bigoted, homophobic comments have 
absolutely no place either in this Chamber or certainly in the 
Liberal Party of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacLellan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I accept the comments of the 
hon. member because I know they are sincere. I have respect for 
his position and his contribution to this House of Commons. He 
has been an excellent member of Parliament.
<P>
	I cannot comment on the member to whom he refers because 
she as he stated is entitled to her own opinions. We have stated 
here in this act the position of the government which is that hate 
motivation is going to be dealt with more strongly in the 
criminal code. That speaks volumes for the position of the 
government.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice has stated and fully intends to bring 
forward amendments to the Human Rights Act in the next few 
months. I would hope that the hon. member will look upon these 
as a major step forward. I cannot possibly predict what is going 
to be in the legislation.
<P>
	I do feel this government is moving in a direction that is very 
creditable. Its record is going to indicate that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
congratulate my colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Justice, for his remarks to this House today. Over the 
past six years I have often approached my experienced and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5917"> 5917 </A></B>
<P>
learned colleague for advice on the issues we have been 
addressing.
<P>
	I appreciate his and our minister's belief that the sentencing 
practices in Canada must be responsive to the concerns and 
values of Canadians. For the most part Bill C-41 reflects the 
government's commitment to a fair and balanced justice system, 
hence my support for it.
<P>
	I am here to represent my constituents from Hamilton West 
and others across this country. My support is for victims of 
violence and their demands that section 745 be repealed.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	This is not a new subject for the parliamentary secretary in 
discussions we have had in the past. It is a courageous first step 
that our minister is going to permit the victims of violence to 
make their impact statements at those judicial reviews. It was a 
curious statement by the parliamentary secretary that it was a 
tremendous impact on judicial reviews. A tremendous impact 
how? What is the aim of that statement? What would result if a 
victim had their say?
<P>
	Can the parliamentary secretary to the minister explain why 
section 745 would not be completely repealed, and if at 
committee there is proof in the pudding-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I believe in trying 
to facilitate each member's ability and opportunity to engage in 
debate and I do not want to take up much time either here 
because the purpose of my getting up is to try and keep the 
debate going because we have gone a little too long. I would ask 
the parliamentary secretary for a very brief response, otherwise 
I will be on my feet once again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think I can reply to that very quickly.
<P>
	The difference is in having the actual response of the victims. 
Before there may have been a document which said what this 
person did, the person being reviewed, that he or she is being 
reviewed because of such and such and this is what they did. 
When you have the victims there to actually state from their 
point of view what happened to them or a member of their family 
or a neighbour, that has tremendous impact. Those of us who 
have been to committees to hear the actual stories from the 
people who were the victims have seen a monumental difference 
in how we feel on a particular point.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to have this opportunity to speak on Bill C-41.
<P>
	Canadians across the land are genuinely concerned about their 
criminal justice system. The law-abiding citizen looks to this 
House for common sense to ensure the passage of legislation 
which protects them and not the criminal.
<P>
	Having said that, there are a couple of areas in Bill C-41 that I 
can support. The provision regarding victim impact statements 
is long overdue, and the parliamentary secretary just waxed 
eloquently on that. Victims must be permitted to make 
representations at hearings held to determine whether the court 
imposed period of eligibility for parole should be changed. I am 
also in favour of the part of Bill C-41 that will enable the courts 
to order offenders to make restitution to victims of their crimes. 
Finally the victim is getting some consideration from a system 
which has not served the interests of Canadians.
<P>
	Unfortunately Bill C-41 does very little to address the real 
problem that plagues the law-abiding citizens of Canada. It 
appears that a criminal justice system does not even exist. What 
we have is a legal industry dominated by lawyers and judges 
who play a bureaucratic game with laws which tend to serve the 
criminal, not the public.
<P>
	Since being elected as member of Parliament for Yellowhead 
my office has been inundated by constituents' concerns about 
our so-called justice system. They are frustrated with a system 
that bends the law for criminals and does little to protect and 
serve the community. As far as the majority of my constituents 
are concerned, offenders convicted of violent crimes, those 
whose crimes impact violently on others, should be stripped of 
their rights. I share their views. The commission of violent 
crimes against others is a violation of society and those who 
choose to engage in these acts should not be a part of it.
<P>
	Mary Waites is one constituent of mine who has seen the law 
up close and personally and she did not like the view one bit.
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	Her son Julian was one of Canada's most wanted criminals for 
his involvement in a violent sexual assault earlier this year. 
Julian and another man are alleged to have brutally raped a 
woman at knifepoint.
<P>
	Mrs. Waites wants her son put behind bars indefinitely 
because he is extremely dangerous to the community but Mrs. 
Waites knows the courts will eventually let her son back out on 
the streets so that he can continue to commit heinous crimes 
against innocent people.
<P>
	Why does she know this? She has seen her son breeze through 
the court system time after time on charges of armed robbery, 
assault with a weapon and possession of stolen property.
<P>
	He has a violent past. Twice during robberies Julian drew 
blood by holding knives to his victims' throats. He served 
sporadic jail terms but was always released. He will be released 
again I suspect.
<P>
	Is this justice? Bill C-41 does nothing to ensure that 
dangerous repeat offenders like Julian Waites remain behind 
bars.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5918"> 5918 </A></B>
<P>
	Margo Gurgens is another constituent of mine who has seen 
the legal system serve the criminal. Her younger brother was 
stabbed to death at the hands of Tim Mead. Mead was originally 
charged with second degree murder but when the legal people 
got their hands on the case, a guilty plea to a lesser charge of 
manslaughter was accepted.
<P>
	For killing a man Tim Mead received six months 
imprisonment. Again our so-called justice system failed. Mead 
has been convicted of committing crimes against society since 
1980. I suspect he will be back on the streets six months after 
killing someone. Is that justice?
<P>
	Again, Bill C-41 does nothing to keep dangerous repeat 
offenders like Tim Mead from posing a threat to society. If the 
afore mentioned two cases are not enough to show how 
inadequate our criminal justice system is I ask members to 
consider the following.
<P>
	In 1981 Norma van Gundy returned home on the weekend 
from hairdressing school to visit her family and friends. The 
youthful 17-year old met up with an old friend and through him 
she met Larry Read. At the end of the evening Norma's friend 
asked her if she would take his car and drive him and Read home 
because they had had too much to drink.
<P>
	Norma felt obliged to help. She dropped her friend off and 
proceeded to take Read home. On the way home Read from the 
back seat of the vehicle viciously strangled Norma to death. 
Read then raped Norma's body in the car before driving himself 
home. He parked the car with the windows rolled up and left 
Norma's naked body in the back seat to freeze in the 30-degree 
below night air.
<P>
	For this horrific crime Read was convicted of second degree 
murder but the judgment was appealed and the charge was 
reduced to manslaughter. Read spent only six years in prison but 
the story does not end there, sadly.
<P>
	When he was released on parole Read made his way to another 
town where he became friends with a single woman and her 
9-year old daughter. On a day when the mother was not home 
Read paid a visit to her house where her child was alone with 
their 12-year old babysitter.
<P>
	The unsuspecting girls let Read in the door and their 
nightmare began. Read lured the two children to the basement, 
tied them up and beat them. He then took the girls for a ride in 
his car where he raped both of them. The psychopath took a knife 
to the 9-year old girl.
<P>
	She required 120 stitches to her genitalia. Read is in prison 
again. The system will undoubtedly fail the law-abiding public 
again. He will eventually be released.
<P>
	The shocking part of the story is that Larry Read brutally 
raped a woman before he murdered Norma and before he 
violated the young girls. This is our criminal justice system. It 
made sure Larry Read had his rights. Where was the criminal 
justice system for Norma van Gundy and the two little girls? 
Where is the criminal justice system for the families of these 
victims which are  forever scarred by these acts of violence to 
their loved ones.
<P>
	Bill C-41 does not do anything to protect society from the 
Larry Reads out there. Bill C-41 will not prevent sick, twisted 
individuals from reigning terror on innocent people. Bill C-41 
is just another piece of democratic legislation, a band-aid 
attempt to fix an outrageously flawed criminal justice system. 
The point to be made is this. The Liberal government has been in 
power for almost one year. It has done nothing significant to 
change the way crime is dealt with in this country. To an 
increasing number of Canadians that is perhaps the biggest 
crime of all.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to 
the hon. member's intervention. In my riding of Parkdale-High 
Park in Toronto my constituents are very concerned at the trend 
where streets are becoming more unsafe instead of being safer.
<P>
	This is why the minister has come up with some tools to 
combat crime in the streets, to reduce the drug trade, to prevent 
the violent sex offender from threatening the community. We 
can all get up and recite horror stories one after another. Is this 
going to prevent an increase in crime?
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member of the Reform Party this. 
Does he have any constructive amendments to this bill? This is 
why we debate, so that opposition parties and members from our 
own party can improve the bill. The government would be very 
interested in any constructive amendments that the hon. member 
can make to improve the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yellowhead):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for his question.
<P>
	We cannot support the bill. Even though we support some 
aspects of the bill we will not be supporting it. It contains too 
many things we do not support and that we see will really do 
nothing to solve the stories that have been talked about and to 
the stories that I have just related.
<P>
	We need deterrents that will work. We could move 
amendments but we would be whistling in the dark. We could 
move an amendment to introduce capital punishment or corporal 
punishment as my colleague suggested. Maybe we will just do 
that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member indicated that there are a number of 
provisions in the bill that he can support and there are others 
which he cannot support.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member specifically, what is the 
position of the Reform Party or the hon. member himself, if 
there is not a position in the party, with respect to the provisions 
in the bill that would ensure that a sentence is increased in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5919"> 5919 </A></B>
<P>
circumstances in which an  offence is motivated by among other 
factors sexual orientation?
<P>
	The hon. member was present in the House when the Liberal 
member of Parliament for Central Nova made comments, among 
other things, suggesting that homosexuality is immoral and 
unnatural, when she suggested that AIDS was a scourge to 
mankind which had been inflicted upon the country by 
homosexuals.
<P>
	In view of the response of at least some of the hon. member's 
colleagues from the Reform Party seeming to indicate support 
for those positions, would the hon. member indicate what is the 
position of the Reform Party with respect to these provisions of 
the bill that would ensure stiffer sentences for those hate crimes 
which are motivated by homophobia, which are motivated by 
hatred on the basis of sexual orientation. Does he share the 
views of the hon. member for Central Nova?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yellowhead):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
rise and agree wholeheartedly with what the hon. member from 
Nova Scotia said in the House some time ago. I agree with her.
<P>
	As to the increase in sentence if it can be determined that a 
crime is motivated by hate, I cannot agree with that personally 
because I do not know how you can go about determining that. It 
seems to me it would be a nightmare for people but of course a 
haven for lawyers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I certainly hear the hon. member when he expresses frustration 
on the part of the public in relation to portions of our criminal 
justice system. Certain offences and actions by criminals are 
abhorrent to all of us. I heard him say he can support some 
elements of the bill but surely there is more to this bill than a few 
unrelated sections.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	Would the hon. member not agree that this bill, which for the 
first time in Canadian criminal legislative history codifies the 
principles for sentencing, a just, peaceful, safe society, respect 
for the law, imposing just sanctions, et cetera, is not a positive 
step forward?
<P>
	In the absence of this kind of a bill would we not be simply on 
the same treadmill we have been for the last 75 years, without 
the benefit of those principles that can provide direction to our 
judges who carry the burden of sentencing in our courts.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yellowhead):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would suggest 
that they just do not go far enough. They will not act as a 
deterrent and the punishment is still not there for the crimes that 
I described and that we hear about every day.
<P>
	There is too much going on and that is just not specific to the 
riding I represent. In fact my constituency has a lower crime rate 
than a lot of other ridings. Multiply that by all the ridings across 
the country. I mentioned only a few of the incidents in 
Yellowhead. The bill does not go far enough. It does nothing to 
deter. We have to get stronger, tougher laws so that people will 
think twice before they engage in a criminal activity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member 
for Yellowhead refers to the hate provisions in the bill, which I 
very strongly support and which the majority of my colleagues 
in the Liberal caucus support.
<P>
	He says he does not understand how judges could tell if a 
crime was motivated by hate. Let me suggest that if the Heritage 
Front, or the neo-Nazis were to attack a visible minority group, 
and say they want to keep this country white, it is a pretty good 
bet that we are talking about hate.
<P>
	I really wish that the issues of crime and punishment and 
justice were as simplistic as the Reform would like to believe. 
When the parliamentary secretary asked for constructive 
amendments we got capital punishment, corporal punishment, 
longer sentences, more jails.
<P>
	Those things do not work. They have not worked. That is what 
is so important for the members of the Reform Party to get their 
minds around.
<P>
	The things they are talking about have been tried and are 
being practised in societies like the United States. They were 
practised in all the repressive regimes in the history of mankind. 
They have not worked. There is unanimous agreement among 
people who know the complexities, as well as victims, as well as 
volunteers in the system, on what has worked.
<P>
	When I raised the issue before, one of the Reform members 
said that it was an elitist kind of idea as well as an inexperienced 
kind of idea. It is so clear that it is not just the experts. It is 
people in the community who have any involvement, be it with 
victims, be it with offenders. They are saying the present 
approach is not working.
<P>
	The direction this bill sets in place was what was tabled by the 
committee on justice on crime prevention and community safety 
which had victim groups agreeing with it, which had 
professionals in the system agreeing with it, which had police 
officers agreeing with it.
<P>
	The member mentioned that he has one of the lowest crime 
rates in his community. The community I come from, the 
Waterloo region, has one of the lowest crime rates in Canada. 
We have a task force called the crime prevention and community 
safety task force. It is headed by the regional chief of police, 
Larry Graville. The police officers on that committee are the 
ones who pushed the strongest for new approaches because they 
said that the old methods have not worked. We have to look 
beyond just enforcement, we have to look at the root causes of 
crime.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="5920"> 5920 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	The issues are not ones that are going to be solved 
simplistically. The old approaches, the approaches that are 
practised in the United States where some states have capital 
punishment and sentencing which goes back hundreds of years, 
where they incarcerate more people than anybody else in the 
free world and they have the worst crime rate in the free world. 
They do not compare to Canada. The only thing we receive from 
the Americans is all of the television news that shows how 
violent their society is.
<P>
	I say to the members of the Reform Party: Do not pander to 
those misconceptions. If they insist on doing that, all they are 
going to be doing is fueling crime. People will believe that their 
communities are not as safe as they are. Let me say that our 
communities are a lot safer than they are in the United States. If 
we were to undertake some of these reforms we could go further. 
We could go toward the European model.
<P>
	Therefore the answer is not simplicity. The answer is trying to 
understand and deal with the complexity of the issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yellowhead):</B> I do not know, Mr. Speaker, 
did he want me to reply to that? If I would I could be standing 
here for quite awhile and, Mr. Speaker, you would rise as well.
<P>
	In so far as hate motivated crime is concerned I did not 
mention that in my speech. I will say that it would promote a 
two-tiered system. Is vicious assault less serious than assault 
just done for kicks? What about equality before the law? Assault 
is assault regardless of motivation.
<P>
	The member talks about the high crime rate in his riding. I 
suspect that if-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It is low in that riding.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yellowhead):</B> It must be a good community 
because it sure did not happen because of the system of justice 
that he promotes.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The time for questions 
and comments has terminated. I would suggest, if the House 
would agree, that I see the clock as being 5.30 p.m. and move to 
Private Members' Business. Is it agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 5.30 p.m. the 
House will now proceed to the consideration of Private 
Members' Business as listed on today's Order Paper.
<P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="UNEMPLOYMENTINSURANCEACT">UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from April 21 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-218, an Act to amend the Unemployment Insurance 
Act (excepted employment), be now read a second time and 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Tremblay (Rosemont):</B> Mr. Speaker, the purpose 
of this bill put forward by my colleague, the hon. member for 
Saint-Hubert and Official Opposition critic for justice, is to 
redress a major injustice in the existing Unemployment 
Insurance Act with regard to spouses, children and relatives 
employed by small family businesses.
<P>
	By the initiative she has taken in face of a government with a 
wait-and-see attitude that multiplies reviews and consultations, 
and introducing this bill, the hon. member for Saint-Hubert has 
clearly proven that where there is a will to act swiftly, there is a 
way and you can cut the idle talk and truly promote the 
development of family business.
<P>
	Let it be said that paragraph 3(2)(c) of the Unemployment 
Insurance Act that this bill is meant to eliminate puts spouses, 
children and relatives working for a family business in the 
position of actually being deemed potential UI abusers.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	Tell me one thing: why are spouses, children and relatives 
denied the presumption of innocence the rest of the workforce 
enjoys? Their only fault is to support through their work the 
efforts of an entrepreneur to whom they are related. Why force 
them to prove their honesty to Revenue officials instead of 
recognizing them a right every other worker automatically 
enjoys?
<P>
	Nearly one million Canadians, of which 650,000 are women, 
are subjected to this unfair treatment while the Minister of 
Finance continues to want us to believe he wishes to promote the 
development of small business. If he is sincere-which he may 
be-he will unhesitatingly support this bill.
<P>
	As you know, this government has been saying for months 
that it is going to reduce the bureaucratic red tape to a minimum 
for small business. Here is a golden opportunity to prove it 
means to act by supporting this bill introduced by my colleague. 
Otherwise, it will be clear that its main motivation is appealing 
to voters but when the time comes to act, it would rather consult 
and take orders from big business.
<P>
	We all know that owners of budding businesses need the 
support of their families to overcome the enormous difficulties 
associated with starting up and developing a business. We also 
know they find absolutely disheartening the slow governmental 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5921"> 5921 </A></B>
<P>
process, and particularly the bureaucratic loops they are forced 
to  jump through. I think that the commitment the government 
has made in that respect meets the wishes of the public, but what 
the public is expecting now is action. And action is what this bill 
is about.
<P>
	The bill provides the government with an opportunity to 
translate its promises into action and this is a chance I hope it 
will not miss. But if they do miss it, I can assure you we will be 
here to remind them over and over.
<P>
	Some will say that this unfair provision of the Unemployment 
Insurance Act is meant to curb abuse. Let it be quite clear that 
we all agree to curb abuse. This is indeed desirable. But, to do 
so, is it necessary to assume that a whole class of citizens are 
potential UI abusers? Is abusive use more tolerable on the part of 
bureaucrats than on the part of the unemployed? Are 
bureaucrats' abuses less costly than those of the bureaucracy 
itself? It is far from obvious, as I am about to show you.
<P>
	Between 80 and 90 per cent of the spouses, children or parents 
who went through the whole process imposed by this act won 
their cases, and if the others had appealed, this percentage might 
be even higher. So can you explain to me why, after realizing 
that those who followed the process succeeded in having their 
rights recognized, we continue to put so much red tape in their 
path when the energy they spend on this could be used to make 
their businesses more successful?
<P>
	The Unemployment Insurance Act has become increasingly 
linked to the whole issue of job training access. It is not only a 
matter of benefits. We are in the process of turning the 
unemployment insurance system into a permanent system for 
training and re-training workers. We are thus depriving these 
people of the right to benefit from training programs because 
many of the programs offered require that trainees be entitled to 
UI. People who set up family businesses often need job training. 
They often have a basic idea, are determined and have managed 
to raise enough capital, but often need the training offered by 
these programs.
<P>
	By refusing them protection under the Unemployment 
Insurance Act, we deprive them of the right not only to collect 
benefits but also to receive job training. And this is an extremely 
important factor in the success of small businesses.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	If my riding for instance, they set up economic and 
community development corporations specifically aimed at 
promoting entrepreneurship. So, on the one hand, we put in 
place programs to promote entrepreneurship while, on the other 
hand, we let red tape discourage just about everybody.
<P>
	According to all the surveys, the priority all small businesses 
agree on, other than the need for capital, is that they must be 
allowed to work and given access to what they are entitled 
without having to walk through endless corridors only to find in 
the end a bureaucrat with the discretionary power to decide 
whether or not they have that right.
<P>
	It is an excessive measure. In order to keep abuses in check, 
we penalize 80 per cent, 90 per cent, even 95 per cent of the 
people honestly trying to create jobs and develop our economy. I 
think that if we want to foster the confidence that will enable us 
to promote entrepreneurship, we must take concrete action. So 
far we have only heard speeches from the government; I hope 
that all members and parliamentarians will support my 
colleague's bill.
<P>
	I can assure you that we, in the Bloc Quebecois, consider 
family businesses to be major players in job creation and 
economic development. We just gave concrete proof that we can 
take action. We will continue to do so and honestly hope that the 
government will support this commendable initiative from my 
colleague, the hon. member for Saint-Hubert.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the opportunity to comment on the private member's bill before 
the House. I hope to put the hon. member's mind at ease and to 
assure the House the government is committed to women and to 
their concerns.
<P>
	I begin by stating unequivocally that I admire the hon. 
member's motivation in presenting Bill C-218. She perceives 
an injustice which she believes must be addressed. Surely this is 
the mission of each of us as representatives of the people. Every 
one of us is charged with a duty to ensure that the rights and 
privileges of all Canadians are respected.
<P>
	The values and principles upon which our social security 
system are founded are part of what makes Canada so distinct. It 
is one of the reasons we have again been named by the United 
Nations as the number one country in the world in which to live.
<P>
	Our social security net has been established purposely to 
protect those least able to fend for themselves, and 
economically disadvantaged women are certainly one of the 
government's priorities.
<P>
	I absolutely agree with the hon. member that if discriminatory 
regulations are found within the act they must be removed. 
However I want to make it abundantly clear to the House that the 
government is open to and committed to reviewing all aspects of 
our social security programs and to correcting flaws wherever 
we find them. It is precisely with that purpose in mind that we 
are undergoing the social security review.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5922"> 5922 </A></B>
<P>
	The government acknowledges that our programs are far from 
perfect. Some may have outgrown their usefulness. Others have 
not kept pace with the times. In fact we recognize that in some 
cases our programs are not working well at all.
<P>
	The basis for reforming our social security system is that we 
want to be sure the system is providing the appropriate supports, 
not penalizing people trying to help themselves. We want to 
knock down the barriers that prevent people from fully 
exploiting every opportunity to achieve dignity and 
self-sufficiency.
<P>
	It is important the hon. member bring her concerns about this 
one piece of the overall puzzle of what is wrong with our present 
structure to a forum where all Canadians can help find the right 
fit. There is no point at this time in patching up a system that is 
clearly out of date and no longer capable of meeting our current 
needs, so I invite her to join us in the larger debate on social 
security reform.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	In the meantime I should like to respond to a few points raised 
in Bill C-218 that I think must be clarified. I believe the hon. 
member may have come to the wrong conclusion about the 
government's attitude toward people in family businesses.
<P>
	Let me remind the House it was precisely to address the 
problem of sexually discriminatory regulations that the act was 
amended a few years ago by the previous government. It was not 
so long ago that employed spouses were automatically 
disqualified from receiving UI benefits simply because of their 
family status. Clearly families that work together were put at a 
disadvantage by the government and thankfully such antiquated 
thinking is far behind us.
<P>
	How does the system work today? The Unemployment 
Insurance Act stipulates that workers related to their employers 
are covered and are eligible for UI benefits if they qualify as any 
other worker would. In other words, each and every employee of 
a family operated business has equitable access to 
unemployment insurance protection. Like any other claimant 
seeking social assistance employees in such cases must satisfy 
certain criteria. The determining factors are rate of pay, 
conditions and length of employment, as well as the type and 
importance of the work.
<P>
	These are not new eligibility requirements. The same rules 
and regulations apply to all UI claimants regardless of their 
workplace or any association they may have with their 
employers. While family employees have the same rights, they 
also have the same obligations under the current law as all other 
Canadians. Otherwise the legislation would indeed be 
discriminatory. Workers who are related employers are assured 
the same protection as those with a strictly business 
relationship. If there is a clear employer-employee association 
that the act calls an arm's length working relationship everyone 
is treated equally.
<P>
	Furthermore the fact is that the vast majority of Revenue 
Canada's decisions on arm's length relationships in family 
businesses do work to the individual's favour. Over the past four 
years since the regulations were amended family businesses 
have fared well under the Unemployment Insurance Act. Tens of 
thousands of employees of family firms, up to 90 per cent of all 
claimants who are in arm's length relationships, have received 
the benefits to which they are entitled.
<P>
	It is very obviously the nation's business to be concerned 
about women in business. We know, for instance, that more 
women than men run small businesses and that those companies 
now provide more new jobs than large corporations. We also 
know that women are extremely successful in keeping their 
companies running.
<P>
	It is frequently women who need to hire staff as their 
businesses expand. Many women want to employ their family 
members. As the law now reads, provided they are in an arm's 
length relationship those family members can expect to be able 
to pay into and collect from the unemployment insurance 
program if and when they are entitled to, if and when their wife 
or mother lays them off or if and when their father or husband 
lays them off.
<P>
	Many working couples are opting to start their own operations 
as a way to juggle work and family time, another serious issue 
facing many Canadian families. More and more parents, male 
and female, are making a home based business the career of 
choice as the way to balance professional and family 
responsibilities. They too can rely on UI if and when the need 
arises and they meet the criteria.
<P>
	The reality is that women are frequently compelled to step 
into the workforce to respond to family demands, particularly 
taking care of dependants. It is usually women in the so-called 
sandwich generation who care for either their children or their 
parents and all too frequently both.
<P>
	For this reason the government recently changed the UI act to 
take these special circumstances into account. The dependency 
benefit rate has increased UI benefits to 60 per cent for people 
with low incomes who have a dependant or have a spouse with a 
dependant. It is one of the measures we introduced to address the 
inequities of the existing system.
<P>
	The hon. member is quite right. There are many challenges 
confronting working Canadian women that need much closer 
examination. I have every confidence if there are oversights 
which need correction or outright discrimination which 
disfavours women they will be addressed through our social 
security review. I am committed to making sure that this is the 
case.

<P>
	There will be ample opportunity in the months ahead to debate 
the merits and drawbacks of the current legislation as we 
grapple with the new realities facing Canada's social welfare 
structure. We must work together to improve Canadians' quality 
of life. I look forward to the hon. member's joining us in that 
cause.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North):</B> Mr. Speaker, back in 
April my colleague, the member of Parliament for 
Yorkton-Melville, outlined some very good reasons for not 
supporting this particular bill. I would like to briefly review 
those reasons before providing some thoughts of my own.
<P>
	The changes proposed by the hon. member for Saint-Hubert 
would amend the Unemployment Insurance Act be revoking the 
arm's length provision used by unemployment insurance 
adjudicators to determine if family members employed by other 
family members are in a true employer-employee relationship 
and therefore insurable and eligible to collect UI benefits should 
they be laid off. This includes employment by husbands and 
wives, mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters.
<P>
	Therefore, as I understand it the net effect of this bill would be 
to allow all family members employed by their immediately 
relatives, mainly husbands and wives, to become eligible to 
collect UI benefits without giving the government any means of 
determining if the employer-employee relationship is 
legitimate.
<P>
	Government officials predict that this change would result in 
at least 3,750 additional claims for unemployment insurance 
being allowed each year. Considering that the average benefit 
paid to each UI claimant in 1992 was $6,613 we are talking 
about a minimum annual increase in UI payouts of about $25 
million. These figures were confirmed by the office of the hon. 
member who is proposing this bill.
<P>
	Reformers oppose this bill for the following reasons. There 
are four of them. First, it opens up the Unemployment Insurance 
Act to yet another avenue of abuse and waste of taxpayers' 
dollars at a time when we should be tightening up the system, 
tightening up the loopholes and saving employers' and 
employees' UI premiums to cover UI claims by workers and 
families hardest hit by today's high unemployment.
<P>
	Second, it would increase payout of UI benefits by many 
millions of dollars.
<P>
	Third, it directly contravenes Reform Party policies which 
support elimination of fraud and abuse on returning UI to true 
insurance principles.
<P>
	Fourth, spouses employed by their partner already have an 
advantage over other Canadians because they can split their 
income and reduce their taxes. Reformers support income 
splitting for all married couples, not just those running their own 
business.
<P>
	I would now like to respond to some of the rationale used by 
the hon. member for Saint-Hubert when she spoke during the 
first hour of debate on this bill. The hon. member said the 
current law presumes that family members who work for their 
relatives are guilty of defrauding the UI account and must prove 
they have a legitimate employer-employee relationship with 
their husband or wife, mother or father, brother or sister.
<P>
	Reformers say this is simply a reasonable safeguard in a 
system in which there is real potential for abuse. I must point out 
that Revenue Canada identifies over 3,750 UI claimants a year 
who are denied benefits because they do not work in a true 
employer-employee relationship and are denied benefits as a 
result.
<P>
	The hon. member says the current law discriminates against 
women, not technically but socially because most of the people 
affected by this law are women. Reformers say that this 
particular section of the UI act is not discriminatory and is just a 
reality of small family businesses.
<P>
<B>(1750 ) </B>
<P>
	If a woman works for her husband in a small business, then 
she must be prepared to convince Revenue Canada that she is in 
fact in a true employee-employer relationship, not just hired on 
in fiction to add a nice windfall of UI benefits to the family 
income some time down the road.
<P>
	The investigations carried out by Revenue Canada on behalf 
of unemployment insurance every year identify significant 
abuse in this area.
<P>
	Why would we want to throw the door wide open to allow still 
more people to take advantage of the system. If this safeguard 
were not in the system there would undoubtedly be more abuse 
and many more millions of dollars wasted on bogus UI claims. 
The end result would cost workers and employers millions more 
dollars in UI premiums.
<P>
	I want to emphasize that these premiums would be funded by 
an increase in payroll taxes which come directly out of each 
worker's pocket. People not trying to take advantage of the 
system who are legitimately and truly employed by immediate 
family members are not penalized. Why should we not support 
rules to deny abusers the right to rip off other workers?
<P>
	The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human 
Resources Development also spoke against this bill in April. He 
told members of this House that of the tens of thousands of 
claims filed by employees of family businesses 15,000 had been 
reviewed by Revenue Canada and 25 per cent, the 3,750 claim-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5924"> 5924 </A></B>
<P>
ants I mentioned earlier,  were found not to qualify for UI 
because they were not in a true employer-employee 
relationship.
<P>
	Reformers agree with the government's concern about 
preserving the integrity of the unemployment insurance fund. 
Reformers think the current law is balanced and fair and must be 
maintained.
<P>
	Our policies are developed by ordinary members of our party. 
This is the policy these average Canadians have put in place 
concerning unemployment insurance: ``The Reform Party 
supports the return of unemployment insurance to its original 
function, an employer-employee funded and administered 
program to provide temporary income in the event of 
unexpected job loss''. Reformers encourage the government to 
get on with its efforts to reform the unemployment insurance 
system.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development promised an 
action plan in May, delayed it until June and then postponed it 
again until this fall. Yesterday in response to a question from our 
leader the Prime Minister said a discussion paper, not an action 
plan, will be released in October.
<P>
	Canadians are fed up with the waste, fraud and abuse in the UI 
program and they want it cleaned up. Canadians want action, not 
still more discussion. Reformers believe that Canadians want 
real reform of unemployment insurance, not just more liberal 
tinkering around the edges.
<P>
	Here are the issues Reformers believe are fundamental in any 
consideration of changes to the UI program. Do taxpayers, 
workers and employers think the UI program should be 
compulsory as it is now, or voluntary? Do taxpayers who are 
present employers think the government should continue to 
control the UI program or should unemployment insurance be 
administered by the employees and employers who pay the 
premiums?
<P>
	Would workers like to have a choice to invest their money in 
their own savings plan to protect them against unexpected 
unemployment rather than being forced to pay UI premiums?
<P>
	Would workers get a better return on their investment than the 
government run UI program offers them if they invested their 
money privately?
<P>
	Should the UI program be turned into a self-financing 
program administered by the employees and employers who pay 
the premiums with government safeguards?
<P>
	Should unions and employers be permitted to opt out of the 
government run UI program by establishing privately 
administered unemployment insurance programs for the benefit 
of their workers?
<P>
	We know that the hon. member who proposed this bill has a 
genuine concern for the plight of unemployed Canadian workers 
and their families but she will not help them by allowing their 
pockets to be picked by fictional employment arrangements 
allowing bogus UI claims.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	The UI program will take $19.8 billion this year directly out 
of the pockets of people trying to keep businesses afloat and 
people trying to earn a decent living. That is approximately 
$1,485 for every single Canadian worker covered by the 
unemployment insurance program.
<P>
	I have suggested some fundamental issues that ought to be 
addressed in order to design a reformed system that truly works 
for the benefit of those who are paying the big dollars to support 
it. Rather than increasing the burden on these working people, I 
urge the member to work with us to find ways to make the 
system more efficiently and effectively meet the very real needs 
of Canadians who suffered the distress and hardship of 
unexpected job loss.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi):</B> Mr. Speaker, it goes 
without saying that I rise to support Bill C-218 proposed by my 
colleague, the hon. member for Saint-Hubert.
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is to exclude, from the definition of 
excepted employment, employment where the employer and 
employee are not dealing with each other at arm's length.
<P>
	Contrary to what the government's spokespersons claim, we 
must not wait for a global reform of the legislation to act. We 
must immediately correct this injustice created by the previous 
Conservative government, which excluded spouses from being 
eligible to UI benefits. We know that this same government not 
only did not want to correct this injustice but went so far as to 
extend the scope of that provision. Indeed, it is no longer only 
spouses which are excluded, but all those who are not dealing 
with their employer at arm's length.
<P>
	I mentioned on several occasions in this House that the 
unemployment rate in my riding is very high. Chicoutimi and 
the Lower Saguenay region have often had the highest level of 
unemployment in the country, a distinction which they could 
gladly do without, believe me.
<P>
	In spite of the new government in Ottawa and the promises 
made during the last federal election campaign, the situation 
remains the same. Unemployment is still very high and our 
young people keep moving to large urban centres.
<P>
	It is not a happy event for people when they have to claim UI 
benefits. I do not know anyone who is happy to become a UI 
claimant and only get 55 per cent of his or her regular income. 
But it is even worse to be totally excluded for the reason that you 
are not dealing at arm's length with your employer. If you have 
worked for your parents, or if you are working for your spouse, 
you are perceived as a potential abuser and an inquiry is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5925"> 5925 </A></B>
<P>
conducted to see if your employment is insurable. These 
workers regularly show up in our riding offices.
<P>
	Understandably, they cannot figure out why their UI claim 
ends up at Revenue Canada, Taxation, for an inquiry. All this for 
the simple reason that these people worked for their parents or 
their spouse. In the majority of cases, the UI office does not tell 
people about this when they first submit their claim. Only once 
their file is transferred to Revenue Canada, some three weeks 
later, are these people told that officers from that department 
will conduct an inquiry, at the conclusion of which they will 
finally know whether or not they are eligible for UI benefits.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	Revenue Canada takes three months to determine the 
eligibility of a claimant. When you are waiting for money to buy 
the groceries and pay the rent, let me tell you that three months 
can seem like a long time. This procedure penalizes taxpayers in 
Saguenay, in Quebec, and in Canada in two ways. Quebec City 
processes the claims for my region. We just got Revenue Canada 
officials to sign their decisions so that taxpayers who wish to 
discuss their file can do so. Of course, these taxpayers have to 
pay all the costs they incur to contact these officials.
<P>
	Let me review briefly how these civil servants work. They 
have pretty extensive investigative powers and can ask to see the 
company's accounting books, ledgers, minutes of meetings, 
copies of cheques, and much more. They audit bank accounts 
and check with the suppliers. They are looking for people who 
cheat the system. What else would you call it? At least that is 
what the people under investigation believe.
<P>
	As often as not, we are dealing with very small businesses, 
family businesses whose owners hire their immediate family 
members. We often hear: ``Charity begins at home''. How many 
businesspeople among those who made it big started their 
businesses in their basement or garage with only their spouse or 
their sons and daughters as employees? There are a great number 
of success stories. Let me give you two examples everyone has 
heard about.
<P>
	First, there is the Louis Garneau company, and closer to my 
riding, the Chlorophylle corporation, two businesses which are 
now renowned all over the world. But before they can become 
this famous, a good number of our businesses operate on a 
seasonal basis, which means that their employees must apply for 
UI benefits. That is when the fun begins and the investigation 
gets under way.
<P>
	Think about all the people who are discouraged by the system. 
If Revenue Canada finds that your employment is not insurable, 
you must file an appeal. That means another delay, another 
90-day waiting period, not to mention all the costs you will have 
to incur for postage and long distance calls, for example. During 
the summer, I saw in my riding office a couple who were about to 
appear before the Tax Court of Canada. Although they had legal 
opinions to support them, the couple decided not to appear 
before this new court, because they were  tired and discouraged. 
They did not have the strength or the money to fight any more, 
unlike Revenue Canada which can afford lawyers.
<P>
	So, these people gave up. I sincerely believe that we have to 
support the bill introduced by the hon. member for Saint-Hubert 
if we want several of our family businesses to survive. God 
knows we need these businesses to fight the disastrous 
unemployment situation. Although everybody decries the 
situation, few suit their actions to their words. We must ensure 
that the people who still have the desire to achieve something, to 
create their own job, can survive.
<P>

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Lincoln):</B> Mr. Speaker, I start by thanking 
the hon. member from Saint-Hubert for bringing to light what 
she perceives to be a serious problem facing Canadian women. 
We respect that the hon. member is very knowledgeable about 
women's issues and is sensitive to the various forms of bias from 
which they suffer.
<P>
	This country is founded on the firm conviction that each and 
every citizen, regardless of gender, age, race or abilities has a 
right to receive a wide variety of health and social assisted 
services. It is our practice and not just our policy to ensure 
equitable access and respectful treatment in all our dealings 
with the citizens of this country. It is a part of our social 
heritage, an affirmation of Canada's commitment to human 
dignity. It is an expression of our dedication to the ideals of 
social justice, equality and personal security.
<P>
	I also want to make it crystal clear to the House and the hon. 
member that this government is open to reviewing any aspect of 
all our social programs, including the Unemployment Insurance 
Act. The obvious need to re-evaluate the efficacy of our social 
safety system is at the very heart of social security reform.
<P>
	This government was elected on a platform of creating 
opportunities for Canadians. In our view the social security 
review is crucial if we are to achieve that goal because 
ultimately, reform is nothing less than a response to a desire for 
change. It offers us a rare chance to redefine the values, the 
assumptions and working principles with which to deal with the 
questions of opportunities for all Canadians. Through this 
renewal process we will reach a consensus about what our 
priorities should be and how we can achieve them, given the 
money and tools available.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5926"> 5926 </A></B>
<P>
	I assure the hon. member there will be ample opportunity to 
carefully consider her concerns for the plight of economically 
disadvantaged women within this overall debate.
<P>
	Imposing conditions on the basis of gender would indeed be 
discriminatory, as would imposing restrictions on the basis of 
family status, but the current law does not do that. I think it 
would be helpful to look at just what section 3(2)(c) says. This 
provision of the Unemployment Insurance Act stipulates that all 
employees, regardless of gender or marital status, are assured 
the same protection. The law simply defines the kind of business 
relationship people must have before they can receive UI 
benefits.
<P>
	Every working citizen of this country, whether male or 
female, be they employed by a spouse, a sibling, a parent or a 
child, is eligible to pay premiums and to receive benefits so long 
as there is an employer-employee relationship. It is what the act 
calls an arm's length relationship.
<P>
	Unemployment insurance relies on Revenue Canada to 
determine what constitutes an arm's length relationship between 
employers and family members in their employ regardless of 
gender. More than four times out of five, Revenue Canada rules 
that a true business association does exist and payments are 
made accordingly. The record shows that people in need 
employed in family firms are obtaining their rightful benefits.
<P>
	In 1992-93 for example workers of family businesses filed 
tens of thousands of claims for unemployment insurance. Of 
those, 15,000 cases were reviewed and more than 75 per cent 
were accepted at face value with no questions asked. Of the 
remainder, a further three-quarters were eventually accepted. 
Only 10 per cent of claimants were unable to satisfy the criteria.
<P>
	I do not want to appear to downplay the possibility of 
discrimination in our legislation. Canadians justifiably demand 
dignity, respect and equality for all, an obligation this 
government is committed to fulfil.
<P>
	I should point out however that the provision being examined 
by Bill C-218 was included in the act precisely to remove 
objectionable regulations which did discriminate against 
married couples working in family businesses. Previously, 
employed spouses were automatically disqualified from 
receiving unemployment insurance benefits because of their 
family status. Paragraph 3(2)(c) has reversed that regulation and 
made the system more equitable. That is in keeping with the new 
reality in the workforce.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	As members of this House are well aware, women today play a 
crucial role in our economy, especially in the burgeoning small 
business sector. As the engine of national growth, women are 
clearly in the driver's seat. We know that more women than men 
start small businesses today in Canada and that those companies 
now provide more jobs than the large corporations.
<P>
	For more than a decade over 150,000 small businesses have 
been started each year. They account for some 90 per cent of all 
new jobs created annually in this country. We also know that 
women enjoy a very high success rate in keeping their 
companies running. Between 1975 and 1990 the ranks of 
self-employed women in Canada grew by a phenomenal 172 per 
cent compared with 50 per cent for self-employed men during 
that period. It is also a fact that a large number of these small 
companies are owned and operated by families, often employing 
spouses or other members of the immediate family. We want to 
do everything we can to ensure such progress continues.
<P>
	One of the objectives of our social security reform is to assure 
our social spending supports and nurtures women in business as 
they blaze a trail to the next century. If that means the 
Unemployment Insurance Act needs to be modified, so be it. 
When we make those changes, we will have to preserve the 
delicate balance between managing the program responsibly 
and ensuring that benefits go to those who need and are entitled 
to them.
<P>
	Taxpayers are counting on us to ensure the fair and equitable 
provisions of UI benefits. They expect that our social security 
supports should be flexible enough to accommodate workers' 
changing needs.
<P>
	Canadians want assurances that any changes to the system are 
implemented on the same principles of fairness and integrity, 
which have been the cornerstones of our society and system of 
government. That is precisely what we have been working to 
achieve.
<P>
	The hon. member is correct in pointing out that many women 
in our society are still in a position of economic disadvantage. It 
is certainly one of the primary issues which has prompted this 
government to want to undertake the social security review. 
However we will not sit idly by awaiting the outcome of that 
process. Work is already under way and we will continue to 
address some of these inequalities.
<P>
	In fact, we recently made adjustments to the Unemployment 
Insurance Act to increase UI benefits for low income parents. I 
am referring specifically to the dependency benefit rate. It is a 
provision that provides extra benefits to people who earn a low 
income and who support a dependant, or whose spouse supports 
a dependant.
<P>
	People qualifying under this category, most frequently 
women, are now eligible to receive 60 percent instead of the 55 
per cent benefit rate. This measure respects the important role 
women play within our families and supports them in that task. 
It recognizes that the person providing care for a dependant is 
contributing to the social and economic health of Canada and 
should be compensated accordingly.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5927"> 5927 </A></B>
<P>
	It is just one example of the ways we are attempting to better 
manage the social security system to make it more responsive to 
the realities facing Canadians. It is also proof of this 
government's commitment to a thorough review of all our social 
programs. We want to see where all of them should be updated 
and improved to prepare for the future.
<P>
	That is why the bill before us should not be considered in 
isolation. Rather, it has to be looked at in the context of the 
global process of recommendations and options being 
developed as part of the overall renewal of our social security 
system.
<P>
	That does not mean the hon. member should abandon her 
passion for the plight of economically disadvantaged women. I 
suggest she should instead take full advantage of the 
opportunities presented by the social security review to 
represent the interests of women.
<P>
	Members on the government side of the House are convinced 
that we can put our energies to the best use by working together 
to confront the full range of the very real and pressing problems 
that must be addressed. We invite the member for Saint-Hubert 
to join us in that process of reform.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réjean Lefebvre (Champlain):</B> Mr. Speaker, the current 
Unemployment Insurance Act was proclaimed on October 23, 
1990 with an extended section 3(2)(c).
<P>
	It maintains a hidden discrimination mainly against women 
whose regular work helps their spouses' business.
<P>
	The amendment now extends this discrimination to all close 
relatives of the employer but, in fact, wives are still affected the 
most.
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Liberal government advocates job creation 
and, to this end, gives greater importance to small and 
medium-sized businesses. The situation of these businesses is 
such that they sometimes must involve only the family, since, 
among other things, they need to minimize start-up costs and 
the family members can, if needed, make an additional effort.
<P>
	This is especially true for seasonal businesses. These need a 
flexible and very devoted staff to ensure a viable work 
organization in the short run.
<P>
	Spouses involved in an allegedly fraudulent 
employer-employee relationship should be considered just like 
employees who buy work weeks from their employer to 
complete their number of insurable weeks. This is more and 
more frequent and yet no discriminating provision adresses this 
issue in the law.
<P>
	On the other hand, in the insurance cases that concern us, the 
applicants have the burden of proving that their normal work is 
distinct from family activities. In effect, they must demonstrate 
to the civil servants processing their file that because of the 
volume of work, the wages paid, the conditions of employment, 
they should be  considered to be dealing with their employer at 
arm's length.
<P>
	Bill C-218 to amend the Unemployment Insurance Act must 
allow businesses to use the most qualified and available 
workers, whether they be family members or not. Of course, the 
government must remain vigilant and exercise effective control 
in order to prevent abuse. Cases of family relationships must be 
dealt with in the same way as any other unemployment 
insurance application. If there is a serious concern about fraud 
on the part of the client applying for benefits, the official of the 
Department of Human Resources Development will ask the 
Investigation and Control Office to look into the legitimacy of 
the request. On the other hand, a worker not dealing at arm's 
length with his employer is required from the outset to 
demonstrate that his situation is normal.
<P>
	To change this state of affairs the client must prove, by his or 
her own means, that he or she is not defrauding the system. It can 
often happen that this person must engage the services of a 
lawyer, and I can tell you that those who find themselves in this 
situation are not the wealthiest members of our society.
<P>
	In this regard, the act must recognize the true employee status 
of those who face this situation. Those people's work should be 
compared with that of individuals in similar positions in 
companies of the same sector, with a comparable level of 
activity and where the owner and employees are unrelated. We 
should consider the amount of work done, working hours, and 
salary in each company to determine whether the job could be 
held by someone who is unrelated to the employer.
<P>
	Small business people strive to reduce operating costs in 
order to survive. They will often set up their office in their own 
home, and tax deductions for that are accepted by Revenue 
Canada. Hiring one's spouse to perform certain tasks for the 
business is another way of reducing costs and minimizing 
supervision.
<P>
	I will now describe two cases of employers and employees 
with family ties. They live and work far from big cities in remote 
communities, where working from the family home is more 
frequent, where work is structured differently and not always 
done in office buildings, shopping centres, or plants.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	Section 3(2)(c) leaves the door open to interpretation on the 
part of the officers who have to administer it. At present, all 
applications where the employee and the employer do not deal at 
arm's length are examined individually by the Department of 
Revenue and the ruling depends solely on the officer's 
interpretation of the section of the Act and on his opinion 
concerning the operational context of the applicant's former job.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5928"> 5928 </A></B>
<P>
	Naturally, there are some criteria to be taken into account, but 
these are so broad that there are as many interpretations as there 
are officers administering the Act.
<P>
	Let us take for example the owner of a hunting and fishing 
equipment store, which is a seasonal venture, where the 
employer has a full-time job elsewhere. In order to ensure the 
proper operation of his business, he must have employees to 
look after the customers. Therefore, he hires two part-time 
employees for evenings and week-ends. To keep costs at a 
minimum, he sets up his store in a building adjacent to his place 
of residence and he hires his spouse as a replacement for him 
when he goes to work.
<P>
	The tasks of his spouse are equivalent to those of the other two 
part-time employees. Business hours are regular, the payroll 
record and the cheques issued are proof enough of the 
authenticity, the reliability and the regularity of the payroll and 
the hours worked. These items should be sufficient as references 
in the absence of any contract. But, because the work is done in 
the same building as the home, and given the fact there is a 
reason for dependence, the applicant was declared not entitled to 
benefits.
<P>
	Moreover, if we compare that with another company from the 
same area of activity and with a comparable volume of business, 
the company has to hire a full-time seasonal worker to do that 
kind of job. Of course, the job description, supervision and work 
control should also be part of the work agreement.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I would like to give you another example, in this 
case a forestry contractor from the northern part of my riding of 
Champlain. His workplace is in a forest area, quite far from his 
place of residence. For the needs of his company, he must set up 
a forest camp where approximately thirty people are working. 
To ensure the operation of the camp, and since he must be 
frequently absent, he must hire a supervisor, who happens to be 
his wife. She acts as the camp supervisor, as would anybody in 
such a business. But just because she is related to her employer 
and has no work contract, her employment is deemed 
uninsurable. If we compare these circumstances and the volume 
of work that has to be done, all this is similar to what an 
unrelated person would do.
<P>
	The act as it is presently written is open to much interpretation 
and subjectivity about an employee who is related to the 
employer. That employee is considered uninsurable.
<P>
	As you know, the Department of Human Resources 
Development lets the Department of Revenue decide on the 
interpretation and enforcement of clause 3(2)(c) of the 
Unemployment Insurance Act and forces the applicants to prove 
that the fact that they are members of the same family has no 
influence whatsoever on the nature and parameters of the work 
performed.
<P>
	That clause is discriminatory and its enforcement causes 
frustration among applicants. There are more and more 
administrative and judicial procedures and in spite of the 
amendment made in 1990 to the section we are dealing with, 
women who work with their spouses are still the most affected 
population group.
<P>
	Discrimination based on marital status jeopardizes 
co-operation and entrepreneurship in remote and sparsely 
populated areas, where employment is often of a seasonal 
nature. For many people, working for a relative is the only way 
to enter the labour force and for small businesses, it is the only 
way to get reliable and dedicated labour requiring little 
supervision.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
colleague from St-Hubert introduced on February 17 a bill 
which is close to my heart. It is close to my heart because, as a 
lawyer, I have a great deal of difficulty in accepting that some 
people are treated differently. We call that discrimination, not 
only in law but also in the dictionary.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	If bill C-218 introduced by my colleague is rejected by the 
House of commons, discrimination will continue, a large 
number of citizens will be treated inequitably.
<P>
	Since the Unemployment Insurance Act was passed-it 
received Royal assent on October 23, 1990-our party has 
denounced, in the House and outside, the aberrations it contains. 
Normally, according to Canadian legislation, we are all innocent 
until proven guilty and the burden of the proof rests with the 
accuser, that is the minister or the Crown in criminal matters.
<P>
	However, when an employee leaves his or her job, he or she 
must prove that it was not without compelling reasons, and the 
burden of the proof falls on the potential UI claimant. We are in 
a democracy and we are never guilty until proven so. This is 
what we call the presumption of innocence guaranteed by the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	The new Unemployment Insurance Act changed the rules of 
the game in 1990, and it allows some employers to abuse their 
employees and to require of them more work, extended working 
hours and total submission, a wholly unacceptable situation in a 
democratic society like ours. It is nothing short of blackmail!
<P>
	If an employee objects and leaves his or her job, that 
employee must prove that he or she had good reasons to do so. 
Worse, during the period of objection the former employee will 
find social assistance hard to get. Indeed, Quebec social 
assistance regulations do not permit the payment of any benefit 
as long as the official has not received an unqualified denial 
from unemployment insurance. So, Mr. Speaker, you can 
imagine that before quitting a job, employees may be abused by 
their employers for a very long period of time.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="5929"> 5929 </A></B>
<P>
	This is the reason why the Crown lost out under the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The various courts which were 
asked to rule in this matter, namely the human rights tribunal of 
the appeal division, the Federal Court, the Tax Court of Canada 
and the Supreme Court of Canada, all declared null and void 
former sections 3(2)(c) and 4(3)(d) of the act. Canadians won.
<P>
	It was to be expected since they were just as discriminatory, 
and that was the objective of Bill C-218 introduced by my 
colleague, the hon. member for Saint-Hubert, as denying 
benefits to a spouse working for her husband or a family-owned 
business. Whom was this piece of legislation aimed at 
especially? Women working for their spouses. This is another 
example of the legal subordination of women to their spouses.
<P>
	Under the circumstances, the previous Conservative 
government took steps to amend section 3.(2)(c) in accordance 
with these decisions. It had no other choice. From now on, not 
only spouses, but all workers not dealing at arm's length with 
their employers will be excluded. In this way, it may seem less 
discriminatory, legally speaking, as long as the courts have not 
ruled on the constitutionality of this amendment.
<P>
	But in reality, what does it mean to not deal at arm's length? It 
means that in all cases the presumption of honesty is from now 
on replaced by a presumption of fraud. It is now up to the 
employee to satisfy the official in charge-who is vested with 
discretionary powers-that the work contract met the same 
requirements as if the job had been given to someone who was 
not related to the employer.
<P>
	How many people will be left stranded without any income 
until a case is heard by the Supreme Court of Canada? This 
measure, I should say this injustice, concerns close to one 
million Canadians, 650,000 of whom are women. It is 
unacceptable.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	On going through Hansard of April 21 of this year, I noticed 
that an hon. member on this side of the House, but not from the 
Bloc, opposed the bill proposed by my colleague from 
Saint-Hubert by arguing that her proposal would lead to the 
filing of at least 2,000 supposedly unfounded unemployment 
insurance claims which would entail the payment of $13 million 
dollars. This is absurd.
<P>
	The unemployment insurance legislation was adopted-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. The hour provided for 
the consideration of Private Members' Business has now 
expired. Pursuant to Standing Order 93, the order is dropped to 
the bottom of the order of precedence on the Order Paper.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HUMANRIGHTS">HUMAN RIGHTS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to raise briefly or should I say provide a 
brief update on one of the obvious inconsistencies in the 
discourse and policy of this government, namely the 
relationship that may, and indeed must, exist between the 
Canadian foreign policy and human rights promotion.
<P>
	To address this contradiction we have no reason to be proud 
of, I shall refer to a question I had put to the Deputy Prime 
Minister on June 10. I asked the Deputy Prime Minister this 
question on June 10, following a visit by the Prime Minister in 
exile of Burma to the Standing Committee on Human Rights.
<P>
	We realized, as a standing committee responsible for the 
promotion of human rights both within Canada and outside, how 
much of a discrepancy there was between what this government 
said -all this talk about legislative instruments and active 
involvement outside the country being required to promote 
human rights- and reality.
<P>
	Such discrepancy is easy to understand considering that as 
early as 1990, the Canadian government had been pressing for 
democratic elections to be held in Burma, which is currently run 
by a military junta. Canada can be said to have participated in 
this international campaign for elections in Burma.
<P>
	We realized in the committee that, while Canada had lobbied 
for Burma to be requested to uphold human rights within its 
boundaries-because as we know, Burma is one of those Asian 
countries with the darkest, most worrisome history in that 
respect, a country where the Nobel Peace Prize winner is 
imprisoned, where torture is practised and very serious cases of 
abuse are reported-it also prohibited Canadian businesses 
from trading with Burma for reasons relating to human rights 
that we agree with. We believe that foreign policy and the 
promotion of human rights should be linked somehow.
<P>
	Imagine our surprise when we discovered that, in the case of 
China, there was a double standard. And yet China is the main 
country supplying arms to the military junta currently in power.
<P>
	The question we can ask ourselves is this: if Burma's human 
rights record is so important that Canadian companies are not 
allowed to do business there, why is China, which also commits 
its share of abuses, which is also inconsistent in promoting 
human rights-as the 1,200 executions recorded in Amnesty 
International's latest report demonstrate-not subject to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5930"> 5930 </A></B>
<P>
same policy? Must there be two types of countries from a 
political standpoint? The Canadian government will  overlook 
the human rights record of important countries with significant 
growth and large markets while imposing restrictions on 
countries with less impact on the international economy.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	I say that there should not be a double standard. The 
government must make adjustments and use the same language 
so that when we talk about promoting human rights abroad-and 
I think the government has a responsibility to talk about it-we 
should have exactly the same requirements for a country of 1.2 
billion people as for a country of 3 million inhabitants.
<P>
	This is-and I will stop here as my time is up-an example of 
an inconsistent policy the government has no reason to be proud 
of.
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to address the member's 
question directly. Canada's relations with Burma are limited 
because we remain concerned about the deplorable human rights 
situation and lack of progress toward democracy in Burma.
<P>
	Human rights abuses continue unabated and the military have 
made it clear that they will not relinquish power. Canada 
suspended its aid program in 1988 and military sales are not 
allowed to that country.
<P>
	Furthermore, the Canadian government does not encourage 
Canadian business activity in Burma. Petro-Canada pulled out 
of Burma in November 1992 and Canada has worked actively 
through bilateral and multilateral channels to promote 
democratic development and respect for human rights in that 
country.
<P>
	At the 1992 Association of Southeast Asia Nations 
Post-Ministerial Conference Canada called for an international 
embargo on the sale of military equipment to Burma, bearing in 
mind that country's lamentable human rights record.
<P>
	Canada made strong statements on Burma in its human rights 
speech at the United Nations General Assembly in December 
1992 and contributed to the resolutions on Burma at both the 
United Nations General Assembly and the 1993 United Nations 
committee on human rights. We continue to be very active at the 
UN third committee and the UN commission on human rights.
<P>
	We are among the larger donors of multilateral humanitarian 
assistance to Burmese refugees and we continue to press for the 
immediate release of Nobel peace prize winner Madam Aung 
San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SOCIALSPENDING">SOCIAL SPENDING</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am glad to return to an issue I raised in June with the 
Minister of Human Resources Development when I asked him 
what plans he had in place to ensure that Canadians and their 
families would not be subject to the level of poverty that they are 
presently subject to.
<P>
	We know from experience that Canada has to a very large 
degree eliminated poverty among its senior citizens. There is 
still a category of senior women who are subject to severe 
deprivation, but on the whole we have responded to that 
problem. We have essentially eliminated poverty among senior 
citizens, although quite clearly we have not done so with regard 
to our children. There are now 1.3 million children in Canada 
living in poverty, more than when this government took office. 
There are 2.3 or 2.4 million Canadians living on social 
assistance and 1.6 million living on unemployment insurance.
<P>
	We clearly have a major problem in terms of our economy not 
working for those four million Canadians and in particular for 
those 1.3 million children.
<P>
	In response to the minister when he talked about 
unemployment insurance-and I do not quite know why he did 
that-I want to return to the point that I made with him because I 
think Canadians need and this House deserves to know what 
specific plans the Minister of Human Resources Development 
has under way to eliminate poverty among young people and in 
particular young children. We know that this House in 1989 
unanimously committed itself to eliminating child poverty by 
the year 2000. We also know that this House is unlikely to see 
any improvements in that regard as long as we continue in the 
direction we are taking.
<P>
	All we have seen from this government are plans to cut 
billions of dollars from social programs spending at a time when 
Canadians are in record numbers experiencing difficulties.
<P>
<B>(1840 ) </B>
<P>
	We see a continuation of the Mulroney agenda where 
unemployment is blamed on the unemployed. The notion is that 
the problem is with the unemployed.
<P>
	If you look at the documentation presented by the minister, 
you will see that his response to unemployment is to say that 
there is a problem in the employability of Canadians, that they 
need more training, more skills and so on.
<P>
	We all know that we can do with more training. All of us in 
this House can do with more training. If there are no jobs for 
Canadians at the end of this training as is plainly the case at the 
present time, this training goes for naught. In particular the sort 
of training programs that have been put in place by this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5931"> 5931 </A></B>
<P>
government and other federal governments has cost enormous 
amounts of money to train the participants in the program.
<P>
	If we look at the works program, we see a huge drop-out rate 
in the program. We see a huge cost in terms of training those 
Canadians. We see this in the context of further deep cuts to 
social program spending. We do not need to move to an 
American approach to social programs, which this government 
is continuing. It is a trend that the Mulroney government 
introduced.
<P>
	We do not need that Americanized approach. We need a 
compassionate, caring approach. We need to look at countries 
that have been more successful than we have in dealing with 
those problems of poverty.
<P>
	As we all know, only the United States has a worse poverty 
problem than Canada in the industrialized nations. We should 
look to those European countries which have taken a very much 
different approach to this problem, an approach which has 
enabled more and more citizens to live in dignity.
<P>
	We have a choice in Canada. We can if we want to continue to 
slash programs as this government plans to do or we can instead 
focus on the core problem which is that we do not have enough 
jobs in this economy. This economy is not producing enough 
jobs for those Canadians who need them. We have no leadership 
in that regard.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Human 
Resources Development have said basically they will take a 
hands-off approach to this except for a couple of programs 
involving the youth and involving the infrastructure program. It 
has put some Canadians back to work but still left millions not 
working.
<P>
	They said they will take a hands-off approach and let the 
private sector develop those jobs. Over the last 15 years the 
private sector has simply not done that. The private sector has 
not created the jobs that Canada needs. It requires a concerted 
approach from the government in conjunction with the 
provinces, in conjunction with business and labour and the 
various communities across this country.
<P>
	The point I really want to make with the minister is that there 
is a need for urgency. We do have to come to grips with this 
problem of insufficient jobs in this economy. We cannot deal 
with the deficit unless we attack that problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
can tell the hon. member that since the October 25 election this 
government has worked very hard to bring about positive change 
in the lives of young people here.
<P>
	I am happy to report to the House that the unemployment rate 
for young people has decreased from 17.5 per cent in 1993 to 
16.4 per cent in August. This is a result of 20,000 new jobs that 
were created for youth and 29,000 young Canadians were no 
longer unemployed. This is just part of a package.
<P>
	The summer employment strategy for young people created 
approximately 60,000 jobs to give young people the skills 
required to be competitive in a very different world.
<P>
	We also moved quickly on the youth service Canada 
lead-sites. Seventy-five per cent of the 67 lead-sites are fully 
operational. We expect that the others will be operational 
shortly.
<P>
	We have also moved in the area of youth internship and 
apprenticeship training programs because we recognize as a 
government that we do live in an era where young people must 
be given tools to be competitive in a very competitive world 
marketplace.
<P>
	We have not forgotten of course the importance of staying in 
school and through our stay in school initiative with a budget of 
approximately $31.5 million, we expect to assist over 10,000 
young people through direct interventions this year, not to take 
lightly our contribution made to the Canada Student Loans.
<P>
<B>(1845 ) </B>
<P>
	A review took place and there again positive change to the 
legislation resulted in greater accessibility to funding for young 
people so that they could access post-secondary education. We 
as a government understand that higher education is necessary 
for us to compete.
<P>
	As members know, above and beyond that young people will 
be an integral component of social security review. I am sure the 
hon. member and his party will participate fully in this very 
historical event.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="NATIONALFORUMONHEALTH">NATIONAL FORUM ON HEALTH</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon):</B> Mr. Speaker, on June 8 I 
asked the Deputy Prime Minister to assure Canadians that her 
government would maintain and enforce the Canada Health Act 
and, further, for her government to release the terms of reference 
and timetable for the promised national health care forum.
<P>
	I suppose I have heard of no issue of more concern to 
Canadians across the country being discussed over the past few 
months when the House was not sitting than the future of health 
care. Seniors are worried about the future of health care. Others 
are worried about whether they will have the universal health 
care system of which Canadians have so rightly been proud.
<P>
	One promise of the Liberal government and specifically of the 
Prime Minister was that he would chair a national health care 
forum that would deal with these many issues and the changes, I 
assume, although we have seen no terms of reference. I would 
hope such a health care forum would also deal with the change 
that needs to take place in our health care system.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5932"> 5932 </A></B>
<P>
	Certainly as a New Democrat I am absolutely committed to 
the principles of universal, accessible health care for Canadians. 
However I am not adverse at all to changes within the Canada 
Health Act to guard the five principles of the Canada Health Act 
to make it more appropriate for Canadians.
<P>
	Three months after I asked the question of the Deputy Prime 
Minister we still do not have a date for the national health care 
forum. We do not have a clear statement from the government as 
to the expectations for this forum. The Liberal Party has 
committed itself to upholding the five principles of the Canada 
Health Act, but we need to have a really comprehensive vision 
for health care.
<P>
	The government's first budget, for example, was not a good 
sign of what was to come. The Conservative policy of freezing 
transfers to the provinces for health care continued. If this 
strategy continues there will be no federal funding for health 
care by the year 2015. Canadians want to hear the government 
say that it will not happen and that they will continue to have a 
universal health care system.
<P>
	Further to the issue of the national health care forum, if it is 
truly to be a forum to develop a new vision of health care it 
would be hoped that the terms of reference would include a wide 
spectrum of groups that would participate on this forum. It 
would also be hoped that it would include all provinces and 
territories.
<P>
	I would certainly like to know from the government 
spokesperson if the Prime Minister has any indication, since he 
will be the chair, whether all provinces will participate in a 
national health care forum. If not, will the Prime Minister be 
proceeding without the participation of all provinces?
<P>
	We have seen the government allow provinces to develop 
systems which do directly contravene the Canada Health Act. 
For example, the province of Alberta with its private clinics 
specifically contravenes section 12 of the Canada Health Act. I 
have asked the Prime Minister in the House to raise the issue 
with the premier of Albert with whom he is meeting today. The 
Prime Minister refused to say that he would do so and said that it 
would be done at some other time in some other place.
<P>
	That is not good enough for Canadians. Canadians want our 
national health care system to be a priority of the government 
and of all parliamentarians and a fundamental right as health 
care should be for Canadian citizens. It is also, I might add, one 
of the biggest supports for business in the country.
<P>
<B>(1850) </B>
<P>
	When will the national forum be? Will all provinces and 
territories participate? Will those provinces that are now 
contravening the Canada Health Act be dealt with by the 
government? When will we get an answer? When will the Prime 
Minister act?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, it would seem the hon. leader of the New 
Democratic Party must have read the press release of the 
Minister of Health which she sent out in June with regard to the 
forum. She just listed all the things that were mentioned in it. 
The forum, as indicated in the press release, is to be an ongoing 
four-year forum.
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLaughlin:</B> Let's start.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Fry:</B> It is going to begin in October, as the press release 
indicated. Of course it will involve federal and provincial 
relationships. It will involve public input and working groups 
that will deal with many of the issues the hon. member just 
raised in her question.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, please. I know 
these interventions are rather short, being four minutes on the 
one hand and two in which to respond. I am trying to facilitate 
everyone by giving them the opportunity to complete their 
remarks. I hope we allow the parliamentary secretary to 
conclude her remarks over the next two minutes.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Fry:</B> The mandate of the forum is to develop a vision for 
health care in the 21st century. It will create a dialogue among 
the public, federal, territorial and provincial governments for 
renewing the better health of Canadians. It will deal with and 
identify priorities concerning a consensus for change in all the 
provinces. At the same time it is determined to respect the five 
principles of health care upon which medicare was built.
<P>
	Obviously the forum will have to deal with issues such as 
setting guidelines for technology. It will have to deal with issues 
such as the aging society. It will have to deal with what kind of 
financing is required for a future health care system. All these 
things have been said by the minister in her press release in June 
and they will happen.
<P>
	With respect to the hon. member's question concerning the 
transfer of payments in federal financing, the member well 
knows the government has made a commitment to stable 
financing in health. We have made that commitment by not 
cutting transfer payments for this year.
<P>
	In the year 1995-96 we will begin to have our federal transfer 
payments financed on the gross national product minus 3 per 
cent. Given that we will still the following year be putting in 
$214 million more than we will be putting in this year, The 
population growth will be factored in and therefore the transfers 
will be increased according to population growth each year.
<P>
	One of the things we will be doing in financing is that we are 
not touching the tax transfers. This means a sizeable amount of 
money is still going to be put into provincial coffers with regard 
to financing the health care system.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="5933"> 5933 </A></B>
<P>
	The member well knows that the health care system does not 
only depend on-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I regret to interrupt 
the parliamentary secretary but the format of four minutes and 
two minutes is quite clear. I have been more than generous if we 
consider that we have only had three of the five interventions so 
far which would normally take in a very strict manner 18 
minutes. I guess I have been more than generous.

	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu):</B> Mr. Speaker, I asked for 
four minutes of speaking time for myself and two minutes for 
the parliamentary secretary to answer the question that I asked 
in June about mass layoffs. At that time, I asked the Minister of 
Human Resources Development and of Western Economic 
Diversification whether he agreed with giving the Sorel 
employment centre a $2.2-million fund because of the mass 
layoffs at Soreltex, Tioxide and Beloit in the Sorel-Tracy 
region.
<P>
	Further to that answer, this request for $2.2 million more was 
made by the employment centre through the normal channels at 
the regional level and then on to the national level, and the 
employment centre got a good hearing from senior officials.
<P>
<B>(1855) </B>
<P>
	I asked the minister to confirm it for me, and then had a 
second question concerning the specific program for mass 
layoffs that was abolished. The minister's first answer to me was 
completely off topic, referring to the fact that I had been a 
Conservative member. It was an arrogant, incompetent, 
flippant, almost cowardly answer, showing the minister's 
unconcern for the workers' needs and the respect owed them and 
his lack of attention to a recommendation from his own senior 
officials.
<P>
	Since I raised my second question, the Sorel employment 
centre received more funds to help the victims of mass layoffs, 
thanks to the remarkable work of senior officials in Sorel, the 
director of the employment centre and senior officials 
throughout the Quebec region. One thing that has not been 
restored is the specific program for mass layoffs.
<P>
	Now, when there are mass layoffs, the general fund is drawn 
on and if it is used up, the special fund is no longer available. 
Restoring this fund would provide assistance when a disaster 
like the one in Sorel-Tracy strikes, where there were two major 
shutdowns, Beloit and Soreltex, in quick succession. In that 
case, the general fund was used since the special fund is now 
included in the general fund and there was no more money. So 
we now have a situation where we have no way of getting back 
any funds to deal with the situation.
<P>
	It seems to me that reinstating this fund would be essential to 
good management. The minister's answer was vague, once 
again. As I see it, this mass layoff fund should not only be 
reinstated but should be flexible as well.
<P>
	For instance, a number of workers at Soreltex have from 25 to 
35 years of experience, but their average age is between 50 and 
55, so they are not eligible for POWA, the adjustment program 
for workers 55 and over, so they fall between the cracks, because 
they cannot be retrained. Often they do not even have a 
high-school diploma. They only went to grade school, and they 
cannot be retrained for work other than the kind they have done 
for 35 years.
<P>
	Perhaps this mass layoff fund could provide some form of 
remuneration for people between the ages of 50 and 55 who fall 
between the cracks, lose their homes and their savings and end 
up on welfare. That is why I think the fund should be reinstated 
and expanded so that employment centres can tailor the program 
to specific cases and are not hampered by criteria that are too 
restrictive.
<P>
	I hope that today, the minister will have a more open mind on 
the matter than he did when he answered my questions.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member must know by now that this government has 
demonstrated that it places a high priority on the training and 
adjustment needs of Canadians.
<P>
	As a matter of fact in the Sorel-Tracy region which he cited 
when companies such as Sorel Tex were having difficulties the 
Department of Human Resources Development intervened. In 
that case assistance was provided through the industrial 
adjustment service. It is recognized as a very effective program 
for assisting those individuals who are affected by major layoffs 
to make the adjustment to new employment opportunities.
<P>
	In addition I am pleased that the Department of Human 
Resources Development has recently freed up a further $54 
million in Quebec. These funds will provide a significant 
increase in the resources available to provide assistance to those 
individuals across the province of Quebec who require training 
and employment assistance in order to make the transition to 
new employment.
<P>
<B>(1900 ) </B>
<P>
	I am pleased also that $622,000 has been provided to the 
Sorel-Tracy region alone. This will assist individuals in this 
region to receive the necessary skills and training so that they 
can be once again reintegrated in the labour force.

	<B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a topic which is much less glamorous but is related to a 
question which I asked on June 20 of the Minister of Fisheries 
and Oceans.
<P>
	The question concerned what action the government was 
taking to fight the increase in sea lamprey eel population in the 
Great Lakes.
<P>
	I realize that this is not a topic which has a great appeal for 
someone who lives in a place like Airdlie, Alberta or Moncton, 
New Brunswick. At the same time I think it is important that all 
Canadians understand the importance of the Great Lakes and 
their ecosystems.
<P>
	Every year some 75,000 Canadians have jobs and some $2 
billion or more are generated simply as a result of the 
commercial and sports fishing industries which exist on the 
Great Lakes. Every year some 4 million sports people try their 
luck on the waters of this lake system.
<P>
	It is also important that we remember the recent past when the 
sea lamprey first appeared in the lakes and flourished at a rate 
which threatened the very existence of all fishing in the Great 
Lakes.
<P>
	The result of this predator, which came in from of the ocean 
when the seaway was opened, an eel which can live in fresh or 
salt water, was the absolute annihilation of commercial fisheries 
for a time in the 1950s.
<P>
	In the 1950s governments did react. Governments used the 
best technology of the time to combat and limit the population of 
eels in the lakes so that the numbers of certain species did in fact 
come back to an acceptable level where an industry could exist.
<P>
	As is often the case, there is a certain level of complacency 
which sets in at the government and at the naturalist level. It is a 
complacency from a governmental perspective in that dollars 
directed to controlling the sea lamprey remain flat and in some 
cases actually marginally decreased to the point that less was 
being done to control the populations of the sea lamprey.
<P>
	At the same time due to joint Canadian-American efforts 
water quality in the Great Lakes started to improve. We are all 
aware of the efforts taken to improve water quality. This opened 
up new habitats for lamprey eels. The combined result of 
improved water quality and less money for control has resulted 
in a real resurgence in lamprey populations.
<P>
	Naturalists have now confirmed that lamprey eels take more 
trout out of Lake Superior than do all the commercial sports 
fishermen on that body of water.
<P>
	Finally it is essential that this threat be always considered in 
light of the 75,000 jobs and the $2 billion plus generated by the 
fishing industry on the lakes.
<P>
	When I asked the question of the minister I was very pleased 
and surprised by his response that the government has acted to 
protect this industry and these jobs. The minister has recognized 
the seriousness of the problem and has moved to address it in a 
timely fashion.
<P>
	The government has increased funding to the Great Lakes 
fishery commission by one-third. The fishery commission, as 
some may realize, is a joint Canadian-American agency which 
deals with ecological issues in the Great Lakes system. We must 
however realize that this problem emanates from feeder rivers 
on both sides of the border.
<P>
	Canada has increased its contributions in a real and 
significant fashion. It is now necessary, indeed imperative, that 
pressure be brought to ensure that the American government 
will match the Canadian proportionate increase, failing which I 
would suggest that a multi-billion dollar industry and tens of 
thousands of jobs will continue to be threatened.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Parliamentary Secretary 
to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. 
member has noted, predation by sea lampreys is considered to be 
one of the major causes of the collapse of the lake trout and 
whitefish fisheries in the 1940s and 1950s.
<P>
	In response to this concern the Great Lakes fishery 
commission was created between the United States and Canada 
to find ways to manage sea lampreys and to develop a research 
program to sustain fish stocks in the Great Lakes.
<P>
	The Department of Fisheries and Oceans, which represents 
Canada as a party to the Great Lakes Fishery Convention, is 
actively involved in the planning and implementation of the 
lamprey control program.
<P>
	This program, according to statistics provided by the 
commission, has reduced lamprey populations by 
approximately 90 per cent from historic levels. Given the 
economic importance of the Great Lakes fishery to our fishing 
community, there is still work to be done. That is why Canada 
recently increased its funding to the commission by 33 per cent 
to a total of $5.145 million. We have secured assurances from 
the U.S. government that it will follow Canada's lead and 
increase its funding to the commission as well.
<P>
	The Department of Fisheries and Oceans is proud of the work 
that Canada and the U.S. have done to support lamprey control 
on the Great Lakes. We have managed to build this fishery up to 
a $2 billion to $4 billion industry annually.
<P>
	We will continue to support this commission in the future. It is 
our belief that it is now time for those who directly benefit from 
the Great Lakes fishery commission's efforts to join us and 
begin contributing to the cause of the lamprey control program.
<P>
	We all have a responsibility in maintaining a healthy and 
prosperous fishery for the future.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38(5), the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
have been adopted. Accordingly, this House stands adjourned 
until tomorrow at 2 p.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7.07 p.m.)
