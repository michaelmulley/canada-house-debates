	<B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to take this opportunity today to express my concerns 
about recombinant BST or bovine somatotropin.
<P>
	Although this hormone is found in cattle in its natural state, 
artificially increasing the rate of BST will not improve the 
quality of the milk, which is the most important consideration 
here.
<P>
	Furthermore, the consumer backlash may be substantial. 
There is no particular rush to approve the use of this hormone, 
especially not before appropriate consultations with consumer 
associations.

	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose):</B> Mr. Speaker, last week I 
attended a justice meeting in which a review of the National 
Parole Board was the topic of discussion.
<P>
	The result of this meeting left me questioning the 
accountability of the parole board. During the course of the 
discussion it was proven again that the current system is flawed. 
One of the results of the meeting was the Solicitor General's 
proposing a disciplinary scheme for members of the parole 
board. The time and thought given to these cosmetic 
disciplinary changes has been wasted time. We should not be 
spending time on how to get rid of people, we should be ensuring 
that the board is competent from the beginning.
<P>
	The public wants concrete changes, not cleanup measures. 
For accountability to be restored it has to begin at the top. This 
means the Solicitor General should consider placing a 
moratorium on the release of dangerous offenders coming up for 
parole until this whole system is revamped and meets the 
standard.

	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the 
years to come, Quebec will receive a major influx of 
immigrants. The need to make these people welcome and to 
integrate them into Quebec society would seem paramount, non 
only to guarantee the continued existence of the French 
language but also to strengthen economic links between new 
immigrants and Quebec's institutions.
<P>
	The Mouvement des caisses populaires Desjardins, one of the 
motors of Quebec's economic development, has shown 
leadership in this field.

	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parkdale-High Park):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
behalf of the Minister of Foreign Affairs it is my honour to pay 
tribute to the democratic process which is unfolding in South 
Africa today.
<P>
	The Government of Canada is committed to the advancement 
of human rights and our support continues with some 150 
Canadians currently in South Africa to observe the elections and 
to provide electoral expertise in the first democratic and 
non-racial elections.
<P>
	At present the Secretary of State for Latin America and Africa 
is leading the official bilateral team of electoral observers, 
while many other Canadians are serving with the United 
Nations, the Commonwealth and non-governmental 
organizations during this historic transition.
<P>
	I salute all the people of the new South Africa. Today marks 
an end to the past and is hope for the future.

and officially launched the composting system set up by the

<P>
	I would like to draw your attention more particularly to the 
work of Environnement Jeunesse, ENJEU, which makes 
students more aware of and educates them about the 
environment in Quebec. I was delighted and inspired by their 
commitment and the projects they have started. They have 
convinced me of the need to provide strong support for all youth 
initiatives.

<P>
	In a time when we are desperate for more opportunities and 
initiatives for youth, Collège de Bois de Boulogne has 
succeeded in creating new and innovative ways to involve its 
students and enhance their awareness of the issues.
<P>
	This demonstrates that with perseverance and commitment 
success is possible. Projects such as these are great 
achievements and should serve as an example for all our youth 
to follow.
<P>
	I applaud the college administrators, the private sector and 
the community for making this idea a reality and I urge my

	<B>Mr. Gaston Péloquin (Brome-Missisquoi):</B> The Supreme 
Court decision handed down yesterday with regard to 
telecommunications did not surprise anyone in Quebec. For the 
third time since 1993, Quebec is having powers in the area of 
communications torn away by the federal government. After 
broadcasting and cable television, Quebec is now losing control 
over telephone companies, control which is essential to the 
province's  social and economic development as we embark on 
the electronic highway.
<P>
	Once again, the Supreme Court takes a ``Canadian'' and 
centralizing view of the Constitution to continue chipping away, 
little by little, year after year, at the powers of the Quebec 
National Assembly. That is the true face of federalism in 
Canada, Mr. Speaker.

thousands of Canadians who work abroad in natural resource 
industries benefit from the federal overseas tax credit. In return 
for spending six months of the year away from their families and 
working often under very difficult conditions, these Canadian 
workers have had their annual tax liabilities reduced by the 
credit.
<P>
	Now as reported by <I>Alberta Report</I> magazine, Revenue 
Canada has decided to retroactively disallow the overseas tax 
credit to those Canadian workers employed by U.S. parented 
companies. In some cases this disallowance may extend back 
three years. This move will be an annoyance to the companies in 
question but it will do great harm to hundreds of ordinary 
Canadian workers, most of them Albertans.
<P>
	I am told that the unforeseen tax bill of up to $50,000 will

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Speaking yesterday to the greater Montreal Chamber of 
Commerce, the Chairman of VIA Rail unveiled his agency's 
proposal for a high-speed train in the Quebec City-Windsor 
corridor. VIA Rail is proposing that the federal government 
support the project financially using part of the grant it awards 
each year to the agency. This would allow the government to 
build the HST without it affecting Ottawa's budget.
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister tell us if the government is interested 
in VIA Rail's proposal which has the advantage of requiring no 
additional outlay on the part of the federal government?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have indeed indicated that we are interested in this venture. 
We have said that if this project can be carried out without the 
government having to incur significant costs, then we would be 
happy to proceed with it. However, if one proposal seems more 
acceptable at this time, I am certain the government will review 
it carefully. There could be a problem though in that it will be 
hard for a high-speed train linking Montreal and Toronto to be 
forced to stop for inspection at the border, once Quebec becomes 
independent, as the Leader of the Opposition hopes will happen.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I asked a serious question to someone who, I thought, 
took things seriously. Instead, he responded in a joking fashion.
<P>
	The HST project has been under consideration for many 
years. Governments have been studying it for at least three 
years. Why is the Prime Minister so reluctant to announce his 
support for the HST, given that this project will generate 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3567"> 3567 </A></B>
<P>
activity, create thousands of long-term jobs and, at the same 
time, strengthen our competitive position in a high-tech sector?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. leader of the Opposition surely knows that the 
governments of Quebec, Ontario and Canada have already 
invested just under $6 million in a high-speed train study. The 
three governments expect the report to be ready by this summer 
and we will, of course, be reviewing it with a great deal of 
interest. The study is being carried out jointly by the 
aforementioned three governments and I hope the Leader of the 
Opposition is interested in seeing the results, just as these three 
governments are.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what reasons can the Prime Minister give, I wonder, for 
his reluctance to state clearly what he thinks, and where he 
stands on the HST project, when all the while, the federal 
government has invested and will continue to invest-I would 
even say waste, at least in the case of Hibernia-billions in 
Hibernia, not to mention the exorbitant sums spent on upgrading 
the rail system in the West?
<P>
	Why is the Prime Minister holding off on disclosing his views 
on an HST that will link Quebec and Canada with the United 
States?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
we want to talk about decisions made by this government, I 
would point out to the Leader of the Opposition that the most 
successful company in Montreal is Canadair. It was during my 
tenure as Minister of Industry and Trade that the government 
bought Canadair back from private interests, got it back on track 
and invested money to develop the Challenger jets and other 
aircraft responsible for Canadair's current success. This was all 
due to the intervention of this government.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	The Leader of the Opposition is always asking us to work with 
the provinces, but the Minister of Transport has just said that he 
is working very closely with provincial governments on this 
matter. Now the Leader of the Opposition is suggesting that we 
not listen to the provinces.
<P>
	We do listen to them and, when the proposal is ready, we will 
respond. If it represents no cost to us, then of course the project 
will get the green light. However, if the costs are exorbitant, we 
will have to take into consideration this government's financial 
situation.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, according to 
the Minister of Industry, the federal government apparently 
wants to review the drug-patent law. This legislation extended 
to 20 years, need we remind you, the protection offered to 
patented drugs and led to the announcement that nearly $1 
billion would be invested in research and development in 
Quebec by 1996. By the year 2000, the total value of investment 
projects could reach $5 billion in Canada.
<P>
	Does the minister admit that it is because of pressure from 
lobbyists representing the interests of generic-drug companies, 
mainly concentrated in Toronto, that he is about to review the 
drug-patent legislation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
can assure the hon. member that I have no interest in lobbyists' 
efforts. What I care about the most is Canadians' interests.
<P>
	We promised during the election campaign that we would 
review Bill C-91, and that is what we explained again yesterday. 
We are interested in drug prices and in the investment and R and 
D track record here in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, Quebec's 
Minister of Industry and Commerce stated this morning before a 
parliamentary committee in Quebec City that the mere mention 
of a review of Bill C-91 caused the immediate postponement of 
a $50-million investment in Quebec's pharmaceutical industry.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Finance, who is also responsible for 
regional development in Quebec, admit that a review of the 
drug-patent legislation would be disastrous for the brand-name 
drug industry, which is mainly concentrated in Montreal?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
is the same kind of exaggerated hyperbole that we have heard on 
both sides of this debate for too long.
<P>
	We are trying to deal with the facts and we are going to 
determine what the facts are. The facts will indicate what policy 
direction the government should take in the future.
<P>
	I want the hon. member to understand, because he was not 
here when Bill C-91 was passed, that law contains within it a 
statutory review that would occur within four years of its 
enactment in 1993. That is already in the bill. There is nothing 
new about saying that we will review legislation passed by the 
previous government.

bia. National health care reform requires more co-operation, not 
less, between federal and provincial governments.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister instruct his Minister of Health to stop 
antagonizing and start listening to the provinces on health care 
reform?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have a very clear law of Parliament that medicare in Canada 
is free for everybody.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	We have a law in Canada that says there will not be a two tier 
system of medicare, one for the rich and one for the poor. We 
also have a law in Canada which says that if one province is 
engaged in that direction we shall cut off funds to it.
<P>
	The minister is doing what is right. She is making sure that the 
laws of Parliament are respected.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the root of the financial difficulties of health care lies in the fact 
that federal transfers to the provinces in support of health care 
have consistently declined over the last 15 years. Just last week 
the finance minister promised further cuts to federal transfers.
<P>
	If the Prime Minister is really committed to health care, will 
he commit today to maintaining federal transfers to health care 
at present levels and to making deeper spending cuts elsewhere 
required to support that commitment?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this is another good day. Now the leader of the Reform Party is 
pleading with us not to cut. I hope the Minister of Finance will 
note that.
<P>
	In our platform we said that we were to maintain the level of 
transfers to the provinces, that they were not to be reduced, and 
they were not reduced in the last budget.
<P>
	We say to the provinces that we want to sit down with them. 
The Minister of Health is organizing the conference that I will 
be presiding over in June wherein we will make sure that free 
medicare is portable for all our citizens whatever their financial 
means, respected and operated efficiently. We will have that 
meeting to do that and I hope the Reform Party will support this 
process. In fact, yesterday when I said that we should keep that 
system in Canada I saw many of his members applauding.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Prime Minister is avoiding the issue. When national 
medicare was introduced the federal government made a solemn 
commitment to carry 50 per cent of the cost to the provinces.
<P>
	Today federal transfers in support of health care in provinces 
like British Columbia cover only 36 per cent of the cost. Yet the 
federal government continues to use the Canada Health Act to 
tell the province how to finance and operate the system. In other 
words, health care is being choked between reduced federal 
transfers and an outdated national health care act.
<P>
	My question to the Prime Minister is very simple. Will he stop 
the choking? Will he promise that federal transfers in support of 
health care will be maintained and instruct the health minister to 
give the provinces more latitude, not less, in developing 
solutions to their health care needs?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
of course there are some problems in the administration of 
medicare. We have said that and we have said that is why we 
need a conference.
<P>
	It has been a good system. It is a system the Canadian people 
want to maintain. We have to sit down with the provinces to 
make sure that it is revisited at this time and that it is operating 
properly. It has been a great service to Canada since it was 
established. I think all Canadians want to keep it.
<P>
	We want to work to maintain it. I am happy to see the Reform 
Party supporting the notion that we should have free medicare 
and not two types of medicare for people in Canada.

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the minister of immigration.
<P>
	It has been revealed that one of the individuals arrested in 
Toronto in connection with the Just Desserts killing had an 
ongoing involvement with Canadian immigration officials and 
the minister's department.
<P>
	This individual had been ordered deported in 1992 but had 
been given a stay of proceedings on that deportation order again 
by the minister's department in 1993. Had this individual been 
deported on time he would not have been charged in connection 
with the murder of Georgina Leimonis.
<P>
	Why was this individual given a stay on his deportation order 
in 1993 by the minister's department?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is a difficult situation. We 
should be careful and try not to be in contempt of court so as not 
to prejudice this very important case many Canadians are 
looking at. Let me say this tragedy moved more than the city of 
metropolitan Toronto. It moved the whole country to think about 
that senseless killing.
<P>
	Let me also put into focus this department moved on the basis 
of inadmissibility grounds to deport that individual. I can tell 
the hon. member and this House I believe when we moved to 
deport that individual the case was made before an immigration 
appeal member. This is not controlled by my department but is a 
quasi-judicial independent tribunal.
<P>
	I will say the system failed us on this case. That strengthens 
my convictions that the amendments I have been discussing with 
my officials to strengthen the criminality provisions and to close 
the loopholes are the right course.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
individual in question was issued a stay on his deportation order 
in 1993 despite the fact he had a criminal record as long as his 
arm, and that was with the knowledge of the department.
<P>
<B>(1435 ) </B>
<P>
	When will the minister finally acknowledge that his 
department's system of background checks and enforcement is 
not working? How many more lives are going to be lost before 
the minister takes action to ensure the safety of Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, this member of Parliament does a 
disservice to the facts of the issue and to the concerns both of us 
and both sides of this House share. You do not have a monopoly 
on concern-

<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would remind hon. colleagues to please 
address the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchi:</B> Mr. Speaker, my department wanted and pushed 
for deportation. An independent quasi-judicial body stayed the 
deportation. The adjudicator who made that decision was not 
reappointed to that board. She was not reappointed by this 
minister. Therefore we need no lessons from the hon. member.

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the past, the Liberal government has recognized on 
numerous occasions the need to set up a reconversion assistance 
program for the defence industry Indeed, the situation of these 
companies is very precarious and no specific assistance is 
currently provided to those interested in restructuring their 
operations.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Industry recognize that the defence 
industry productivity program, or DIPP, does not provide any 
specific assistance for conversion purposes, and that the defence 
industry wants a fund to be set up, using money from the current 
DIPP budget to support conversion initiatives? Indeed, the 
budget of this program should be used for that purpose.
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to hear the hon. member refer to that project,

include conversion projects for the defence industry.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Mr.

<P>
	The member is aware of the financial limitations the 
government has. That is why we are also looking not only at 
making the DIPP contributions repayable in their entirety, but 
creating a revolving fund. Therefore not only do we aid projects 
that are directed at defence conversion presently, but we build a 
fund based on commercial viability that will sustain such 
projects and those companies that are involved in those sectors 
of our industry into the future.

	It is with a heavy heart that I once again must ask the Prime 
Minister why he continues to waste tax dollars, this time on a 
sun and fun holiday among the palms of a Caribbean island.
<P>
	It is reported the Prime Minister not only used a Challenger 
jet for a personal vacation, at a cost of slightly more than 
$250,000 using the Auditor General's formula, he allowed his 
hangers on and his flight crew to enjoy 10 days in the sun as 
well.
<P>
	When will this Prime Minister realize Canadian taxpayers 
will not accept his free spending ways?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have already explained they have asked me to travel on these 
planes for security reasons. I was already in Mexico and I stayed 
south for a few days. The member would have complained if the 
plane had travelled back and forth like it did when it was a trip 
for the Governor General.
<P>
<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
	I think they are doing a big disservice to an industry. I was 
talking with Canadair the other day. That type of question talks 
down on Canadian airplanes because you pretend it costs tons of 
money and that is not true. The figure you use is not the real one.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I recognize that in the heat of 
debate we sometimes forget the Speaker. I would ask all of you 
to please address your remarks to the Chair.
<P>
	If the right hon. Prime Minister has not finished, I invite him 
to finish. If he has, I will go to the next question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose):</B> I have a supplementary, 
Mr. Speaker. What did not happen was we did not address the 
extravagance. It sounds like a two tier system to me. Security for 
the Prime Minister is extremely important. We realize that.
<P>
	Did the Prime Minister check the private charter prices? I did 
and he could have saved $125,000. Why not save money for a 
change? Quit being so reckless. Will he stop being reckless?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am doing that. It is a plane that is owned by the Canadian 
government to be used by the Prime Minister of Canada.
<P>
	I have checked too. I asked Canadair if these planes were 
transferred to them how much they would charge the 
government for travelling. They said it would be less than 
$3,500 an hour. That is the real cost of using these planes.
<P>
	Not only that, when you calculate the cost of the pilots, you 
have to understand these are national defence pilots. They have 
to be in the air so many hours in a month anyway to keep their 
licences. However you charge the cost to the government when a 
minister is on board and you do not complain when they use the 
plane for training.
<P>

be able to travel like the RCMP requests.

<P>

<P>

the program that we put in place to stop the smuggling of 
cigarettes has been a great success. There were reports that there 
was an increase in smoking but the articles did not report the fact 
that cigarette export sales declined while domestic shipments 
increased.
<P>

<P>
	Last week the minister's parliamentary secretary confirmed 
that Canada Pension Plan premiums will have to be increased 
from the current 5.2 per cent of earnings in order to cover 
payments to our aging population. In fact at the current rate in 
less than 25 years these premiums will eat up 10 per cent of 
every worker's paycheque.
<P>
	Has the minister looked at this problem? What is he doing to 
keep premiums in check?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to report to the hon. 
member that I have read the press reports.
<P>
	It would be very important to refer him to a study or 
assessment that was undertaken by the Canadian Institute of 
Actuaries which noted that the financing of the Canada Pension 
Plan is on an actuarially sound basis. The formulas are there.
<P>
	We all understand that as the population changes and as we go 
into the future where there will be a larger number of Canadians 
who are in retirement age, there will be some pressures on the 
Canada Pension Plan. That is the reason why my colleague, the 
Minister of Finance, announced in the budget that we will put 
forward a paper that will make some assessment and analysis of 
what those kinds of issues will be. We will have an opportunity 
for a public debate, assessment or dialogue on what some of the 
resolutions or responses should be.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat):</B> Mr. Speaker, we look 
forward to that public debate.
<P>
	The surplus fund or contingency fund that the minister 
mentioned is presently invested in low interest provincial 
government bonds that subsidize the debt of provincial 
governments.
<P>

investment so that Canadians can count on having the pension 
they spend their whole lives contributing to?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, just to put this matter in its 
proper context, the managers of the fund have maintained 
throughout that this was not an unexpected development of the 
contingency fund, that it would have some pressures.
<P>

<P>

<P>
	Certainly for the next three years it has full funding to cover 
any possible change or alteration in the situation of the fund. It 
is certainly actuarially sound and has sufficient contingency 
funds within it.
<P>
	As the hon. member knows, according to legislation there 
must be changes in premium rates along the way. That is one 
reason why we have emphasized in the budget the importance of 
bringing down the cost of payroll tax, things like UI premiums 
and CPP premiums, so that we can maintain an active incentive 
for the private sector. That is one reason why the paper that the

for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	In December 1992 the government announced a freeze on all 
inactive groundfish licences. As a result of this, in order to 
demonstrate their attachment to the fishery and to avoid losing 
their licences, fishermen felt compelled to increase their fishing 
effort. Last week, in announcing the Atlantic groundfish 
strategy, the minister promised that he would review this policy.
<P>
	Will the minister advise the House as to what action has been 
taken on this issue?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to thank the member for the question. Indeed, he 
and virtually every other member of the Atlantic caucus raised 
the issue of frozen or inactive groundfish licences with me.
<P>
	Following consultation with members of the Atlantic caucus 
and consultation with the Canadian Council of Fish Harvesters, I 
have come to a decision to put in place a new professional 
standard affecting the fishermen that will have the effect of 
thawing or releasing the freeze on the vast majority of those 
so-called frozen groundfish licences.
<P>
	This decision will have the effect of contributing nothing to 
capacity as it affects only professional or bona fide fishermen. It 
will increase not one cent the cost of the Atlantic groundfish 
strategy, but it will do a great deal in the sense of fairness and, 
may I say, simple justice to restore the trust between fishermen, 
professional fishermen, bona fide fishermen and their 
government.

the Ministry of Justice in so far as they suggested changes to the

<P>
	As I mentioned to the hon. member on the last occasion when 
she raised this important matter, there are complex questions 
arising from the recommendations such as, for example, the 
intersection of criminal law where it tries to prevent horrendous

legitimate research in the university setting which can go to 
push back the frontiers of medical knowledge.

Parliament and the career of his or her spouse should not be 
affected by the status of a member of Parliament.
<P>
	There are some restrictions for cabinet ministers that must be 
respected, but spouses of members of Parliament have the right 
to earn a living. They have the capacity to earn a living. This is 
the fundamental right of equality in our society.

	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	On Monday the Minister of Justice met with representatives 
of Concordia University, the Canadian Safety Council, the 
Canadian Bar Association, the Ottawa Chief of Police and others 
who asked for a ban on handguns.
<P>
	Since handguns are not used for hunting but are very often 
used for criminal purpose, will the minister propose legislative 
amendments to implement these proposals? What was his 
answer to these groups on Monday?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I enjoyed the meeting on 
Monday. The delegation that came to see me in my office was as 
described by the hon. member and served to remind me that the 
vast majority of Canadians want effective gun control in the 
country.
<P>
	It is recognized that this is only part of the solution. It is 
recognized that we have to deal with the smuggling of illegal 
arms and deal properly with those who use firearms in the 
commission of offences. At the same time it is important to 
recognize that guns are used in suicides, over 1,000 each year, 
and that 3,000 firearms are lost or stolen from the homes of 
lawful owners each year and then turn up in the hands of 
criminals who subsequently injure or kill with them.
<P>
	While respecting the legitimate rights of lawful gun owners in 
the country, the government is committed toward more effective 
gun control. We will be responding to concerns such as those 
expressed on Monday last in my office by those who visited on 
the occasion described by the hon. member.

	<B>Mrs. Beryl Gaffney (Nepean)</B> moved for leave to introduce 
Bill C-241, an act to amend the Income Tax Act (child support 
payments).
<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, the current tax treatment of child 
support payments requires custodial parents to pay taxes on the 
support they receive while non-custodial parents are allowed to 
fully deduct the amount.

<P>
	While the average child support order covers less than half the 
minimum cost of raising a child, up to one-third or more of the 
support payments that are meant to help feed and clothe children 
are taken away in taxes.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Robert Gauthier (Ottawa-Vanier):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have two petitions signed by about 40 constituents of 
mine.
<P>
	The first petition deals with the sanctity of human life. The 
petitioners pray that Parliament ensure that the present 
provisions of the Criminal Code of Canada prohibiting assisted 
suicide be enforced vigorously and that Parliament make no 
change in the law which would sanction or allow the aiding or 
abetting of suicide or active or passive euthanasia.
<P>
	The second petition deals with the sanctity of life but for a 
different reason. The petitioners pray that Parliament act 
immediately to protect the unborn child by amending the 
Criminal Code to extend the same protection enjoyed by born 
human beings to unborn human beings.

	<B>Mr. Elijah Harper (Churchill):</B> Mr. Speaker, pursuant to 
Standing Order 36, I have the honour to present certified 
petitions from over 100 of my constituents and others in support 
of the increased use of the port of Churchill.
<P>
	The port of Churchill is an untapped national resource. The 
petitioners call on Parliament to direct the hon. minister 
responsible for the wheat board to maximize the port's use and 
to ship at least 5 per cent of Canada's annual grain shipments 
through the port.
<P>
	The Canadians who built the port and the railway to Churchill 
had a vision of Canada and of the north. I join the petitioners in 
hoping that this vision can live on.

	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Essex-Kent):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to present a petition on ethanol. The ethanol industry will 
certainly create a boon for the agricultural industry. Ethanol is 
one of the most environmentally friendly fuels available.
<P>
	Residents in the Chatham, Essex and Kent county areas are 
very concerned that the government show a consideration on 
taxation with regard to ethanol.
<P>
	They humbly ask the Parliament of Canada to allow a decade 
of tax allowance in order that the industry may get under way. 
The economic values to the industry are far greater than the tax 
costs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too 
rise in the House today to present a petition in support of ethanol 
as a fuel. Its time has come in Ontario.
<P>
	Some 200 petitioners call on the government to extend the 
exemption on the excise portion of ethanol for a decade to allow 
the strong and self-sufficient ethanol industry in Canada to go 
forward.
<P>
	I present this petition on their behalf.

pursuant to Standing Order 36, I am pleased to present on behalf 
of the constituents of Lambton-Middlesex and area a petition

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="PETITIONSPRESENTEDINTHEHOUSE-SPEAKER'SRULING">PETITIONS PRESENTED IN THE HOUSE-SPEAKER'S RULING</A></H4>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Dear colleagues, the Chair is now 
ready to deal with the point of order raised by the hon. member 
for Chicoutimi, on Monday, April 18, 1994, concerning the 
manner in which certain petitions have recently been presented 
in the House.
<P>
	The right of the public to petition Parliament is very 
important because it constitutes the only means by which 
individual Canadians can directly place grievances before this 
body and make their concerns known. As is noted in Bourinot's 
Fourth Edition at page 231, the signing and presentation of 
public petitions is highly appreciated by Parliament and in many 
cases assists it in forming its opinions and in taking appropriate 
action.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Since individual Canadians are not permitted to address the 
House directly, as members know, petitions are presented by 
members. Groups and individuals with petitions for the House 
must therefore enlist the aid of MPs to have their petitions 
certified and presented. Citation 1038 of Beauchesne's sixth 
edition states that members are not bound to present petitions 
and cannot be compelled to do so. Nevertheless, it is not unusual 
for members to present a petition to the House whether or not 
they agree with its contents.
<P>
	Under the provisions of the standing orders a petition may be 
presented in one of two ways. Standing Order 36(5) states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A petition to the House may be presented by a Member at any time during the 
sitting of the House by filing the same with the Clerk of the House.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is also known as tabling by the back door. The second 
method of presenting a public petition is prescribed by Standing 
Order 36(6) which states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Any Member desiring to present a petition, in his or her place in the House 
may do so on ``Presenting Petitions'', a period not to exceed 15 minutes, during 
the ordinary daily routine of business.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As noted at page 111 of the Annotated Standing Orders, 
several conditions apply to the presentation of petitions in the 
House during Routine Proceedings, the most notable of which is 
the prohibition contained in Standing Order 36(7) on ``debate on 
or in relation to'' petitions presented.
<P>
	On February 26, 1986, Speaker Bosley issued guidelines 
which not only reiterated provisions of Standing Order 36(7) but 
also invoked the practices which had evolved here on the 
manner of presenting petitions, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In presenting a petition during Routine Proceedings, the member may make a 
brief-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	I underline the word brief.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-summary of the prayer of the petition, state the parties from whom it comes 
and the number of signatures it contains, but may not make a speech or enter into 
debate on or in relation to the petition. The member should also indicate that the 
petition has been certified in order, pursuant to the standing orders.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Therefore, commenting in any way on the merits of a petition 
could be considered a form of debate on the petition. In this 
Parliament, on several occasions some Members have 
commented favourably or adversely on the petitions they are 
presenting, prompting other members to voice various 
objections to those comments.
<P>
	Since there is only a limited period during each sitting when 
members may present petitions, saying anything other than what 
is normally permitted takes time away from other members who 
wish to present petitions. Members should bear in mind that the 
Member presenting a petition in the House or filing it with the 
Clerk is acting as a messenger or intermediary between 
Parliament and the petitioners.
<P>
	If the rules permitted debate on petitions or if the subject of 
the petition were to come before the House for debate in some 
other manner, the member's view on the subject matter would be 
relevant and vital to the process. As things stand, however, the 
role of the member, while essential, is limited.
<P>
	Therefore the Chair would ask members to refrain from 
commenting on petitions they present other than to simply note 
the prayer of the petition, the number of signataries, and their 
place of residence.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Finally, should members choose to present petitions with 
which they disagree they may do so during Routing Proceedings 
without comment or simply file them with the Clerk of the 
House at any time.
<P>
	Both methods of presentation fulfil the requirements of the 
standing orders and both are equally valid.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I hope this brief statement will help explain the procedure on 
presenting petitions to the House.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for Chicoutimi for raising this matter 
and thus allowing the Chair to provide the House with an 
explanation of the process.

	The House resumed consideration from April 26 of the motion 
that Bill C-22, an act respecting certain agreements concerning 
the redevelopment and operation of terminals 1 and 2 at Lester 
B. Pearson International Airport, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee; and of the amendment; and of the 
amendment to the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-22 
will be an opportunity for me to demonstrate the unfair 
treatment given Jean Lesage Airport in my riding, compared 
with other Canadian airports.
<P>
	Since the opening of the 35th Parliament on January 17, we 
have on many occasions heard Liberal and Reform Party 
members boast of the advantages of Canadian federalism for 
Quebecers. In my speech on Bill C-22, I will try to show how 
different the real situation is by looking at the problems we have 
with air transportation.
<P>
	First of all, we condemn the centralizing approach of 
Transport Canada in decisions that affect Quebec. For instance, 
there is the story around the selection of Mirabel as a second 
airport for Montreal. The result: 20 years of economic disaster. 
Mirabel is still finding its feet, Dorval has stagnated, and 
Toronto has emerged as the big winner from Transport Canada's 
planning disaster. From 1970 to 1991, Air Canada moved 12 per 
cent of its employees from Montreal to Toronto, and from 1977 
to 1991, Montreal lost 22 per cent of its pilots, while the number 
of pilots in Toronto increased by 34 per cent. In 1988, Air 
Canada transferred its pilot training services to Toronto, and in 
1991, 12 management positions were transferred as well.
<P>
	The centralizing approach of Transport Canada has affected 
air traffic control as well.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	Terminal control units have been transferred to regional 
control centres. Halifax, Thunder Bay, North Bay, Regina, 
Saskatoon and Sault Ste. Marie each lost their radar control 
facilities.
<P>
	The terminal at the airport in Quebec City will be closed in 
July 1994, which means that after that date, aside from the seven 
regional control centres, only Ottawa and Calgary will be 
allowed to maintain their air traffic control units.
<P>
	Nearly $1 billion has been spent as part of a plan that has 
created a number of security problems by making vast areas 
extremely vulnerable, in case of a malfunction in regional radars 
or if regional control centres have to be evacuated in an 
emergency, and I will get back to this later on.
<P>
	I would now like to make some comparisons to illustrate how 
ignorant Liberal and Reform Party members are when they 
claim Quebec is complaining on a full stomach.
<P>
	The airport in Quebec City was built on 633 hectares of land, 
the airport in Halifax on 930 hectares, Winnipeg on 1504 
hectares, Toronto on 1714 hectares and Edmonton on 2669 
hectares.
<P>
	Liberal and Reform Party members will have to admit that 
Quebecers paid approximately 25 per cent of the cost of these 
locations, which are much bigger than the site at Jean Lesage 
Airport in Quebec City.
<P>
	These properties have cost Quebecers a lot of money. Only the 
airports in Newfoundland, Charlottetown, Regina, Yellowknife 
and Whitehorse are on sites smaller than the location in Quebec 
City.
<P>
	If we compare air terminal areas, Quebec has 12,126 square 
metres, Ottawa has 18,044, Winnipeg has 24,834, Halifax has 
24,870 and Edmonton 34,374. Liberal and Reform Party 
members will have to admit that Quebecers paid 25 per cent of 
the cost of the air terminals in these Canadian cities, while they 
have to make do with an area two to three times as small. Once 
again, the other provinces have cost Quebec a lot of money.
<P>
	My Liberal and Reform Party colleagues might want to justify 
Transport Canada's neglect of Quebec, by assuming that the 
volume of air traffic at the airport in Quebec City is smaller than 
at other Canadian airports.
<P>
	Here are some more figures to demonstrate the greed of 
Transport Canada. What we have here is the increase in 
transborder and international flights from 1988 to 1992: Halifax 
went up 12.5 per cent; Winnipeg, 13 per cent; Calgary, 15 per 
cent; Quebec City, 179 p. 100.
<P>
	I did not make this up. These figures are from Transport 
Canada.
<P>
	This was about increases in volume. If we compare the flight 
volume in Quebec City with the volume at the other airports I 
mentioned, we see that these volumes are comparable. It is 
therefore not surprising that, with a comparable flight volume 
and an operating area two to three times as small, the quality of 
service provided by Transport Canada at Jean Lesage Airport is 
very poor. In fact, according to Transport Canada's own criteria, 
the level of service at the airport in Quebec City, rates an F, 
which means: system saturated, congestion and unacceptable 
delays. So much for the profitable federalism you are trying to 
sell Quebecers!
<P>
	Everyone refers to Jean Lesage Airport as a bush airport. 
Considering the millions of dollars invested in other Canadian 
airports and especially in Toronto, the situation in Quebec city is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3578"> 3578 </A></B>
<P>
a disgrace. The only explanation is the irresponsible attitude, if 
not bad faith, of Transport Canada and the Liberal and 
Conservative members who sat and sit on the benches opposite.
<P>
	This is one more indication that, under Canadian federalism, 
Liberal and Conservative members from Quebec have always 
done the bidding of the English Canadian majority and never 
had any real power. The presence of Prime Ministers from 
Quebec was, and still is, merely an illusion of power.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	Let us now go back to air traffic control. While the regional 
centres in other provinces serve, on average, some 2.6 million 
people, in Quebec, according to Transport Canada plans, the 
Montreal regional air traffic control centre will be serving a 
population of 7 million. This is what we mean by profitable 
federalism for all Canadians, except Quebecers, who are paying 
to provide other provinces with services they can only dream of.
<P>
	We are not fooled by all this! Why is Transport Canada trying 
to close the Quebec City airport terminal air traffic control unit? 
The reason invoked is savings. However, we do not believe it, 
because we can prove that a series of decisions proposed by 
Transport Canada will require much larger investments than 
what is requested by the people involved in the Quebec City 
area. We believe that the real reason, although nobody would 
admit to it, is the elimination of a French-speaking air traffic 
control centre. Then Canada would be left with only two 
officially bilingual centres, one in Montreal and one in Ottawa.
<P>
	Speaking of bilingualism at the Ottawa airport, how do you 
expect francophones of this country to feel that they get some 
respect, when they know that Transport Canada has been trying 
unsuccessfully for five years to render air traffic control 
bilingual at the airport of the national capital of a country which 
claims to have an official languages policy. This is the Prime 
Minister's Canada.
<P>
	By the way, why was the Ottawa airport terminal air traffic 
control unit not transferred to Toronto, like all other units within 
a given region? Air traffic control in Ottawa was supposed to 
become bilingual, so if it were to be transferred to Toronto, 
could that centre be expected to become bilingual one day? The 
answer is obvious.
<P>
	This is one more example of the so-called profitability of 
federalism as it applies, this time, to air transportation. Over the 
years, Quebecers have come to realize that Canadian federalism 
cannot be reformed and cannot be profitable. I should add, by 
the way, that if the other provinces had not come to the same 
conclusion, that is to say that Quebec is profitable for them, why 
would they be so strenuously opposed to Quebec sovereignty?
<P>
	As for the possibility of the Canadian government 
compensating people who were about to extort millions of 
dollars from Canadians, it is outrageous. If we should 
compensate friends of Liberal and Conservative regimes for 
profit losses, how should we compensate Quebecers for 125 
years of federalism that kept them unemployed and dependent? 
This unfair treatment of the people of Quebec began in 1840, 
when England imposed the Act of Union between Upper and 
Lower Canada. In doing so, England wanted to make Canadians 
living in Lower Canada, French Canadians, pay part of Upper 
Canada's debt. Quebec has already paid its share of 
compensation and then some.
<P>
	Therefore, Mr. Speaker, clearly, I will vote against this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mark Assad (Gatineau-La Lièvre):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
listening to the analysis presented by our colleague opposite, it 
appears to be a black and white issue. His view of history betrays 
prejudices which have no room in our world.
<P>
	Sure, if you look at our history, you will find that not 
everything was perfect, but an analysis such as yours is 
bordering on slander. I wonder where you found all those data to 
reach such a negative conclusion. It is unfair. There are two 
sides to every story and you must take it into consideration when 
analyzing situations like this one, especially going all the way 
back to 1840.
<P>
	Would you be willing to consider the benefits of our 
confederation, one of the best in the world? It will be difficult to 
convince you that, were it not for the Canadian federation, you 
would not have been able to maintain a second official language. 
It would have been impossible anywhere else but in Canada. We 
are the only living proof of that in the world.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before recognizing the member, I 
would like once again to ask you to address your remarks to the 
Chair. It lowers the chances of friction.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paré:</B> Mr. Speaker, most of the data I quoted in my speech 
come from reports published by Transport Canada. To compare 
the situation at the Quebec City Airport with that of airports in 
other capitals, be it in the provinces or the Northwest 
Territories, I relied mainly on statistics from Transport Canada. 
To compare the increased frequency of flights between those 
airports, I used Transport Canada data. To compare air traffic, 
again I used Transport Canada data.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, Quebecers have studied history. We may not 
have had the same history books as our colleagues opposite, 
however, I can assure you that, in the next few months, we will 
be prepared for the upcoming debate on nationhood for Quebec. 
Rest assured that the system has given us all the arguments we 
need to prove what I just started demonstrating. It is only a 
matter of time. We only have to read the official reports 
published by the federal government and Statistics Canada, to 
find the necessary data. We will make them public and circulate 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3579"> 3579 </A></B>
<P>
them among Quebecers, who will, no doubt, come to the proper 
conclusion.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I inform the House that, after five 
hours of debate, we will now proceed to the ten-minute allotted 
time period for speeches without questions or comments. The 
member for Chicoutimi.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak on the amendment to Bill C-22.
<P>
	First of all, I would like to briefly review the sequence of 
events. In 1989, Paxport Inc. spontaneously submitted a 
proposal for the privatization of Terminals 1 and 2. The 
government of the day nixed the idea. That was in 1989. 
However, in October of 1990, the government invited the private 
sector to submit proposals for the redevelopment of Terminals 1 
and 2. In 1991, Terminal 3 opened for business under the 
management of Claridge Holdings Inc. On March 11, 1992, the 
government formally issued requests for proposals for the 
privatization of Terminals 1 and 2 at Pearson. This preceded the 
decision on the proposed expansion of the runway system at the 
airport. Only a one-phase process was called for, involving no 
prequalification, whereas the bidding for the privatization of 
Terminal 3 involved a two-stage process, initially soliciting 
interested parties and selecting a short list of bidders, and then 
encouraging detailed submissions.
<P>
	As for the competition process itself, the Nixon report states 
the following on page 2, and I quote: ``The Request for 
Proposals did not set out many of the fundamental aspects of the 
proposed development, but left these to bidders to define for 
themselves''. Therefore, it was left to bidders to make 
projections on passenger traffic at the airport. Yet, data on 
passenger traffic is critical to determining the pace and scope of 
the redevelopment. With a project of this magnitude, how could 
it have been left to the bidders to define such crucial 
parameters?
<P>
	Moreover, only 90 days were provided for responses. This is 
an unusually short deadline, considering that we are dealing 
with a highly complex, long-term contract covering a period of 
57 years. What reason could there be for setting such a tight 
deadline if not to give an advantage to certain companies, such 
as Paxport which had submitted an earlier privatization plan in 
1989, and Claridge which was already managing Terminal 3 at 
Pearson? In the end, the government received only two bids, one 
from Claridge and one from Paxport.
<P>
	On December 7, 1992, the Paxport proposal was selected as 
the best of the two bids. The company was required to 
demonstrate by February 15, 1993 that its proposal was 
financially viable.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	As it could not do so nor, according to its president, obtain the 
necessary capital from other sources, Paxport and Claridge 
established T1 T2 Limited Partnership less than two months 
later. In fact, Paxport created a joint venture with its only 
competitor.
<P>
	Why did the government then in office award a 57-year 
contract worth hundreds of millions of dollars to a 
financially-troubled company that was also close to the party? 
All interested parties in the Toronto region knew at the time that 
Paxport was in financial difficulty. The government cannot 
claim it acted in good faith.
<P>
	As you may recall, one of the reasons Paxport was chosen was 
to encourage healthy competition between the manager of 
Terminals 1 and 2 and the manager of Terminal 3.
<P>
	On August 30, 1993, the Minister of Transport announced a 
general agreement between the two parties. He promised that a 
final agreement would be signed in the fall.
<P>
	On September 8, 1993, the Government of Canada called an 
election. The Nixon report summarizes the events as follows: 
``Prior to the conclusion of the legal agreement the Leader of the 
Opposition (now the Prime Minister) indicated clearly that 
parties proceeding to conclude this transaction did so at their 
own risk and that a new government''-that is, the people 
opposite-``would not hesitate to pass legislation to block the 
privatization of terminals 1 and 2 if the transaction was not in 
the public interest''. The legal agreement was signed 
nevertheless.
<P>
	Under the pressure of public opinion, the government ordered 
a review of this highly controversial deal and the Nixon report 
was published on November 29, 1993. On December 3, 1993, the 
Prime Minister announced the cancellation of the agreement.
<P>
	The Nixon report outlines the process and argues that it 
strongly favoured one of the proposals since Paxport had 
already submitted a privatization proposal.
<P>
	The report itself describes in plain language the abuses that 
were committed in this deal: ``Other management and 
construction firms not having been involved in the maneuvering 
preceding the RFP had no chance to come up to speed and submit 
a bid in the short time permitted''.
<P>
	Other companies should have been invited to bid and should 
have been given a reasonable deadline. No prequalification 
financial analysis was required in this request for proposals.
<P>
	Finally, the Conservative government signed the contract in 
the final stretch of an election campaign. Allow me to quote 
from the report. ``It is a well-known and carefully observed 
tradition that when governments dissolve Parliament they must 
accept a restricted power of decision during the election 
period''. The report concludes that the privatization process was 
far from promoting the interest of the public to the fullest.
<P>

<P>

<P>
	We demand a royal commission of inquiry. The Nixon 
investigation was conducted in private. In the red book, the 
Liberals say that people are irritated because key parts of public 
business are conducted behind closed door.
<P>
	The government keeps harping on about transparency. Here is 
a chance to show us they believe in their principles and can 
apply them responsibly.
<P>
	A government that preaches transparency has to shed some 
light on this whole issue. Taxpayers have the right to know and 
to be provided with inside information on these transactions. 
The government cancelled the privatization plan, yet this bill 
provides for compensation, although the parties were aware of a 
possible contract cancellation.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	The Crown does not have to compensate investors for 
miscalculations. Clause 10, paragraph 2, reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No amount is payable under an agreement entered into under this section in 
relation to (<I>a</I>) any loss of profit, or (<I>b</I>) any fee paid for the purpose of lobbying a 
public office holder, within the meaning of subsection 2(1) of the <I>Lobbyists 
Registration Act</I>, in connection with any agreement.</BLOCKQUOTE>
It has to be stronger than that. Public funds are at stake.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to denounce the doings of some politicians in this country. More 
particularly, I intend to denounce the almost incestuous 
practices which are part of the culture of some people who try 
every day to influence government decisions, using all the 
means at their disposal, from childhood friendships to services 
rendered, including election organizing and political party 
financing.
<P>
	These people try to change the normal course of events, to 
trade the public interest for private gain and, sadly, to relegate to 
the background parliamentarians' role as their constituents' 
elected representatives. I therefore speak on this bitter taste left 
by Bill C-22, the uncertainties surrounding the privatization of 
Pearson Airport in which lobbyists, politicians, former senior 
civil servants and friends of the government seem to be 
involved.
<P>
	The Pearson Airport issue is worth considering, beyond Bill 
C-22. The government is wrong in refusing to clear up the whole 
matter. By simply clamping a lid on it while clause 10 would pay 
generous compensation set in secret and at its discretion, 
without consulting parliamentarians, the government is 
showing the people of Quebec and Canada its true colours, while 
its red book talked about a code of ethics for lobbying.
<P>
	Has the powerful lobby around it made the government 
change its mind? If not, as I hope, the government has the ideal 
issue before it to show its good will, to set a new path in the 
conduct of affairs of state and to give back to our fellow citizens 
a minimum of trust in their political leaders.
<P>
	At a time when polls and all opinion surveys agree that the 
people mistrust and doubt their political leaders and hold them 
in low esteem, is it not worth confronting the old demons which 
haunt the halls and corridors of government and giving the 
people what they want: honesty, openness and the plain simple 
truth? The Pearson Airport issue is perfect for this exercise and I 
am convinced that, in a free vote, parliamentarians would listen 
to their conscience and go for transparency, legitimacy and 
restraint.
<P>
	The government has the duty to hold a public inquiry on the 
privatization of that airport. By refusing to do so and not 
following the suggestion made by the Bloc Quebecois, the 
government would not fulfil its responsibilities; it would renege 
on its election promises, and it would in fact endorse methods 
used by Conservatives. The government would merely replace a 
few beneficiaries.
<P>
	As Mr. Nixon mentioned in his report, the privatization of 
Pearson Airport is an obvious example of political interference, 
irregularities and maneuvering. This is why, if the government 
has nothing to hide or to protect, the issue must be thoroughly 
examined and must stand as an example to ensure that such a 
situation does not occur again.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	In 1987, when the federal government implemented a new 
management policy regarding Canadian airports, it did so 
mainly to involve local authorities in the development of airport 
sites. This was the case for Vancouver and Montreal, among 
others, where non-profit corporations manage airport facilities. 
In Toronto, the situation was very different, perhaps because 
Pearson Airport was the most profitable in Canada. In a context 
of freer trade, which is a sacred cow, the thinking goes like this: 
Why should the government keep a profitable venture when it 
can look after so many non-profitable ones?
<P>
	Far from promoting public interest, the transaction took place 
in the midst of an election campaign, for the benefit of the only 
two bidders, former competitors now united to reap the profits. 
Paxport Inc., whose bid had been approved by the government 
without any prior financial analysis, was not able to come up 
with the funds necessary to conclude the transaction involving 
terminals 1 and 2. Paxport joins forces with Claridge Inc., which 
already controls terminal 3 via Pearson Development 
Corporation.
<P>
	This merger produces T1 T2 Partnership. And there you have 
it! Pearson, which is a very profitable airport, is completely 
privatized for the benefit of a single group. The financial details 
of the deal are kept secret, but when reviewed by Robert Nixon 
and other Ontario investigators, they do not seem to be 
compatible with public policy. How many millions of dollars are 
we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3581"> 3581 </A></B>
<P>
talking about? We have to know in order to determine how much 
we are ready to pay to show our appreciation  to government 
supporters. It is in the best interest of Canadians to know these 
things, because it is their money the government is squandering 
and wasting away on such schemes.
<P>
	It is also in the interest of the public to find out who took part 
in those deals and how they managed to come up with such 
irregular and intricate deals. This information will only come 
out of an in-depth inquiry, which the government must set up.
<P>
	Right now, we only know who the lead actors in the Pearson 
deal were and notice that they all are closely linked either to the 
Conservative Party or the Liberal Party. For instance, Claridge 
Properties Inc., belongs to Charles Bronfman, who is 
well-known for his ties to the Liberal Party of Canada. Senator 
Léo Kolber sat on the board of directors of Claridge when the 
deal was signed and, during the election campaign, he held a 
party at $1,000 a plate, which Mr. Bronfman and the current 
Prime Minister, among others, attended.
<P>
	Herb Metcalf, a lobbyist for Claridge, is a former political 
organizer for Mr. Chrétien, while Ramsey Withers, deputy 
minister of Transport at the time of the request for proposals 
process concerning Terminal 3, is another lobbyist well-known 
for his close ties to the current prime minister.
<P>
	At Claridge, to strike a balance between red and blue, there 
were also Conservative lobbyists involved in this deal: Pat 
MacAdam, a college friend of Brian Mulroney, Bill Fox, former 
press secretary to and personal friend of Brian Mulroney, and 
finally Harry Near, a long-time party activist.
<P>
	Paxport Inc. also has some Conservative friends even though 
it reportedly also maintains close ties with the Liberal Party of 
Canada. There is Don Matthew, former chairman of Brian 
Mulroney's leadership campaign, former chairman of the 
Conservative Party and of the party's fund-raising campaign. 
Another former chief of staff of Brian Mulroney, Fred Doucet, 
acted as a Conservative lobbyist for Paxport while the 
consortium with Claridge was being planned. Other lobbyists, 
like Bill Neville, Hugh Riopelle and John Legate, are all known 
to have easy access to Brian Mulroney Cabinet members.
<P>
	Given this information and all the disturbing matters raised in 
the Nixon report, the government simply cannot brush aside this 
issue, as it is trying to do with Bill C-22.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	In his report, Mr. Nixon talks about political manipulation, 
which is a serious allegation. Will we encourage this by handing 
to the minister, under the cover of section 10, a blank cheque for 
the payment of compensations as he sees fit? The Nixon Report 
indicates that financiers and lobbyists tried to put one over on 
us, the taxpayers of Canada and of Quebec, with this project. 
Will we help them to con us even more?
<P>
	The answer is no, and I will conclude with this. Taxpayers 
have already paid too much, and they need to know why. Thus, 
we must reject Bill C-22 and soon proceed with a royal 
commission of inquiry.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
lobbying has evolved considerably over the last few years. The 
real transformation came about in the early 70s. Before then, 
Canadians thought that lobbying was virtually non-existent and 
this subject was seldom discussed. However, in the early 80s, 
lobbying became part of the federal decision-making process.
<P>
	In its famous red book, the Liberal Party talks about making 
government more transparent in order to restore public 
confidence. However, it is mentioned in the Nixon report that 
some politicians showed an enormous interest in the Pearson 
Airport transaction. In his report, Robert Nixon states, and I 
quote: ``My review has left me with one conclusion, to leave in 
place an inadequate contract arrived at with such a flawed 
process and under the shadow of possible political manipulation 
is unacceptable''.
<P>
	I will now summarize the evolution of lobbying before telling 
you about the real players in the Pearson Airport deal.
<P>
	In view of the recent death of Richard Nixon, I do not need to 
remind members of the Watergate scandal in the 1970s, a 
scandal which shook the confidence of our neighbours to the 
south in their political system. Need I remind members also of 
the Canadian Pacific scandal in the 1870s, one of the first 
political scandals to take place in Canada. That scandal was 
about making donations to the election fund. In fact, Sir 
Alexander Mackenzie had made honesty the theme of his 
Liberal election campaign, and in the process brought down the 
government of Sir John A. Macdonald.
<P>
	Later on, under the Conservative government, draftsmen 
began to work on a bill stating the basic principles of a lobbyists 
registration system. Its foundation was Bill C-82, now entitled 
``Lobbyists Registration Act'', afterward referred to as R.S., 
1985, c. 44, assented to September 13, 1988 and in force 
September 30, 1989. That act was subsequently amended by Bill 
C-76, passed February 22, 1993.
<P>
	Let us ask ourselves: What is really a lobbyist? A lobbyist can 
be defined as an individual or a corporation which, for payment 
or other compensation, makes representations for a client to 
ministers or officials. The basic principles can be summed up 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3582"> 3582 </A></B>
<P>
this way: public access to government; transparency of dealings 
with governments; simplicity of the system's administration.
<P>
	The Ninth Report to the House of Commons by the Standing 
Committee on Consumer and Corporate Affairs and 
Government Operations, tabled in 1993, stated and I quote: 
``When lobbying is conducted away from public view, there is a 
greater opportunity for decisions that undermine the public 
interest''.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	Thus, lobbyists are required to file returns with registrars. 
There are now different categories of lobbyists.
<P>
	First, there are professional lobbyists who, for payment and 
on behalf of a client, undertake to arrange a meeting with a 
public office holder in an attempt to influence him or her on 
legislative proposals, on the passage or defeat of a bill or on the 
awarding of monetary grants or government contracts. These 
lobbyists are subject to very strict regulations.
<P>
	And then, there are the other lobbyists. They are employees 
who, as a significant part of their duties, communicate with 
public office holders. Let us note that the registry of lobbyists 
may be consulted by the public. This second category of 
lobbyists is a problem because they are not subject to the same 
disclosure procedures.
<P>
	In 1993, the standing committee recommended the 
elimination of distinctions between different categories 
concerning mandatory disclosure. It is crucial that we support 
those recommendations by the standing committee, since many 
lobbyists do not abide by the law. An anti-avoidance rule is 
needed. Obviously, staunch opposition is to be expected from 
many lobbyists.
<P>
	The concept of openness should also apply to the financing of 
political parties. Incidentally, on March 13, my colleague, the 
hon. member for Richelieu, introduced a motion to restrict 
donations by individuals to $5,000 a year and to eliminate all 
corporate contributions.
<P>
	That motion reminded us that the real bosses are the voters 
and not the big backers.
<P>
	The hon. member for Richelieu went on to say: ``Although the 
proportion has changed, the amount provided is still significant 
and a potential source of conflict. Since the reform of 1974 and 
the ensuing evolution of fundraising, small contributions from 
private individuals account for a larger share of the financing of 
political parties. Such democratization is very much due to the 
institution of a federal tax credit on political contributions, 
which was adopted in 1974''.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, some people may think the current legislation is 
an adequate means to limit influence peddling and that there is 
no need to impose a ceiling on donations. However, the 
accusations of influence peddling made in the last ten years 
against members of the Senate or the House of Commons tend to 
prove otherwise.
<P>
	More and more, Canadians and Quebecers are demanding 
openness. This disproportionate influence must stop and the 
people must regain control over our electoral system. Quebec's 
legislation is a model for all aspects of the electoral system. 
Popular financing and the requirement to disclose the source and 
amount of contributions are an integral part of Quebecers' 
customs.
<P>
	The last point I want to mention is the recommendation of a 
code of ethics for elected representative and senior managers, 
which would allow for more transparency in the registration of 
lobbyists. This recommendation leads me to the Pearson Airport 
affair.
<P>
	Many players are involved and the two principal political 
parties were largely implicated in this scheming. We find the 
following companies: Claridge Properties Inc., Paxport Inc., 
Pearson Development Corporation, and names like Peter 
Coughlin, Senator Leo Kolber, Herb Metcalfe, Ray Hession, 
Don Matthews, Otto Jelinek and Fred Doucet, to name only a 
few.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	So it is not without reason that Robert Nixon, Jean Chrétien's 
investigator, recommended cancelling the contract last 
November. Having named all these players, we have to conclude 
that a code of ethics for elected representatives and senior 
managers is essential.
<P>
	Given all the disturbing facts of the Pearson Airport affair, it 
is of the utmost importance to ask the Prime Minister to appoint 
a royal commission of inquiry to get to the bottom of the 
dealings of those involved. Transparency must prevail if 
Canadian democracy is to regain its true meaning.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay):</B> Mr. Speaker, today's 
debate challenges all our political morals, our habits, our 
customs out of this Chamber, our relations behind the political 
scene and the influence peddling that usually remain hidden 
from the public. The study of Bill C-22 provides a unique 
opportunity to ask ourselves about the interaction that may exist 
between the political authority of a government and the 
economic power of large corporations.
<P>
	We have before us a holding which resorted to the most 
extreme schemes to acquire terminals 1 and 2 of Pearson Airport 
in Toronto. The report by Robert Nixon, who was responsible for 
examining the deal, is very critical in that regard. Corporate 
transactions, transfers of senior departmental officers, 
exceptional tendering procedures, no requirement for a prior 
financial analysis, clauses benefitting the airport at the expense 
of others, everything led the investigator to believe that such an 
inadequate contract signed in such an irregular way was 
unacceptable.
<P>
	One can understand Airport Development Corporation, 
Claridge Holdings Inc., Paxport Inc. and their consortium T1 T2 
Limited Partnership. Pearson Airport was a jewel for developers 
in the air transport industry. With 20 million passengers each 
year, an area  covering 1 792 hectares, three terminals, 15 000 
employees, and 800 airplanes landing or taking off every day for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3583"> 3583 </A></B>
<P>
300 destinations in 60 countries, Pearson airport is the hub of air 
transport in Canada.
<P>
	According to a Transport Canada study dating from 1987, 
Pearson airport has direct economic spin-offs amounting to $4 
billion for the Ontario economy and it employs 56 000 people. 
Yet, not long ago, it was Montreal that was the hub of air traffic.
<P>
	The federal government is responsible for major changes that 
have affected the location of the poles of economic activity. 
Quebec has long been suffering from federal interventionism 
within its economy. Pearson airport is benefitting from the side 
effects of one of these federal interventions, namely the building 
of Mirabel International Airport.
<P>
	The Mirabel decision had horrible consequences for Quebec 
in several regards. Initially, the idea was to meet a demand that 
Dorval airport could no longer satisfy. Why not stick to 
consolidating Dorval infrastructures into one modern efficient 
airport that would have confirmed Montreal as the hub for the 
next 50 years? No. Politicians at the time agreed to build a 
second airport in Mirabel, 40 kilometres from Montreal and 
about a hundred kilometres from Ottawa, at a spot Highway 13 
has not even reached yet.
<P>
	Meanwhile, Quebec representatives were thinking about 
locating that airport in the Montreal-Sherbrooke-Quebec 
triangle in order to serve adequately the metropolitan area, as 
well as the old capital, while opening up, through Sherbrooke, to 
the big market of the East coast, with several million people. 
The federal government refused to listen and, while Quebec was 
pursuing its actions and its consultations, the federal 
government made a unilateral decision on March 27, 1969. Its 
airport would be located in Mirabel to serve, it was claimed, 
both the federal capital, Ottawa, and the Montreal metropolis.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	The federal government, with our money, was making a 
poisoned gift to Quebec. What a gift. It was depriving us of 
95,856 acres of one of the best farming land. But most of all, 
Mirabel airport would gradually cause the Montreal area to lose 
its status as the hub of international air traffic in favour of 
Pearson airport in Toronto. While Mirabel was being built, the 
federal government was giving permission to all international 
airline companies to use the airport in Toronto, which could then 
provide all these services and keep expanding in one single 
airport.
<P>
	A plot to move this economic activity 500 kilometres to the 
West could not have been more successful. This federal 
intervention resulted in a significant loss of jobs for Quebec. 
And who paid the bill? Quebecers themselves, with the taxes 
they are sending to Ottawa.
<P>
	This kind of deplorable intervention by the federal against 
Quebec's interests is not the first and will not be the last, as long 
as Quebec remains in this federation. Interventionism has also 
affected all our oil and petro-chemical industry. In 1957, the 
Diefenbaker government established a Royal Commission on 
Energy chaired by Henry Borden. Of the six commissioners, 
Jean-Louis Lévesque, from Montreal, was the only one 
representing Quebec. The mandate of the Borden Commission 
was to examine all issues relating to energy, such as size of the 
domestic market, security of oil supply, the export volume and 
price.
<P>
	The commission was anxious to develop this sector of the 
economy to become less dependent on other countries and at the 
same time reach the U.S. market. There was more to it, however. 
A jealous eye was cast on the oil refineries in Montreal, which 
some people wanted to see transferred to Ontario. The 
commission heard representations from independent producers 
who were in favour of building a pipeline from Edmonton to 
Montreal, so that Alberta crude would displace imported 
Venezuelan crude being refined in Montreal. However, Ontario 
was not really interested in this pipeline or western natural gas 
but in Montreal's major refineries.
<P>
	Once again, as in so many other cases, the influence of the 
lobbyists was decisive. The project was opposed by the major oil 
multinationals. Finally, the commission recommended drawing 
a demarcation line along the Ottawa Valley. It recommended 
securing all markets to the west of this line for producers in 
Alberta. The federal government implemented this 
recommendation in 1961. Since the pipeline went to Toronto, 
Sarnia was born. The next step was to extend the pipeline to 
Montreal, and after taking away our refineries, English Canada 
was to take over the Montreal market.
<P>
	We owe the disappearance of an entire petrochemical industry 
in East Montreal to Canada's national policy initiatives. Richard 
Séguin, one of our great singers from Quebec-the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Industry referred to 
him on February 9 as a great artist-tells us in one of his songs 
about the incredible human cost of the disappearance of East 
Montreal's refineries. At the end of his song he says to his 
father: ``J'vais prier pour toi''.
<P>
	Another example, equally important, is the St. Lawrence 
Seaway. We all know that this access way to the Great Lakes, 
built with our taxes, sounded the death knell of the Port of 
Montreal. It contributed substantially towards shifting certain 
activities towards the West, while destroying Montreal's 
position as a transit zone for goods, services and people. We 
could have made Montreal the biggest interior port in the world, 
a real international hub.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3584"> 3584 </A></B>
<P>
	Today, a special committee is considering the future of the 
Seaway, but we are stuck with it, and it will probably cost too 
much to undo.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	As an economic activity, transportation is central to many 
other activities. This is why maritime, rail, pipeline and air 
transportation play a role in the development capabilities of 
other economic activities. You can sense the appeal of that. This 
is clearly the reason why big investors, lobbyists and friends of 
the government are doing their utmost to lay their hands on this 
sector. Wolves follow their prey, and if we are not vigilant, 
private interest will prevail over public interest.
<P>
	I will conclude by saying that for too long our taxes have been 
used against us in this federation. We no longer want our taxes to 
be used to enrich the friends of the government, we want them to 
be used to reduce the debt. The financing of our party, the Bloc 
Quebecois, is a model to follow. Money comes from individuals, 
not from large companies or interest groups seeking favours by 
giving money to the main parties, irrespective of their leanings. 
We do not owe anyone anything, our hands are not tied.
<P>
	We are here to defend Quebec's interests, and they include a 
sound management of public funds. This is why the Bloc 
Quebecois is asking for a royal commission of inquiry. While 
waiting for Quebec sovereignty, we will try to improve Canada. 
Be assured that we are going to try to clean up its act.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne):</B> Mr. Speaker, several 
questions have been raised since yesterday regarding the famous 
Bill C-22, an Act respecting certain agreements concerning the 
redevelopment and operation of Terminals 1 and 2 at Lester B. 
Pearson International Airport.
<P>
	Several questions, to the total amazement of our friends 
opposite, had escaped them, not all of them though. Some 
Liberal members are more lucid than others, such as the member 
for York South-Weston, as demonstrated on page 3539 of 
yesterday's official report. I quote what he said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I would submit that it would be unconscionable if they were paid any money 
whatsoever not only because of what was said during the election campaign, and 
what happened behind the scenes, but also because of the very clear statement 
and the request for proposals that was put out in March 1992. At paragraph 
(8.6.3.), it says this. Again Mr. Bronfman and all those who were participating in 
this contract were well aware of what was in the request for proposals.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It said: ``All costs and expenses incurred by proponents relating to proposals 
will be borne by the proponents. The government is not liable to pay such costs 
and expenses or to reimburse or to compensate proponents in any manner 
whatsoever for such costs and expenses under any circumstances, including the 
rejection of any or all proposals and the cancellation of the project''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This paragraph shows very clearly that clause 10 of Bill C-22 
makes no sense whatsoever, unless the minister, the Minister of 
Transport in this case, has to, heaven forbid, reward friends of 
his party.
<P>
	Liberal members are surprised by our relentless attacks on 
this bill but what has happened to their commitment to 
transparency, now that they are six months into their mandate?
<P>
	Among the promises which filled a whole chapter of the red 
book, what has happened to the ethics counsellor in charge of 
advising ministers, MPs and other public officials? The 
government could really use somebody like that, these days. 
What progress has been made in the drafting of a code of 
conduct for Parliament? It seems to me that it has fallen by the 
wayside.
<P>
	What has happened to the new rules regarding lobbying? The 
Liberals will undoubtedly answer that it is a priority for them, 
but if we were to make a list of the priorities they have been 
talking about since January 17, I would feel sorry for issues that 
did not make it in their eyes because, for this government, 
everything is a priority, or rather, nothing is.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	With respect to the new lobbying rules, we learned only 
yesterday from a report in <I>La Presse</I> that the federal government 
had decided to extend by one year very lucrative advertising 
contracts prior to establishing its new lobbying rules.
<P>
	Clearly, there must be some mistake, Mr. Speaker. And yet, 
the government is now giving us the impression of taking care of 
its friends, before passing legislation to protect them, as I just 
mentioned. Perhaps we are mistaken, but the perception is rather 
different. And perception is the key to whether or not the public 
trusts the government. In this particular case, positions are 
relatively clear.
<P>
	With your permission, I would like to quote the hon. member 
for Red Deer who stated the following yesterday, which appears 
on page 3529 of Hansard. I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-I certainly agree with that. I would agree wholeheartedly with the 
member's comments that they know better and they obviously should not be 
expecting any compensation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As you can see, I have introduced quotes from Liberal and 
Reform members who agree with our amendments, but none 
from Bloc members.
<P>
	It is clear that Bloc members stand solidly behind this 
amendment, as do Reform members and even a few Liberals. 
Therefore, they have no business saying that we are being 
paranoid and that we are nitpicking.
<P>
	Not so very long ago, in addition to the member for York 
South-Weston, the Minister of Immigration himself, the 
President of the Treasury Board and the Parliamentary Secretary 
to the Minister of Industry spoke out on this agreement. Even the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3585"> 3585 </A></B>
<P>
Minister of Transport said that the federal government was 
considering setting  up a royal commission of inquiry into the 
privatization of Pearson Airport. This fact was reported in <I>La 
Presse</I> on November 29 last. The Minister of Transport himself 
suggested that such a commission be established.
<P>
	Why then are our colleagues opposite so surprised when 
barely a few months ago, they shared our position on this issue? 
Could it be because the members on this side have not changed 
their minds and are not in the habit of doing so every few 
months?
<P>
	Why did we not change our minds? Why are we asking for a 
royal commission of inquiry to save millions of dollars, perhaps 
hundreds of millions in the long run, to the taxpayers, but above 
all to clarify whether the government's hands are clean? That is 
the whole question.
<P>
	Why is it that, while the Nixon report, which surprisingly 
enough took only 30 days to produce, states that there has been 
wrongdoing in connection with lobbying, it gives no specific 
example of such practice?
<P>
	Also, why compensate people for costs incurred in such 
instances? My mother used to tell me, as a child, that honesty 
pays. Was she right or not?
<P>
	Why does the government continue to refuse to release the 
privatization contract concerning Pearson Airport? There are 
many unanswered questions, are there not? Many questions that 
will do nothing to improve the Liberal Party's credibility rating, 
if it has any credibility left.
<P>
	The reason we are opposing Bill C-22 and asking the 
government, for its own good and in the interest of the Canadian 
population as a whole, to shed light onto these obscure dealings 
is to get all these questions answered. Of course, that is if the 
government has nothing to hide; otherwise, its reluctance is 
understandable.
<P>
	In closing, let me repeat the amendment moved by the Bloc 
Quebecois:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``This House declines to give second reading to Bill C-22, An Act respecting 
certain agreements concerning the redevelopment and operation of Terminals 1 
and 2 at Lester B. Pearson International Airport, because the principle of the Bill 
is flawed due to the fact that it contains no provisions aimed at making the work 
done by lobbyists more transparent.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We also support the amendment to amendment moved by the 
Reform Party to add ``in Canada'' after the word ``lobbyists''.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, as my 
colleagues have been doing for two days, I want to speak on the 
shady privatization of Pearson Airport. It is obviously a 
question of money but it is also a matter of principle concerning 
the very foundation of the federal system, namely the financing 
of political parties.
<P>
	When stories such as this still make headlines in 1994, we 
wonder if democracy has made progress or if we are still facing 
the dubious tactics of the good old 1940s. Now, my dear friends, 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to relate to you a story my mother and 
father told me more than once. My father, an important lumber 
dealer and a highly-regarded Liberal organizer-back in the 
1940s, of course-who raised enormous amounts of money for 
the Liberal Party, had the opportunity to acquire machinery no 
longer needed after World War II, such as tracked vehicles and 
tanks. He leased flat cars from Canadian Pacific in Toronto and 
he was always telling me what a good deal it was. He told me: ``I 
sold one and all the others were free and clear''. He was of 
course a friend of the government. All his friends in the 
community tried to buy some but they were all gone, as friends 
of the government had bought everything they could lay their 
hands on at ridiculous prices.
<P>
	Before the last election, I was living quietly in my little 
community and looking from afar at what politicians with 
various levels of credibility were trying to do. Sometimes they 
did well, other times not so well. Political criticisms and 
analyses always apply to what the media choose to report. We 
are not so gullible as to believe that newspapers are always 
unbiased and always report all the facts. Not everything should 
be taken for granted.
<P>
	So, the media report horror stories suggesting that the 
government is not doing its job. We object and say it makes no 
sense, but, deep down, we wonder what is true. Barring some 
exceptions, nothing is black or white. For example, there was 
the Malaroï case, where virtue was pitted against bureaucracy, 
and where my colleague from Québec-Est spared no effort. 
Normally, sensationalism is profitable, not subtleties. As to the 
case before us today, even if we were not in the House when the 
story first broke, we realize that the more we learn from the 
media, the less we understand.
<P>
	Even if all members in the House know the story, I will 
summarize it briefly as I, the member for Frontenac, see it.
<P>
	The contract to privatize Pearson Airport was signed on 
October 7, 1993. As we all remember, that was only 18 days 
before the defeat of the Conservative government. And in 
Quebec, like elsewhere, polls were conducted almost every day. 
And the closer we got to October 25, the lower the Conservatives 
were in those polls. Time was of the essence; this could not wait 
until after the election; the Conservatives were no longer in the 
picture. You remember as well as I do what happened. Two 
bidders fought hard to get a contract worth several million 
dollars. To succeed, the two finally merged and got the contract 
on October 7.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3586"> 3586 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	During the last election campaign, the Liberals, and 
particularly those from the Toronto area, promised to cancel that 
contract. These same Liberals are now attempting to cancel the 
contract, but they are also trying to compensate the promoters. It 
must be pointed out that, under Bill C-22, the government does 
not have to compensate these people but the legislation 
authorizes-and this is what I strongly object to-the minister 
to make certain payments to promoters, at his discretion. Let me 
remind you that, according to recent polls, politicians are far 
from being popular.
<P>
	When I meet people from my region, they say: ``You are O.K., 
but we do not trust the others. Try not to stay in Ottawa too long, 
otherwise you will turn out like them''. My colleague for 
Terrebonne says that politicians are less popular than used car 
dealers. We do not give rebates. When such sordid stories are 
found out, how can you possibly hope to improve the image of 
politicians in Quebec? When the reputation of one of us is 
tarnished, we all pay a price.
<P>
	The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that there is no 
smoke without fire. If everything is honest and transparent in a 
contract, why be so secretive? Why not appoint a royal 
commission of inquiry? If the Liberal government opposite does 
not have anything to hide, such a measure would settle the issue 
and the Conservatives might be the only ones in hot water. But 
the Liberal Party is afraid to set up a royal commission of 
inquiry with the power to question all the players in the Pearson 
Airport saga.
<P>
	What seems contradictory at first glance is that a contract 
signed under suspicious circumstances by the Conservatives is 
not being denounced by the Liberals, who now form the 
government and have the necessary tools to shed some light on 
this transaction. Yet, during the election campaign the Liberals 
kept referring to the importance of transparency.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	When I taught my ecology students the transparency of water, 
I told them: ``It is like when you look down into a lake and you 
see the bottom''. We say that water is transparent when we see 
through it. Can we say that we see through the Liberal 
government today? I am asking them.
<P>
	Yet, in the red book, it is all there in black and white: the 
government is committed to more transparency. It has been six 
months and we are still waiting for this same transparency. This 
would have been the opportunity, I think, to prove that it was the 
transparency of a notion that was dear to them and not a media 
show.
<P>
	Unfortunately, I was able to deliver only one part of my 
speech. If one of my colleagues would want to take it, I could 
have it passed on to him or her. I thank you for your patience, 
Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity to take my turn in this debate on Bill 
C-22 respecting certain agreements concerning the 
redevelopment and operation of Terminals 1 and 2 at Lester B. 
Pearson International Airport in Toronto.
<P>
	I assume that, after listening to all the speeches we have had 
so far, you have realized that the very serious reservations of the 
Official Opposition about this bill concern section 10, which 
reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>10. (1) If the Minister considers it appropriate to do so, the Minister may, with 
the approval of the Governor in Council, enter into agreements on behalf of Her 
Majesty to provide for the payment of such amounts as the Minister considers 
appropriate in connection with the coming into force of this Act, subject to the 
terms and conditions that the Minister considers appropriate.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mr. Speaker, I imagine you have also understood that the 
opposition approves of cancelling this highly improper contract 
because there are many reasons for doing so. I became 
convinced after reading the Nixon report several times from 
start to finish. I found out why, although Mr. Nixon is as Liberal 
as they come-a very well connected Liberal who is very close 
to the circles we are talking about, including the friends of the 
Prime Minister-why his intellectual honesty and his sense of 
responsibility forced him to use the word ``maneuverings''.
<P>
	After carefully reading his report, one realizes why he had to 
use this word, which could be translated in French as 
``<I>magouillage</I>''. The <I>Petit Robert</I> defines the word ``magouille'' 
as follows: ``<I>Manoeuvres, tractations douteuses ou 
malhonnêtes</I>''. The English definition is: ``Maneuverings, 
questionable practices or shady dealings''. So this is pretty 
strong language.
<P>
	I thought I would simply bring to the attention of this House a 
few passages from the Nixon report which are self-explanatory 
and which illustrate the murky and shocking aspects of this 
affair, and as some people are saying, we may need a royal 
commission of inquiry to determine whether bad faith was 
involved.
<P>
	For instance, on page 5, there is a short paragraph that gives us 
an indication of the maneuvring, and a theme that runs through 
the entire Nixon report, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In the calculation of gross revenue (on which rent will be based), there are 10 
deductions which I am advised are unusual in commercial transactions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mr. Nixon also said that T1 T2 Limited Partnership, which 
would manage the airport, is a multi-purpose rather than a 
sole-purpose corporation.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The lease does not restrict the freedom of T1 T2 Limited Partnership to carry 
out an undertaking other than the management, operation and maintenance of 
Terminals 1 and 2. Therefore, the financial health of T1 T2 Limited Partnership 
could be adversely affected by the financial failure of a venture which has 
nothing to do with the management, operation and maintenance of Terminals 1 
and 2.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The report also says, with respect to air traffic:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3587"> 3587 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Government of Canada undertakes not to permit development of any 
airport facility within 75 km of the T1 T2 complex that would reduce passenger 
traffic at Pearson by more than 1.5 million persons per year, until the volume of 
passenger traffic at Pearson reaches 33 million people per year. Present 
projections predict this number to be reached by approximately the year 2005. If 
the Government of Canada chooses to engage in such proscribed development-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
-we can see the manoeuvring, the understanding which exists 
among people who are close to the government, have undue 
influence and who may even, and we will see this later on, 
condition and intimidate senior officials-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-it must either pay economic loss to the Tenant</BLOCKQUOTE>
-we know who that is-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-or provide the Tenant with access to Area 4 at Pearson, an area explicitly 
excluded from</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>the RFP.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Another interesting and revealing point.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>About the end of September 1993, T1 T2 Limited Partnership represented to 
the Government that it had entered into 10 contracts with non-arm's length 
parties-</BLOCKQUOTE>
-in other words, parties connected with and involved in the 
project-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-prior to October 7, 1993. One of these was said to be a construction 
management agreement with Matthews Construction. This information was not 
publicly disclosed.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The point is that Matthews is directly concerned and involved 
in the whole transaction and was closely connected with the 
activities of Paxport.
<P>
	The report also says the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>After permitting the privatization of Terminal 3 at Pearson, the process to 
privatize Terminals 1 and 2, the remainder of the largest airport in Canada, is 
inconsistent-</BLOCKQUOTE>
-this is fundamental-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-with the major thrust of the policy of the Government of Canada 
announced in 1987.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It was on the basis of this policy that the offer made in 
1989-90 by the same parties was turned down by the 
government. With the passage of time and as a result of intense 
lobbying, the government became very interested in 1993, and 
we know what happened.
<P>
	Another consideration in the Nixon report, a very important 
one this time, concerns the time frame the parties were allowed 
to submit their proposals.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The RFP having as it did only a single stage and requiring proponents to 
engage in project definition as well as proposal submission and, all within a 90 
day time frame-</BLOCKQUOTE>
-we are talking about an investment of $700 million, and 
people are being given 90 days to position themselves.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-created, in my view, an enormous advantage to a proponent-</BLOCKQUOTE>
-Paxport-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-an enormous advantage-</BLOCKQUOTE>
-this is the maneuvering-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-that had previously submitted a proposal for privatizing and developing T1 
and T2.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This was referred to earlier. It was the proposal turned down 
in 1989.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Other management and construction firms not having been involved in the 
maneuvering-</BLOCKQUOTE>
-this is Nixon speaking-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-preceding the RFP had no chance to come up to speed and submit a bid in the 
short time permitted. With little construction and development occurring-</BLOCKQUOTE>
-by honest people-considering the state of the economy in 
Toronto as well-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-others should have been sought out and given reasonable time to 
participate.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Further, it is significant that no financial pre-qualification was required in 
this competition. For a project of this magnitude the selection of a ``best overall 
acceptable proposal''-</BLOCKQUOTE>
-that was the basic criterion-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-without complete assurance of financial viability seems to me to have been 
highly unusual and unwise.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Finally, the concluding of this transaction at Prime Ministerial direction in 
the midst of an election campaign where this issue was controversial, in my view 
flies in the face of normal and honourable democratic practice. It is a well 
known and carefully observed tradition that when governments dissolve 
Parliament they must accept a restricted power of decision during the election 
period.</BLOCKQUOTE>
There is no question that a financial deal of this 
magnitude-$700 million-which would have privatized a 
public asset for 57 years should not have been signed at that 
time.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	I will end with one of the conclusions of Mr. Nixon, who 
believed that the process: ``to privatize and redevelop Terminals 
1 and 2 at Pearson fell far short of maximizing the public 
interest''. Therefore, considering all that surrounded the 
``negotiation'', it is imperative-and one is astonished that the 
report does not make any recommendation to that effect, and 
that the Prime minister who preaches openness in the red book 
has not taken any action in that direction-that we have an 
inquiry that can get to the bottom of that shocking event that is 
so damaging to the reputation of Canada, a country known for 
the quality of its institutions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, with clause 10 of Bill C-22, the government is in fact 
inviting the friends of the system-Conservatives and Liberals 
united as brothers this time and drooling in anticipation-to 
grab a piece of Pearson, a particularly juicy pie. Not only is the 
bill conveniently unclear about the way this pie is to be shared, 
but it does not explain how Pearson Airport is to be managed and 
what its place will be in the Canadian network. It is this latter 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3588"> 3588 </A></B>
<P>
and no  doubt less scandalous, but nevertheless important aspect 
of the bill that I would like to address today.
<P>
	It may be a good idea to show this airport's importance with 
regard to air transport, and in particular in relation to Montreal's 
two airports.
<P>
	Pearson and Mirabel-Dorval play a major function in air 
transportation in Canada. Competition between them can be 
beneficial, provided they compete on equal terms, which is not 
the case. The Mirabel-Dorval airport complex has a major 
handicap. If I wanted to make a case against the government 
based on assumptions and not facts, I would suspect it of, if not 
keeping an old wound open, at least painstakingly not helping it 
heal. Its persistent failure to act on this issue is really 
incomprehensible. I am referring to the lack of a high-speed 
link between Mirabel and Dorval as well as the totally 
inappropriate linkage of the airport complex with the road and 
railway system. First, a few facts.
<P>
	Dorval is the point of origin of all regular flights within 
Canada and to the United States, while Mirabel is the boarding 
point for all other destinations. A passenger travelling from 
Quebec City to Paris will have to transfer. That is normal, but 
what is not quite as normal is the fact that this person has to ride, 
from Dorval to Mirabel, in a shuttle travelling on Highways 15, 
640, and 13 and then on Mirabel Blvd. Commuting time: 40 
minutes, plus waiting time. It is absolutely absurd.
<P>
	To remedy the problem, it was suggested that Mirabel be 
closed down and all flights shifted to Dorval. What a brilliant 
idea! You eliminate one of the airports, thereby eliminating the 
need to connect them. Rather than curing the disease, it would be 
simpler to get rid of the patient!
<P>
	A simple solution would be to extend Highway 13 another 25 
kilometres to the north. It was agreed a long time ago that the 
costs-that is to say $78 million in 1988 dollars-were to be 
shared equally by Ottawa and Quebec, but nothing has been 
done since. Of course, for a long time, the two governments 
accused one another of refusing to co-operate, stating that a 
cheque could be made the following morning if only the other 
side would stop dragging its feet. I guess that is what you call 
profitable federalism!
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the sad thing is that, since then, cost estimates 
have risen by $50 million because of the procrastination. This 
will certainly not help break the impasse. The fact remains that 
there is a serious need to extend Highway 13 from Boisbriand to 
Mirabel Airport.
<P>
	However, what Mirabel needs to become a world class airport 
is a rail link.
<P>
	This unacceptable oversight could be corrected while at the 
same time another problem which is somewhat less frustrating 
could be solved. As everyone knows, most developed countries 
already have a high-speed train, an ultramodern means of 
transportation. In this as in so many other areas, Canada is 
lagging behind for lack of vision. The Minister of Transport is 
waiting for another in an endless series of reports on the Quebec 
City-Windsor HST project before giving consideration to 
eventually setting up this network. Studies already completed 
have concluded that an east-west rail link through Quebec and 
Ontario is feasible, necessary and cost-effective. A total of 
120,000 jobs would be created during the construction phase of 
the project.
<P>
	All that would need to be done is to add a loop to the main line 
to connect Montreal's two airports.
<P>
	Connections between the two airports could thus be made in 
18 minutes, instead of the current forty. Furthermore, the two 
provinces would be linked to Mirabel-Dorval by a high-speed, 
comfortable rail system, one which would leave foreign 
passengers with the impression this time of a country in the 
forefront of new technologies.
<P>
	In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, to ensure that the Toronto and 
Mirabel-Dorval airports can continue to complement one 
another and to provide services commensurate with the capital 
invested, steps must be taken to provide Mirabel with the tools 
mentioned. Failing this, neither Mirabel nor Dorval, for that 
matter, will be able to ensure appropriate levels of user services. 
I am talking about extending Highway 13 from Boisbriand to 
Mirabel and developing a high-speed train in the Quebec 
City-Windsor corridor, along with a loop to provide service to 
Mirabel and Dorval.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
state my position on Bill C-22, the Pearson International 
Airport Agreements Act.
<P>
	The bill declares in particular that the agreements did not 
come into force, bars any action for damages against the federal 
government, and authorizes the Minister of Transport to enter 
into agreements for the payment of amounts in connection with 
the coming into force of the legislation.
<P>
	I wish to draw the attention of the House to the last point. I 
strongly object to Bill C-22, which authorizes the government 
to pay the compensation it sees fit to private-sector contractors 
without shedding light on the circumstances that led to the 
decision to privatize the airport and to the hasty signature of the 
contract.
<P>
	When the government privatizes public property, 
transparency must be paramount, as the government advocates 
in the Throne Speech delivered at the beginning of this 
Parliament. Part of this speech reads as follows: ``Integrity and 
public trust in the institutions of government are essential. My 
ministers''--
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3589"> 3589 </A></B>
<P>
it was the Governor General speaking-``will insist upon  
integrity, honesty and openness on the part of those who 
exercise power on behalf of Canadians''.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister promised to shed light on the 
circumstances surrounding the negotiations and the agreement 
to privatize Pearson Airport. Instead, he gives us an internal 
review behind closed doors. Nevertheless, the study by Robert 
Nixon, a good Liberal, a former provincial finance minister and 
a former leader of the Liberal Party of Ontario, underlines the 
undue influence of lobbyists sympathetic to the current 
government.
<P>
	The Nixon report contains a number of comments on the 
privatization process, its political dimension and the terms of 
the redevelopment agreements. This same Mr. Nixon says that 
privatizing terminals 1 and 2 is not in accordance with the 
government policy that such terminals should be owned and 
operated by local authorities. He condemns this transaction and 
talks about the role of patronage and pressure groups.
<P>
	I would like to make myself clear. We want to shed light on 
this process of privatization, deals and agreements that are not 
in the public interest. The review of the Pearson Airport case 
concludes on page 9 that the role of lobbyists went far beyond 
the acceptable concept of consulting. ``It is clear that the 
lobbyists played a prominent role in attempting to affect the 
decisions that were reached''.
<P>
	This is a series of troubling facts that call into question this 
government's openness and the legitimacy of any decision to 
compensate the companies involved in the case. Why 
compensate individuals for charges incurred by people who 
abused their connections? This decision is contrary to 
government policies on this subject. Bill C-22 deals with a very 
controversial development agreement which should be 
elucidated.
<P>
	I understand that the government thinks that the bill is a way 
to undo an agreement that it condemns because the agreement 
was politically motivated and pushed by lobbyists. I understand 
the government wanting to avoid long and costly lawsuits if an 
agreement could not be negotiated.
<P>
	However, despite the controversy and although the 
government has announced the end of the contract, why does the 
government still want to keep this contract secret? Would there 
be something to hide? Not disclosing the full identity of all 
parties to this agreement and other major provisions of the 
contract inevitably arouses public mistrust. When the 
government makes a decision in a case involving the public 
interest, I think that it has to be open. The public has a right to 
know all the details of this agreement and the facts surrounding 
the government's decision.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the events leading up to the signing of the contract 
permitting the privatization of Pearson International Airport the 
various lobbyists appear to have played a disproportionate role.
<P>
	I call on the government to enlighten this affair of public 
interest as mentioned by the Leader of the Official Opposition in 
this House calling for the establishment of a royal commission 
of inquiry before the tabling of Bill C-22.
<P>
	As long as we do not know the roles played by the various 
players in this matter, how can we determine for sure whether 
investors are victims or actors in this affair?
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-22 declares that no amount will be payable under this 
agreement in relation to any loss of profit or any fee paid for the 
purpose of lobbying a public office holder. Why then will the 
Minister of Transport with the approval of the Governor in 
Council make agreements on behalf of the government to 
provide for the payment of such amounts?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	If the government wants to be off the hook, it must authorize 
an inquiry which will shed light on what might be one of the 
biggest patronage scandals in the history of Canada.
<P>
	Initially, Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Transport himself did 
not oppose the idea of a public inquiry to find out the details of 
the circumstances surrounding the Pearson Airport transaction. 
And the minister even had the support of several of his 
colleagues regarding such an initiative.
<P>
	Only after realizing that some of its close friends were 
involved did the government make an about-face, opting for a 
simple report prepared behind close doors. The government 
does not have the right to demand sacrifices from the public to 
help reduce the deficit, to make cuts in social programs, and to 
use taxpayers' money to compensate the key players in these 
dealings, when its own report states that in this case lobbies have 
largely exceeded the acceptable limits.
<P>
	Even if lobbying is legal, the public has a negative perception 
of this activity, especially in a case like this, where the lobbying 
took place without the public knowing about it, and where the 
decisions made went against public interest. Greater 
transparency will enable Canadians to know who is trying to 
influence who, how, and on what issue.
<P>
	For the sake of transparency and honesty, an inquiry must be 
held on the Pearson Airport transaction.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3590"> 3590 </A></B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I fully support the government when it is willing 
to improve Parliament's credibility. I am quite prepared to 
support the government when it proposes legislation aimed at 
ensuring greater transparency regarding its dealings with 
lobbyists.
<P>
	In this case, the government has no choice but to shed light on 
this issue. This is why I support the motion of the Leader of the 
Official Opposition to set up a royal commission of inquiry and 
find out the details of that unfortunate saga.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to have this opportunity today to speak on Bill C-22.
<P>
	I would like to point out to my colleagues and all members of 
Parliament that I had the privilege to sit, for four years, on the 
Société de promotion des aéroports de Montréal, which is 
considered, as you know, a local airport authority, according to a 
1987 government plan. I want to show you that local airport 
authorities, or LAA as they are called in the air transport 
industry, are much less prone to scheming than private 
companies which take charge of an airport, as was the case at 
Pearson.
<P>
	So, I think that we absolutely have to talk about the great 
openness shown by local airport authorities, and to do so, I want 
to use Montreal as an example, that is the airport of Montreal 
and its Société de promotion des aéroports, made up of 21 
individuals from the Communauté urbaine de Montréal.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	What does a SOPRAM or a promotion company do? First of 
all, it must get a very good representation within the greater 
metropolitan area as such. In the case of SOPRAM, there are 
three electoral colleges which form the 21 members of this 
promotion company. Of course, what the company will promote 
are these airports and with only one objective in mind, that is to 
re-invest the money in the community by doing repair work in 
these airports. That is far better than favouring a bunch of 
friends who are mostly interested in capitalizing their funds and 
ensuring that shareholders get more and more dividends in the 
end.
<P>
	In the case of a local airport authority, it is the opposite; the 
money is directed towards the community and re-invested, and 
people are put to work in the same community.
<P>
	If I go back to SOPRAM, I was saying earlier that there are 
three major electoral colleges; there are seven business people 
who form the executive of the Montreal Airport Administration. 
They all are business people and their distribution, as you will 
see, is very well thought out in terms of territorial distribution in 
the greater Montreal area. We also have seven elected people at 
the municipal level who are representatives of municipal 
politicians, and also, people who are responsible for the 
technology and the administration as such. I was myself part of 
the technicians and administrators category and I  was delegated 
by the Société montérégienne de développement and the City of 
Longueuil.
<P>
	Also on territorial distribution, it was made sure that the 
whole of the territory would be very well represented. Among 
others, we have three representatives from the South area, six 
representatives from the North area and 12 representatives from 
the island of Montreal. These people are serving their respective 
interests within a regional solidarity, and it is worth repeating 
that all the money is re-invested in the greater Montreal area.
<P>
	My colleagues raised earlier the relevancy of airport duality 
in Montreal. That is a debate that was just completed-airport of 
Montreal-and what was agreed to is that both Montreal airports 
are extremely important. Even a major international panel 
confirmed it. The international panel told us that having two 
airports was an extraordinary advantage for us. Unfortunately, 
at the time of devolution, the government withdrew from its 
project to link Dorval and Mirabel by a special shuttle so that, 
today, the cost of it will have to be borne by ADM.
<P>
	Let us look at the economic impact. As I said, the goal and 
objective of the development corporation, as far as Montreal 
airports are concerned is to make sure that money is reinvested 
in the area. At the present time these two airports bring in about 
$100 million. After expenses, we manage to keep $30 million 
which, over the next five years, will be reinvested into the 
communities through improvements and repairs to the airports. 
This will create about 1,700 jobs over the next five years. The 
difference is obvious. Profits are reinvested in the community, 
they go directly to the workers hired to improve the 
infrastructures and not to shareholders, as dividends, or to a 
bunch of friends of the government.
<P>
	We can also talk of the direct impact. In 1987, it amounted to 
$109 million for the community of Montreal and, in 1992, it 
reached $273 million. I repeat, the revenues are around $100 
million annually.
<P>
	According to an HEC study, 42,185 jobs result directly and 
indirectly from the operation of the two Montreal airports and 
the reinvestment of profits into the community contributes 
greatly to job creation. We can see the importance of a local 
airport authority. This is not the situation at Pearson Airport. 
Why not?
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	Clearly, the private sector noticed that there was a ripe plum 
to be picked, something juicy enough to whet the appetite of 
shareholders. With the help of lobbyists they pressed the 
government by saying: ``Do not give it to a local airport 
authority, this is a source of trouble''. Squabbles occur in all 
local airport authorities, and Montreal had its share, but in the 
end, we agreed in order to protect the interest of the community.
<P>
	In Toronto, the government said that a local airport authority 
would not work and that the private sector should have the 
opportunity to dip into the trough. And that is what happened. 
The present government, which  promised during the election 
campaign that it would cancel the deal, in now finding that the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3591"> 3591 </A></B>
<P>
people feeding at the trough were not all friends of the 
Conservatives, there were also friends of the Liberals. This is 
why the minister has included in the bill provisions that would 
give him discretionary powers to compensate friends of his 
party.
<P>
	We can see all the differences and contradictions that exist 
between the two systems; on the one hand, Montreal proceeds 
with a people-minded, democratic approach whereas, on the 
other hand, people in Toronto manage to get a piece of the 
action, and put the interests of the shareholders, lobbyists, and 
friends of the government before those of the community.
<P>
	To conclude, I am indeed in complete agreement with the 
amendment proposed by the Bloc Quebecois because we need a 
royal commission to review the whole deal. I would even say 
that, besides a royal commission, the government should allow, 
without delay, Metropolitan Toronto to take matters into its own 
hands. I think that there are some very worthwhile people in that 
city who would be more concerned with the interests of the 
community than with strictly financial interests. There are 
people who were there at the time, such as the mayor of 
Mississauga who was very active and who would probably be 
willing to carry the torch to make sure that this local airport 
authority comes into being and that priority is given to the 
public interest instead of the interests of the government's 
friends.
<P>
	To this end, I think that a royal commission is an absolute 
must. And I repeat that we should take this opportunity to allow 
Metropolitan Toronto to take matters into its own hands and say 
to the government's friends: ``Sorry, the contract is cancelled 
and there will be no discretionary compensation''. I think that, 
in this whole matter, we have to look at the government's 
transparency and set an example so that, from now on, in 
Canada, there is a clear message that you cannot operate behind 
the scene and favour your friends at the expense of the public 
purse. I believe that a royal commission is in order. Let us 
proceed with a royal commission and discover what is behind all 
this manoeuvering.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, now that the future of Quebec and of Canada is being 
debated, we still find ourselves talking about lobbyists. Need we 
remind members that lobbying is not a new activity? This 
country, Canada, is the end result of lobbying efforts. Consider 
the Grand Trunk railroad! The many lobbyists who were 
involved in the building of the railroad were in fact responsible 
for building Canada. There more things change, the more they 
remain the same.
<P>
	The question is even raised in our history books. I pointed this 
out to one member, a friend who sits across from me in this 
House. Lobbyists were the great Canadian promoters and we are 
still contending with  them today, albeit not the same people. 
However, the spirit of lobbying continues to burn brightly.
<P>
	Yet, in its red book, the government promised transparency. 
On looking at the whole Pearson Airport deal, it becomes clear 
that the one thing lacking is transparency, at the very least. Let 
me recall a few facts for you.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	On December 7, 1992, the federal government decided to go 
with the bid submitted by Paxport Inc.
<P>
	Two months later, this company was forced to join forces with 
its only competitor to form a consortium, T1 T2 Limited 
Partnership. It is somewhat troubling to realize that the 
government was planning to award a 57-year contract worth 
several hundred million dollars to a company in financial 
difficulty, a company which besides had close ties with the 
governing party, which at the time, was the Conservative party.
<P>
	While we could say that T1 T2 was once a Tory entreprise, 
over time it has become a Grit entreprise. Basically, that is what 
the red book is all about, Mr. Speaker. It is saying: Count on us, 
we will put you in the red. And we currently seem to be heading 
in that direction.
<P>
	The policy put forward by the Conservative government as 
early as 1987 regarding airport administration was based first 
and foremost on local airport authorities of the public type-I 
am thinking of the Montreal ADM-or else the administration 
was contracted to certain firms, as was the case in Vancouver, 
Calgary and Edmonton. Privatizing Pearson Airport ran directly 
counter Transport Canada's policies.
<P>
	Take also the bidding period, which was only 90 days long. 
This time limit seems somewhat unusual, in that we cannot talk 
about standard tendering. This is a 57-year contract, a 
long-term and very complex contract.
<P>
	So, why limit the bidding period that much, if not to favour 
companies that had already expressed an interest in that area? 
Companies like Paxport, which had already submitted a 
privatization plan in 1989 or one which was already managing 
another airport, like Claridge, responsible of Terminal 3 at 
Pearson Airport.
<P>
	Wrongdoing on the part of lobbyists was mentioned in the 
Nixon Report, but without quoting any specific case. Why then 
compensate people for their expenses if they misused their 
connections?
<P>
	As Robert Nixon points out: ``It is clear that the lobbyists 
played a prominent part in attempting to affect the decisions that 
were reached, going far beyond the acceptable concept of 
``consulting''. That is on page 9 of the report, Mr. Speaker.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3592"> 3592 </A></B>
<P>
	Disturbing conduct is also reported on the part of political 
staff members who have shown too much interest in the 
transaction, an interest disproportionate to reality as we know it 
today. That is also on page 9, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	In spite of the controversy, in spite of the fact that it has 
already announced the cancellation of the contract, the 
government persists in refusing to release the contract in 
question.
<P>
	One can wonder why. Does the government have something to 
hide? Is this a case of the Ginn Publishing syndrome? Because in 
that case too, they refuse to show us the contract. Are we 
dealing, for example, with advertising contracts awarded by the 
minister responsible for government operations with no real 
tendering process, no clear criteria, basically at the discretion of 
the minister?
<P>
	Contracts which, as we find out, are more often than not 
granted to friends of the system, the kind of people who carry a 
membership card in the Laurier Club. It is strange that things are 
not more open, and that there are even no parameters.
<P>
	In the Quebec legislature, if contracts were awarded in this 
way, there would be a general outcry. We are a long way from 
``Vautrin's pants'' in the days of Duplessis. We are not talking 
about a pair of pants but about an airport, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	Why was this 57-year contract, worth hundreds of millions of 
dollars, awarded without financial pre-qualification? On page 8 
of his report, Robert Nixon concludes that such a process is 
highly unusual. At least we hope so. If it were usual to award 
57-year contracts worth hundreds of millions without financial 
pre-qualification, we would be worried and with good reason.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	We can however ask, not necessarily for the first time either, 
why Hibernia project we are now considering was not subjected 
to a thorough financial review either. We are set to invest 
another $1 billion in the biggest contract, private or public, in 
Canada's history, and no serious study was done. We are now 
being asked to invest another $1 billion with our eyes closed. So 
no prior financial study was made for Pearson Airport.
<P>
	As you may recall, the Conservative government signed the 
contract in the last days of an election campaign. This 
undemocratic gesture was denounced by our friends opposite. 
Mr. Chrétien jumped on this opportunity to denounce these 
undemocratic measures flying in the face of Parliament's 
supremacy because the government, of course, must honour its 
predecessors' commitments. But there is a way to get out of it to 
accommodate current realities, as was the case with the 
helicopters. They acted, but more openly that time. That was in 
Quebec, and the government may have fewer friends in Quebec, 
but it is different in Toronto.
<P>
	Private developers could not help but know that the Liberals 
were likely to form the next government. That is why the T1 T2 
Partnership is friends with the Liberals and with the 
Conservatives. As everyone knows, the ranks of lobbyists do not 
only include Conservatives. They also need Liberals in case a 
new government is elected. They know how to prepare for 
change. These people are used to power. The party in power may 
change, but the ideas remain the same.
<P>
	The lobbyists knew then that the Liberals would take power; 
they knew that there was a risk in signing such a contract. They 
decided to take it. That is the law of the market. They are 
business people, serious people who are always telling us that 
we have to take the risk of free competition, we must not be 
afraid, we must know how to take risks, and they are asking the 
government to compensate them for the risks they took. They 
made a mistake, poor things! They must be compensated. These 
are the same people who usually denounce the unemployed and 
welfare recipients. Pearson is luxury-class welfare, Mr. 
Speaker.
<P>
	When the Conservatives awarded the contract, they knew one 
thing. Ms. Campbell and Mr. Charest did not seriously think that 
they would keep power. They knew that, but they did not know 
that they would be left with only two members.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I just want to make sure 
that we know that we are supposed to refer to one another by the 
name of our riding when we sit in the House. I just wanted to 
bring this to the hon. member's attention.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. So the member for 
Sherbrooke and Ms. Campbell-I must name her because she no 
longer has a riding-did not suspect that their party would be 
reduced to two seats.
<P>
	So these people said to themselves, ``Before we leave 
Parliament and our access to government funds, we will ensure 
that our friends have not invested for nothing,'' because the 
names involved in the Pearson affair did not invest only in 
Pearson. These people invest at least every four years, even 
every year, with the Grits and with the Tories, with the Tories 
and with the Grits. Depending on who will be in power, they 
invest more in one side than the other. I suppose they invested 
more in the Liberals, who have 177 seats, than in the 
Conservatives, although each of the two remaining Tories must 
have got more than the 177 Liberals, on a per capita basis.
<P>
	So Mr. Nixon says a little farther in his report, and I will close 
with that-my ten minutes are almost up-that his examination 
had led him to only one conclusion: to leave in place an 
inadequate contract, arrived at through such a flawed process 
and under the shadow of possible political manipulation, is 
unacceptable.
<P>
	That is what we say: it is unacceptable. We must get to the 
bottom of it and have the resources to do so, have the power to 
compel people to testify, to present documents  and to get a good 
idea of what people opposite would like to keep in 
semi-obscurity.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would just add that, as 
Acting Speaker, I have the duty and the honour and the pleasure 
to protect the interests and privileges of members of this House.
<P>
	I do understand that when members are outside the House, 
they are more vulnerable. However, I know that, whether you are 
here or not, I must maintain respect for these traditions in the 
House.
<P>
	Now to continue the debate, the hon. member for Gaspé.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Mr. Speaker, please excuse my 
astonishment. I did not expect to rise so soon in the House on 
this matter.
<P>
	Never mind, there is so much to say on the subject, that I 
would be tempted to say: ``Let us get on with this, the party is 
over''. That attitude must have prompted the motion from 
members opposite.
<P>
	If I understood my colleagues well, and what members 
opposite did not understand, our main objection to this bill is the 
fact that in principle it does not allow us to see what the 
lobbyists involved are doing.
<P>
	On my opinion, to avoid making the same errors in the future, 
it is important that we review such measures. Because this is no 
small matter. We are talking big money here. Moreover, we are 
dealing with the future of transportation in Canada, which was 
really the issue here and which they are trying to make us forget. 
They want us to casually disregard what has happened.
<P>
	The biggest surprise, and all my colleague agree on that, is 
that it was only when the election drew near, or during the last 
week of the campaign, that the new Prime Minister rushed in to 
announce that an end would be put to that ``bargain''.
<P>
	Now, in Parliament, we are told that we must keep silent and 
that we will not be told what really happened. We call that 
writing a blank check. I must admit that I find it hard to live with 
such an arrangement.
<P>
	What are we to think of all those things which they are trying 
to hide from us? The things they hide from us tell a lot about the 
way political parties are financed. We are talking about 
lobbyists. The Bloc Quebecois has very strict rules regarding 
party financing, and we must thank Mr. René Lévesque for that.
<P>
	We must specify who gives us money, and the maximum 
allowable amount is $5,000. This, Mr. Speaker, is a good 
example of transparency. You can see who gives us money and 
whose interests I represent. People may contribute $5, $10 or 
$100. There are very few in my riding who can make a 
contribution of $1,000, and this brings me to another issue: the 
underdevelopment of regions.
<P>
	Remote regions like mine do not have the monies or 
incentives which would allow us to be represented by very 
articulate lobbyists. They are capable of great things, but we are 
not on a level playing field in that regard. There is one thing 
though which the public has understood, and I will get back to 
this when I discuss the underdevelopment of our regions.
<P>
	The public has the right to know. During the last election 
campaign, the Bloc Quebecois had limited funds with those $5 
and $10 contributions to which I referred earlier.  Nevertheless, 
with these small amounts, it succeeded in getting almost two 
thirds of the seats in Quebec: 54 out of 75 to be precise.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
Personally, I only spent 60 per cent of the amount allowed to me 
by the returning officer, and that was enough to defeat two 
powerful organizations, two old parties. Why is that? It is 
because I talked to people; I did not try to buy their vote with 
money. In fact, I could not even afford a single page of 
advertising in newspapers. But I talked to people and 
journalists, and the public got my message.
<P>
	The Liberals now have the opportunity to do exactly what the 
public expects from them, and that is to tell the people what this 
is all about. The people have to know what went on with this 
deal. They have to know why such a thing cannot happen ever 
again. It is very important.
<P>
	I also want to talk about the economic underdevelopment of 
some areas. If the current Liberal government cannot show us 
how to ensure that, from now on, lobbyists will not be able to 
continue to influence Canadian development and economic 
policies in any negative way, how can we benefit from the 
expertise of these lobbyists? This is a good question, since all 
the Liberals talked about in the red book and during the election 
campaign was jobs, jobs, jobs. But when will we be able to work 
with people who know how to get money from the government to 
put remote areas residents back to work?
<P>
	I know that I am digressing, and I will come back to the 
Pearson issue, but I just want to ask how am I supposed to 
explain to people in my riding, where unemployment is at 27 per 
cent and the labour force participation rate stands at 42 per cent, 
that I gave the government a blank cheque to pass over in silence 
the millions of dollars that were wasted and the nasty trick we 
were about to play on the Canadian air transport industry. I will 
never be able to explain the situation to my voters. However, if 
the minister or the Cabinet wants to play this little game, maybe 
they can try to explain the whole situation or send lobbyists to 
develop the remote areas that are currently underdeveloped. We 
have the resources, but maybe we are not developing them the 
right way. But we were never given a chance in the past, since 
each time we came up with a good idea, as many people from the 
Gaspe Peninsula have noticed, a funny  thing happened and the 
project was always taken away to the city.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3594"> 3594 </A></B>
<P>
	This leads us to believe that lobbyists have a lot of clout and 
that is not acceptable to us. Also it is difficult to understand that 
only two groups were involved in that deal as there were only 
two parties-and some criticized us for this. But there is now a 
third party, which I would call the voice of the Quebec people, 
that is the Bloc Quebecois. And we do not want to put up with 
that kind of things.
<P>
	I agree with everything the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean 
and Leader of the Opposition said the other day in his speech and 
I would invite every Canadian to reflect on it. We make so many 
speeches to try to promote awareness among members on the 
other side. Although they do not belong to our party, our 
colleagues in the Opposition must also have something to say 
against this lobby system, which may be responsible for the 
increase in poverty and a wider development gap between 
central Canada and the rural or isolated areas like mine.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	How can I make the government think? As an hon. member, 
the only means I have is the opportunity to express my views in 
this House. I do not have millions of dollars but I represent a 
riding as equal and as influential as the others.
<P>
	During my election campaign, I used to say: ``Local problems 
call for local solutions''. If ever the federal government must 
give up its direct control over Pearson Airport, I would 
understand, as the hon. member who spoke before me said, that 
it could be transferred to a municipal airport authority. 
Torontonians would know how to use such a development tool, 
such an important link in the transportation system. However, I 
repeat that, before any decision is made, the government will 
have to clarify the role of the lobbyists in this issue. Pearson 
must become a reference case so that never again is such a 
situation imposed on the Canadian taxpayers, especially not 
during an election.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="NATIONALSPORTACT">NATIONAL SPORT ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops)</B> moved that Bill C-212, an act to 
recognize hockey as the national sport, be read the second time 
and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from 
Broadview-Greenwood along with my colleague from 
Regina-Lumsden and many others who formally seconded this 
bill. I want to acknowledge my assistant, Bill Syrros, for all of 
the preparatory work he has done to make this a success today.
<P>
	I will begin my short speech by quoting Bruce Kidd who said 
in the book <I>Welcome Home</I> by Stuart McLean: ``Hockey is the 
Canadian metaphor. The rink is a symbol of this country's vast 
stretches of water and wilderness, its extremes of climate, the 
player a symbol of our struggle to civilize such a land. Unsure as 
we are about who we are, we know at least this about ourselves: 
We are hockey players and we are hockey fans''.
<P>
	Those words certainly ring very true these days considering 
what the national pastime is of Canadians from coast to coast to 
coast nightly.
<P>
	I do not suppose there are many of us who do not recall that 
moment of excitement on a Saturday night when the Montreal 
Canadiens would take to the ice and that soft maritime chant 
would fill the room: ``Good evening ladies and gentlemen and 
hockey fans from coast to coast. This is Danny Gallivan at the 
Forum in Montreal''. Then Saturday night would be complete 
and life would be good.
<P>
	Probably most of us in this House played hockey and skated 
even before we could tie our own skates. Many of us will 
remember those great moments when we first learned how to 
raise a puck, seeing that puck sailing through the air for the first 
time. Or maybe it was the first time we were able to complete a 
good slapshot and heard the sound of that puck bashing into the 
boards.
<P>
	It is safe to say that hockey matters to all of us, in Quebec and 
the rest of Canada. It is part of our culture. It is key to the 
understanding of Canada. It is the perfect game on the perfect 
Canadian medium in the perfect Canadian season. We are a 
northern people and hockey is a northern sport. It is certainly 
fair to say it is much more than a game in our country.
<P>
	There are few sportsmen in Canada today who on a wintery 
Saturday night are not seated waiting for those familiar words: 
``It's hockey night in Canada''. The voice of the late Foster 
Hewitt was embedded in the minds of many Canadians from the 
inception of CBC radio and television. That voice united Canada 
from the Atlantic shores of Newfoundland to Vancouver Island 
and even northward to the Arctic missions.
<P>
	It has been estimated that over 650,000 Canadians actually 
take part in some form of organized hockey.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3595"> 3595 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1735 ) </B>
<P>
	To quote the late Foster Hewitt: ``In our country while hockey 
is usually played for sheer enjoyment, its outdoor rinks and 
enclosed arenas are meeting places for youths of all origins 
where race, culture and creed are forgotten. Stewarts, Kellys, 
Smiths, Beliveaus, Delvecchios, Mahovlichs, the Ullmans and 
Howes combine for the glory of the team and in the process, 
Canada gains in unity and strength''.
<P>
	In this day, sport has become a means by which a nation 
attains international status and recognition. I believe that 
hockey is Canada's national game and is the main sports 
preoccupation of our young people.
<P>
	It is ultimately woven in our Canadian self-image and our 
mythology. Paul Henderson set the tone for this image in 1972 
with his dramatic goal over Russia. Indeed, hockey is more than 
a national game for its popularity has spread to at least 20 
different countries.
<P>
	It is time to recognize hockey for its impact on Canada. It is 
time to thank the volunteers and all the hockey teams in Canada 
for their contribution in a number of areas such as charity, 
education, competition and international co-operation.
<P>
	It gives me a great deal of pleasure to congratulate Canada's 
championship women's hockey team for capturing its third 
consecutive world hockey championship in Lake Placid two 
weeks ago. It is no wonder that women's hockey is the fastest 
growing sport in Canada.
<P>
	When we look at whether or not we should identify a certain 
sport as our national sport, it is important to look at the origin of 
the sport, its popularity in the country today, the reputation it 
has abroad and the value of a number of intangibles.
<P>
	Many historians have tried to figure out where and when 
hockey was created in Canada. The cities of Halifax, Kingston 
and Montreal have all boasted that they are the true birthplace of 
hockey in Canada. I am sure more theories of hockey's 
birthplace will arise in the future.
<P>
	I was interested to hear a comment last month by my hon. 
Liberal colleague representing the riding of Annapolis 
Valley-Hants who mentioned that his riding represents the 
birthplace of hockey.
<P>
	One theory in support of Kingston mentions that an early 
historian by the name of Mr. Horsey wrote in his diary of 1847: 
``Most of the soldier boys were quite at home on skates. Shinny 
was their first delight where 50 or more players on each side 
would be in the game''.
<P>
	A committee appointed by the Canadian Amateur Hockey 
Association to determine the Canadian origin of hockey 
concluded: ``The first hockey was played by the Royal Canadian 
Rifles, an imperial unit stationed in Halifax and Kingston in 
1855. It is quite possible that English troops stationed in 
Kingston from 1783 to 1855 played hockey, as there was 
evidence in old papers, letters and legends''.
<P>
	In Montreal authorities emphatically declared their city is the 
original home of ice hockey. They felt that the first pure hockey 
game was played in Montreal at Victoria Skating Rink on March 
3, 1875.
<P>
	Perhaps the true cradle of hockey could have been Acropolis 
Hill in Greece, as there are remnants of a goal, men with hockey 
sticks in hand, a ball on the ground between curved blades, and 
an official about to give the starting signal.
<P>
	Hockey remains the sport of first choice for the majority of 
Canadian households. It is already looked upon by Canadians as 
Canada's national sport. This has been proven in the past but 
most recently by the great outpouring of support and 
encouragement for Canada's gold medal national junior hockey 
team, five medals over the last seven years, and the silver medal 
efforts of our Olympic team in each of the last two Winter 
Olympic Games. In a recent newspaper article by the Ottawa 
<I>Citizen</I> it was mentioned that Canadian fans vastly outnumbered 
Americans as a sea of red aided the Canadian women's hockey 
team to a third consecutive world championship in Lake Placid, 
New York.
<P>
	A national sport would promote national interest in times of 
national competition. Hockey is governed by a national 
organization and millions of fans follow it. National radio and 
television spend a great deal of money to broadcast hockey 
games. There is an organized hockey event in virtually every 
Canadian community, be it a large city or a humble village.
<P>
	I received a letter of support for this motion from the 
Canadian Amateur Hockey Association. Its membership 
includes an active volunteer force in excess of 100,000 
Canadians and upward of 500,000 on-ice participants.
<P>
	Canada is recognized worldwide as the nation where the great 
sport originated. It is unquestionably looked upon as the 
foremost leader playing a vital role in the evolution of hockey 
worldwide. By the most recent estimates it extends now to not 
20 but actually 51 countries that make up the membership of the 
International Ice Hockey Federation.
<P>
<B>(1740 ) </B>
<P>
	There is nothing more identifiably Canadian to the rest of the 
world than our game of hockey. Canadian Amateur Hockey 
Association teams at all levels of play compete regularly and 
successfully in international tournaments and championships 
around the world.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3596"> 3596 </A></B>
<P>
	In each season the Canadian Hockey Association transfers 
almost 600 accomplished Canadian players to hockey-playing 
countries where they assist in the growth of this sport overseas 
in various emerging federations. All of these players are 
outstanding ambassadors for our country and our game. They 
help to sell Canada, its wholesome values and its healthy 
lifestyles.
<P>
	In discussing hockey we can never forget the economic 
impact it has on Canada. A cursory glance indicates that tens of 
thousands of Canadians are employed directly or indirectly as a 
result of the game of hockey.
<P>
	In 1992 Statistics Canada completed a family expenditure 
survey which concluded that Canadians spent approximately 
$400 million annually on hockey. This does not include club 
dues, ice time, travelling expenses or other numerous expenses 
relating to participation in hockey competition.
<P>
	Again I cannot mention enough the appreciation for the 
millions of hours that volunteers contribute to ensure the 
success of tournaments and the education of youth in this sport.
<P>
	Women's hockey is the fastest growing women's sport played 
in Canada today. In the past few years the Canadian Amateur 
Hockey Association has estimated the number of women 
participating in minor hockey at approximately 13,000 and that 
is being very modest. This has grown from the 6,000 recorded in 
the 1991-92 season. This upsurge has a lot to do with the success 
of officially sanctioned world championship events.
<P>
	Women are actively challenging for positions on professional 
teams throughout Canada and the United States. The success of 
Canadian Manon Rhéaume, the first woman to play hockey in 
the National Hockey League, also has a lot to do with the surge 
of female participation in hockey.
<P>
	Brampton, Ontario hosts a women's hockey tournament every 
year that attracts over 250 teams, including international teams 
from countries such as Russia and Finland.
<P>
	I could go on about how hockey supports charity 
organizations of all sorts throughout our country. I could talk 
about the impact of the international Hockey Hall of Fame 
located in the great city of Toronto. I could talk about the impact 
hockey has on my hometown of Kamloops where we 
enthusiastically support the Kamloops Blazers. I wish them well 
in their competition with our friends from Saskatoon. I could go 
on but I want to step down to allow ample time for a number of 
members who have indicated an interest in participating in this 
debate.
<P>
	I simply want to say the time has come and the timing is 
perfect. We are right in the middle of hockey enthusiasm and 
excitement in this country. It would be a great gesture of this 
Parliament to agree to declare hockey our national sport. I think 
Canadians would welcome and applaud that from coast to coast 
to coast.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Mr. Speaker, during the last 
election campaign there was much rhetoric about how there 
should be more co-operation in Parliament and how MPs should 
actually work together to achieve objectives common to all.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We have the opportunity today to prove that co-operation 
works.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In an effort to include a Canadian sporting tradition that 
predates Confederation, I have asked the member for Kamloops 
to support the amendment of his private member's bill to 
recognize both ice hockey and lacrosse as national sports of 
Canada.
<P>
	While many Canadians would certainly view the national 
sports status of ice hockey as a natural expression of the 
Canadian reality, the concept has been on ice for decades. 
Canadians have long recognized the significance of another 
sport which also originated in Canada and which is played all 
over the world today.
<P>
	Our proposed amendment would allow for the inclusion of 
Canada's long tradition in the sport of lacrosse and would 
resolve an issue that has been left on the bench since 
Confederation.
<P>
	In January 1967 Prime Minister Lester Pearson, a devotee of 
sports and honorary chair of the Canadian Lacrosse Association, 
said in this House: ``I think we should have a national summer 
game and a national winter game''.
<P>
<B>(1745 ) </B>
<P>
	Twenty-seven years later members of this Parliament had the 
chance to convert a pass from Pearson and remind ourselves of 
some unique aspects of Canadian culture.
<P>
	As Americans remember where they were when Neil 
Armstrong took a great leap for mankind, Canadians remember 
what they were doing when Paul Henderson sent Canadians to 
the moon when he scored the winning goal for Canada in 1972.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canadians can be proud when hockey is played at the Olympic 
Games in Norway or when the lacrosse championship is held in 
the United Kingdom.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Not only are Canadians a dominant force in both sports but we 
have been on top for more than a century. Both these sports are 
just as symbolic of Canada as the maple leaf or the <I>Bluenose</I>.

	Ice hockey as it is played today originated in Canada in 1855, 
on Christmas Day, when the Royal Canadian Rifles based in 
Kingston, Ontario decided to remove the snow covering the ice 
in the harbour. They then attached blades to their boots and 
started playing with field hockey sticks and a lacrosse ball 
which they had borrowed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the early 1800s the Algonquin Indian tribe of the St. 
Lawrence Valley in Canada played a sport that is known as 
lacrosse, the sport that was an important element in the life and 
culture of First Nations. Today it is just as important in the lives 
of Canadians of all backgrounds.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	Throughout Canadian history, we have had every reason to be 
proud of our athletes who participate in all kinds of sports.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Our nation's athletes have inspired great pride in Canadians 
by their world class performance in so many different sports: 
curling, synchronized swimming, canoeing, rugby, diving, track 
and field, skiing, skating and biathlon, to name a few. Today we 
salute Canadian achievement in all sports.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Recognizing that sports are an important element of our 
culture, I think it is essential that we take responsibility for the 
future of sports in Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As one of the partners involved in the development of sport, 
the Government of Canada has a very legitimate and essential 
role to play in that future. We must focus on building a stronger 
recognition of sport as an important contributor to the Canadian 
cultural identity.
<P>
	Douglas Fisher once said: ``Most of our shared experiences 
and values from Bonavista to Vancouver Island are through 
politics and sport. We would be a much duller lot without our 
sporting heritage and sporting present''. In short, we must make 
sure that our athletes are always playing at full strength.
<P>
	This is one occasion when Parliament should not take one 
game at a time. Mr. Speaker, I think you will find that there is 
unanimous consent for this motion. I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-212 be modified in clause 2 by deleting all the words following 
``national'' and replacing them with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is there a point of order? 
The hon. member for Bellechasse.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker, about the relevancy of the 
amendment. I respectfully suggest that this amendment should 
be submitted during consideration by the committee of the 
whole House, if there is to be a committee of the whole House on 
this bill, and not at the second reading stage.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I thank the hon. member 
for Bellechasse for his remarks. I will consult with the table 
officers and I will get back to the House at once, on this matter.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary is asking for unanimous consent. 
If the House gives its unanimous consent, it would be acceptable 
to proceed in this manner at this stage.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Mr. Speaker, since I was prepared 
to speak to the motion dealing with hockey, I will speak only 
about hockey, which does not mean that I oppose the 
amendment.
<P>
	I would first like to congratulate the hon. member for 
Kamloops for his determination in wanting to have hockey 
recognized as the national sport since, according to our 
research, this is at least his third attempt to do so. Moreover, I 
learned from my own research that this is at least the tenth time 
that someone in this House tried to have hockey recognized as 
the national sport.
<P>
	Let me say straightaway that we are in favour of recognizing 
hockey as the national sport, but for another reason than the one 
raised by the hon. member for Kamloops. The hon. member for 
Kamloops said that one of the reasons why he presented this bill 
is that it may contribute to national unity.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3598"> 3598 </A></B>
<P>
	I do not intend to embark on a partisan debate today, because 
the reason for a national sport is to foster harmony, but I would 
like to indicate to the hon. member for Kamloops that our 
perspective may be different from his. Nothing prevents two 
countries from sharing the same national sport. Quebecers also 
love hockey. We will have to wait for a referendum, but Quebec 
will likely be a sovereign state in a couple of years, and it will 
want to keep excellent relations with English-speaking Canada. 
Sports foster good relations. For reasons that have nothing to do 
with those of the hon. member for Kamloops, we agree that 
hockey should become a national sport.
<P>
	If there is a sport that can arouse interest here, that sport is 
hockey. Playoffs under way in the National Hockey League are 
on the mind of many people. The first item on the <I>Téléjournal</I> on 
April 20 was the health problems of the Canadiens' goalie 
Patrick Roy, and not the war in Bosnia or bloodshed in Rwanda.
<P>
	Many people may condemn that editorial choice, but it shows 
how important hockey is for Canadians and Quebecers.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	The method most frequently used by countries to choose a 
national sport is to find one which was created in that country. 
This is the case for hockey which is a combination of four other 
sports, three coming from abroad and one taken from the 
Indians. People probably do not know it, but hockey is a 
combination of bandy, originally from England, shinty, 
originally from Scotland, hurley, originally from Ireland, and, 
of course, lacrosse, a native Indian sport.
<P>
	The books written on hockey do not say when and where the 
first real game was played. As the member for Kamloops and the 
parliamentary secretary said, many have their own ideas about 
its history. Many regions still claim, without documented proof, 
to be the site of the first game. However, we know that the first 
publicized hockey game was played in 1875 at McGill 
University in Montreal and that the first rules were published in 
<I>The Gazette</I> on February 27, 1877. All this proves one thing: 
hockey was truly invented in Canada.
<P>
	It is also very important to look at the number of people who 
practice a sport to determine its popularity. Nowadays in Canada 
more than 650,000 men and women participate in this sport. 
Even if hockey is played mostly by men, more and more women 
play as well. Our women's national team has just won its third 
world championship in a row. This team's goalie is Manon 
Rhéaume, the first woman ever to play professional hockey.
<P>
	Who has not played hockey in the street or on a frozen lake? 
So, when you say 650,000 players, these are players registered 
with the Canadian Hockey Association. In reality, there are 
countless players. Just about everybody has played hockey, at 
one time or another, more often in the street than on an rink with 
boards around it. The fans  who closely monitor the performance 
of their favourite teams number in the millions. Names such as 
Wayne Gretzky, Mario Lemieux, Gordie Howe, Maurice 
Richard, Bobby Hull, Jean Béliveau, and Bobby Orr are now 
legendary. They are or will be inducted into the Hockey Hall of 
Fame, in Toronto, where most of the inductees were born in 
Canada or in Quebec.
<P>
	When we think about hockey, we think about the National 
Hockey League and the Stanley Cup, one of the most prestigious 
trophies in professional sport. It was created in 1893 by Lord 
Stanley, a great sports fan who was also the sixth Governor 
General in Canadian history. The original trophy was only a 
salad bowl for which Lord Stanley had paid less than $50. But 
over the years, several layers have been added to it; the names of 
the winning team members are engraved on it. In spite of its 
relative lack of value, the trophy is highly coveted.
<P>
	Hockey has become the national pride of Canada and Quebec; 
it reached its pinnacle in 1972 during the series of the century 
which pitted Canada against the Soviet Union.
<P>
	In Quebec, there is a hockey team which greatly contributed 
to enhance French Canadian pride-that is what we were called 
in those days-the Montreal Canadiens, created in 1909. With 
24 Stanley Cups, they are the most important dynasty in 
professional sport in North America. In the twenties and thirties, 
this team was one of the first to recruit French-speaking players. 
Lightning-fast and aggressive, they were nicknamed the Flying 
Frenchmen. There was Aurèle Joliat, Armand Mondou, and 
Sylvio Mantha, to name but a few. They played in the Montreal 
Forum, the legendary building at the corner of Sainte-Catherine 
and Atwater.
<P>
	It was during the forties and the fifties that they became truly 
legendary, especially because of Maurice Richard.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	He was the first player to score 50 goals in one season in the 
NHL; he led the Montreal Canadiens to many Stanley Cups, 
including five in a row between 1956 and 1960. That man was a 
powerful symbol for Quebecers. The suspension which he got in 
1955, depriving the Canadiens from the Stanley Cup, provoked a 
real riot in the Montreal Forum.
<P>
	The Canadiens benefitted from an almost monopoly of 
recruitment in Quebec for many years. That allowed them to 
acquire players such as Phil Goyette, Bernard Geoffrion and 
Jacques Plante.
<P>
	The Canadiens have always had many French-speaking stars 
on their team over the years. I will name some others: Jean 
Béliveau, Jacques Laperrière, Henri Richard, Guy Lafleur, 
Jacques Lemaire, Guy Lapointe, Patrick Roy, Guy Charbonneau 
and many more. Of course, there were also English players who 
contributed: Howie Morenz, Ken Dryden, Toe Blake, Doug 
Harvey, Larry Robinson and many others. Naturally, some 
French-speaking players also won fame with other teams: Jean 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3599"> 3599 </A></B>
<P>
Ratelle  with the New York Rangers, Mario Lemieux with 
Pittsburgh, Marcel Dionne and many others.
<P>
	This was to demonstrate that Quebecers have been well 
represented in the sport that is called hockey. It was one of their 
first successes. Coming from the province of Quebec, I would 
not forgive myself if I did not mention the Quebec Nordiques 
who, due to the dramatic increase in salaries, may have to leave 
Quebec City, as other players from other teams may have to 
leave cities such as Edmonton, Calgary, Winnipeg and various 
small towns.
<P>
	It is fine to adopt today an act recognizing hockey as the 
national sport. But I believe that one should also consider to take 
rather quickly some measures which would keep teams such as 
the ones I just mentioned in Canada and in Quebec. It is very 
important.
<P>
	The last point I want to make is that, to preserve this sport, I 
feel it is important to take measures to fight against violence in 
hockey, a factor which may very well discredit that sport. In 
closing, Mr. Speaker, I wish together with my colleagues to 
congratulate once again the member from Kamloops for 
introducing this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> Point of order, Mr. Speaker. In the spirit of 
co-operation and good will that exists and in an effort to 
acknowledge the days of work that the Parliamentary Secretary 
to the Minister of Canadian Heritage has put in to facilitate 
today, I wonder if I could seek unanimous consent of the House 
to acknowledge the parliamentary secretary as being one of the 
formal seconders of Bill C-212.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Members have heard the 
member for Kamloops. Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I guess today would be one of those 
days that you wish you were involved in this debate having been 
a player not only of the Memorial Cup team you played on but a 
coach and referee in the NHL. We are certainly all aware of your 
participation in this national sport.
<P>
	I begin by quoting from <I>The Game</I> which Ken Dryden and Roy 
McGregor put together. I think it summarizes most of the spirit 
and the theme that the member for Kamloops is putting forward 
in his bill today:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Hockey is part sport and recreation, part entertainment, part business, part 
community builder, social connector, and fantasy maker. It is played in every 
province and territory and in every part of every province and territory in this 
country.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Once a game for little boys, now little girls play hockey as well and so do older 
men and women, so do the blind and the mentally and physically handicapped, 
and although its symmetry is far from perfect hockey does far better than most in 
cutting across social divisions, young and old, rich and poor, urban and rural, 
French and English, east and west, able and disabled.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is this breadth, its reach into the past, that makes hockey such a vivid 
instrument through which to view Canadian life.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I believe that Roy McGregor and Ken Dryden have captured 
what the member for Kamloops is trying to put forward today in 
this bill and I stand here in full support. I would like to talk about 
a couple of experiences that I have had in dealing with hockey as 
our national sport since I have been a member of Parliament and 
how I feel that it really pulls us together, not only as a House of 
Commons but as a country.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	About the time when we were celebrating the 125th 
anniversary of our country a group of us from all parties got 
together. At that time most of us who were working on this idea 
were in the opposition. We went to the then minister responsible 
for national unity, the Right Hon. Joe Clark, and asked him to 
support us in bringing to Toronto 58 hockey teams from villages, 
towns and cities from all across Canada. From coast to coast, 
every region of our country, they all came to Toronto in April of 
that year to play in Maple Leaf Gardens in a 10-day tournament.
<P>
	There were a few things that inspired me to believe that 
hockey truly is the sport that pulls us together as a country.
<P>
	First I have to talk about the evening that the Dartmouth 
Whalers played in Maple Leaf Gardens against a team that most 
people thought would dominate the Dartmouth Whalers, a team 
in a AAA league in Toronto at the peewee level. At the end of the 
game the Dartmouth Whalers were victorious. They had beaten 
this Toronto championship team.
<P>
	The following morning in the hotel I ran into the captain of the 
Dartmouth Whalers and I said to him: ``Boy you had a pretty 
good game last night. We were all surprised that you did so 
well''. He said: ``Well, Mr. Mills, it was a funny experience. We 
walked into Maple Leaf Gardens. First of all when we looked up 
and saw those stands we felt the magic in the place. We felt 
good. But then when we got on the ice our energy quadrupled, 
our spirit was so great no one could beat us''.
<P>
	Those young peewees from Dartmouth said it all. Hockey 
provides an energy, a feeling and a spirit of  pulling us together 
that I do not think any other sport in this country has. I am not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3600"> 3600 </A></B>
<P>
putting down any other sport, but I do believe it truly is our 
national sport.
<P>
	I know you can relate to this, Mr. Speaker, because we both 
have sons who play in the Ontario Hockey League. Your son is a 
terrific player with the Kingston Frontenacs and I have had the 
pleasure of watching my son play this year with the Belleville 
Bulls. It is an experience going to these local rinks. I am amazed 
at the way it pulls the community together. It becomes the local 
event. The radio stations and the local TV stations and the whole 
community experience happens around hockey. There is a whole 
family experience that happens around hockey. This same 
experience is in every rink throughout our nation.
<P>
	I am happy to stand here today in support of hockey as our 
national sport. I believe that hockey will be one of the things that 
ultimately keeps us together as a nation. I just cannot imagine 
the Montreal Canadiens being changed to the Montreal Blocs. It 
just does not work.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was going to rise in the House today to speak against 
this, but I guess I have to change that because I have already 
agreed to the amendment and everything.
<P>
	Why are we using valuable debate time in this House to debate 
and vote on a bill which dismisses our national support of 
lacrosse as though it never was? Perhaps this member does not 
know his Canadian history. Perhaps this bill is presented to this 
House out of ignorance.
<P>
	It occurred to me that if one member of this House is ignorant 
of our history perhaps other members are not aware of our rich 
cultural heritage, a cultural heritage given to us by our first 
peoples. I am therefore going to present some of our history of 
lacrosse to this House. In 10 minutes I cannot really do the game 
justice but I will do what I am able.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	There are some who try to date lacrosse back to 
Confederation, perhaps because many of the encyclopaedias 
refer to it as being our national sport at that time.
<P>
	Lacrosse cannot be dated in this House. Who in this House is 
going to decide when lacrosse started in what today we call 
Canada? We have records going back to the Seven Year War, the 
1700s, and the story of the English trader Alexander Henry's 
experience at Fort Mackinac when on the pretence of celebrating 
King George III's birthday on June 2, 1763 the Ojibway Indians 
played lacrosse outside the open gate of the fort. When the ball 
went through the gate the players and the onlookers went after it.
<P>
	Upon entering the grounds they attacked the garrison and 
seized the fort. It is told that the native women concealed the 
weapons beneath their skirts.
<P>
	Father Brebeuf, the Jesuit priest, speaks of lacrosse in his 
writings. Many in this House I am sure are aware of the Jesuit 
priests or the Black Robes who date well back in Canada's 
1600s.
<P>
	I am told that the Creator gave lacrosse to our native people.
<P>
	I have with me today a list of 27 citations referring to lacrosse 
as Canada's national sport. They are recognized authorities or 
researchers, such as sports writers, historians and five 
encyclopaedias. Some of these resources date from 1877, 1902, 
1911 and right up to the present.
<P>
	Shribners is the earliest source which in volume 14, May to 
October 1877, states: ``The game of lacrosse was adopted as the 
national game of Canada on July 1, 1859''.
<P>
	In 1911, <I>Encyclopaedia Britannica</I>, 11th edition, states: 
``Lacrosse, the national game of Canada''. I do not have time to 
quote them all here.
<P>
	When our children ask us and their teachers for facts on a 
subject where do we send them? We send them to the 
encyclopaedia for factual information.
<P>
	I am not here today to build up lacrosse and tear down hockey. 
Both are great sports. In fact if we were to ask our national 
lacrosse and hockey players their opinions I wonder if we would 
not find many had played both sports during their careers and 
value the special attributes of both.
<P>
	Hockey legend Bobby Orr I believe played lacrosse for 
Oshawa. Other lacrosse celebrities including such names as 
Wayne Gretzky, Joe Nievendyke, Gary Roberts, Cliff Renning, 
Newsy Lalonde, Jack Bionda, Adam Oates, Brian Bellows and 
many more that I cannot name. Each played lacrosse in the 
summer and hockey in winter. Gretzky used lacrosse to sharpen 
his hockey skills.
<P>
	There are some facts about lacrosse I am sure many members 
here are not aware of. The <I>Guinness Book of Records</I> states that 
the first night game of baseball was played in the 1883. Baseball 
fans pride themselves on the fact that this was an amazing 
accomplishment. Would it surprise the House to know that the 
game of lacrosse was played under the electric light in Montreal 
in 1880?
<P>
	Are we all aware that some of hockey's proudest moments 
began in lacrosse? Each year there is a celebration and a 
congratulation among hockey people as they hold their all-star 
game. The concept of holding all-star games began in the 1870s 
when the lacrosse clubs in Ontario banded together to challenge 
their rivals from across the border in Quebec.
<P>
	In the 1870s and 1880s when hockey was becoming popular, 
in order to increase its appeal to the public, the game borrowed 
from the most popular sport of the time, lacrosse, the concept of 
goal posts, centre face off, referees and the position names for 
its players.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	In 1904 Canada sent its first delegation to the Olympic games. 
Among the team sports which represented Canada at its premier 
was the lacrosse team. Lacrosse is the only Olympic team sport 
where Canada has won more medals than the rest of the world 
combined.
<P>
	Talk about numbers and attendance at sports games. In 1910, 
when the Canadian Minto Cup Senior Lacrosse Championships 
of Canada were played between New Westminster and the 
Montreal Shamrocks, there were 15,000 spectators. That is not 
very many you say. It is incredible when we look at the facts. 
The number of people living in New Westminster at that time 
was under 8,000. The game literally shut down the majority of 
B.C. as people travelled to New Westminister to see the game. 
That is the spirit of nationalism.
<P>
<B>(1815 ) </B>
<P>
	How many here are aware of the fact that the Right Hon. 
Lester B. Pearson during his office of Prime Minister became 
the head of only one sport in Canada? Lester Pearson accepted 
the role and served as honorary chairman of the Canadian 
Lacrosse Association.
<P>
	I have always been a sports participant and not much of a 
spectator, but I did have an opportunity to learn about our 
national sport lacrosse.  Often heard it is the fastest sport on two 
feet, from a family connection in my early twenties. Lacrosse 
great Jack Bionda is my brother-in-law, and he played both 
hockey and lacrosse professionally.
<P>
	Through Jack I can best describe how these two great sports 
are a part of one's life. He played hockey for the Boston Bruins 
and in two Stanley Cup finals; for the Toronto Maple Leafs, 
among others, and was a defenceman for the Portland Buckaroos 
for six years.
<P>
	However, lacrosse was his sport, beginning in Huntsville and 
carrying Jack to the west where he played in seven Man Cup 
finals, five of them winners. He played for the Victoria 
Shamrocks, Nanaimo and the famous New Westminster 
Salmonbellies. Jack's superb stick handling developed when he 
was a lad of 10 or 11. He was inseparable from his lacrosse stick 
and he walked to school practising, hitting the telephone poles 
with the ball as he walked along. This ability to control the ball 
until the last minute and score won him the lacrosse all time high 
scorer in his time.
<P>
	He has been honoured in the New Westminster Lacrosse Hall 
of Fame and the Canadian Hall of Fame. Even today in his 
sixties Jack gives tirelessly to young lacrosse players at clinics 
and tournaments. His love of the sport extends to the continued 
use of the wooden native lacrosse stick.
<P>
	That brings me to Wes Patterson, a Tuscorora native which is 
part of the Six Nations. Wes Patterson is a North American 
Indian who knows as much about the cultural heritage of our 
national sport of lacrosse as any person in Canada. For many 
years he has been engaged in successfully producing the wooden 
lacrosse stick through  Can Am Lacrosse Ltd. I wish I had one in 
the House today to show the skill of this very talented 
aboriginal.
<P>
	I have not yet had the honour of meeting Wes Patterson but I 
have it from good authority that this native can make a complete 
lacrosse stick in 20 minutes as you watch. He talks of the days as 
a young boy playing lacrosse and how you were not able to play 
on the team if you did not select, cut your hickory limb, steam it, 
bend it, shape it, cut the leather strips and make the net.
<P>
	What am I trying to say? Is it not long past time for Canadians 
to realize the cultural contribution of our first people, our truly 
first people not just in sport but in many things? This is not 
mythology but true, actual facts.
<P>
	I do not think Canadians can cheer any harder or 
enthusiastically for hockey than they have already demonstrated 
during the Canada-Russia hockey series of the past or than they 
did during our hockey team's performance at Lillehammer. Both 
sports are very popular at this time. If members are not aware, 
ask the countless volunteers who sign up the youth of our nation 
each season for both these sports.
<P>
	Today I pay tribute to all volunteers in both associations who 
over the years have given countless hours promoting these 
sports. Above all I can never dismiss what the past has given us. 
We do have a rich cultural heritage.
<P>
	Come to the Commonwealth Games in Victoria this August 18 
to 28 and see lacrosse as the introductory sport. Who will be 
representing our aboriginal people? Wes Patterson.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to support this bill as amended. It was 
originally a bill to declare hockey our national sport and now it 
is a bill to have hockey accepted as our national winter sport and 
lacrosse as our national summer sport.
<P>
	I fully support the amendment but I principally want to talk 
about hockey. I love this game. I love playing it. I love watching 
it. I love talking about it. Some of my greatest friendships have 
been formed through hockey.
<P>
	As many know I come from Montreal, the hockey capital of 
the world. Montrealers, like no other citizens of any other city, 
breathe, live and die for hockey.
<P>
	Last year was the 100th anniversary of the Stanley Cup.
<P>
<B>(1820 ) </B>
<P>
	In those 100 years, six Montreal teams won the Stanley Cup 
41 times, including the first time in 1893. The Canadiens won it 
24 times. I am saying that because I want to correct the record. 
Many newspapers in Canada, in listing last year those that won 
the Stanley Cup in those 100 years, mentioned that the 
Canadiens won it 24 times and that the Leafs won it so many 
times. They forgot that there were five other Montreal teams 
that won it to make it a total of 41 times for Montreal, way 
beyond any other city or community in Canada. This not  to 
belittle the other cities 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3602"> 3602 </A></B>
<P>
but simply to remind Canadians that Montreal is the capital of 
hockey in Canada.
<P>
	I have been playing hockey since I was six years old and 
despite my ancient appearance I am still playing. At this time I 
want to pay tribute to the many Canadians who are still playing 
and organizing oldtimer hockey. There are now thousands of 
leagues in Canada, many tournaments and every weekend a lot 
of us old guys go here and there to play weekend tournaments.
<P>
	I think all this goes to show what many people are saying here 
in this House. It shows that Canadians of all ages and both sexes 
love this game. We are supporting this bill to make hockey our 
national winter sport. I hope it would mean more than simply lip 
service to the game.
<P>
	What I hope it would mean is that we as Canadians will really 
support this game at all levels from peewee to international 
hockey. There have been times in recent years when we have not 
at the government level and at the private sector level supported 
it as we should.
<P>
	By making it part of our legislation, I would hope that our 
commitment to hockey as our national winter sport will make us 
more aware of its place in our history and in our tradition and 
culture.
<P>
	I have only one concern and I will end with it. My concern is 
that the cost to young people playing hockey today is escalating 
to the point at which many young people can no longer play. I am 
sad to say that in many cases hockey is now becoming a rich 
man's sport.
<P>
	That was not the case when I was young in Montreal. We 
played on outdoor rinks at the peewee level, the bantam level. If 
you played in a school then you might get on an artificial rink. 
Our equipment was not that expensive and we did not have many 
long trips or a long schedule.
<P>
	I am not arguing with it but simply pointing out my fears. 
Today players at 11, 12, 13 are playing all their games on indoor 
artificial rinks which is very expensive. It is very expensive for 
the parents. They are fully equipped with the best of equipment. 
They have long schedules and often very expensive travel 
schedules.
<P>
	I give credit to the parents who are doing outstanding jobs 
following their young boys and girls around with these teams. 
They are paying sometimes up to $1,000 a year simply to keep 
their children in minor hockey. If that had been the case we may 
not have had the Maurice Richards, the Boom Boom Geffrions 
and the Gordie Howes and many other of these players who 
came from moderate backgrounds and who went up the ranks 
and became outstanding hockey players.
<P>
	I fully support this bill. Canadians fully support this bill but I 
hope once we pass it, it will not simply be a memory for us but 
will be what it means; namely a commitment by the Parliament 
of Canada to really support these two games, hockey and 
lacrosse, from the very minor level to the international level and 
the professional level.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. I would like to 
seek unanimous consent to prolong the debate for a maximum of 
one-half hour or at the collapse of the debate, whichever comes 
first, in order to permit more members to participate.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The House has heard the 
terms of the motion. Is it agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to be able to spend five minutes of my 
time on this bill that I support, naturally. I would like to 
congratulate the hon. member who finally managed to bring his 
project to fruition. At least it is debated, and I hope it will pass 
before the end of the sitting. I congratulate also the 
parliamentary secretary for her amendment that we will gladly 
support. Since I do not know very much about lacrosse, I am sure 
this will be an opportunity to learn about it. We will have to find 
the equipment to learn how to play though. However we are 
already masters at other sports.
<P>
	The previous speakers dealt mostly with hockey and I will 
follow their example. We tried to rewrite history, but the truth is 
the origin of hockey is largely uncertain. It is very difficult to 
know for sure where and how it started. Some people go back 
2,000 or 3,000 years. Nobody knows. Even in Canada, the time 
and place of the first game ever played are difficult to find. I 
choose to remember one place, Montreal, and one date, 1837, 
100 years before my birth.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robichaud:</B> It was much earlier than that.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay: </B>Perhaps. Let us not argue about it. Anyone 
can make his own choice.
<P>
	Making hockey our national sport gives Canada another 
symbol. We had the beaver, the national anthem, the flag, now 
we have two national sports: lacrosse in the summer, and hockey 
in the winter. So these are important elements of our national 
identity. For now, they are declared national sports of Canada. 
As mentioned by my colleague, we will see in due time what 
Quebec will do about it, but I already favour the parliamentary 
secretary's proposition. The Montreal Blocs could very well 
play against the Toronto Maple Leafs. That would be a good 
representation of the two Canadian nations, once sovereign.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3603"> 3603 </A></B>
<P>
	When the national news on TV begin with the announcement 
of the Canadian's defeat, I wonder less about the fanaticism of 
Montreal or Canadian fans than about the choice of the news 
desk officer. Recognizing hockey as our national sport implies 
that we must not value it excessively. Recognizing hockey as our 
national sport is of course recognizing its rights, but also its 
duties accordingly. I think we must act and clearly define 
standards so that Canada's national sport is played according to 
rules that apply even in the national league. Parliament could be 
called upon to adopt rules that would allow civil or criminal 
lawsuits against NHL players whose conduct does not improve 
because a national sport must set an example for a country's 
young people. Consequently, Canadian hockey officials will 
have to take on the responsibilities that come with it.
<P>
	Canada should also make sure that, when it sends a team 
abroad to compete in our national sport, it can win medals as we 
are able to do with players of the calibre of our national 
champions such as Rocket Richard, who made this sport famous, 
the great Jean Béliveau, Bernard ``Boom Boom'' Geoffrion, 
who became the highest scorer, passing Maurice the day 
Mr. Campbell suspended him-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> She really knows her hockey.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> I was at the Forum the day of the riot. That 
dates me, I guess.
<P>
	Several members have mentioned the great ones: Lemieux, 
Gretzky, Roy, Orr, and Hull. I congratulate the members who 
took part in this debate and carried it through. I am very happy to 
have two national sports from now on.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex):</B> Mr. Speaker, first 
of all, I am pleased to congratulate the hon. member for 
Kamloops and am very pleased to support this amended bill. The 
bill recognizes two sports officially as our national sports, 
hockey and lacrosse, neither of which has ever been officially 
recognized in the House before as a national sport. I think that is 
a very positive initiative.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	Can there be anyone in the Chamber or anyone in the country 
who does not know that one sport fascinates and obsesses 
Canadians from coast to coast to coast? Frankly we know that 
sport is hockey.
<P>
	It is our national obsession. It is played by young and old, by 
male and female, by the able bodied and by the disabled. How 
well I remember seeing people playing a variation of hockey in a 
gymnasium, people who had lost the use of their legs. It is our 
national obsession unlike any other sport, and that is not to 
denigrate the many other sports Canadians participate in very 
aggressively, including lacrosse.
<P>
	Whether it is my young son, Carl, or yours, Mr. Speaker, 
playing hockey in the backyard or Patrick Roy in the Forum, 
most Canadians have played hockey at one time or another in 
their lives, be they citizens in a large city or in one of our 
hamlets from coast to coast to coast.
<P>
	Being from southwestern Ontario I can tell the House that the 
summertime sport of choice there is baseball. It always has 
been. London, Ontario has the site of the oldest continuous 
baseball played at Labatt Park. Not to denigrate the sport of 
lacrosse which I have played a bit, it is not played in some parts 
of the country. That cannot be said about the sport of ice hockey 
as we all know. It truly is the national sport of Canadians and I 
would say the national obsession of Canadians.
<P>
	We all know that the true world hockey championship is not 
the Olympics or the yearly world tournament. It is the Canada 
Cup. That is the true world championship of hockey. Canadian 
men and women excel at this sport.
<P>
	It has been said by several members that our women's 
national team has just won the world championships for the third 
time in a row. I expect they will add many more times to that 
championship run.
<P>
	Hockey is part of our national identity. It helps us to define 
ourselves. Canadian poet Al Purdy called hockey a combination 
of ballet and murder. We might not like the second word but it is 
an aggressive sport. He wrote: ``For years a Canadian specific to 
salve the anguish of inferiority by being good at something the 
Americans aren't''.
<P>
	The Americans are improving but they have a long way to go 
to come up to our level. As we all know with the American 
franchises by far most of their players are Canadians and with 
the influx of Europeans we are seeing the Americans still have a 
long way to go to catch us in our national sport.
<P>
	The impact of the professional sports franchise, the Montreal 
Canadiens has been mentioned already. It is the most successful 
of all sports franchises. As several of my colleagues have 
said-and, my hockey loyalty can be found in this 
comment-the Canadiens 24 Stanley Cups is a professional 
sports record. No team in any other sport equals that success 
level.
<P>
	I am proud to tell the House that although many early players 
were French Canadians and the sport was founded in Montreal, 
it was founded by an Irish Canadian by the name of Ambrose 
O'Brien. I am proud to note that fact in the debate.
<P>
	Canadian cities compete to claim these hockey heroes. Being 
from southwestern Ontario I can say that Stratford likes to claim 
Howie Morenz as the Stratford Streak, but the people of 
Mitchell, Ontario, will say that Howie Morenz was born in 
Mitchell, Ontario.
<P>
	We have national lessons to learn from the great game of ice 
hockey. I would like to refer to the most famous goal ever 
scored. That of course has to be the goal scored  by Paul 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3604"> 3604 </A></B>
<P>
Henderson to give us victory in the 1972 World Championship 
against the Russians, the first such series.
<P>
	As a Montreal Canadiens fan my whole life, I am proud to 
remind the House that the Henderson goal was made possible by 
a great play by Yvan Cournoyer to keep the puck in the Russian 
end, an extraordinary effort when they tried to clear the puck, 
and then by Phil Esposito who refused to be denied his shot on 
goal, the rebound of which Henderson then pounced on and put 
into the net. It has hit me many times for years the symbolism of 
that goal. Let me give you those three names again: Paul 
Henderson, Yvan Cournoyer and Phil Esposito. That is the kind 
of co-operation we need in this country: An English Canadian, a 
French Canadian and an Italian Canadian working together to 
help us win a hockey series.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	We are most confident, we are most determined and we are 
most united on a hockey rink. That is a lesson we ought to bear in 
mind as we support this bill. I applaud this. This is not frivolous 
in any way. This is an extremely important bill. It is well worth 
the time for us to take a few minutes in this House and learn the 
lessons we should be learning from hockey. The fact that we are 
at our best as a nation when we set aside background, English, 
French, ethnic, and we work together as a nation. May it always 
be so.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to support Bill C-212 and the amendment 
introduced by the parliamentary secretary.
<P>
	This discussion encompasses much more than the pros and 
cons of two Canadian sports. Rather it is an opportunity for us as 
members of Parliament to raise a rallying point to help us further 
define ourselves as Canadians. I assert that by naming Canada's 
national sports, with which we identify parts of our history, our 
present reality and a future that can bring all Canadians a step 
closer together.
<P>
	There are certain questions we can ask ourselves. My 
colleague has actually presented a case for lacrosse. I wish to 
briefly propose some questions that will address whether 
hockey should be made Canada's national sport.
<P>
	First, is hockey rooted firmly in Canada's history? As we have 
heard the answer is an unequivocal yes. Hockey in Canada has 
been in existence for as long as Canada itself. Hockey is a 
uniquely Canadian sport dating as far back as the early 19th 
century.
<P>
	The hockey that is most familiar to Canadians today was first 
introduced in Montreal by a McGill University student named 
J.G.A. Creighton. The first world hockey championship was 
held in Canada in 1883. The first Stanley Cup game was held in 
1894 and won by the Montreal triple A team.
<P>
	In addition to Lord Stanley's contribution, Canada also 
recognizes excellence in hockey through other historical 
awards. The Lester Pearson award is given to the most 
outstanding player in the NHL. The Lady Byng Memorial 
Trophy is awarded to the player who has exhibited the best type 
of sportsmanship combined with a high standard of playing 
ability.
<P>
	Second, is hockey seen by Canadians as their national sport? 
Most Canadians would answer yes. Over the last several decades 
hockey has consistently attracted a number of fans and 
participants greater than all other sports together. Household 
words are hockey names like Rocket Richard, Gordie Howe and 
Wayne Gretzky.
<P>
	There are over half a million players registered at the amateur 
level and for each of those at least five other Canadians are 
behind the scenes. There are 31,000 teams and 2,400 hockey 
organizations registered with our national registry. These 
numbers do not include the many tens of thousands of other 
players. From pre-schoolers to old timers there is an explosion 
of participation. Like so many other centres in my own riding of 
Port Moody-Coquitlam the facilities in our area just cannot 
keep up with the demand.
<P>
	Third, is hockey an inclusive sport open to all Canadians? For 
instance, women's hockey is the fastest growing sport played by 
women in Canada today. Two weeks ago our women's national 
team gained international recognition as the best team in the 
world. This was their third straight world title. They have yet to 
lose to any country at the international level.
<P>
	Fourth, is hockey accessible to Canadians? Canada boasts the 
most impressive organizational network for hockey in the entire 
world. Known as the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association 
this body links the membership of local associations to all other 
nationally and internationally organized bodies. First formed in 
1914 the CAHA has nurtured amateur hockey in Canada so that 
millions of Canadians from coast to coast can come together. In 
addition, police and government organizations, colleges, 
universities, et cetera, et cetera bring Canadians together 
through hockey across Canada.
<P>
<B>(1840 ) </B>
<P>
	Fifth, does hockey serve the interests of Canadians both 
individually and as a community? Hockey indeed enriches the 
lives of many Canadians. It encourages leadership among our 
youth. It teaches sportsmanship, drive and determination. It 
builds a healthy sense of competitiveness and fosters an 
atmosphere where lasting friendships as we have already heard 
can be developed.
<P>
	Millions of volunteers offer their time to this sport each and 
every year. Parents, teachers, friends, neighbours, people from 
all walks of life invest their time in their communities and 
therefore in Canada as a whole. In addition, an estimated $400 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3605"> 3605 </A></B>
<P>
million is pumped into the national economy annually as a direct 
result of hockey.
<P>
	Sixth, when other countries look at Canada, what do they see? 
They see hockey. Teams from across Canada travel all over the 
world to challenge the best players from other countries. 
Whether we win or lose on the ice as a nation, Canada wins each 
and every time one of our teams competes abroad.
<P>
	Remember well the 1972 Canada-Russia series when Paul 
Henderson scored. It was one of the great moments in our 
history, a moment in time that caught and has held the hearts of 
all Canadians.
<P>
	Seventh, when Canadians look at Canada what do we see? 
Canada is hockey. Hockey is played in every region of the 
country, from west to east, south to north, from Vancouver to St. 
John's, from Calgary to Montreal, from Edmonton to Toronto, 
and in every town and village in between.
<P>
	We look at the present and to the future and see the need to 
bring Canadians closer together. We need symbols that represent 
Canada as a whole. We need to build on what we have. Hockey 
and lacrosse can play a part in furthering pride in our land and 
our unity.
<P>
	In the words of one of our hockey greats: ``The 1972 
Canada-Russia series was not politics, it was not sport. At that 
time we were not considered easterners or westerners, we were 
Canadians. We represented Canada and had the best players in 
the world''.
<P>
	In conclusion, from what I have heard today, may I suggest 
that we take part in Winterlude on the ice next year and show 
Canada that we as parliamentarians can enjoy our national 
winter sport.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, here we are at the beginning of the parliamentary 
season and tonight we are already going into overtime.
<P>
	The speeches from members across the way could be 
characterized as very careful stick handling. The House of 
Commons today will score with all Canadians, I am sure, when 
we pass this bill. A referee of the NHL is in the Chair as we are 
having this debate, and I am speaking of you, Mr. Speaker. I 
think the parliamentary secretary has scored a hat trick with all 
three readings in one day. This is a shoot out for the member for 
Kamloops because in the end, he is going to have the winning 
goal.
<P>
	We achieved all of this without penalty. Mr. Speaker, I hope 
you do not think I am offside for making these remarks as we are 
approaching the termination of the debate.
<P>
	The net gain in all of this is that Canadians will win and no one 
will lose. This has to be the only game in town where you have 
winners and no losers. Indeed, this is a victory for the Canadian 
hockey team with a very large <I>C</I>.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Canadian team has just won. And tonight, all of us will be 
winners when we adopt this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I must tell you in my 10 
years with the National Hockey League I would commonly tell 
the players: ``I call 'em as I see 'em'' and they would say: ``But 
Bob you don't see enough''. Well, today I wear glasses so I can 
see all of you.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too am 
pleased to support this bill which recognizes hockey as the 
national sport.
<P>
	Like my predecessors did earlier, all Canadians and 
Quebecers agree that hockey should be recognized as the most 
popular, and therefore national, sport. This goes without saying. 
All we have to do is look at the popularity of the playoff games 
now under way, or scheduled to start in a few minutes, to 
recognize the importance of hockey.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	However, to introduce a somewhat discordant note into the 
proceedings, the government is trying to use hockey as a 
component of national unity.
<P>
	I would remind them that this evening, the Canadiens are 
playing against Boston, that is a sovereign Canadian country is 
squaring off against a sovereign American nation. If I am not 
mistaken, I believe that Toronto is also playing against Chicago. 
I do not think that Mr. Clinton and Mr. Chrétien call one another 
up very often or that this creates problems between the two 
sovereign countries. National unity, perhaps.
<P>
	Still on the subject of the importance of hockey as a national 
sport, I want to say, as indicated earlier, that by now there is 
probably not one soul in Quebec or even in Canada who has not 
heard about Patrick Roy's appendicitis, and we hope he gets well 
soon.
<P>
	However, let me express some reservation about debating 
hockey in this place, all the while respecting the principles of 
the parliamentary system.
<P>
	Yesterday, I was the guest speaker at a luncheon organized by 
the Chamber of Commerce of Repentigny. By the way, I thank 
them for their invitation. A hundred or so business people from 
my riding were gathered and there were discussions about the 
difficult economic situation, the interest rates, and the 
insufficient risk capital made available to small business. Other 
subjects of discussion included the GST and the Quebec sales 
tax as well as unemployment and, of course, sovereignty.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3606"> 3606 </A></B>
<P>
	A quick look at yesterday's <I>Hansard</I> leads us to ask questions 
on several problems facing people; yet we are talking about 
hockey tonight.
<P>
	The issues debated yesterday in this House include the 
military college in Saint-Jean; Pearson Airport; the Young 
Offenders Act; South Africa. We congratulate them on their first 
democratic election and we hope that everyone will recognize 
the election results. Also, Bosnia; Canada's credit rating; 
bilingualism; the fisheries; Hibernia; the economy; AIDS; 
income tax; and job training.
<P>
	I said earlier that many young people watch our proceedings. 
Talking about job training, I would like to quote the hon. 
member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine who said 
yesterday in this House in answer to my colleague from Lévis: 
``The federal government does not intend to question provincial 
jurisdiction over education''.
<P>
	Does this mean that he will not discuss it, that he will take on 
total jurisdiction in this area? His answer raises questions.
<P>
	Still on the subject of young people, the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine said on CBC two weeks 
ago that 30 to 60 per cent of young Quebecers are dropouts 
because of the plan for sovereignty. Look at this figure: between 
30 and 60 per cent. With such precise numbers, he could be 
finance minister.
<P>
	Last fall, <I>Maclean's</I> showed that although serious, the actual 
dropout rate of young people in Quebec was about 20 per cent. 
We agree that we must encourage our young people and our 
youth, but not at their expense and not with crass petty 
politicking like he engages in too often.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, as I said at the beginning of my presentation, I 
support the bill to recognize hockey as Canada's national sport, 
but let us all agree that people in Quebec and Canada and 
throughout the world face much more urgent problems.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
my pleasure to join with my colleagues in the House of 
Commons this evening to support Bill C-212.
<P>
	I stand in this House as a certified CAHA hockey coach. I am 
from Saskatchewan and we do have world curling champions, 
both men and women. Hockey is played in every community on 
every dugout in the winter and on every piece of ice that one can 
find in every community in our province.
<P>
	That is a tribute to the type of thing we are doing today in the 
House of Commons, making hockey along with lacrosse our 
official national sports.
<P>
	Every Canadian either played hockey or wants to play hockey. 
It is a dream of almost every young hockey player to play in the 
NHL.
<P>
<B>(1850 ) </B>
<P>
	Although Saskatchewan does not have any NHL teams we 
have exported a number of NHL hockey players to make up a 
number of teams. For example, we have Mike Modano playing 
for the Dallas Stars. He played for the Prince Albert Raiders at 
one point. Ron Grechner who is now with the Sabres is from 
North Battleford. Theoren Fleury from the Calgary Flames was 
playing for Moose Jaw at one point. Jeff Shantz is from the 
Regina Pats. He is playing with the Chicago Black Hawks.
<P>
	Of course Wendel Clark who is from Kelvington, 
Saskatchewan is playing with the Toronto Maple Leafs. Doug 
Wickenheiser, the first draft choice of the Montreal Canadiens, 
is from the Regina Pats. We have as well Barry Melrose who 
played hockey in the NHL and coaches the Los Angeles Kings. I 
believe he is from Kelvington as well, the same place as Wendel 
Clark. Bill Hicke played many years ago for the champion 
Montreal Canadiens.
<P>
	We have from Floral, Saskatchewan Mr. Hockey, Gordie 
Howe. Hockey is such a popular sport in our province that there 
is even a statue to Gordie Howe among the many statues in 
Saskatoon that my colleague from across the floor would 
acknowledge and certainly support.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, Gordie Howe is such a major figure in 
Saskatchewan that he has even got some colleagues of mine in 
university passing grades. For example, we had a psychology 
exam one day and one of my friends from Saskatchewan did not 
know the answers so he wrote a story about Gordie Howe which 
had nothing to do with psychology. The professor gave him an <I>A</I> 
for this exam because he was a Gordie Howe fan too. I think that 
it has interesting implications as we go through the hockey 
process.
<P>
	I want to not only support this bill but acknowledge in this 
House that the Regina Pat Canadians are the 1994 Canadian 
midget champions. They have played very well throughout the 
season and ended up winning the entire championship recently.
<P>
	Not only have I been a coach, I have worked with many 
individuals in the community. I want to acknowledge this 
evening the volunteers who have spent hundreds of hours and 
many years in particular in my district, Regina-Lumsden, 
working for both the parks and recreation leagues which have in 
my constituency probably about 2,000 hockey players overall, 
as well as those in the more competitive city league of Regina 
which has about 1,600 players for the entire city at a higher 
level.
<P>
	I think what they are doing is very important. Individuals like 
Greg Mario, president of the Regina Northwest Sports 
Association, and Harald Gohlke, vice-president in charge of 
hockey, 
<P>

<B><A NAME="3607"> 3607 </A></B>
<P>
have made significant  contributions to the community by being 
involved in the sport, in the community by teaching young 
players not only skills but how to get along in life as they age and 
become very reliable and admirable citizens of our country.
<P>
	There are about eight hockey rinks in my constituency. They 
are always filled from five o'clock in the morning until late at 
night. We have not only the recreation leagues and the 
competitive leagues but the senior leagues, the oldtimers, those 
over 30 as well. Everybody in my community, if they do not play 
hockey, has played hockey. I think that is an indication of the 
broad based support for this very important national sport that 
we are approving this evening.
<P>
	In summary, I want to say that ``he shoots, he scores'' is a very 
well known slogan in hockey. As far as I am concerned 
everybody in this House this evening has taken a shot today and 
everybody has scored.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Winnipeg St. James):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to rise and speak for just a couple of minutes on this bill. I 
certainly want to indicate my support for the bill in principle and 
its amendment. I am more than happy to give my support to it.
<P>
	I think it is entirely appropriate for a Winnipeger to stand up 
and enter into this debate because Winnipeg and the province of 
Manitoba have contributed greatly to this great game of ours 
called hockey, especially the NHL.
<P>
	I would like to remind the acting Speaker, who naturally 
served in the NHL as a referee, that perhaps one of the greatest 
of referees ever to serve in the NHL and currently serves in the 
NHL is none other than Andy Van Hellemond and he comes from 
that great suburb of Winnipeg called St. Boniface.
<P>
	Andy's name is just one of dozens and dozens from Winnipeg 
who have contributed to this great game of hockey. For example, 
does anyone know, and this is just a little piece of trivia, that the 
NHL player holding the record for the three fastest goals comes 
from Winnipeg. I am sure, Mr. Speaker, you would recognize the 
name Billy Mosienko. He is probably about six months older 
than you, or something like that. Sorry about that. Billy 
Mosienko of course played for many years. He had a sterling, 
outstanding career with the Chicago Black Hawks and his record 
of three goals I believe in 21 seconds still stands. I would doubt 
whether that record will ever be broken.
<P>
<B>(1855) </B>
<P>
	Who can ever forget Bill Juzda, the great defenceman who 
probably could deliver some of the greatest bone cracking body 
checks ever delivered on ice in the NHL.
<P>
	I am sure you cannot forget Don `Bones' Raleigh who was a 
great player with the New York Rangers. How about Tom 
Johnson who played with not only the Boston Bruins but the 
Montreal Canadiens. I would like to say politicians are given to 
this kind of thing. The Tom, who  shares my ancestry which is 
Canadian Icelandic, grew up a mere 14 miles from my 
community. He grew up in a little town called Baldur and I grew 
up in a little town called Glenboro.
<P>
	There was another great hockey player from Manitoba. Again, 
Mr. Speaker, I am sure that given your age and your interest in 
hockey and participation that you would remember a great 
player by the name of Black Jack Stewart who grew up in Pilot 
Mound, Manitoba.
<P>
	I just wanted to share a little bit of this history because 
Manitoba has played a great part in hockey and contributed 
greatly to the game. We are all proud of it. I am happy to support 
the bill. I think that by adding this amendment that it is in itself a 
great symbolism of the way we do politics in this country 
because this is the quintessential Canadian compromise. You 
start off with a proposition that hockey should be named the 
national sport then people come in and say: ``Now hold it. We 
have a history, we have a record. Lacrosse also has a lot of merit 
in this so why do we not reach the Canadian compromise and 
name lacrosse the summer national sport and hockey the winter 
hockey sport''.
<P>
	I think that is a great compromise and I am more than happy to 
support the bill.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The member for 
Winnipeg-St. James brought the name of a former colleague in 
another life with the National Hockey League, Andy Van 
Hellemond, but let me tell you about one other because I am 
aging rather rapidly here by all accounts, none other than Red 
Storey. A few years ago a number of parliamentarians, including 
the member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce who spoke earlier, came 
together to form a hockey team to play for a good charitable 
cause at the civic auditorium here in Ottawa against some 
National Hockey League oldtimers.
<P>
	Lo and behold, in the middle of the game, for no apparent 
reason, Red Storey blew his whistle and stopped the play. Keep 
in mind that we had about 30 players on our bench. Red came 
over and said: ``Look fellows, whatever you do don't quit your 
day jobs''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I 
want to congratulate the hon. member for Kamloops whose 
perseverance will be rewarded in a few moments.
<P>
	I also want to thank the hon. member for 
Mission-Coquitlam, who made a brilliant presentation on 
lacrosse, a sport which those who will read <I>Hansard</I> tomorrow 
will be able to learn more about. If the hon. member has more 
detailed personal notes on this topic, I would be pleased to read 
them. In the meantime, I wanted to highlight her contribution to 
the debate.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3608"> 3608 </A></B>
<P>
	Later on this evening, most members will watch the hockey 
game between Montreal and Boston. As for me, I will probably 
go to Hull to watch the sixth game between the Hull Olympiques 
and the Chicoutimi Saguenéens of the Quebec junior major 
league. My interest in hockey stems more from my career as a 
journalist rather than from the limited skills I displayed on the 
ice. Indeed, I was better at writing about the game than at 
playing it. Early in my relatively short career as a journalist, I 
covered what was then junior A hockey in Canada, since major 
junior hockey did not yet exist.
<P>
	I remember all the trips I made for the newspaper I was 
working for at the time and the playoffs I covered between teams 
which became famous. I could tell you stories that may have 
been forgotten in some areas, but are still much talked about in 
other places.
<P>
	I covered games between the Quebec Remparts and another 
great hockey team, the Cornwall Royals, which also played in 
the Quebec major junior hockey league, and also the east-west 
finals between the Estevan Bruins and the Niagara Falls Flyers. 
What was funny about these finals was that both teams had the 
very same jersey, and I think it was the Niagara Falls Flyers 
organization which had to lend their visiting-team jerseys to the 
western team for the Memorial Cup Finals.
<P>
	I want to point out that the Centennial Cup Series will start on 
Friday and will be held in Olds, Alberta. I want to wish the best 
of luck to the team that will be representing Quebec, the 
Châteauguay Élites, and may the best team win.
<P>
	If it were not for all these men and women who drive their kids 
to the arena, or even an ice rink or somewhere else, and stay to 
entice their children to play their favourite sport, I do not think 
we would have a national sport. We talked about people playing 
in the heat and wearing extremely expensive equipment but 
there are still people playing outside in siberian cold like the 
ones we had last winter. We must pay tribute to those people of 
my generation who started playing hockey with elementary 
equipment, because that sport was for us the soccer of the North. 
We would build our nets with ice, use hockey sticks worth 59 
cents and quite often make a puck out of frozen horse droppings. 
Imagine how interesting it would have been in the spring to have 
a slap shot at the member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, if 
you will allow me a joke, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	I am pleased, in the name of the Bloc Quebecois and of all my 
colleagues since we share a common interest, whether we are 
from Quebec or Canada, regarding the two sports we are about to 
recognize, to support the bill introduced by the member from 
Kamloops, which we are going to pass unanimously.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I must confess that I have 
been very pleased and honoured to have been in the chair 
throughout debate on this private member's bill. I congratulate 
the member for Kamloops. I also thank the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Canadian Heritage for her diligence 
and work so that we might bring the bill to conclusion today.
<P>
	The sports of hockey and lacrosse have played important roles 
in the development of my home town of Cornwall and the entire 
area of Stormont-Dundas. In naming names sometimes we 
forget someone, but let me go to the early 1900s. Two names that 
come to mind are Joe Lally and Newsie Lalonde, both of whom 
we will find in the Lacrosse Hall of Fame located in New 
Westminster, British Columbia. Of course Newsie Lalonde has 
also been inducted into the National Hockey League Hockey 
Hall of Fame.
<P>
	Prior to the early 1960s the Roundpoint Chisholm lacrosse 
stick factory located on the Akwesasne Reserve manufactured 
85 per cent to 90 per cent of the world's hickory lacrosse sticks. I 
really enjoyed being in the chair throughout the debate.
<P>
	Pursuant to order made earlier this day, Bill C-212, as 
amended, is deemed read the second time and referred to 
committee of the whole, deemed considered in committee of the 
whole, deemed reported without amendment, deemed concurred 
in at report stage, deemed read a third time and passed.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to, bill read the second time, considered in 
committee, reported, concurred in, read the third time and 
passed.)
<P>
	It being 7.04 p.m. the House stands adjourned until tomorrow 
at 10 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7.04 p.m.)
