indeed an honour and a privilege to present some 3,000-plus 
petitioners who have come to the House with a petition.  They 
would request that parliament take all measures necessary to 
ensure that possession of child pornography remains a serious 
criminal offence, and that federal police forces be directed to 
give priority to enforcing this law for the protection of our 
children.

<P><A NAME="LINK14"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am presenting two petitions this morning.  The first petition has 
been signed by residents of my constituency of Burnaby—Douglas 
as well as communities across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners, members of the Humanist Association of Canada 
and others, seek changes to the preamble to Canada's constitution 
and to the charter of rights.  They wish to remove the reference 
to the supremacy of God in the preamble and to change the wording 
of the charter of rights to reflect the fact that Canada is a 
secular country which respects the deeply held views of people of 
many different religious faiths as well as those who have no 
religious beliefs.

<P><A NAME="LINK16"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the second petition notes that the NATO attack on 
Yugoslavia is illegal under the charters of the United Nations 
and NATO, and that the best hope for world peace rests on the 
rule of international law administered by the United Nations.  It 
notes that the present war, intended to reduce the persecution, 
killing and displacement of Kosovars, has drastically increased 
all three. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the petitioners call on the House of Commons to 
withdraw immediately all Canadian Armed Forces from the war and 
use all our influence to convince the United Nations to arrange a 
ceasefire followed by further negotiations on the future of 
Kosovo.  They petition Milosevic to put an end to the ethnic 
cleansing that is taking place in Yugoslavia, including in the 
province of Kosovo.

have two petitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first petition states that residents of Canada call on

the second petition states that the use of the additive MMT in 
Canadian gasoline presents an environmental problem affecting 
every man, woman and child in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the petitioners call on parliament to set, by the end 
of this calendar year, national clean fuel standards for gasoline 
with zero MMT and low-sulphur content.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is an honour to rise today on behalf of Canadians who have signed 
this petition on the concept of marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent court rulings have created a sense of public confusion on 
the definition of marriage and spouse.  It is the intent of this 
petition to set the record straight and to ask parliament to 
accept the concept of marriage as the voluntary union of a 
single, unmarried male and a single, unmarried female. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, it asks parliamentarians to ensure that marriage, as it 
has always been known and understood in Canada, be preserved and 
protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank those who have signed this petition for representing 
their views to parliament.  Today we have an opportunity to 
debate this issue—

<P><A NAME="LINK28"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
present a petition on behalf of the people in Peterborough who 
are concerned about children living in poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They point out that thousands of children in Canada are not 
receiving the national child tax benefit.  They believe that in 
Ontario, which has the highest child poverty rate in Canada, that 
all families should receive the national child tax benefit to 
help alleviate child poverty, and that it is time to amend the 
national child tax benefit so that no province in Canada will be 
allowed to claw it back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, they urge the Parliament of Canada to amend the 
agreement with all provinces to allow all children living in 
poverty to receive the national child tax benefit to improve 
their quality of life.

am pleased to present a petition on the subject of human rights 
signed by a number of Canadians, including from my own riding of 
Mississauga South. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House 
that human rights abuses continue to be rampant around the world 
in countries such as Indonesia and Kosovo.  They also acknowledge 
that Canada continues to be internationally recognized as a 
champion of human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners therefore call on the Government of Canada to 
continue to speak out against such abuses, and also to seek to 
bring to justice those responsible for such abuses.

society, our children, from sexual abuse and to take all

petitioners are adding their names to the over 100,000 already 
presented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners are petitioning parliament because they are 
horrified by the pornography that depicts children and are 
astounded by the legal determinations that possession of such 
pornography is not criminal.  They say that it is the duty of 
parliament through the enactment and enforcement of the Criminal 
Code to protect the most vulnerable members of society from 
sexual abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, they ask parliament to take all measures necessary to 
ensure that the possession of child pornography remains a serious

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to present a petition that is signed by residents 
from across Canada.  It states that grandparents, as a 
consequence of death, separation or divorce of their children, 
are often denied access to their grandchildren by their 
guardians, that the relationship that exists between grandparents 
and grandchildren is a natural and fundamental one, and that the 
denial of access can constitute elder abuse and can have a 
serious detrimental emotional impact on both grandparents and 
grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, they petition parliament to amend the Divorce Act to 
include a provision, as supported in Bill C-340, regarding the 
right of spouses, parents and grandparents to have access to or 
custody of their children and grandchildren.

sector of Canadian Life” appeared in the London <I>Free 
Press</I>.  We have recently seen many more of these headlines in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are Canadians overreacting or do they have justifiable concerns? 
Let us examine some of the recent events that have added to the 
public concern about the erosion of the definition and the 
concepts related to marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Up until recently Canadians understood the word spouse to be 
either a husband or a wife in a marriage.  The courts and the 
Liberal government are telling Canadians that they have it wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just in the last few months alone immigration Bill C-63 was 
introduced and it will give the minister, or in fact the 
bureaucracy under her, the power to define spouse as whatever she 
deems it to be depending on the occasion on any particular day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-78, recently pushed through the House, the 52nd bill that 
the government has forced early closure on, dealt with the public 
service pension plan.  This bill removed every reference of wife, 
widow and spouse and replaced them with the word survivor in 
order to extend benefits previously reserved for marriage to same 
sex relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week the Minister of Human Resources Development went 
beyond the Canada Pension Plan Act to extend pension plan 
benefits normally reserved for married couples to same sex 
relationships, even though there has been no legal or legislative 
authorization to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, a number of court cases have served to erode the 
distinctiveness of marriage and the concepts, rights and 
obligations tied to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians are concerned about this trend.  There are two 
examples of recent court rulings.  The Liberals refused to appeal 
a tax code case, known as the Rosenberg case, when a provincial 
court redefined spouse to mean two people of the opposite sex or 
the same sex, even though every dictionary, including legal 
dictionaries, have always and still do understand spouse to be 
the husband or wife. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most recent development, perceived by many as a further 
undermining of the distinctiveness of marriage and the concepts 
surrounding it, was the supreme court's decision that the 
opposite sex definition of the term spouse in the M. v H. case was 
unconstitutional.  With this ruling the complete section 29 of 
Ontario's Family Law Act was struck down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerned Canadians are watching this trend.  Some say that the 
last thing that remains is the full blown establishment of 
homosexual marriage in Canada as a normative practice.  It 
becomes somewhat self-evident that sooner or later the opposite 
sex definition of marriage will be challenged in the courts. 
If they can rule that the way Canadians use the word spouse is 
unconstitutional and must include a same sex definition of 
spouse, why could they not rule that the current definition of 
marriage is unconstitutional unless it includes same sex and 
possibly a variety of other relationships as well?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be sharing my time today with the member for 
Surrey Central.  All Reform members will be sharing their time 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not intending to target the courts.  I am attempting to 
describe the events which have been an increasing cause of 
concern for Canadians.  The courts and Canadians have been asking 
for some leadership and some clarification on this issue. 
Reformers believe that as servants of the people who put us here 
we have an obligation to provide it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Due to the lack of accountable leadership from the Liberal 
government, the courts end up setting social policy, often 
derived from a single case, using charter arguments.  The Liberal 
government follows with legislation saying that the courts made 
the government do it and the people of Canada are left out of the 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have an opportunity to put the people back into the 
process.  Let us respond to the concerns of Canadians and give 
the courts the direction they have been asking for.  Let us start 
the process today with this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me move to the second part of the motion, which states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>...that marriage is and should remain the union of one man and 
one woman to the exclusion of all others... 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why this wording?  This is the government's own wording in 
response to petitions which I mentioned earlier and in recent 
letters from the justice minister.  The response has been that 
the term marriage is clear in Canadian law and is defined as 
stated in today's motion.  Therefore, let the government and the 
entire House affirm this position publicly and commit to 
proactively upholding this definition of marriage.  Hopefully the 
Liberals will not vote against their own wording in response to 
private inquiries from citizens.  Or will they? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever the case, the vote today will allow the people whom we 
are supposed to serve to hold each one of us individually 
accountable, both today and in the future, on this issue.  The 
Reform Party has long advocated greater accountability to the 
public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marriage, as it has been defined throughout history, is 
significant to people for a variety of reasons.  It would be 
presumptuous of me to try to attempt to adequately capture all of 
the values and rationales that Canadians have associated with 
defining what marriage is in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In general, the institution of marriage has been important to 
Canadian society from the very beginning of our nation.  In 
marriage, a man in a relationship with a woman gains insights, 
sensitivities and strengths which she brings to the relationship 
and vice versa.  A lifelong, committed union of a man and a woman 
in marriage creates a unit that is stronger than the sum of the 
individuals because their differences complement each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Corbett v Corbett the court said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(Marriage) is the institution on which the family is built and 
with the capacity for natural heterosexual intercourse as an 
essential element. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marriage provides a healthy biological design for procreation. 
Other types of relationships are technically incomplete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about children?  Teachers, and my wife is one, have a 
saying.  They say that more is caught than taught.  Intimate, 
committed marriage provides the best possible learning ground for 
the socialization and character development of children.  Boys 
who have a lifelong example of a father who is patient, kind, 
polite, calm, forgiving, truthful, trusting and protective toward 
his wife are more likely to be that way themselves.  More is 
caught than taught. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same concept applies for daughters.  In fact, both genders 
learn from a myriad of subtle character messages that children 
pick up from different gender parents.  These models help them to 
decide and to relate to their own life mate.  Marriage provides 
children with parental fullness, versus the gender deprived 
parenting of same sex relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This kind of positive character modelling within and across 
genders does not stay confined to the home but continues with 
children outside the home and adds to the stabilizing and 
strengthening component of society as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent Statistics Canada studies report that children in home 
relationships with both parents have far fewer behavioural 
problems and have a significantly higher percentage of children 
who complete high school.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also interesting to me that in a recent Angus Reid poll 
young people in Canada aspire to having strong families. 
Ninety-three per cent of the youth in the poll predict that their 
families are the most important part of their lives. Eighty per 
cent believe that marriage is for life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is reasonable to assume that some day there will be a 
constitutional challenge to strike down the opposite sex 
definition of marriage in Canada.  Why wait until that happens? 
Why continue to let the courts lead?  Why not respond to the 
people and lead instead of follow? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do not act now when the courts say the charter made us do 
it and the Liberals say the courts made us do it, the question of 
the use of the notwithstanding clause will come up again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would we use the notwithstanding clause to defend the current 
definition of marriage?  Clearly the Liberals have a position 
that seems to say they will never use it.  They will do 
everything in their power to make sure that no one else does 
either.  We would not even need to enter that debate if the 
government protected the definition of marriage in statute now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, the Reform Party is demonstrating leadership today 
by bringing forward a motion that addresses three concerns: 
first, the public concern reflected in the media and the weekly 
petitions calling on the House to protect the definition of 
marriage; second, a motion that uses the government's own words 
to define marriage in Canadian law in response to private 
inquiries; and, third, an opportunity for us all to make a 
commitment to action in order to uphold and defend this 
definition both now and in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope we see unanimous support for the motion before us as it 
is a reasonable expectation and certainly our hope.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is important that Canadians witnessing the debate 
today understand the real agenda here.  The real agenda is that 
the Reform Party not only does not believe in the equality of gay 
and lesbian relationships but does not believe in equality for 
gays and lesbians, period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When that issue came before the House of Commons for a vote, the 
fundamental question of whether the Canadian Human Rights Act 
should be amended to include sexual orientation so that gay and 
lesbian people would not be fired from their jobs or thrown out 
of their homes or denied access to goods and services, they voted 
against that basic equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they say today that they want to talk about marriage, let 
us be very clear what the real agenda is.  That party does not 
believe in the fundamental equality of gay and lesbian people in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Calgary Centre raised a number of issues.  He has 
made a number of statements to which I would like him to respond 
in terms of the inaccuracy of those statements.  He talked about 
committed, loving, lifelong relationships.  The fact is that gay 
and lesbian people also enter into committed, loving, lifelong 
relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to ask the hon. member a question.  How is it any threat 
to a heterosexual marriage to recognize and affirm our 
relationships as well?  For gay and lesbian people who seek to 
marry, why should that right not be extended to them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has said that some day there will be a court 
challenge.  I tell the hon. member that there has already been a 
court challenge.  So much for what he knows.  Is the member not 
aware of the fact that there has already been a constitutional 
challenge in the Ontario Divisional Court in the case of Layland 
and Beaulne, in which the court ruled that federal common law 
restricts marriage to one man and one woman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is he misleading the House on this important issue?  Why 
will he not respect the right of equality for gay and lesbian 
people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question. 
Certainly the Reform Party is committed to the equality of all 
Canadian citizens before the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In what we are doing here today we are not against anyone.  We 
are simply affirming that marriage is an important institution to 
Canadians.  Canadians understand that marriage is a unique 
institution in a relationship that involves the union of a man 
and a woman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our job is to represent our constituents and Canadians on issues 
that are important to them.  We believe that marriage should 
remain the union of a man and a woman.  It is foundational to 
family and foundational to the strength of the nation. We believe 
that strong families make strong nations and marriage is part of 
that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, having 
listened to the Reform member for Calgary Centre today, it seems 
to me a massive contradiction to say that the Reform Party is 
committed to equality and is not against anyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion clearly states a bias and an opinion to which the 
Reform Party and the member are entitled, but to force that 
opinion or bias about marriage being between a heterosexual 
couple on all Canadians, it seems to me, is a direct attack on 
equality and a direct attack on many members of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to hear the member also say that a marriage 
without children is technically incomplete.  I am sure that all 
the heterosexual couples who for whatever reason have chosen not 
to have children will be devastated to learn that they are 
technically incomplete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What authority does the member and the Reform Party have to 
impose their views on other Canadians if they believe in 
equality?  If they believe in equality, where does that authority 
come from? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the 
question although I need to clarify a couple of her points.  She 
is assuming I said that married couples without children are 
technically incomplete.  That was not at all what I said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said in my speech that a marriage between a man and a woman 
provides for parental fullness.  A marriage between same sex 
couples is technically incomplete and is deprived parenting in 
some ways because one gender is deprived. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion indicates what the government and the law already 
states, that marriage is and should remain the union of one man 
and one woman to the exclusion of all others.  We are just 
saying: let us make sure that we are clear on what the Canadian 
law is and that the House stands behind it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apparently the member who asked me the question does not agree 
with Canadian law and does not agree with the responses to 
petitions that have been given in the House.  That is a sad 
indictment of her party. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central in support of the 
official opposition's motion.  The hon. member for Calgary Centre 
made an excellent speech and I congratulate him on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of those who do not understand the motion, I 
will read it again: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, it is necessary, in light of 
public debate around recent court decisions, to state that 
marriage is and should remain the union of one man and one woman 
to the exclusion of all others, and that Parliament will take all 
necessary steps to preserve this definition of marriage in 
Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason we have caused this motion to be brought forward is 
simply that the courts and others are asking the House for clear 
instructions with respect to this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are concerned about the possible erosion of the 
traditional definition of the institution of marriage.  Our 
federal government, through the elected representatives in this 
place, provide our courts with legislation, the laws of our land, 
for the courts to interpret. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the sanctity of the traditional definition of 
marriage, the courts have been left to defining it themselves or 
calling on the government for direction.  Today the official 
opposition is exercising its responsibility to ensure that the 
definition of marriage is reaffirmed in our federal legislature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marriage should be affirmed.  The motion is not about being 
against anyone or anything but is about being for marriage. The 
official opposition believes that the term marriage is a 
cornerstone of public policy and ought not to be unilaterally 
changed by the courts, by bureaucrats or by cabinet behind closed 
doors as is usually done. 
There should be the full light of public input, parliamentary 
debate and free votes in the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our courts take guidance from parliament on important social 
policies and other matters.  Today's motion is intended to give 
expression to the will of the parliament on marriage, a 
cornerstone of our public policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is legitimate for parliament to give guidance on important 
social policy matters.  Parliamentarians can reform the current 
status of the law, especially given debates surrounding recent 
court decisions relating to the definition of spouse, et cetera. 
Today the official opposition motion provides that opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been, there are and likely there will be future court 
challenges to the definition of marriage.  It would be 
inappropriate for parliament to remain silent about this 
important social policy term in the midst of great public debate 
on the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The courts often indicate that they are looking for guidance 
from parliament on different issues.  The motion is an 
opportunity to clearly express the will of parliament.  The 
motion allows parliament to better engage in a dialogue with the 
courts with respect to the definition of marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By having a debate and a vote on the matter in parliament we are 
allowing the elected representatives of the Canadian people to 
reflect the views of Canadians on what they feel about the 
definition of marriage, an important Canadian institution.  This 
is properly the role of parliament as such input is not able to 
take place in court litigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opinion of the Canadian people is very clearly in favour of 
the current definition of marriage.  In the 36th parliament 84 
members stood in the House and tabled petitions from constituents 
calling for parliament to enact legislation to define that a 
marriage can be entered into between a single male and a single 
female. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People should not be shut up.  They are the ones we came here to 
represent.  We should listen to these people when they send 
petitions to the House.  The supply day motion is an opportunity 
for members and parliament as a whole to stand by their 
constituents and communicate so that their voices are heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being a relatively new immigrant and new Canadian, I can share 
with the House that many people around the world choose to 
immigrate to Canada because of what they know about our country. 
When they come they believe they will find the traditional 
definition of marriage, a union between a man and a woman.  They 
trust that the federal government supports that definition.  If 
we did not, these immigrants might have immigrated elsewhere in 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's demographics have changed significantly since 
Confederation.  People immigrating to Canada now come mostly from 
Asia.  They share the social values that include the definition 
of marriage we are debating today.  They believe the family is an 
institution, a cornerstone or a pillar of society.  This strong 
belief in the traditional family values is another reason they 
often have joint families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the election campaign a young man came to my office and 
asked for my views on the definition of marriage.  I told him I 
believed that marriage was a union of a man and a woman.  He said 
that he did not agree and that two men or two women could marry. 
I asked him if he would like to have his own children.  He said 
he did not care, that having children was not important.  I told 
him that if his father or mother had thought the same way he 
would not be talking to me. 
There was silence for a moment and then he said he had never 
thought of that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later he told me that originally he would not vote for me, but 
he was sorry now.  He thanked me for making him realize that.  He 
not only voted for me, as he told me afterward, but he became one 
of my volunteers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the House dealt with Bill C-78, changes to the pension 
fund of federal government employees that will allow the Liberals 
to make a one time $30 billion grab.  One effect of the bill was 
to expand the benefits of the pension plan. It extended survivors 
benefits outside of marriage to marriage dependent on private 
sexuality regardless of gender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a contributor to a pension plan dies, the benefits go to 
the surviving husband or wife.  The bill maintains that 
provision, which is good.  It also extends the benefits beyond 
this point in a new way.  The government said its intent was to 
extend the benefits to same sex relationships as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue here today is not of same sex benefits for couples; 
the issue is the definition of marriage.  No sex means no 
benefits.  This is not the right policy.  It has added a new 
legal expression, a relationship of a conjugal nature with 
absolutely no definition of what it means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the official opposition in our leadership role is 
asking the government and all sides of the House to affirm 
support for the definition of marriage as being a union between a 
man and a woman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to move an amendment to the main motion. I move: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by replacing the words “in Canada” 
with the words “within the jurisdiction of the Parliament of 
Canada”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  On a point of order, 
the hon. member for Surrey Central. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to withdraw 
that amendment and change it. I move that the motion be amended 
by inserting between the words “to” and “state” the word 
“unequivocally”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My understanding was that an amendment had been moved and 
seconded and was before the House and could only be withdrawn by 
unanimous consent.  Is that not correct? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The original 
amendment was before the House.  I will just do a little 
consultation with the clerk to make sure we are on solid ground 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment had been presented by the member for Surrey 
Central in debate.  It had not been presented to the House by the 
Chair and in that event had not been formally introduced to the 
House.  It is perfectly within the normal procedure for the 
member on a point of order to rescind his earlier amendment and 
revise his amendment, which would then in due course be taken to 
the table officers and then to the Chair for presentation.  We 
will do that right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to unduly prolong the debate, but there is a 
procedural issue here which is a serious one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I understand it, the hon. member during the course of debate 
had put forward an amendment, had moved and seconded an amendment 
to the motion which was before the House. 
He then sat down having concluded his intervention in the debate. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1050"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He subsequently rose on a point of order and sought the consent 
of the House to put forward a different amendment. Perhaps the 
Chair could assist us but as I understand it, it is not in order 
to seek to put an amendment before the House when rising on a 
point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Burnaby—Douglas has a point.  I am going to consult with the 
clerk and we will sort this out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The hon. member for Burnaby—Douglas is challenging the rule of 
the Chair when it has already ruled.  That is inappropriate and 
he is not permitted to do that when the Chair has already ruled 
on the point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The Chair is not so 
insecure that he cannot take guidance from wherever it comes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Burnaby—Douglas is quite correct.  On 
reflection, we had on debate recognized the original amendment 
from the hon. member for Surrey Central.  The member had taken 
his place and did subsequently rise on a point of order. It is 
established procedure that an amendment cannot be introduced on a 
point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the first amendment stands.  The second amendment is 
not receivable.  We will now look at the first amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to 
have confirmation of the Chair's willingness to be flexible and 
review its decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do want to be quite clear.  I understood that the hon. member 
moved a motion during the debate and that is the one that stands 
according to your ruling.  However, I also heard you say that the 
other member had proposed a motion during his speech in debate 
which is not before the House.  Can we have that clarified? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  No, that is not the 
case.  It was on a point of order that the hon. member for 
Burnaby—Douglas brought to the attention of the Chair a 
procedural error.  This is being rectified.  It is better to be 
rectified now than at 10 o'clock tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not sure what that

return the first amendment to the hon. opposition House leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The clerk has brought to my attention that the Chair has yet to

the debate will be on the motion as presented.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me clarify this.  My 
colleague from Surrey Central introduced an amendment.  He had a 
written amendment here which he tried to subsequently introduce. 
There is no other amendment.  We do not have another amendment 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We will check the 
blues and we will take the time necessary to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his debate the member for Surrey Central presented an 
amendment verbally to the House.  The normal procedure is that 
that would be signed and presented to the Chair.  If the Chair 
does not receive that, then we do not have it and we go to the 
original motion as presented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, because we do not have an amendment the debate is on 
the original motion.  It is not an amended motion.  There has 
been no amendment presented to the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I signed one amendment. 
I gave it to the clerk and the clerk has it.  It has been 
presented to the hon. Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The member for 
Surrey Central says that he signed an amendment.  Apparently the 
amendment he signed has been given to the Chair.  That was the 
second amendment presented to the House.  It is not an amendment

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it may 
come out as a question but I certainly have a comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member indicated that he is a fairly recent immigrant 
to Canada. He said that people come to Canada because of the 
definition of marriage and that this is of great value to him.  I 
recognize that it is a value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reason a good many people come to Canada is because of 
the persecution they face in their own countries. They may be in 
a same sex relationship and may not be given the same 
opportunities to be treated fairly as is what happens in Canada 
under our charter of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To bring the marriage issue and the term marriage up as being 
the most important thing and then to slam same sex relationships 
is not the way to go about doing this. A number of Canadians 
believe strongly that those in same sex relationships should have 
all the benefits of other Canadians but they feel a great 
affinity to the term marriage because of how they have perceived 
marriage through Christian beliefs and through the unity of their 
partnerships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest rather than be divisive that Reform take a 
serious look at its approach to things. The member should 
consider seriously the real reasons people come to Canada.  It is 
not just for the term marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there are many reasons 
that motivate prospective immigrants to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One reason is the definition of marriage with family as the 
cornerstone of our society.  What is a family?  How do families 
begin? The definition of marriage is the one we are debating 
here. Prospective immigrants view the definition of marriage as 
it is stated in the law and which we are here to reaffirm today 
as one of the reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was one of the reasons I came to Canada.  With due respect, 
this is the definition of marriage.  It is between one man and 
one woman.  That is what we are here to reaffirm today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member's colleague, the member for Calgary Centre, has 
referred to gay and lesbian families, the families of two gay men 
or two lesbian women who are raising children as gender deprived 
parenting.  He said that these families are somehow deficient.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member for Surrey Central agree with this attack 
and this insult on families in Canada who happen to be made up of 
two women and their children or two men raising children?  Does 
he agree that this is, to use the words of his colleague, gender 
deprived parenting?  Does he also agree, presumably, that a 
single parent family in which there is only one woman raising 
children or one man raising children is a gender deprived family 
and similarly is a defective or a deficient family? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the hon. member for Surrey Central explain why he is 
apparently agreeing with this appalling attack on families in 
Canada who happen to be made up of gay and lesbian people raising 
children? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, what we are debating 
here is the definition of marriage.   On this side of the House 
we are not against anyone or anything.  We are here today simply 
to reaffirm the definition of marriage as a marriage between a 
man and a woman.  That is the only issue we are debating today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
heard the member speak about immigrants coming to Canada. I was 
recently at the citizenship court and heard the judge speaking to 
new Canadians who were swearing the oath of allegiance to Canada 
and becoming citizens.  The citizenship judge in Vancouver told 
them that the most important thing about becoming a Canadian was 
understanding diversity and equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very surprised to hear the comments from the member that 
somehow the particular view that the member holds would be 
enforced on all other Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my constituency is one 
of the largest constituencies in Canada.  I have a diverse 
population in my riding.  I am here to represent my constituents. 
They have been calling to tell me that they want to reaffirm the 
definition of marriage as a marriage between a man and a woman.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise to respond to the 
motion this morning on behalf of the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me clearly state that the Government of Canada will be 
supporting the motion in the House today.  The fact that we will 
be supporting the motion should come as a surprise to no one. I 
would like to thank the hon. member for tabling the motion for 
the consideration of the House and for giving the government the 
opportunity to clarify our position on this important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side agree that the institution of marriage is a 
central and important institution in the lives of many Canadians. 
It plays an important part in all societies worldwide, second 
only to the fundamental importance of family to all of us. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The institution of marriage is of great importance to large 
numbers of Canadians, and the definition of marriage as found in 
the hon. member's motion is clear in law. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As stated in the motion, the definition of marriage is already 
clear in law.  It is not found in a statute, but then not all law 
exists in statutes, and the law is no less binding and no less 
the law because it is found in the common law instead of in a 
statute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The definition of marriage, which has been consistently applied 
in Canada, comes from an 1866 British case which holds that 
marriage is “the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion 
of all others”.  That case and that definition are considered 
clear law by ordinary Canadians, by academics and by the courts. 
The courts have upheld the constitutionality of that definition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ontario court, general division, recently upheld in Layland 
and Beaulne the definition of marriage.  In that decision a 
majority of the court stated the following: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—unions of persons of the same sex are not “marriages”, 
because of the definition of marriage.  The applicants are, in 
effect, seeking to use s. 15 of the Charter to bring about a 
change in the definition of marriage.  I do not think the Charter 
has that effect.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One may then ask why we are here today and why we are using the 
already limited time of the House to debate a motion, on which, I 
suspect, there will be no fundamental disagreement inside or 
outside the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am aware, as are other ministers, that recent court decisions 
and resulting media coverage have raised concern around the issue 
of same sex partners.  It appears that the hon. member believes 
that the motion is both necessary and effective as a means to 
keep the Government of Canada from suddenly legislating the 
legalization of same sex marriages. That kind of misunderstanding 
of the intention of the government should be corrected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me state again for the record that the government has no 
intention of changing the definition of marriage or of 
legislating same sex marriages.  No jurisdiction worldwide defines 
a legal marriage as existing between same sex partners.  Even 
those few European countries such as Denmark, Norway and Holland, 
which have recently passed legislation giving recognition to same 
sex relationships and extending some of the same benefits and 
responsibilities as available to married spouses, maintain a 
clear distinction in the law between marriage and same sex 
registered partnerships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Norway's ministry published a statement in 1994 that makes this 
distinction clear.  Although a same sex relationship may have many 
of the same needs, the Norwegian government clarified that it, the 
same sex partnership, can 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—never be the same as marriage, neither socially nor from a 
religious point of view.  (Registered partnership) does not 
replace or compete with heterosexual marriage—(and the) 
opportunity for homosexuals to register their partnerships will 
not lead to more people opting for homosexual relationships 
rather than marriage. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fundamentally do not believe that it is necessary to change 
the definition of marriage in order to accommodate the equality 
issues around same sex partners which now face us as Canadians. 
The courts have ruled that some recognition must be given to the 
realities of unmarried cohabitation in terms of both opposite sex 
and same sex partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly believe that the message to the government and to 
all Canadian governments from the Canadian public is a message of 
tolerance, fairness and respect for others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who remain concerned, I would point out that recent 
surveys of young people indicate that marriage has not gone out 
of style in Canada.  The majority of young people still expect to 
marry.  The marriage rate is still similar to that of the 1920s, 
although a rising number are re-marriages, and that Canadian 
marriages still on average last longer than those in the United 
States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion speaks of taking all necessary steps to preserve the 
definition of marriage in Canada.  While I and the government 
support the motion, I feel strongly that marriage is already 
very clear in Canadian minds and in Canadian law, and that there 
is little that the House must do as a necessary step to in any 
way add to the clarity of the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marriage has fundamental value and importance to Canadians and 
we do not believe on this side of the House that importance and 
value is in any way threatened or undermined by others seeking to 
have their long term relationships recognized. I support the 
motion for maintaining the clear legal definition of marriage in 
Canada as the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of 
all others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time I would like to move an amendment to the motion. 
I move: 
<A NAME="LINK57">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by inserting after the word “steps” 
the words “within the jurisdiction of the Parliament of 
Canada”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I believe that the seconder of the motion is required to 
be in his or her seat when he or she seconds.  The member was not 
in her seat at the time of the seconding and I therefore think 
you should consider the motion null and void. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  As a matter of 
interest, I checked with the clerk on exactly that point no more 
than 30 seconds ago.  I was informed that the member needs only 
to be in the House, recognized by the Speaker as a legitimate 
member, and to be anywhere within the purview of the Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment is in order and is accepted.  The debate is on the 
amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the Minister of Justice for supporting the motion.  I also 
agree with her comment about marriage being an important 
institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She posed a couple of questions in her speech.  She asked why we 
are here today and then put out the suggestion that it is a 
redundant motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went to sleep last night thinking about the motion.  Often in 
the House we get so caught up in the day to day activities and 
with what is in the press that we sometimes lose focus on the 
truly important issues.  Sometimes things create a life of their 
own.   As we have seen many times through the courts on various 
issues, completely separate and apart from this, they do create a 
life of their own and the courts are left to interpret. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Minister of Justice agree that parliament is the 
supreme lawmaker of the country?  Is it not very important for 
the courts to get a very clear, simple message from the 
Parliament of Canada on where we stand on this issue?  In the 
past in many cases we have not done that and we have left it up 
to the courts to shape the law of the country. The Minister of 
Justice and I both recognize that happens all the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Minister of Justice not think that this will send a 
very clear signal to the courts on where the Parliament of Canada 
stands on the issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the point I have 
tried to make on behalf of the government is that we do believe 
that the definition of marriage is clear.  It is clear in the law 
of Canada and it was the courts that made the definition clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated in my comments, the definition of marriage as a 
union between one man and one woman is found in the common law of 
our country and the common law of our system of law.  It is also 
found in the civil law of the country.  This is clear and we are 
therefore able to support the motion as presented by the official 
opposition.  If it is believed that some clarity is required 
around that, so be it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We thought perhaps we could spend our time debating other issues 
as opposed to that on which there is clarity in the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  You have no idea how 
much I enjoy the opportunity to stand and interrupt the Minister 
of Justice because when we first met 10 years ago I could not 
interrupt her.  However, this time I can.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the minister and is with regard to the amendment 
that has been moved in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think she would agree with me, given the nature of the 
amendment, that jurisdictional controversies in terms of 
authority, be it federal or provincial, is extremely clouded in 
this area.  I quote from Professor Hogg: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal power in terms of regulating marriage has been 
largely undetermined. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the main motion there is some question as to the 
power and jurisdiction of the federal government.  Would the 
minister agree with me on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I respect the hon. 
member's comment and that of Professor Hogg, dean of Osgoode Hall 
Law School.  There is divided jurisdiction in the area of family 
law and divided jurisdiction in relation to marriage.  The 
federal government has jurisdiction over marriage and divorce. 
The provinces have jurisdiction over solemnisation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I moved the amendment.  I wanted to clarify for 
everyone in the House and in the country that we as a parliament 
are operating within our jurisdiction.  We are not arrogating to 
ourselves any jurisdiction that we do not have. Obviously we 
could not do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope the official opposition, of all parties, would 
adopt the amendment and support it.  It is important in this 
federation where we acknowledge diversity and the role of the 
provinces that we make clear parliament supports the motion 
operating within its constitutional jurisdiction, however that 
might ultimately be defined by the courts of the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the opposition motion, as amended by the Minister of Justice, 
addresses an extremely important issue.  I think it would be 
worthwhile for the House to express its views on this issue, 
which merits reflection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a bit bothered by the turn the debate is taking.  I think 
there is a slight difference between the motion as drafted and 
what I am hearing, and that is what is bothering me.  I have the 
feeling Reform Party members want to oppose two concepts.  They 
are using the topic of marriage to oppose the rights of gays and 
lesbians.  It would appear that they want to steer the debate in 
another direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to what the government will be doing—and I do not know 
about the opposition parties—the Bloc Quebecois will allow a free 
vote on this issue.  Members will be able to vote according to 
their conscience.  This is very important, given the underlying 
implications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally, I think this is a poor time to debate this issue in 
the House, before there has really been a substantive public 
debate.  This is an issue to which society must give some 
thought, one whose evolution over time it must consider.  One 
cannot simply spring it on people as something parliamentarians 
must vote on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian and Quebec law and society are evolving.  What marriage 
was considered to be in Great Britain in bygone times may not 
necessarily hold in 1999 in Canada and Quebec.  The minister 
cited case law that goes back a few years. 
I would like the House to consider the question of marriage from 
a much more contemporary angle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 20 the Supreme Court of Canada ruled on 
an equally important matter, the question as to whether partners 
of same sex relationships were entitled to support payments under 
Ontario's Family Law Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can understand that such a ruling would upset some Reformers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here again the justices of the supreme court simply applied 
existing principles of law. They did not invent the wheel. I do 
not think this lends itself to wild demonstrations in Ontario, 
in opposition to the interpretation of these Courts have given 
to the Ontario Family Law Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think things have changed. Had the same decision been rendered 
25 years ago, I have no doubt that we would have demonstrated in 
the streets. Today people are perhaps more open than they were 
on a similar subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, I would say we are in the lead. The national assembly 
has taken extremely important steps to try to establish some 
equality. 
Regardless of whether people recognize it, approve it, 
disapprove of it or not, the fact exists in Quebec society, and 
the members of the national assembly recognized it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not a decision by the PQ government alone. It was a 
unanimous decision of the national assembly. I must point that 
out, because it is not every day there is a consensus in the 
national assembly or in a parliament. I think it was Bill 32, 
which obtained the unanimous support of the national assembly to 
amend a series of acts. If I recall correctly, 28 statutes and 
11 regulations were amended in order to give gay and lesbian 
couples the same rights as couples in a common law relationship. 
This is a step forward, and I think it is one that received the 
approval of the people of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we can see, things are changing. We are mulling this question 
over. 
Today, in a motion, the Reform members want to block any 
discussion of this issue. I think it is too early. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is proper to speak of it because outside the House, in the 
society as a whole, in our families, it is important for people 
to tell us what they think about it and how they see things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who are adamant that marriage be between a man and a woman 
are afraid that one day gay and lesbian couples will claim the 
right to adopt and other rights. They wonder where their demands 
will end. This is a legitimate question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that we still have not enough information to be able to 
make a definite position on such an important issue as this. 
I believe that marriage is a indeed sufficiently important 
institution in Canada and in Quebec to warrant our taking the 
time to address it and to have a definition that is the most 
representative of the society in which we are living in 1999, on 
the eve of the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of different concepts involved.  There is 
marriage, there is union, there is the couple.  There are a 
number of different concepts, and I believe that each one needs 
to be defined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a bit of fun looking up the definition of marriage in the 
<I>Petit Robert</I>.  In the latest edition of the <I>Petit Robert</I>, it is 
defined differently than in the one dating from ten years ago. 
At that time it was defined as the union between a man and a 
woman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, in the most recent edition of the <I>Petit Robert</I>, it is 
defined as the lawful union of two persons under conditions set 
out in the law. 
The dictionary definition of marriage has changed.  This means 
that the definition is an evolving one.  A societal debate is 
required in order to reach a definition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That leads me to another point I want to address.  Initially the 
Minister of Justice introduced an amendment to the motion to add 
the words “within the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada”. 
It is far from clear where the Canadian government's 
jurisdiction over marriage begins and ends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have consulted certain documents by constitutional experts in 
order to see what point we have reached in the evolution of 
jurisprudence and Canadian constitutional law in this 
connection.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The era of the federal government's exclusive jurisdiction over 
marriage has to do with the fundamental conditions, i.e. 
capacity of the parties, and impediments.  The concurrent 
provincial jurisdiction with respect to the solemnization of 
marriage has to do with the preliminary formalities, including 
obtaining parental consent, in the case of minors. 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>... and it has to do with the actual conduct of the ceremony, 
including the competence of those officiating. 
And in the exercise of their jurisdiction, the provinces, like 
the federal government, may stipulate sanctions up to and 
including annulling a marriage. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, when it comes to marriage it is not clear what 
is exclusively federal and what is exclusively provincial.  The 
line is fairly blurred and over time the provinces have 
acquired increasing powers with respect to marriage, as opposed 
to divorce, which has always come under the exclusive 
jurisdiction of Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here too, things have evolved.  I will take this opportunity to 
make my oft-repeated point: if the federal government were to act 
in good faith, it would withdraw completely from this 
jurisdiction and allow the provinces complete freedom to 
legislate with respect to marriage and divorce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I think this is an important debate and one 
which merits public discussion.  We cannot give a fast cut and 
dried answer to this issue, and there should be a much broader 
discussion.  At the same time, great care must be taken not to 
interfere in what may, according to long-standing custom, be 
provincial jurisdictions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member made reference to the dictionary and I thought I 
would share with him a reference from the dictionary which I 
looked at this morning.  It has to do with the word 
discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member will know that for some members who argue this 
case the issue here is equality and to not extend equality is to 
discriminate against a particular group of people.  We certainly 
have seen that in court decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the dictionary the definition of discrimination includes a 
mixture.  It includes prejudice, bias and victimization, but it 
also includes distinguishing between favouring or giving notice 
to.  It dawns on me that within the dictionary and within the 
context of discrimination there is negative discrimination and 
there is affirmative discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member like to comment on whether or not he 
believes that denying same sex marriages is in fact a question of 
negative discrimination or affirmative discrimination? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, the answer to this question 
depends on the values of our society as a whole. The hon. member 
would like me to specify whether this is a form of negative or 
positive discrimination. I would be tempted to say that it is 
negative discrimination, given that I am someone—and I speak very 
personally—who is very open. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If someone put this question to me six or eight months ago, or a 
year ago, my answer might have been different. 
Today however, with the baggage I carry, with experience, and 
with what I regularly run into in a riding like 
Berthier-Montcalm, which is not near the island of Montreal, 
where there are gay neighbourhoods, but which has men and women 
with problems relating to their sexual orientation who come to 
see me, I think that discrimination as the member understands 
it, is negative. But this is really a very personal response.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have a very direct question for my Bloc colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the motion before the House for debate today it states that 
it is necessary, in light of public debate around recent court 
decisions, to state that marriage is and should remain the union 
of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my colleague from the Bloc if he personally 
agrees with that statement.  Is he speaking for himself, his 
constituents or his party when he gives his answer to that 
question?  It is a very direct question and I would like to know 
whether or not he supports that statement. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know if it is 
because we do not speak the same mother tongue, but I answered 
this question at the very outset. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the vote is concerned, I was speaking very personally. 
For the Bloc Quebecois, the vote will be a free vote. I think 
the member can understand what that means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to the second question, about whether I represent my voters, 
I will ask him the same question. Is he fairly representing his 
constituents when, without holding a substantive debate, without 
a public debate, his party brings such a motion to the House in 
order to put paid to any potential definition of marriage 
without even consulting the public at large? Does the member 
properly represent the voters in his riding? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not answer this question, but I leave a great big 
question mark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the moment, it is impossible to make a definitive statement 
on such an issue, because in my riding, as throughout Quebec and 
across Canada, we have not looked seriously at the issue. 
Clearly no responsible decision on the matter can be taken using 
all the stereotypes brought up by the member. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to address this motion today, especially 
following some of the eloquent and learned comments that have 
been made by the speakers preceding me. I particularly want to 
comment later on in my remarks on the Minister of Justice's 
amendment to the motion. I think it is an important amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First let me say that there is no greater spiritual union than 
that of marriage.  There is no more intimate spiritual union than 
that of someone who makes a commitment for life to an idea, to a 
person, to what they believe.  We use that word marriage.  It is 
the most private commitment one can make. Although we celebrate 
marriage as a public event, the reality is the signing of papers, 
the commitment that is made in writing, the commitment that is 
made before God is perhaps the most private and intimate 
commitment we can make as human beings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that because the word marriage has been talked about in 
terms of definitions.  An hon. member from the government side 
and an hon. member from the Bloc went to the dictionary to define 
marriage.  We have commented that it changes with time and it 
does, but it is clearly to correlate a pair, it is clearly to 
join together.  In fact, those of us from the maritime provinces 
grew up knowing 
that when we splice the ends of a rope together, we say we marry 
them.  When a carpenter joins together certain pieces, they are 
married.  We marry up certain things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I talk about the intense commitment of one person, I think 
about one of my relatives. She will not be happy that I am saying 
this publicly, but I believe next year she will celebrate her 
50th anniversary.  Fifty years ago she put on a wedding ring. She 
made a commitment.  She has stayed true to that commitment. Her 
marriage was to her church.  Her marriage was to the ideology and 
the beliefs she believes came to her intimately and that is the 
career to which she is married.  That is the intimate contract 
she has made with whom she sees as her God. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marriage takes all kinds of forms.  From reading history we know 
that Elizabeth I under pressure from France, from her ambassadors 
to marry the king of France, to marry the king of Spain, finally 
came to parliament and said “Behold lords, I am married.  See 
the ring. I am married to England”.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marriage has many connotations.  We have to bear that in mind 
because we are dealing with words.  Words in this chamber are 
important.  I look at the motion in that light; I look at it in 
terms of what the words are.  Some of them are important.  We 
have had definitions of marriage and what it means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some concern with the motion when it says that parliament 
will take all necessary steps to preserve that definition.  We 
need clarification on that.  I do not know what that means. 
Obviously it could mean invoking the notwithstanding clause of 
the constitution should the courts at some future date overrule 
what is contested here as being the legal definition of marriage, 
but how much further do we go if we invoke the notwithstanding 
clause?  Do we go further than that? If two individuals of the 
same sex, let us say, decide that they will fill out forms and 
say that they are married, how far do we go to preserve the 
definition?  We need some clarity on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We look at the constitution. I am glad the Minister of Justice 
made the amendment, because when I first read this motion, 
something did not sit right.  It has been a long time since I 
have been in law school, but somehow I thought, there is a 
jurisdictional issue here and I do not know what it is.  I did a 
little research. It has been commented on by my colleague from 
the Bloc.  Professor Hogg said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal authority in relation to “marriage”—the first 
branch of s. 91 (of the BNA Act)—has to be read side by side 
with the provincial authority in relation to “the solemnization 
of marriage in the province” (s. 92 of the BNA Act). In fact 
most of the laws concerning marriage have been enacted by the 
provinces, and the courts have tended to construe the provincial 
power liberally.  The scope of federal power has been left 
largely undetermined. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put that question to the minister and she agreed with me.  I 
do not know what it means to the House that the minister and 
myself agree.  There is Professor Hogg who may be a little more 
authoritative.  I cite again: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only federal law ever to come before the courts was one which 
declared that every marriage performed in accordance with the 
laws of the place where it was performed was to be recognized as 
a valid marriage everywhere in Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on to say that it was challenged, but their lordships 
expanded the power of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are debating a motion that clearly is one of those that 
overlaps the two spheres of federal and provincial authority.  I 
caution the House on that.  We have to be very careful before we 
interfere with the jurisdiction of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A red light went on when I read this motion. I remember when I 
was married that we applied to the province for a marriage 
licence.  It is the province that sanctions the marriage.  It is 
the federal government that sanctions divorce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to bear in mind those words and those jurisdictional 
questions when we look at this motion.  They require further 
debate.  We will hear about that as the day wears on and it will 
be a long day.  I understand we are here until 6.30. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to go behind the motion. This has been commented on 
by the mover and seconder of the motion. We began discussing what 
marriage is and what it should be and whether or not this 
government has the power and jurisdiction to enforce the legal 
definition.  Then we moved into a debate about recent court 
rulings.  It is fair to say that there is a great separation here 
between what is marriage and what the courts have determined in 
terms of same sex benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been some comment by both the mover of the motion and 
the seconder or the speaker who immediately followed him in 
reference to some of the cases.  The mover of the motion cited 
the Corbett case when he mentioned that the supreme court has 
determined what marriage is.  In that definition, which is the 
court's and not his, he says it clearly requires the physical 
sexual intercourse relationship, the intimacy of that physical 
relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be noted that in my opening remarks I did not refer to 
that. 
Marriage is a spiritual union more so than a physical union; even 
more so is the spiritual element of it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this debate is really about limiting benefits to same sex 
individuals, I would go further than that.  A constituent came up 
to me and said, “I have no problem with this issue of same sex 
benefits.  I think it should go further.  Why should I be 
precluded from naming as my survivor my daughter who has looked 
after me for 20 years?” Why should two sisters 
who are elderly and have looked after each other their whole 
lives, be prohibited from the rights of survivorship that we 
traditionally ascribe to a husband and wife? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this debate is really about fear of extending same sex 
benefits that were traditionally to a husband and wife to members 
of the same sex who have a longstanding relationship or to 
members of the same family who have a longstanding relationship, 
then I think that is a different debate altogether.  I have some 
concern that that may be the underlying thrust given the comments 
that have been made and all the references to same sex benefits 
and supreme court decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of that, it is a complex motion.  I applaud the member 
for bringing it before the House because it is an important 
motion.  But those are questions we will have to hear from the 
Reform Party on in terms of clarifying this important issue as 
the day wears on. 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Reform Party has articulated a tolerant message on 
the situation.  Overarching the motion which we are putting forth 
today is one of tolerance.  I want to make that clear.  I applaud 
the Minister of Justice for her fine speech most of which we 
agree with— 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague touched on a very important issue, that of 
registered domestic partnerships.  If we take the concept of what 
people do in their bedrooms behind closed doors completely out of 
this issue, it will enable us to uphold the traditional concept 
of marriage, one which this party supports.  It will also enable 
us to recognize and respect the diversity of relationships that 
occur and the reciprocal relationships of responsibility and long 
term commitment that exist in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member from the NDP whether he would support the 
concept of registered domestic partnerships when it comes to 
dealing with the issue of benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have some history and 
experience in this regard, having practised family law for some 
10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I not only encourage registered domestic partnerships, I 
encourage marriage contracts.  I have represented many people who 
have been through difficult divorce situations.  I represented 
people in common law relationships, before the courts took the 
initiative to define what were the rights of people who had not 
gone through a marriage ceremony but who lived in a common law 
relationship for a long time.  It seemed to me it would have been 
a whole lot clearer, a whole lot saner, a whole lot easier and 
probably a whole lot cheaper if those parties had registered what 
the nature of their agreement was, what assets would be divided, 
what assets would be shared, what obligations if any would arise 
from the termination of the relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Registered domestic partnerships are a good thing.  They lend 
clarity.  In terms of survivor benefits, I agree it would take 
care of the issue I raised which was brought to me by a 
constituent about someone who wants to ensure that the person who 
has looked after them who may be a family member is entitled to 
share in the benefits that a traditional spouse before the 
supreme court changed that definition would have shared in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the member for the question.  I think it is an important 
question.  I would have no objection to it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
earlier the NDP member for Vancouver East and the NDP member for 
Burnaby—Douglas talked about equality and that to deny equality 
to gays and lesbians is inappropriate and we have to address 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government and now most members who have spoken have said 
that they support the definition of marriage which is in the law, 
that of a man and a woman and to the exclusion of all others. 
We then are faced with the proposition that anybody who supports 
heterosexual marriage, to the exclusion of same sex marriages, is 
going to be labelled as a homophobic.  It is clear that anybody 
who supports heterosexual marriages will then be labelled as 
homophobic.  I want the member's reaction to that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a commercial on credit cards which says that membership 
has its privileges.  When the member considers the decisions of 
Egan, M. v H., Rosenberg, et cetera, it is clear that all of the 
privileges of marriage are no longer distinctive and 
distinguished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only thing that same sex partners do not enjoy right now are 
property rights, which can be dealt with as common law couples 
do, by contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fundamental question is this.  If there is marriage, but if 
there are no privileges and no distinction to marriage, then does 
it not just become a piece of paper?  Why is it that the 
Government of Canada, the laws of Canada and virtually everybody 
in the House support marriage with no privileges? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the first part of the 
question concerned equality.  I am paraphrasing, but my 
recollection of Aristotle is that he said equality means that all people 
are entitled to the same thing.  It is a simple definition but, 
like everything Aristotle said, it is open to interpretation and 
it has been for some three centuries.  I would also look to section 15 
of the charter of rights and freedoms in determining that 
equality does mean that people are entitled to the same treatment 
before the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think the hon. member meant this in the harshest tones 
in which he said it, that everybody who supports heterosexual 
marriages is seen as being homophobic.  I do not think that is 
true.  I know many homosexuals who support heterosexual 
marriages.  I support heterosexual marriages, as I am in one. 
However, I do not think it is fair to say that people who came to 
our wedding are homophobic, because they certainly are not.  I 
know he did not mean it in that context.  I think that requires 
some clarification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of equality, I would look to section 15 of the charter 
and I would look to the court's interpretation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise on behalf of the Progressive 
Conservative Party to take part in this debate.  The hon. member 
for Calgary Centre has brought forward an issue that raises a 
great number of questions, perhaps more questions than we will be 
able to deal with in the time allotted for this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficult aspect that I have with the motion and the wording 
of the motion is that it talks of the need to deal with this 
issue, which suggests that it is one of timeliness.  I have to 
take some umbrage with that.  I find myself agreeing with much of 
the discussion and the debate that is taking place, in particular 
when it was stated clearly by the Minister of Justice and echoed 
by other members that the definition of marriage already has 
quite a clear definition in common and civil law in this country. 
The acceptance of that reality in Canada is such that it leads 
me to question the necessity for this debate at this time, 
particularly given some of the very topical and more timely 
issues that exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know of the strife that currently exists in places like 
Yugoslavia.  We know, as well, that within our current justice 
system there is much that needs more full and open debate.  We 
know that there is a crisis on the agriculture scene in western 
Canada, where most, if not all, Reform Party members find their 
homes.  We know that tremendous challenges are being faced by our 
citizens in Atlantic Canada because of high unemployment and 
downturns in traditional industries like the fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not to say for a moment that this issue is not one of 
importance.  It is certainly one that I would suggest raises a 
great deal of emotion, which sometimes leads to extreme lines of 
thought. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1150"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although it is an important issue, and is indeed important for 
those assembled here today and for those across the country to 
reflect on, I would suggest, given the amount of time that we 
have and the issues that are currently before us, that this is 
not something in which we should become bogged down.  In 
acknowledging that marriage has very sacred and religious 
connotations and implications, and that there is always the need 
for the involvement of the church in this type of debate, there 
is also a need to acknowledge that there is a great deal of 
tolerance and clear thinking that has to be put forward before 
one draws clear legal definitions in the sand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my previous statement I said that the definition of marriage 
remains in place and intact to this time.  To suggest, as is 
presumptive in this particular motion, that this is somehow under 
attack and is an issue of panic or urgency for Canadians is a 
misrepresentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is very broad and asks for an affirmation, I 
suggest, of what already exists.  The motion restates the current 
state of the law, both common and civil.  Therefore, I question 
the nature of the motion, but I also question the motive for this 
debate.  I cannot help but suggest that it is a presumptive and 
provocative attempt to raise what is considered a very divisive 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not to undermine the importance of the issue.  There are 
many who would argue, in fact we have heard the argument today, 
that there is an erosion of social morals and that it stems from 
a decline in the institution of marriage.  I personally do not 
prescribe to that thought.  I believe that it runs much deeper 
and is far more complicated.  My friend, the previous speaker 
from the New Democratic Party, spoke very eloquently about the 
intimacy and the personal elements of marriage.  I believe that 
to be very true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion does not call for specifics.  It does not call for 
an amendment to current legislation, particularly the Criminal 
Code.  It does not speak of charter amendments.  It does not 
speak of highlighting one particular right over another.  It 
calls for the Government of Canada to acknowledge that this is an 
important issue.  I think we have been given fairly concrete and 
static assurances from the Minister of Justice in her appearance 
in the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the motion does not do is dwell on the important issues 
which, in a sense, I feel we have perhaps a higher degree of 
responsibility to respond to in a timely fashion.  We do not talk 
about jobs, health care, education, a desire for a better quality 
of life or deal with conflict where we find it.  In fact, this is 
an attempt to seek out a conflict on a moral issue.  I am afraid 
that leaders sometimes simplify issues that divide instead of 
bind our Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some day there may be a challenge to the constitutional 
definition of marriage.  We heard from a speaker today that this 
has occurred in the province of Ontario, and it may occur again. 
Again, it underscores that there is a sense of paranoia that the 
courts will completely betray us.  There have certainly been 
controversial decisions made, but they will be remedied over 
time.  There will be an opportunity for us to reflect on them and 
to make corrections when needed in this legislature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why on the last day do we find ourselves, before we are to grant 
supply to the government, discussing an issue such as this?  I 
cannot help but suggest that there is some degree of an attempt 
to raise ire and hackles and to divide individuals, not only in 
the House amongst party affiliations but around the country, for 
crass political gain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to be exercising our rights in the House of Commons 
today to raise grievances before voting on all of the money that 
the Government of Canada is going to spend in the coming year. 
To a certain degree this allotted day is a little different than 
any other day.  This day has a greater priority.  We have an 
opportunity to bring grievances to the Government of Canada. 
This is an ancient right that we can exercise in this place.  It 
is an opportunity for us to remind the government that there is a 
greater degree of accountability and responsibility that it 
should be exercising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that the government has in many ways abused the 
privileges and its relationship with parliament.  To a degree we 
know this is happening.  There is strife within the caucus of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an opportunity to send a message to the government today 
with respect to our confidence in the job that it is doing in 
representing Canadians.  One of the messages that I believe 
should be sent is that we are not having enough opportunity to 
interact directly with ministers of the crown at committee or in 
the House. 
Time and time again we see important announcements made in the 
press gallery instead of here in the House of Commons.  We have a 
very limited opportunity to interact at the committee level.  We 
have one hour wherein we might be able to pose a handful of 
questions and receive very packed, evasive, non-informative 
answers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a message that can be sent tonight with respect to the 
confidence that we have in the government when we stand in our 
place to vote.  I believe that, in and of itself, it is an 
important message which should be sent and received by the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning back specifically to the motion before the House, I do 
not profess to stand to speak for every member of the Progressive 
Conservative caucus when I say that this is a motion of 
importance which needs to be flushed out.  It is not the priority 
of the government at this time, nor should it be.  This motion is 
an attempt, I believe, to somehow give Canadians the sense that a 
crisis exists and that is simply not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that we should be having consultations.  I am sure the 
mover of this motion has heard from his constituents.  I know 
that in my constituency of Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough there 
are many who have very strong and very reasonable attachments to 
the institution of marriage.  That is fine.  That is the way it 
should be.  I do not believe that the institution of marriage is 
under attack or is in jeopardy, as this motion might suggest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two very separate and distinct issues.  I believe the 
hon. member would acknowledge that the issue of financial 
security, the issue of same sex benefits accruing to partners, is 
quite separate and apart.  I do not believe the suggestion that 
one leads necessarily to the other.  The courts themselves have 
given very clear rulings.  The legislatures throughout the 
country, provincially and at the federal level, have in some 
cases led and in some cases followed.  However, I do not believe 
that in this forum, in this debate today, we are going to find 
the magical answers that will preserve or fortify the institution 
of marriage.  That is not going to be accomplished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I do not believe that the institution of marriage is in 
jeopardy.  I believe that it is going to remain a very strong and 
important institution.  When we talk of family and family 
definitions we find that traditional views of family have changed 
and they will continue to change and evolve.  That is not to say 
that they will change necessarily for the worse, where there will 
be a clear reversal of what we have traditionally viewed as 
family.  The importance of fortifying values in this country is 
recognizing what is safe, what is healthy and what is going to 
create a better citizenry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am afraid that this debate will not further that, at least not 
to the desired end.  When we have an opportunity to vote this 
evening, the Progressive Conservative Party will be voting 
individually.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I find that the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough is not too sure where he stands. 
On the one hand he is suggesting that members of the Reform Party 
are trying to create panic or are attacking.  He even used the 
word “misrepresentation”.  The member suggests that we have 
ulterior motives, that this is a divisive issue.  Yet on the 
other hand he said that this is a motion of importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member cannot have it both ways.  He is talking about jobs 
and health care.  Those are issues which we talk about every day. 
No one is suggesting that they are not important issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has to decide which way it is.  I know that he and I 
both agree on the definition of marriage, without question.  The 
member said that this motion will not fortify the institution of 
marriage.  Is the member telling us that this House of Commons 
has no influence on our courts?  We are both members of the bar. 
We know that judges look to the House of Commons, to the comments 
which were made and how we voted.  Will this not send a message 
to the courts telling them exactly where the Parliament of Canada 
stands? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Which way is it?  Is it an issue of importance or does the 
member not believe it is?  Nobody in this party is suggesting a 
panic attack.  Those are words coming out of the hon. member's 
mouth, not from the Reform Party of Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is an issue of much 
consternation, even within the member's party.  I fully 
acknowledge that decisions made in the House of Commons and in 
parliament generally will affect the current law.  They will 
change the current law in most instances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The definition of marriage and all the implications that flow 
from marriage, be it a legal definition, a moral definition or a 
person's own personal decision, will not be decided ultimately 
here.  I suggest there are constantly changing definitions and 
constantly changing views of what is and what is not traditional 
in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fine for the hon. member to suggest that we should clearly 
state that this is black and this is white, but that is not the 
case in an issue such as this one.  Try as we might to cram 
things into small packages and to paint people into a corner, I 
do not believe we will further the debate by taking that stance, 
which is classic of the Reform Party. 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
commend the hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough on 
his very cohesive and reasonable remarks regarding the issue at 
hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I happen to agree with him.  I believe the motion has been 
brought forth to be divisive, to create friction and to create a 
feeling that anyone who opposes the motion is opposed to 
heterosexual relationships, is un-Christian and all other things 
that will stir up the feelings of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have my own personal feelings about the terms of marriage. 
Just as my colleague from Sydney—Victoria stated, it is a 
spiritual relationship as well.  It does not tie into having 
children or ensuring a sexual relationship.  There is more to 
marriage than that, but I believe very strongly that the issue is 
before the House just to create friction which does not 
necessarily have to be there at a time when there are many things 
of great importance to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not that the issue is not important, not that marriage is 
not important and not that recognizing the institution of 
marriage is not important.  It is.  To suggest that anybody who 
would oppose the motion is anti-marriage, anti-heterosexual and 
pro-gay lesbian as compared to being in favour of heterosexuals 
is just crazy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is despicable that we have a party sitting in the Parliament 
of Canada which pushes that kind of let us get on gays and 
lesbians attitude.  Quite frankly that is what the Reform Party 
does when it brings forward these types of issues ahead of very 
important issues that should be before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for her comments.  I tend to agree that hot button politics are 
not needed at this time in the country.  Hopefully we will enter 
a perhaps more stable period on the political landscape.  The 
last thing we need to do is to try to find open wounds and pick 
at them.  That is not productive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of our charter and because of the way our history has 
evolved, individuals in the country have been left with many 
rights and freedoms, but they are often collective rights and 
silent majority rights that are not always heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is never difficult to find issues that inflame passions. What 
is difficult is trying to find a very tolerant and non-intrusive 
path to take that will be respective of the collective rights and 
respective of individual rights.  That is what we should be 
striving to do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is an honour to rise on this very important issue.  After 
listening to the last few speakers, I want to read something: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, it is necessary, in light of 
public debate around recent court decisions, to state that 
marriage is and should remain the union of one man and one woman 
to the exclusion of all others, and that Parliament will take all 
necessary steps to preserve this definition of marriage in 
Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how much clearer we can get than that.  We talk 
about hot button politics.  With some of the comments being made 
by the other parties in the House, I would be ashamed to be 
associated with those parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here to talk about one issue and only one issue.  That is 
the definition of marriage between one man and one woman.  I lay 
awake last night for a long time thinking about this issue.  I 
truly want to thank the hon. member for Calgary Centre for 
bringing forward the motion.  He has been a very strong person in 
support of this message and has had the courage to bring this 
very important issue before parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often in the House we get caught up, and rightly so, in raising 
our standard of living, taxes, health care and the war in Kosovo. 
We talk about those subjects hour in and hour out and sometimes 
it is my belief that we lose focus on the bigger, very important 
issues.  This is one of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been in the courts as a member of the bar.  Judges are 
always shaping the law of the land.  The law of the land has been 
by no means static.  It is very dynamic.  It changes over time. 
When judges make their rulings it is very important to them that 
they look at where the legislatures and the parliament of the 
country stand on various issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite often lawyers presenting cases will refer to 
<I>Hansard</I>.  We have seen in recent court decisions where the 
courts interpret a variety of issues.  In British Columbia this 
year a judge ruled that possession of child pornography is not a 
crime in Canada.  Of course the country was immediately outraged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a case where parliament has an opportunity to send a 
very clear message, and it is painfully simple, on where the 
Parliament of Canada stands on the definition of marriage. 
Parliament is the supreme lawmaker of Canada.  We know the 
definition of marriage in the books right now and we have an 
opportunity to reaffirm that, which I think is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many members have suggested that there is a much deeper meaning 
to what we are trying to do.  I want to talk about that deeper 
meaning.  I want to go deep inside this definition and this 
motion to what we are trying to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After spending hours thinking about this and looking at it from 
all angles, the deepest meaning I can come up with is that we are 
reaffirming the definition of marriage between one man and one 
woman.  Nothing else.  That is it.  It is painfully simple.  It 
cannot be confused with any other issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have sat in parliament for the past few years.  I appreciate 
that somebody would bring forward this motion because it is what 
really matters to Canadians.  Actually I am offended when I hear 
members of other parties trying to minimize its importance. They 
have asked what the Reform Party is doing.  They have said that 
this law is on the books and have asked why it is wasting time 
and why it has come forward with this meaningless motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some 85 members of the House of Commons, or almost one-third, 
have tabled petitions on the definition of marriage containing 
hundreds of thousands of signatures.  I cannot recall another 
issue in which so many Canadian people have believed so strongly 
that they wanted to send a message and table that many petitions. 
I have seen members table petitions that are inches high.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am truly offended by members who suggest that this is not an 
important issue to Canadians; that it does not deserve time in 
parliament; that it does not deserve members of the House taking 
a stand and sending an unequivocal, clear message to all of 
Canada, to all the courts and to all members of the bar that this 
is where the House of Commons stands on this issue.  There is 
nothing deeper than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard the Minister of Justice say that she will support 
it, but to suggest that this is not an important issue is to have 
missed the mark.  I emphasize the number of signatures.  How much 
plainer and simpler can we get than this definition?  There are 
no other issues.  There is no hidden agenda, absolutely nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Your nose is growing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I heard a member on the other 
side say my nose is growing.  It is ridiculous to even suggest 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one agenda.  I say that sincerely, with all my heart. 
In all my discussions with my colleagues in the Reform Party 
behind closed doors in our caucus, the one topic that has come up 
is the definition of marriage between a man and a woman. That is 
it and nothing else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the members cannot accept that, if they cannot accept the 
importance of that and what it means to Canadians, I believe they 
have missed something.  It is important.  As a member of the bar, 
as a lawyer, I think it is truly important that the House of 
Commons sends very clear messages to all courts.  They are 
looking for that.  Often we see our courts struggle with 
decisions because parliamentarians have not had the courage to 
make a statement; they do not want to make a statement.  The 
courts say this is an issue on which parliament should rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an opportunity for us.  I anticipate that virtually 
every member of the House will support the motion for the right 
reasons.  It states just what it does.  It is a truly important 
motion, one that I am proud to speak on, one I am proud to 
represent the constituents of Saanich—Gulf Islands on, that the 
Parliament of Canada believes that the institution of marriage 
should be preserved, that it should be between one man and one 
woman to the exclusion of all others.  We should be prepared to 
make that statement without minimizing it, without saying that it 
is not important or without saying we should not be talking about 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I truly believe it is an important issue.  It is worthy of the 
time of the House to push it to a vote to make sure that all 
officers of the courts and all the judges in the country know 
exactly where we stand on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is high time that we start sending messages to the courts on 
many other issues such as child pornography and others that we 
often do not deal with.  It is time that we take a stand so that 
the courts understand and make the definition so painfully simple 
that nobody can misinterpret it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I will read the motion one more time so that 
everyone remembers what we are talking about, because some people 
have not been able to read it: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, it is necessary, in light of 
public debate around recent court decisions, to state that 
marriage is and should remain the union of one man and one woman 
to the exclusion of all others, and that Parliament will take all 
necessary steps to preserve this definition of marriage in 
Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what the debate is about and nothing else.  Hopefully 
members have got it now. 
<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
despite the protestations of the member it is very clear to all 
in the House, and indeed to all Canadians, that the issues are 
certainly much broader than the definition of marriage and what 
constitutes marriage. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1215"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice spoke in the House earlier and confirmed 
that the motion as stated with the amendment that it is within 
the jurisdiction of the federal parliament is in fact the law of 
Canada.  The member is quite right.  The government will support 
the motion on the basis that the government is defending the laws 
of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member will also well know of the supreme court decisions. 
In the Egan decision there was the concept of permitted 
discrimination with regard to survivor benefits.  In the 
Rosenberg decision and in M. v H. the Supreme Court of Canada 
raised a number of issues.  In fact it has painted parliament 
into a corner to act and in the absence of acting the courts will 
make those decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is one of the reasons the discussions are going on now about 
whether or not there should be an omnibus bill to deal with all 
of the items pursuant to those court decisions, rather than 
approach them as we did with Bill C-78. Despite the protestations 
of the member it is very clear that there is a much broader issue 
on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the member has to do with the concept of 
discrimination.  If the Government of Canada, and I believe it 
will, supports the definition in the existing laws and as 
repeated in the motion, does the hon. member believe that 
constitutes discrimination in favour of heterosexual couples or 
is it discrimination against those who do not fit that 
definition? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know the Minister of 
Justice introduced an amendment.  It is unfortunate that she does 
not understand the standing orders of parliament.  There is a 
standing order that says that all motions before this House can 
only be for the purview or the jurisdiction of the Parliament of 
Canada. That goes without saying. That is why it was not in our 
original motion.  In the House we can only debate anything within 
the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada. That is an 
automatic and a given. It did not need to be stated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the hon. member's comments on discrimination, 
there is no discrimination.  We are only reaffirming the 
definition of marriage.  Members can talk about all of the other 
issues. I will state on the record that I know and I have worked 
with many people who are homosexual.  I have no problem with 
that.  That is not the issue. It is not an issue about sexuality. 
This is an issue strictly about the definition of marriage.  I 
personally do not discriminate against any of those people. I am 
quite happy to state that on the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is where the members of the House want to take this 
discussion which is very unfortunate, as opposed to talking about 
what it really and truly is and that is reaffirming that the 
definition of marriage is between one man and one woman to the 
exclusion of all others. We need to send that message out in 
light of recent court decisions and court interpretations.  They 
are not getting a clear direction from parliament and it is high 
time they did.  We do it on many other issues so that the courts 
know exactly where the Parliament of Canada stands. The Canadian 
people have elected us to make those statements in the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want some feedback from the hon. member on the issue that was 
raised by the Conservative Party member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.  He seemed to be making the 
case that this was not an issue that needed much attention, that 
perhaps we were misusing a supply day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have noticed that the Conservative member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough has been a regular presenter of 
petitions on this very same subject, along with 84 other members 
of the House.  There have been hundreds and hundreds of 
petitions, thousands and thousands of names of petitioners 
calling for the definition of marriage to be defended by the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have also noticed a number of headlines recently across the 
country pertaining to recent court decisions about this.  I too 
think it is troubling that in the House of Commons we are having 
to debate this issue which seems to be a no brainer for most 
Canadians.  I ask my hon. colleague what he thinks about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is very obvious.  There 
are five official parties in the House. Members of every single 
have presented petitions on this issue.  Almost a third of the 
members of the House have presented petitions with hundreds of 
thousands of signatures.  The member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough less than one year ago, last 
June, presented a petition in the House regarding this 
definition. 
To suggest that it is not an important issue is an insult to 
every single person, every single Canadian who signed those 
petitions and all other Canadians who believe in this issue.

is a pleasure to address this issue today.  I want to commend the 
member for Calgary Centre for leading the debate on this issue 
for the Reform Party and also the member for Saanich—Gulf 
Islands for an excellent speech. I want to pick up where he left 
off and say that this is not about hot button politics.  We heard 
that from the member for Churchill and seconded in a way by the 
member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.  That is ridiculous. 
Every day Canadians contact their members of parliament about 
this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Millions of Canadians currently live in the institution of 
marriage.  We all come from the union of a man and a woman at 
some point.  This is not something that is foreign to people. 
This is something that is part of everyday life.  We are simply 
taking the time to address an extraordinarily important issue in 
the Parliament of Canada where it should be addressed, not 
necessarily only exclusively in courtrooms or in public debate in 
the newspapers or in human rights commissions.  This should be 
debated in what is supposed to be of all places the most 
democratic chamber in the country, in the House of Commons. That 
is exactly what we are taking the opportunity to do today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend my colleague from Calgary Centre for really pushing 
this issue.  I think it is extraordinarily important. I want to 
answer some of the objections I have heard today from various 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard the justice minister suggest that somehow this is a 
frivolous debate, that it is trivial.  I point out that we have 
had 84 petitions delivered in this parliament on this issue 
alone. Thousands and thousands of Canadians have signalled to 
this parliament that they are very concerned about this issue and 
they want it addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want parliament to state unequivocally that it 
believes the definition of marriage, the traditional definition, 
should be maintained and that we should affirm it.  We should 
send a strong message to the courts that we believe in this 
traditional definition of marriage.  It is a definition that has 
been passed down over the ages, a definition that I suppose goes 
back to the time before there were legislatures, before there 
were courts, back into the mists of prehistory.  People around 
the world settled on this relationship, the union of one man and 
one woman as a privileged relationship.  We need to affirm it. 
That is what we are doing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ask our colleagues across the way to not be cowed by people 
who suggest that this is somehow hot button politics.  This is an 
important issue.  It should be dealt with in the Parliament of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reject what the Minister of Justice was saying.  I think the 
Minister of Justice too often hides behind the robes of the 
supreme court and behind the robes of provincial courts. I think 
it is time that she showed leadership and we are giving her a 
chance to do that today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply want to point out that the courts are very 
unpredictable.  Many court decisions have overturned what we 
thought was the common law, the common wisdom of the ages.  My 
colleague from Saanich—Gulf Islands pointed out that recently a 
court in B.C. threw out the law against child pornography in 
Canada.  That is alarming to me and to many other Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When all kinds of debates are going on in the courts today with 
respect to other institutions which we thought were protected in 
the common law, institutions like the traditional definition of 
what constitutes a spouse in common law relationships, Canadians 
become alarmed.  They start to say that they are concerned that 
somehow this is going to end up with the courts determining that 
marriage is something else other than what it has always been 
defined to be.  That concerns them and it concerns me as somebody 
who represents those people. That is why we are speaking out on 
this issue today.

been absolutely inane?  I would argue many times.  I remember the 
lead-up to the referendum in 1995.  Over that whole period we 
never did debate the issue of national unity.  In that whole time 
there was never a debate on that, but we debated whether or not 
Canada should have a national horse.  That was worthy of debate 
in this place for some reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are talking about an institution that is one of the 
foundations of civil society and somehow people are suggesting 
that it is not really that important, “Why do we want to mention 
that?  Some people will feel badly about that”.  I say that is 
too bad.  That is the job of parliamentarians, to deal with these 
issues even if they are controversial so that they are not 
determined or settled by somebody else.  We are elected to do 
that job.  We are paid well to do it.  Let us do it.  That is 
what we are saying today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to address some of the comments that came from members of 
the NDP.  The member for Vancouver East suggested that marriage 
as traditionally defined discriminates against same sex couples. 
I have news for the member for Vancouver East.  Does she realize 
that homosexual couples by the very definition of what that means 
discriminate against heterosexuals?  Maybe by definition but the 
definition itself tells us about the very essence of what it is 
we are talking about.  It is not discrimination.  It is simply a 
definition that tells us what constitutes a marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gay couples can have their own relationships.  They can call 
them what they will.  There are other relationships. Friendships 
are called friendships.  They are not the same thing.  That does 
not mean it is discrimination.  It means that they are all 
different and they describe different circumstances.  That is all 
it means.  It has nothing to do with discrimination.  I reject 
that as another red herring.  It is an obvious attempt to take us 
down a whole other path and get us embroiled in this whole debate 
about what constitutes discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must address some of the comments by the member for 
Burnaby—Douglas which I say are laughable.  They were ridiculous 
comments.  My friend from Calgary Centre pointed out that in a 
same sex relationship one of the genders is missing.  What did 
the member for Burnaby—Douglas say?  He said that was an 
appalling attack.  He went on and on and tried to raise the 
temperature in here.  He somehow suggested this was 
discrimination.  It is a fact.  If it is a same sex relationship, 
one of the sexes is missing.  It is pretty clear.  It is by 
definition the case.  It is not discrimination. It is a fact. 
Hello over there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the member for Burnaby—Douglas that it is time to quit 
playing this game of hot button politics, to use the rhetoric 
coming from the other side, and to address the issue.  The issue 
is whether or not parliament wants to affirm the traditional 
definition of marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was also an objection from our friend from 
Sydney—Victoria who spoke rather temperately on this issue.  I 
applaud him for his remarks.  He said that this is an issue of 
provincial jurisdiction, that there is a lot of overlap and that 
really the federal government does not have as big a role to play 
as we might suggest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say right off the top that no party, with the possible 
exception of the Bloc, supports the upholding of provincial 
jurisdiction more than this party does, but it is pretty clear in 
the constitution that the federal government does have a very 
important role to play when it comes to the issue of marriage. 
That role is to determine who has the capacity to marry.  That is 
determined by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to weigh in on this.  We cannot wait for the provinces 
and certainly not for the courts to decide on it.  We have a 
constitutional obligation to be involved in this and to send a 
message to the courts.  The courts have often asked that 
parliament send a clear message.  That is precisely what we are 
proposing to do today.  That is what I say to my friend from 
Sydney—Victoria.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will wrap up with a comment to the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough who said that this is an issue of 
hot button politics.  He presented a petition in this place a 
year ago saying that we must uphold the traditional definition of 
marriage as the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion 
of all others.  He spoke on behalf of his constituents at that 
point.  I would argue that he did a very important thing when he 
did that.  I trust he thinks he did something important as well. 
If he is going to be consistent, then he has to admit and concur 
in the debate today because this is an important issue to all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage my friends across the way to vote in favour of the 
motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK73"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am glad the member encourages the government to support the 
motion.  The Minister of Justice, who spoke earlier today, 
announced that the government will support the motion because it 
reaffirms the existing laws of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member spoke strongly about making the point that the debate 
today was not trivial, and I concur.  The fact is that laws of 
Canada have been changed pursuant to supreme court decisions. If 
parliament does not reaffirm its position on fundamental tenets, 
then it is clear that the courts will always have that 
opportunity.  We have to keep reminding the courts of the 
principles which the supreme parliament holds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is often said in some advertising that membership has its 
privileges and its rights.  In marriage there are certain rights 
extended in our Income Tax Act, in our pension programs, et 
cetera.  In fact, after reading the press, it appears that the 
only privilege that same sex partners do not have that married 
couples have is property rights under family law.  Therefore, if 
a same sex couple enters into a contract with regard to property 
rights, the rights and privileges of membership are all there in 
hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of a sudden it appears to me that marriage has rights and 
privileges, but can we turn that around?  If I have all the 
rights and privileges, or can effectively achieve all those 
rights and privileges, then why is it that I cannot be called 
marriage? This is the dilemma that the House has to deal with. It 
appears that the House and parliament does discriminate, but it 
discriminates in favour.  It is affirmative discrimination of the 
family and of heterosexual couples.  I want the member's 
comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, of course it is true that 
there is an exclusivity about marriage as we traditionally define 
it, which means that all other relationships are outside of that 
institution.  I do not believe that constitutes discrimination, 
at least not in the most negative sense that the opponents of 
this point of view would use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think no matter what we do on this issue, it has to come 
before this place.  It is ridiculous to see these decisions being 
made so often today by the courts.  Ultimately, the courts cannot 
establish the mores of the country.  That has to come from the 
people.  We, as their representatives, have to give voice to 
that.  Those decisions should be made here in a free and open 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend mentioned that the government will support the motion. 
If my friend is an independent parliamentarian, I am surprised to 
hear him say that the government will decide that.  I would 
expect that individual MPs will make these decisions for 
themselves.  That is typically what happens in a free parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I appreciate that this is probably what will happen, I 
simply want to point out that in a sense he is saying that no 
matter what the minister said, he would be going along with it. I 
hope that is not the case.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to address the question submitted to us by 
the official opposition, namely the conditions for a marriage to 
be valid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that our friends over there are particularly concerned 
that nothing be done to change the existing law, particularly 
the rule that marriage may be contracted solely by two persons 
of the opposite sex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I would like to address this question within the very 
specific context of our government's initiative, which dates 
back several years now, aimed at making federal legislation and 
regulations fully compatible with the civil law of the province 
of Quebec, the province in which I was elected.  The government 
considered, and continues to believe, that it is important to 
take the necessary steps to ensure that this valuable Canadian 
aspect of bijuralism is reflected in fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is bijuralism?  It is the term that has been used for some 
time to describe a situation that has existed in Canada since 
the passage of the Quebec Act of 1774, namely the co-existence 
within one territory, Canada, of two contemporary legal 
traditions, the British-inspired common law, and the 
Roman-inspired civil law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1994, the year in which the new Quebec Civil Code, adopted 
in 1991, came into effect, during the reign of Quebec Minister 
of Justice Gil Rémillard, the Minister of Justice for Canada 
carried out numerous preliminary studies on thirty or so complex 
issues, with a view to best ensuring compatibility between 
federal laws and the new Civil Code.  It is important to note 
that this reform affected more than 80% of the rules in the 
Civil Code of Lower Canada, which had been in effect up until 
then, and dated back to 1866. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government then proceeded to hire experienced legal 
experts as well as engaging the services of a number of 
professors of law and other experts.  These were consulted then, 
and will be again now, on the numerous questions raised by such 
an undertaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to set the stage, let us say that of the 700 laws in 
the body of federal statutes, over 300 will have to be amended 
in the coming years to ensure compliance with the distinctive 
nature of Quebec's civil law, in both letter and spirit, of all 
the laws passed by this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most difficult questions the civil code section of 
the federal Department of Justice had to examine involves 
pre-confederation provisions, that is, those passed by the 
legislature of United Canada prior to Confederation. Although 
this is only one of the 30 studies released by the federal 
department in relation to its work, it is interesting to note 
that it concerns much more legally complex subjects, which have 
up to now been essentially not tackled.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Constitution Act, 1867, gives parliament the 
legislative authority over marriage conditions, the government 
had to give some thought to the impact of repealing some 300 
sections of the civil code of Lower Canada dating from 1866 in a 
whole range of areas, including the one that we are concerned 
with today and to the way to ensure the necessary legal 
continuity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another basic principle of the long job undertaken by the civil 
code section of the Department of Justice is to not change 
existing law except to the extent and only when harmonization 
with civil law requires it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's legal minds have therefore had to analyse the question 
of repealing some dozen sections of the civil code of Lower 
Canada on marriage in order to decide whether they should be 
re-enacted and if so, how. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The institution of marriage is historically, as I said earlier 
in my short history lesson, culturally and by definition a 
heterosexual institution.  In Quebec, a fundamental condition of 
a valid marriage has always been that the two people involved are 
of the opposite sex.  That condition is inherent in the very 
institution of marriage. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its 1994 Civil Code, the Quebec legislature restated the rule 
whereby only a man and a woman may enter into marriage.  This 
rule can be found in article 365 of the Civil Code of Quebec. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is also reflective of the state of the law in all other 
Canadian jurisdictions.  This is also part of the reason why we 
moved an amendment this morning to make the difference between 
the federal and provincial jurisdictions. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opinions of our experts led us to propose a number of 
substitute clauses in Bill C-50, four of which have to do with 
marriage.  These clauses concern age, consent of the partners, 
and dissolution of marriage, and ensure that enforcement of 
these provisions is limited to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that this work has involved broad 
consultations with associations of jurists in Quebec, i.e. the 
Quebec bar, the Chambre des notaires, and the Quebec chapter of 
the Canadian Bar Association, as well as the Quebec justice 
department.  These learned bodies have all had an opportunity to 
examine the provisions of Bill C-50, including those having to do 
with marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, representations were made to us by the Quebec justice 
department, urging us to use the wording of article 365 of the 
Civil Code of Quebec in clause 4 of the bill, so that 
harmonization of the applicable rules would be as consistent as 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can therefore see that all necessary precautions have been 
taken by government legal experts to ensure that the rule of 
law, which is well established in our country with respect to 
what constitutes a spouse, is not inadvertently changed. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has taken all the necessary steps in Bill C-50 to 
ensure that the current definition of marriage in our society 
would be implemented in a uniform manner across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to respond to comments made by opposition members. 
If the government has never expressed any intention to change the 
legal definition of marriage, then what is the point of the 
Reform Party's motion?  That is really the question today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a parliamentary secretary, I have often been privy to matters 
in the House dealing with justice issues. I see the Reform Party 
as unfortunately attempting to continue to either spread fear or 
to pit, which is more dangerous, Canadians against each other. I 
see it as a divisiveness in terms of pitting same sex partners 
against heterosexual partners or pitting Canadians of other 
origins against other Canadians.  This constant attempt to divide 
society has to be one of the most despicable things that I have 
heard in the House and, in my opinion, it continues with the 
motion.  It constantly tries to make and score political points 
by confusing the issue.

put that on the record this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask Canadians who are listening to this debate to ask the 
question of themselves:  Why was the motion brought forward in 
the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be sharing my time with the member for Mississauga South. 
<P><A NAME="LINK76"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to about 95% of not a bad presentation and then the last 
5% got a little crazy, I think. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have received over 100 phone calls in my constituency office 
in the last two days in support of this motion and in support of 
what we are doing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are concerned about this because of the confusion that 
has been created by recent rulings.  It is not clear to people 
where parliament stands on this issue and for the member to say 
it is irresponsible for us to bring the issue to this place is 
not acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It's cheap politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson:</B>  That's wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that Canadian people are concerned.  There is no 
other issue on which I have received this many phone calls from 
people in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to Canadians that this be discussed and that 
parliament reaffirm that the definition of marriage as it exists 
is the one we will stand by. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am also a member of 
parliament and I also receive phone calls.  A lot of time those 
phone calls are made because Canadians are misinformed.  I would 
like to say that they are misinformed by the fact that these 
types of motions are brought forward.  They lead to confusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, people want to know where the government stands.  I am not 
debating the fact that we should not have a definition of 
marriage.  As the minister said, there is a definition of 
marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentary secretary I have been privy to a lot of 
discussions in the House about the role of the judiciary, the 
role of the rule of law in the country, something which I believe 
Her Majesty's Official Opposition has never respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member made a comment earlier about the minister hiding 
behind robes.  That is a totally irresponsible comment, that the 
Minister of Justice should not respect a decision made by the 
highest court of the land, the Supreme Court of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  The rule of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B>  The rule of law has never been 
respected, unfortunately, and every time we want to change a 
decision made by the highest court we turn to parliament.  This 
is not a police state where the government runs the courts; this 
is quite the opposite.  We respect the courts.  That is what the 
government has shown.  That has not been the intent of Her 
Majesty's Official Opposition. 
<P><A NAME="LINK77"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the member's position.  I do not agree with it, but I 
appreciate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Really what we are trying to do, and I want to help her 
understand it, is assist the government in showing some 
leadership on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The courts themselves have asked for direction from this House 
on these issues.  I am referring to a case in Ontario in which a 
judge said “The fact that there was a dissenting opinion in this 
case”, which was a case having to do with marriage, “indicates 
that there is indeed confusion about whether marriage could be 
between people who are not of the opposite sex.  Again, there is 
a need for parliament to show leadership and give guidance on the 
issue”.  Those were the words of the judge.  The courts are 
looking to the House to give direction on these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the Liberal government intend for spouse to be redefined as 
the courts have done?  We do not know.  Is it going to wait for 
the courts to redefine marriage or will it step up to the 
leadership role that people expect of it and which the courts are 
calling for? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not think anybody 
has said in the House that we want to stifle debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a pattern created, whenever a decision has been 
by the highest court of the land, that Her Majesty's Official 
Opposition chooses, when it dislikes that decision, to ask that 
parliament act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that is the role of parliament.  The role of 
parliament is to ensure that we have the best legal minds in the 
country to interpret the type of legislation that is adopted by 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will repeat what the minister said this morning.  There was 
never any intention by the government to redefine marriage.

is my feeling that the highest court of the land is the 
Parliament of Canada.  I wonder if the hon. member would disagree 
or agree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the highest court of 
the land, if we are talking about the Supreme Court of Canada, is 
a place that we should all respect.  I dare to say that often in

that we have in the Supreme Court of Canada given by Her

<P><A NAME="LINK79"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this morning when I watched the news a representative of a 
particular group said “It is sad that parliament will be 
debating the continued discrimination against a certain group of 
people”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I came into the lobby this morning and a staff member walked in. 
It was quite quiet in the lobby.  The staff member made a comment 
to the effect that “The motion today is about marriage.  Boy is 
that boring and inconsequential”.  It is neither boring nor 
trivial.  In fact it is a very important motion.  It comes down 
to some fundamentals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I often hear in this place talk about the broader issue, which 
no one wants to mention, about the proverbial line in the sand. 
The line in the sand, apparently, for many has to do with 
marriage.  That is the line in the sand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Policy by its very nature is discriminatory.  It has to be 
discriminatory.  Otherwise we would not need laws to identify who 
is included and who is out, who gets benefits and who does not. 
Policy by its very definition, by its very nature, is 
discriminatory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To say that is to raise the issue of the context of 
discrimination.  Earlier I spoke about the definition of 
discrimination.  It is clear that if we look to many sources we 
will see that discrimination has negative connotations, 
prejudice, bias, victimization and so on.  It also has the 
connotations of distinguishing between groups or favouring or 
identifying distinctive characteristics.  There are other 
applications.  In our laws we have many forms of discrimination 
which discriminate in favour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will highlight a couple of examples.  On the income tax return 
for Canada there is a line for old age security.  We get it 
because we are 65.  It is age discrimination.  It is in the 
charter of rights that we cannot discriminate on the basis of 
age, but we do discriminate because if a person is 65 they 
receive old age security.  It is discrimination in favour of 
seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is someone not here saying that we all have to be equal? 
Should we not all be equal? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about disability benefits?  There is discrimination in 
favour of those who are disabled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of provisions for things such as investment 
income.  A couple can pool their income.  One can invest all of 
theirs and declare all the income.  A single person with a 
partner cannot do that.  There is discrimination on the basis of 
recognized partnership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alimony is another example.  Another is registered pension 
plans, RRSPs.  We can buy a spousal RRSP which can be rolled over 
upon death.  These are all discriminatory in favour of a 
particular group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at child care expenses, we discriminate in favour of 
those situations in which both persons in the union are working. 
They receive a deduction, which is not available to those 
families who have one spouse providing direct parental care.  It 
is discrimination, but it is discrimination in favour of 
something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that point I look back at history.  It was brought in 
initially to take care of the situation of lone parents, because 
of that unique situation where there was hardship.  It was a 
social benefit.  It was not an employment expense.  There is a 
debate on that as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an age for the non-refundable tax credit.  When a 
person is 65 they receive it.  There is the Canada pension plan, 
the transferability of tuition fees and education amounts. I 
could go on and on.  That is simply from the Income Tax Act. We 
could imagine how many examples there are in our system of 
taxation and of benefits which are discriminatory by their 
nature.  They are discriminatory at the discretion of parliament, 
reflecting the social values and the will of the Canadian people.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not talk about discrimination solely in the context of 
a negative.  I think it is important for the House to stop using 
the word discrimination and start talking about valuing.  How do 
we value things? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard members of the NDP today, from Burnaby—Douglas, 
Churchill and Vancouver East, all demand that we need equality 
among people.  The equality they are seeking is equality of 
individuals.  NDP members are asking for the equality of 
individuals as represented by the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms and our constitution.  They want individuals to be the 
lowest common denominator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone should be treated the same, but the issue is, if we are 
going to treat everyone the same in regard to the context of this 
debate, it will then lead to the question of how we treat 
everyone with regard to all of our other tax laws and policies. 
Should we not treat everyone the same?  Should we not reduce 
ourselves to the lowest common denominator?  Should we not just 
be a vanilla society?  Should we not just say that relationships 
do not exist in our laws?  Why do we not just say that we are all 
individuals?  There is a very good reason.  It is because we are 
a society and a society, by definition, is more than a collection 
of individuals.  There is a synergy in a society.  There are 
certain things that happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some will object to my doing this, but I want to note that the 
Archbishop of Toronto, Cardinal Aloysius Ambrozic, wrote a letter 
concerning Bill C-78, which, as members know, has something to do 
with this issue.  He talked about the family.  We have not talked 
about the family yet and whether we put the family on a pedestal 
because the family has an important role to play.  I would throw 
in that there is one definition of family that we all have in 
common, which is a child with a biological mother and a 
biological father.  That is the family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Cardinal referred to the family.  He said “They and their 
children constitute the family—the original cell of social 
life”.   He quoted Pope John Paul II: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In their primary mission of communicating love to each other, of 
being co-creators with God of human life, and of transmitting the 
love of God to their children, parents must know that they are 
fully supported by the Church and by society. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here representing the interests of that society, not a 
collection of individuals.  In fact we are also here very 
delicately trying to defend the family, trying to defend that 
fundamental basic unit of society without which we would cease to 
exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a special role.  It is the procreative role that a 
couple has, a man and a woman.  It is that role which we hold 
very dear, which we put on a pedestal, of which we discriminate 
in favour.  It is why we have spousal benefits, spousal 
transfers, survivor benefits and all kinds and manners of 
benefits for the family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge anyone in this place to look at history, at the 
debate on all of those items on which some would say there is 
discrimination, to find one example of anybody who suggested that 
the reason it was being done was to be detrimental to some other 
group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debates underlying the laws of Canada are clear that 
discrimination within our system is affirmative discrimination. 
We discriminate to reflect values.  If we did not do that then it 
would be a vanilla society.  It would be a society which has no 
values, no vision for a millennium, nothing to pass on other than 
we are all individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue here also has to do with the courts.  Some believe 
that the courts have made law to the exclusion of parliament. 
Some believe that the courts have gone too far, that the pendulum 
has swung too far.  Some are calling for parliament to stop the 
pendulum and to revisit this issue.  Are we going to 
discriminate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very definition of marriage, to the exclusion of all others, 
which has been part of British common law since 1866, is 
discrimination:  “to the exclusion of all others”.  However, it 
is affirmative discrimination on behalf of the Canadian people 
who value and cherish and have great pride and joy in the 
Canadian family.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
to comment on the lowest common denominator.  I am sad to say the 
member for Mississauga South sort of reached the lowest common 
denominator by suggesting that the only recognition of family in 
Canada is of a biological father, a biological mother and a 
child.  That certainly might be his narrow minded vision of a 
family, but I would suggest a great many families out there are 
not biological children or biological parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have recognized over the years that the definition of 
family needs to go beyond biological mother and father.  Part of 
the reason for that is that families of biological mothers, 
fathers and children have not always been perfect.  The 
relationships among those families have not been perfect. Because 
of the imperfections, families do not stay together as biological 
mothers, fathers and children.  Changes have to be made. The 
numbers were great enough that there was an understanding among 
Canadians that family could not just be considered in that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to say once again that the term marriage 
should be all that it is, but it is quite clear to me that the 
Reform Party and the member for Mississauga South have an 
underlying agenda.  It is not just the term marriage.  They are 
talking about Canadians rehashing the whole issue of whether or 
not same sex relationships should have any benefits and any 
recognition.  That should not be the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I believe the member 
misheard me.  I did not say the exclusive and only definition of 
family is child with biological mother and biological father.  If 
the member would check the blues, she would see that I said that 
there is one definition which we all have in common.  I bring 
that to the attention of the member.  It is different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to another agenda, I raised the points not to stir 
up the pot, as it were, but rather to suggest that the definition 
of marriage is discriminatory in favour of heterosexual couples. 
It is affirmative discrimination.  Some are suggesting that 
affirmative discrimination is okay.  Others are suggesting that 
discrimination against same sex couples is negative and should be 
thrown out.  There is a debate pointer. 
<P><A NAME="LINK81"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
like the member for Mississauga South, I attended the last 
Liberal Party of Canada annual convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard earlier the Minister of Justice say that this was not 
an issue, that it was redundant.  I have the Liberal talking 
points put together by some nameless hack which say that if the 
government has never expressed any intention to change the legal 
definition of marriage then what is the point of Reform's motion 
and that clearly it is just part of a continuing attempt to fear 
monger, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was at the last Liberal Party convention as was the member. I 
remember a resolution being passed by the Liberal Party of Canada 
which strongly urged the federal government to recognize same sex 
marriages in the same way that it recognizes opposite marriages 
in its distribution of benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member comment on the remarks of the attorney 
general that this is not a relevant point when her own party, the 
party of which he is a member, voted to change the definition we 
are seeking to uphold through the motion today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member will know even 
from his own party that the party membership passes resolutions, 
many of which are in contradiction to each other.  They do not 
form government policy.  They are there on an advisory or on a 
discussion basis.  They are not binding on the party, and the 
member will know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take the opportunity to point out that I think the debate 
should take on a view or a focus which talks about what we value. 
We have to talk about being for things and not against things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my speech I tried to identify that there are certain things 
we value in society such as healthy stable families with children 
who provide the future of society.  Those things should be valued 
to the exclusion of others simply because of the most special 
role the family provides.  I support them and I discriminate in 
favour of the family. 
<P><A NAME="LINK82"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West—Nepean, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I must very respectfully disagree with my colleague and 
his definition of family. 
Frankly my husband and I are family whether we do or do not have 
children living with us or whether we ever had children living 
with us.  His narrow definition is one I do not accept.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will repeat the same 
answer I gave to the other member.  I did not define the family 
exclusively and that is it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said very clearly, and I will repeat it again, that there is 
one definition of family that we all have in common.  For 
everyone on the face of the earth the common denominator is a 
child with biological mother and biological father. That is not 
speculation.  That is not some wild idea.  That is a fact. 
<P><A NAME="LINK83"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to enter into the debate today on the issue of 
marriage and its importance to society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we get into things such as definitions, the roles of 
marriages and families and so on, we should withdraw a bit from 
some of the debate and reflect upon the joyous state of marriage 
which many people enjoy and covet in a free society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally speaking, I just celebrated my 24th wedding 
anniversary.  I often say that the years I spent before I was 
married were the only wasted years of my life.  Since then it has 
been pretty good.  What we are debating today is: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of the House, it is necessary, in light of 
public debate around recent court decisions, to state that 
marriage is and should remain the union of one man and one woman 
to the exclusion of all others, and that Parliament will take all 
necessary steps to preserve this definition of marriage in 
Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason it is a delight to have the motion before us today is 
that it affirms marriage.  It does not say that it is against 
anything.  It does not say that we belittle other relationships, 
but there is only one marriage.  A marriage is the union of a man 
and a woman as recognized by the state.  It may be a church 
wedding.  It may be a common law wedding.  It may be a justice of 
the peace.  The fact is that a marriage is a union of a man and a 
woman, and a glorious union that is.  Again we are affirming that 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking parliament to step up to the voting line to say 
where it stands on the issue.  We have read a lot in the press 
about different court decisions and about different positions in 
response to petitions.  We have heard comments from different 
parties about their reluctance to agree and so on.  Now is the 
opportunity to step up, as we will do that later this evening, to 
say whether we in favour of this, yes or no.  It will be my 
pleasure to step up to say this is the definition of marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone earlier asked about the definition of family.  Our party 
has defined it but not loosely.  It is pretty easy to define 
family.  Family is those people who are related by blood, 
marriage or adoption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is a single mom with some kids a family?  Yes, by blood.  What 
if she adopted a couple of kids?  By all means.  What about a 
single father?  Of course.  Those are families, and we recognize 
that.  Our party recognizes that and affirms that they play an 
important role in society.  That is another great debate.  Today 
we are affirming that marriage is a union of one man and one 
woman as recognized by the state.  That is what this is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should we bother with this debate?  I believe the courts and 
society in general look to parliament to set the pace and the 
agenda not only for legislation and human rights tribunals but 
also for the courts.  The courts often state that they are 
looking to parliament and legislatures for guidance on issues 
like definitions contained or not contained in legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I gave a speech about the supreme court in my home riding a 
while ago, I mentioned that some people were exasperated, with 
some justification, with how pervasive rulings had become and how 
much they influenced society and parliament.

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I agreed there was cause for concern, I said that the 
greater concern was weak-kneed, yellow-bellied legislators who do 
not have the courage to step up and say what needs to be said in 
legislation.  They should step up to the batter's box and tell 
the supreme court not to worry about a definition in the 
immigration law or in the spousal benefits law or in whatever law 
it might be because we will give it to them.  We are not afraid 
of it because we had a good debate on it, took a vote on it, and 
Canadians through their House of Commons decided and gave 
direction to the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people get annoyed with the supreme court I ask them to 
pause for a second.  While they may be annoyed with the supreme 
court, they are also annoyed with legislatures and legislators 
that do not do their job in this place and in provincial 
legislatures across the country.  That is where we should expect 
good, intelligent debate and where decisions should be made and 
carried to the courts, not the other way around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next point is allowing Canadians to be heard on the subject. 
I debated with the member for Burnaby—Douglas this morning on 
<I>Canada A.M.</I>.  He was proposing that God be removed from the 
constitution.  I took the opposing view and we had a debate back 
and forth about whether or not it should happen.  The only thing 
we agreed on was the need to have and to allow good debate on a 
controversial topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He may want to remove it.  More power to him, if he can convince 
somebody.  Personally I think an overwhelming majority of 
Canadians would agree with my position.  Whatever, the place to 
debate controversial subjects is not in the back rooms of a 
courthouse.  By all means bring it here for Canadians to discuss 
in their House of Commons.  We should not be afraid of any of 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At one time I had an experience with the unique position of 
marriage as opposed to common law.  It was at a funeral held for 
a solider, a constituent of mine who was killed during a land 
mine exercise in Bosnia.  He married the lady of his dreams just 
before he went there.  They had a ceremony.  He went over there 
and he was killed in a land mine accident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember his commanding officer saying to me that it was 
fortunate the couple had married before he went away because now 
they could help her.  They could look after her.  They could 
extend the open arms of friendship, which any human being would 
do for another human being, but because of the unique marriage 
relationship it would not involve a two year waiting period or a 
court case.  There was a marriage certificate.  I do not know 
whether it was a civil or a religious ceremony.  It did not 
matter because the marriage ceremony brought with it a sanctity 
recognized by this place about the important role of marriage in 
that the survivor would receive survivor benefits from the 
Canadian Armed Forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a very emotional ceremony during which the colonel 
pointed out the unique role of marriage in society.  We could 
leave that funeral and say to one another that at least she would 
be well looked after, at least by being married they had sent a 
message to Canada and in return our Canadian parliament said that 
it respected that and would help her in her time of loss in a 
material way, a small way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thrilled that we can talk about something as positive as 
marriage today, that we can affirm it and the role of this place. 
There are other legitimate relationships of all kinds, but today 
we are talking about marriage and the need to preserve that 
definition.  I am glad the Minister of Justice has said she also 
agrees with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us put aside other relationships and their importance for 
another debate on another day, but on this day Canadian 
parliamentarians will stand to be counted on the definition of 
marriage and talk about the positive, important role of marriage 
in society.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened 
very carefully to the member's excellent speech.  In my point of 
view, marriage is not just a contract between a man and a woman, 
it is more than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been married for 29 years.  When my wife and I entered 
into our marriage, we made a commitment to each other that we 
would share good and bad things for the rest of our lives.  More 
than that, to me as a Roman Catholic, marriage is a holy 
sacrament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask my hon. colleague, how has marriage expanded in his view, 
not only as a contract, but from the spiritual side?  How would 
he look at it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is an excellent 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the purposes of this debate I talked about the technical 
definition of marriage, which is the union of a man and a woman 
as recognized by the state.  In other words the state recognizes 
that there can be a civil ceremony with a justice of the peace 
and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the member is talking about of course is a church wedding, 
a church marriage.  People make a vow not only about the 
recognition before the state, but they also make a vow based on 
their faith in God and the scriptural perspective they bring to 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the member that many people, I would suggest most 
people, when they enter into a marriage contract, do not think of 
it in terms of what one or the other can get. They enter into it 
in the traditional faith perspective of the two shall become one. 
It is not just a case of having a prenuptial agreement and 
splitting things up later if it does not go right.  Most people 
enter into it in a very serious and solemn way.  It is a joyous 
but a solemn occasion where they say “You and I are getting 
together.  We are not getting together to split things down the 
middle; we are getting together so that we two shall become 
one”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the member that most people on their marriage day 
make that commitment because they want it to last forever.  I 
agree that is why most people head into it.  That is why the 
tearing apart of a marriage when it does not work out is so 
traumatic.  It is said that when it comes to stress, it is next 
to a death in the family.  There is nothing more stressful than a 
separation in a marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the things we can do here to promote and encourage 
marriage and to help— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  It was really 
difficult for me to capture your eye but I had to interrupt. 
<P><A NAME="LINK85"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in 
making some of his points, the hon. whip for the opposition used 
a very moving story about a soldier who went off to Bosnia but 
was married just prior to leaving.  I understand the point of the 
story to be that it made it easier for the widow to collect 
benefits by virtue of the fact that they had gone through the 
actual marriage ceremony. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask him in the most serious of ways, what if 
that soldier who went away and was killed was part of a long term 
homosexual relationship, a long, stable, loving relationship? 
Maybe they co-owned a home and had joint assets. Then the soldier 
went away and had the terrible accident with the mine.  Does the 
hon. member think that the grieving spouse in that relationship 
should have access to the same benefits as the spouse in the 
member's story? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member did get the 
point of my original story.  Because of the marriage contract, so 
to speak, and the fact that a marriage has taken place, the state 
has said that all the waiting periods and all the proving of 
conjugality are set aside.  They do not have to prove they are 
sleeping together.  They do not have to prove it is a long term 
commitment. 
They do not have to go through a two or three year waiting 
period. They do not have to have children.  The marriage ceremony 
brings with it a certain legitimacy which happens the moment the 
documents are signed.  Not to belittle other relationships, 
marriage brings with it legitimacy and carries it from that 
moment forward.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The member put forward a hypothetical case.  The idea of long 
term relationships and dependent relationships is an issue which 
probably deserves another debate in the House.  I encourage the 
member and his party to bring it forward.  Other members have 
brought forward the idea that we should base our benefits on 
dependency rather than on marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I used the example because marriage brings with it something 
special which has been recognized for eons.  The moment the ink 
is dry and the couple runs out of the church under a shower of 
confetti, that moment is special.  It is special not only in the 
church, not only before the state, but it is special between the 
two people. For the marriage definition, those two people are a 
man and a woman. 
<P><A NAME="LINK86"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is remarkable that we should even be debating this in the House 
of Commons today but I take real delight in addressing the motion 
that has been put forward and I gladly affirm it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one thinks of the glue that holds societies together, one 
cannot help but think of the institution of marriage and the 
family unit which is the fundamental building block of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion the Reform Party put forward today speaks to the 
current legal definition of marriage in Canada as the union of 
one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others. In putting 
forward this motion the Reform Party is simply affirming or 
echoing its longstanding policy that marriage is the union of a 
man and a woman as recognized by the state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we debating such a topic?  Why are we spending time 
discussing something that would seem to be so self-evident? There 
has been a chronology of events over the last number of months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people believe that the institution of marriage is in 
danger of being radically changed in law due to recent court 
rulings. As we all know, a series of court decisions have been 
made in which various kinds of benefits previously restricted to 
heterosexual couples have now been extended to gay partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A year ago in the Rosenberg decision the Ontario Court of Appeal 
changed the Income Tax Act to extend pension benefits to gay 
partners. Just last month the supreme court declared in its M. v 
H. ruling that gay partners are subject to the alimony provisions 
of Ontario's Family Law Act. Some people believe that marriage 
will be the next to fall and that gay marriages may be just on 
the horizon or just around the corner. This does not need to be 
the case and should not be the case in my view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here today to affirm both in debate and by means of a 
vote that there is no necessary connection between extending 
benefits to gay partners and legalizing same sex marriage.  Some 
people will want to see a connection between them but there does 
not have to be and there ought not to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote the justice minister on this point.  In an April 
24, 1998 letter she stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I continue to believe that it is not necessary to change 
well-understood concepts of spouse and marriage to deal with any 
fairness considerations the courts and tribunals may find. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That statement clearly distinguishes between the extension of 
benefits, which is what the courts have been ruling on, and the 
definition of marriage, which is what they have not been ruling 
on. The conclusion drawn by the justice minister is that 
homosexual individuals can be treated fairly without having to 
alter the definition of marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister of the land made the same point in a May 21, 
1999 press release which responded to the M. v H. decision.  He 
said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that it is not necessary to redefine concepts like 
marriage in order to ensure access to benefits and obligations 
for people in committed relationships in a way that is fair to 
all Canadians. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the government and the Reform Party are in agreement 
that gay marriage is not a logical progression from recent court 
rulings on questions of benefits. They are different issues that 
belong in different categories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to address the question of why it is that marriage is a 
unique institution that deserves to be guarded and strengthened 
in our nation.  The institution of marriage has brought great 
benefits to our society. 
In the vast majority of marriages, children are brought into the 
world providing our country with its future citizens, workers, 
leaders, mothers and fathers, and so it goes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marriages provide the most stable, enduring context for the 
development of individuals during the formative years of 
childhood and thereafter on through their teenage years. A mom 
and a dad have an influence on a son or a daughter well on into 
their adult life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been proven statistically that families in which the 
parents are married are the most stable families.  That is a 
documented fact.  In this way marital relationships contribute to 
the dignity, the stability, the peace and prosperity of the 
family and of the greater society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does a marriage bring these benefits, we ask.  When a man 
and a woman enter into the marriage relationship, it is almost 
always for the express purpose of making a lifelong commitment 
which will form the basis of family life and the environment in 
which children will be reared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had the privilege over a decade and a half in a previous 
life of officiating at marriage ceremonies, as the one 
solemnizing that marriage.  It has been a awesome privilege to 
watch the groom and the bride stare into each other's eyes as 
their emotions well up.  On those many occasions I found myself 
being caught up in the significance of that very momentous 
occasion when a man and a woman come together to commit their 
lives together.  I would say in all of those cases and in the 
premarital counselling that preceded, although marriages do break 
down, it was the intent of the two coming together that it be a 
lifelong commitment to one another, a loving relationship in 
richness and in poverty, in sickness and in health and so on as 
the marriage vows go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though regrettably marriages sometimes break down, the fact 
that marriage relationships are much more stable than common law 
relationships makes one thing very clear: very few people enter 
into the marriage relationship flippantly. It has been my 
experience and the experience of many others whom I have talked 
to, colleagues and numerous other people, that most have 
carefully thought about that commitment, some more than others. 
They thought about the commitment they were making and they said 
those vows sincerely and solemnly.  They realized that they were 
participating in something much larger than themselves, something 
that most Canadians from various religious backgrounds believe is 
designed by God. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point here is simply that people are serious when they get 
married.  This seriousness and depth of commitment to the 
marriage is what benefits the children who are born and raised in 
that context in those stable families. That is of great benefit 
to all of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the way in which the institution of marriage benefits 
society, we need to guard it, we need to protect it and we need 
to promote it.  The institution of marriage as a union of one man 
and one woman must be preserved, protected and promoted in both 
the private and the public realms.  It would be foolish to 
undermine the uniqueness of the marriage relationship.  Any 
society that does so risks losing the benefits that have come to 
society from marriage and from the high regard in which it has 
always been held. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course some people are not thinking about the health of the 
larger society when they are willing to sacrifice the societal 
benefits that come from marriage in order to engage in a form of 
social experimentation.  Such people may regard marriage as 
little more than a form of self-expression, but marriage must 
not, marriage cannot be reduced to that level.  It is much more 
than a form of self-expression.  It is the glue, some would say 
the crazy glue that holds society together today and lays the 
groundwork for the society of tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The institution of marriage is not something to be toyed with. 
Were we to abandon the uniqueness of marriage, I am convinced 
that we would pay a heavy price for such social experimentation. 
We would be killing the goose that lays the golden egg.  Down the 
road, two decades from now or whatever number of years down the 
road, we would be looking back and we would rue the day that the 
slide began and that decisive moment of change occurred.  We must 
not go down that road and have to pick up the pieces later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To tinker with the institution of marriage would send the wrong 
message.  First, it would send the wrong message to our young 
people. Surveys have shown that young people are actually more 
optimistic about relationships and starting a family some day 
than even many of their parents were.  This optimism is good.  It 
needs to be encouraged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, were the institution of marriage to be changed, we would 
be sending a wrong message to common law couples who have 
children and are contemplating making a lifelong commitment to 
each other in marriage, that formal commitment, that celebration 
and that actual ceremony before the public.

decided to commit themselves to each other in marriage, which is 
something to be encouraged and welcomed.  The children in such 
relationships can only benefit and society in turn benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion we have considered today is an important one. It 
seeks to defend the current legal definition of marriage in 
Canada as the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of 
all others.  In putting forth the motion, the Reform Party is 
simply echoing its long-standing policy that marriage is the 
union of a man and a woman as recognized by the state.  It is 
monogamous.  It is one man and one woman for life. 
Opposite sex, is defined as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We look forward to the vote tonight and to see the House affirm 
that long-standing, age old, historic definition of marriage. 
<P><A NAME="LINK87"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Judi Longfield (Whitby—Ajax, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the motion before us from the member for Calgary Centre is pretty 
straightforward. It asks that the House reaffirm its commitment 
to marriage with the legal definition of marriage as being the 
union between one man and one woman.  Quite frankly, I have 
absolutely no hesitation in saying that I support this 100%. What 
is regrettable is that the motion has taken on a life other than 
what it should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole idea of survivor benefits and what we are doing in 
other pieces of legislation needs a full and wholesome debate on 
its own.  That is the subject of another debate and I would not 
want to see it confused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have great difficulty with pieces of legislation that deal 
with conjugal relations because I do not think survivor benefits 
should be based on one's sleeping habits or who one is sleeping 
with.  There are other ways to define who might be the recipient 
of a survivor benefit.  It in no way demeans other kinds of 
relationships.  What we are talking about here is the legal 
definition of marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have a question so much as a comment.  I do not think 
it is inappropriate that we, in this House of Parliament, state 
for one and all our reaffirmation that marriage is the union 
between one man and one woman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
affirmation of the member across the way. The whole intent and 
point of the debate is to make it very clear to the public and 
have it on the record that we are defending, affirming, strongly 
avowing and supporting the institution of marriage and the 
traditional view of it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK88"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I too have no problem supporting the motion, but I have 
a question for the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians of the Muslim faith are allowed to marry more 
than one woman.  The motion defines marriage as being the union 
between only one man and one woman.  How would this affect a 
person of the Muslim faith if he is married to more than one 
woman?  Would that be defined as a family by this motion or would 
there be a different category for them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to bring 
to the attention of the member, as he is obviously aware, that 
within Canada, this great Dominion of ours from sea to sea to 
sea, monogamy between one man and one woman is the law.  That is 
the rule. 
<P><A NAME="LINK89"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I also 
want to acknowledge that I support the term of marriage as a 
union of a single man and a single woman.  However, I do think 
other issues have been brought into this as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the hon. member tell me what he would perceive as the 
relationship of same sex couples and whether or not they should 
receive the same benefits that married couples receive?  Should 
that be the case, or is the issue that we want to affirm marriage 
and make sure that same sex couples never have the same benefits 
that married people have?  Does he have another term that may be 
used for the commitment that same sex couples show to each other?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, for the purposes of our 
debate today, we are of course debating the marriage definition 
itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member raised a very valid question.  Her party may put it 
forward on a future day that it should not be based on sexual 
involvement or a conjugal relationship, but we would also need to 
know the cost.  The public would then have to be engaged in the 
debate to determine if that were in the greater societal 
interest.  There would also have to be a full debate the House of 
Commons, and I would encourage that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian:</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member should know that when a man with more 
than one wife applies for immigration status in Canada, he is 
disqualified by this motion from being called a family.  If a 
Muslim family from the Middle East or anywhere else applies to 
come to Canada with more than one wife, the hon. member is 
basically asking them to drop the other wives at home, break up 
the family and come back here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member must address this issue before we vote on the 
subject.  It is a very important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, does the hon. member 
want to put forward a motion to the effect of affirming polygamy 
in our country?  I am not exactly sure of his intent.  However, 
as our law presently states, a marriage is between one man and 
one woman.  It has been long held in our Judeo-Christian setting. 
<P><A NAME="LINK90"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will be splitting my time with the hon. member for 
Wentworth—Burlington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this is an important debate and I am pleased that the 
hon. member has brought the issue to the House.  The motion 
reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, it is necessary, in light of 
public debate around recent court decisions, to state that 
marriage is and should remain the union of one man and one woman 
to the exclusion of all others, and that Parliament will take all 
necessary steps to preserve this definition of marriage in 
Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity to comment on the public 
debate around the recent court decisions, in particular to talk 
about those decisions and suggest some steps that we must next 
take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view, parliament has been silent too long on this issue 
and has, by its neglect, deferred to others in areas of intense 
controversy among Canadians.  The leading decision in the field 
is Egan and Nesbit, which was a challenge to the spousal 
allowance provisions of the Old Age Security Act. In May 1995, 
the Supreme Court of Canada dismissed the appeal of Egan and 
Nesbit by a 5:4 margin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court, however, was unanimous in its view that sexual 
orientation was an analogous ground and triggered section 15 
protection.  A 5:4 majority found that the spousal issue 
discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation and therefore 
infringed section 15.  However, a different 5:4 majority found 
that the discrimination was justified under section 1 of the 
charter.  The conclusion appeared to be based, at least in part, 
on the view that the court should be reluctant to interfere in 
parliament's choice in respect of socioeconomic pieces of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite obvious therefore that this is a very divided court, 
as is society.  However, it had the wisdom to offer this advice 
to parliament in May 1995 when the decision was rendered: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of how the term spouse should be defined is a 
fundamental social policy issue and parliament should decide it 
and parliament should listen to and balance the competing social 
issues, the philosophical issues, the legal, moral, theological 
issues that go into this definitional process.  The court 
shouldn't be deciding it.  Parliament should be deciding it and 
the court should defer to parliament. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is hardly an enthusiastic endorsement for interfering in 
different areas of jurisdictional competence or, as some have 
suggested, judicial activism.  I would submit quite to the 
contrary, the courts are quite prepared to defer to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next leading case is Rosenberg, which the government chose 
not to appeal.  It basically showed that the court of appeal was 
a little fed up with parliament.  It had a case before it 
concerning tax deferral and the advantages of a heterosexual 
couple over a homosexual couple with respect to the Income Tax 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The attorney general conceded that under the Income Tax Act 
section 15 was in fact violated, but at a lower court ruling 
this was a justifiable limitation and was found to be reasonable 
under section 1.  The court of appeal, in overturning that 
decision, said that this discriminatory action could not be 
justified as pressing and substantial.  It also said that it 
failed the test of rational connection, minimal impairment and 
proportionality. 
There was no rational connection between the limitation and the 
goal of protecting heterosexual partners from income security on 
the death of their partners.  It also found that the cost was not 
a constitutionally permissible justification of discrimination 
under section 1 and judicial deference was not a presumptive 
argument against judicial scrutiny.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A conclusion to be reached after a section 1 analysis, in other 
words the discriminatory provisions, could not be justified as 
they had no rational connection and the courts were no longer 
prepared to defer just on the basis of institutional competence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the fair conclusion is that if parliament does not 
decide these issues then the courts will take over.  In my view 
that effectively shuts out the voices of the people of Canada so 
that the chattering classes get to have their say on what they 
think should be the proper definition of spouse or conjugal 
relationship.  The courts can have their say as to what 
constitutes a conjugal relationship, but the people of Canada and 
parliament do not get their say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I want to make is that Rosenberg, M and H, and Egan 
did not deal with marriage.  Rosenberg deals with the tax 
advantages of a heterosexual couple.  M and H deals with section 
29 of the Family Law Act but, as such, marriage itself is left 
alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a clear legal conclusion that in Egan, Rosenberg, M and H 
on the issue of what constitutes a marriage has, per the terms of 
the motion before us, not been attacked.  While there has been a 
great deal of public debate surrounding those court decisions, 
there has been no initiative on the part of either the courts of 
appeal or the Supreme Court of Canada to say that marriage is 
anything other than what the motion states, namely a union 
between one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that the institution of marriage and the definition 
of marriage is not under attack does not mean that 
parliamentarians can have a nice summer and enjoy themselves. In 
my view, the courts have got themselves locked into a dialogue 
out of which they cannot emerge because of the logic of their 
positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Courts necessarily operate in a rights-based environment and 
everything is put through that particular lens.  Courts, by 
definition, do not have a broad perspective.  What is in front of 
an individual judicial officer at any given time is a set of 
litigants who deal on a narrow set of facts, on a particular set 
of legal principles at any given time.  Necessarily, the courts' 
focuses are narrow and specific. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament, however, is best able to look at the broad 
socio-economic implications of changes to legislation. 
Parliament, in its own funny little way, goes through this 
committee type process where witnesses are brought in and a 
variety of viewpoints are sought which have an effect on how the 
government of the day deals with the issues.  The process is 
fairly open and democratic.  Legislation emerges hopefully 
encompassing what has been heard from witnesses.  No judicial 
inquiry can ever match the breadth of a parliamentary process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would submit that one of the reasons the court decisions have 
been so controversial is that the court processes have ended up 
dealing with language concepts that are very limiting by their 
nature. The rights based and rights concept view of life is very 
individualistic and does not deal very well with other 
institutions in our society such as the family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, if one uses the concept of spouse, one necessarily 
ends up expanding the language to accommodate the demands of same 
sex people.  It tends to render the meaning of spouse, as has 
been understood over the millennia, as meaningless to many 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reasons that the courts end up dealing with phrases like 
“spouse” and “conjugal rights” is that their language is 
limited and limited to a particular decision.  They end up 
expanding the language in the way language was never intended to 
go in the first place and then of course that in turn offends 
some people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to propose that the direction for the government in 
this particular area should be to first de-conjugalize the 
language.  The first and foremost principle, as set out in the 
motion of the hon. member, namely that the definition of marriage 
remains as is and that the Government of Canada should give a 
positive statement, rather than merely double negatives from 
lawyers, that marriage is a separate institution recognized by a 
variety of religious authorities throughout the millennia and 
that it enjoys a unique and particular status in the lives of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, the second step of the process is much more 
problematic.  The conjugalizing of the definition of dependency 
for the purposes of family law legislation, or for the purposes 
of divorce, or for the purpose of pension entitlements has set up 
a whole new set of discriminatory practices which the courts will 
find endlessly frustrating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My suggestion is that once we de-conjugalize those sorts of 
definitions and move toward truer concepts of dependency and 
inter-relationship we will avoid a lot of legal absurdities that 
the courts are currently and inadvertently in the process of 
setting up.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most obvious legal absurdity is that the people who have sex 
will be entitled to certain kinds of benefits and the people who 
do not will not.  The dependencies are the same, the relationship 
is the same, yet the entitlement to a panoply of benefits is 
generated only by virtue of sex.  I would suggest that is an 
absurdity which sets up a level of discrimination which is 
unnecessary and will be the source of a great deal of additional 
litigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that it is up to parliament to get the courts 
out of some of their own logical absurdities.  The suggestion 
that you made, Mr. Speaker, with respect to domestic 
partnerships, is in some respects entitled to a great deal of 
scrutiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other suggestions may be to maintain the definition of spouse 
for married couples only and apply a different term, most likely 
partner, for all other relationships, including common law, same 
sex or non-conjugal.  Many non-married couples use the term 
partner for significant terminology, as is reflected in society 
general.  Or the definition of spouse could be used for all 
non-married partnerships, including common law, same sex or 
non-conjugal, and the terminology applied to married spouses 
could be that of husband and wife. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are only suggestions, but I would suggest that this is the 
institution that best deals with those kinds of suggestions and 
that the courts themselves are institutions to which we should 
only defer in certain circumstances.  As I see it, the courts are 
quite prepared to defer to parliament and to listen to what 
parliament has to say in dealing with this very vexing issue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK91"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member from the Liberal Party seems to be in 
contradiction with what the parliamentary secretary said earlier 
about the supremacy of parliament.  The member who just spoke 
seems to be concurring with members of the opposition and others 
who have said that parliament is supreme.  The parliamentary 
secretary clearly stated that the supreme court is supreme, so 
there certainly is a conflict on that side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know he spoke in support, generally speaking, of this motion, 
but I want to know how he justifies the following statement: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Be it resolved that the Liberal Party of Canada strongly urge 
the federal government to recognize same sex marriages in the 
same way that it recognizes opposite marriages in its 
distribution of benefits”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wondering how the member from the Liberal Party of Canada 
can justify supporting this motion?  We appreciate his support, 
but there is a definite contradiction between the policy of the 
Liberal Party of Canada and what they are saying in the House 
today.  How can he justify that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I said in my speech, in 
my view parliament is the proper forum to deal with this issue. 
In fact it has a means to it that allows us to deal with what 
apparently are irreconcilable concepts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I suggest that in some respect any motions that deal with 
same sex marriage, or words or phrases to that effect, are in 
fact imprecise versions of language.  We want to be much tighter 
in our use of language.  We want particular words to mean 
particular things to particular pieces of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My suggestion, and I think it is a good suggestion, which is 
supported by others, is that if we de-conjugalize the issues 
outside marriage we arrive at a solution or we move toward a 
solution which is in fact far healthier and allows us to get past 
this constant flinging of words back and forth, whether it is 
spouse, conjugal, marriage, husband or wife.  If we were far more 
precise in our language then I think we would give the courts 
instruction as to how to resolve the issues on a case by case 
basis. 
<P><A NAME="LINK92"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to follow up on the question that my 
colleague just asked because we are very concerned that the 
policy resolution that was passed by the Liberals at their 
convention is in fact what is behind a lot of the concerns that 
we are raising today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk a lot about the courts and we are very concerned that 
there is going to be more and more of an erosion of our 
fundamental beliefs.  We need to send a message to the courts 
that the definition of marriage is sacrosanct.  We would like to 
stop sliding down the slippery slope.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The basic building block of our society is the family and we are 
very concerned that this will lead to an erosion of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to return to the court case which has formed the 
background for this discussion, the M. v H. case, which was before 
the supreme court.  There was no disagreement on their legal 
rights by the time that case got to the court.  The case had 
turned into an abstract argument over gay marriage.  The monetary 
aspect had been closed.  Both sides wanted the court to rule in 
the same way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would the supreme court accept a case under those 
circumstances?  Why did it not wait to decide whether gay 
marriage should be imposed on the country until a live argument 
was before it?  My feeling is that the court did not wait because 
it was wanting to write gay marriage into the law.  That is why 
this whole discussion today is so important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know if the member has any response to my 
comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's premise 
with respect to the analysis of M. v H. is completely false.  M. v H. 
did not deal with marriage.  M. v H. dealt with section 29 of the 
family law legislation of the province of Ontario, and it dealt 
with that legislation in section 29.  Section 1 concerns the 
definition of marriage.  Section 29 concerns spousal rights; that 
is, what we would consider to be common law spousal rights. The 
court analogized that common law heterosexual spousal rights are 
equivalent to common law homosexual spousal rights, and that is 
where it left it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to the issue that is on the floor, it has nothing to do with 
marriage, as M. v H. had nothing to do with marriage.  In fact, the 
courts in Egan, Rosenberg and M. v H. all said the same thing. 
They were not dealing with marriage; they were dealing with 
rights and benefits that may accrue by virtue of a relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next step is to de-conjugalize the issue.  If we do that we 
have taken the steam right out of the debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am privileged to follow my colleague from Scarborough 
East because I share many of the sentiments he has expressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, let me say that I am a member of parliament.  My 
decisions are made here and they are made by my brain and my 
conscience.  I am not bound by any policy decisions made by a 
Liberal convention.  The Reform Party may be bound by the 
suggestions from policy conventions but not me.  These are merely 
suggestions of policy that have come from the membership of the 
Liberal party.  But, when push comes to shove, as members of 
parliament we have to decide on our own consciences in this 
Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no difficulty saying that I support this motion.  It is a 
little premature for me because I would have liked more time over 
the summer to formulate a better expression of my thoughts 
concerning the controversy surrounding same sex couples in terms 
of the benefits they should receive and the absolute necessity in 
my mind in preserving the legal concept of marriage as a union of 
opposite sex couples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I support this motion is because there are two very 
important things behind the need to recognize the legality of 
marriage as an opposite sex union.  First, it is the idea that 
many Canadians still believe, despite the fact that there are 
some Canadians who have lost some faith in the various organized 
churches, absolutely in the sanctity of marriage.  We owe those 
Canadians an obligation to respect their feelings on this issue. 
We should not willy-nilly trample on something that has been a 
tradition for many thousands of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For me the really crucial issue with respect to the legality of 
an opposite sex union being termed a marriage is the idea of 
adoption.  I voted against my government several years back on 
this very issue.  I support absolutely the need to support 
couples who are in an emotionally dependent relationship that 
becomes materially dependent, be they same sex couples or couples 
that are dependent for other reasons. 
I feel very strongly that while I support that idea absolutely, I 
am very concerned that we must never, in furthering that goal, 
extinguish the rights of others.  By this I mean specifically 
children.  My fear about recognizing same sex marriages is that 
it would infuse a right for homosexual couples to adopt children.

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now there is a discretionary ability for homosexual 
couples to adopt children and I think that is fine, because I am 
not one to say that it is impossible, indeed, even unlikely, that 
a homosexual couple might make excellent parents.  What I am not 
prepared to say is that, all things being equal, a homosexual 
couple make equally as good parents as a heterosexual couple.  I 
do not think society and our understanding of the human psyche 
has progressed that far that we can be prepared to make that 
judgment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea or the concept of retaining the legal concept of 
marriage as an opposite sex union is, I think, extremely 
important in terms of preserving the rights of children, the 
right of a child to be brought up by heterosexual parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I really do welcome this debate, because what 
has happened is that in the courts, when we leave it to the 
courts, the judges sit back and they hear the evidence presented 
before them.  However, if that evidence is flawed or that 
evidence is incomplete, then what happens is that the court will 
make an incomplete decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw that in the use of the word conjugal, which came up in 
Bill C-78.  The government used the word conjugal based on its 
use in previous court decisions.  When I examined that, I 
discovered that the courts did not consider the meaning of 
conjugal.  The courts merely made a change to existing 
legislation and ignored the fact that conjugal means 
heterosexual, unless we had a situation where even the supreme 
court was implying that the word conjugal means same sex unions 
when it does not mean that at all.  What we have to do—

special day in the House.  The Reform Party is standing in 
defence of the family and of marriage between a man and a woman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other ways of supporting families too.  For example, 
we think that it is high time to free families from their 
crushing tax load.  We believe in leaving more money in the hands 
of the people who have earned it so that they can provide for 
their families.  How can families be strong if half of their 
earnings are confiscated in the form of taxes, making it a 
constant struggle for them to make ends meet? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very appreciative of my family.  After 38 years of 
marriage, my wife and I have three children, two in-laws and four 
grandchildren.  However, thanks to the Liberal and Conservative 
governments of the past 35 years, the collective share of the 
debt spread over our 11 family members is over $200,000.

biodiversity when habitats that shelter plant and animal species 
are destroyed.  Billions of tonnes of topsoil are lost through 
erosion each year. Toxic chemicals in the environment especially 
threaten the health of children, the elderly and the urban poor. 
Our ecosystem and our health bear the brunt of these impacts.

21,000 musicians to try to break the world record for the largest

table the bill of sale he made as member—not as Prime Minister

</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask him once more: this business of keeping this sale secret,

efficiency and for renewable energy.  It is also why in the 1998 
budget the government moved to narrow the gap between renewables 
and non-renewables by extending the benefits to the extent of

Mr. Speaker, demilitarization and disarmament are not

Disarmament of the KLA will happen in the initial stages.  It is 
in the interests of the KLA to disarm so that the peacekeepers 
can go in to allow the Kosovo refugees to be able to re-enter 
their country in peace and security.  It was foreseen that way in 
the Rambouillet talks to which the KLA agreed.

Mr. Speaker, we are not talking about a change of use or a change 
in the practices from what they have been for some 30 years.  The 
area we use is necessary for these purposes, but every provision 
is made in order for pleasure craft and other boaters to be able 
to pass in and out, as has been the case for many years.  We are 
not talking about any change at all and we are not talking about 
seizing anything.  We are going through the appropriate 
expropriation process which involves giving fair market value for 
the property.

raised in the House whereby one hon. member alleged that another

was made.  The hon. member who was named in the allegation was 
the hon. member for Vaudreuil—Soulanges.

from the hon. member for Vaudreuil—Soulanges and he is in his

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil—Soulanges, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify 
this situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have too much respect for the House of Commons and the Speaker 
to leak any document.  I find the comments of the member for 
Sherbrooke, who claims that over three years these kinds of 
documents have been leaked, a bit exaggerated since he has only 
been in the House less than eight months, I believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To get directly to the point, I did give an interview to the 
Toronto <I>Star</I>.  From the outset it was clear to the reporter 
that it was my personal opinion.  If members take the opportunity 
to read the headline of that article, they will see that it says 
“MP Report”.  It does not comment at all on what I reported in 
the House of Commons and in the subcommittee per se. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was also approached by another newspaper reporter as early as 
last Friday who told me that they had in their possession the 
said draft report, and I refused comment again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw the attention of the House to a quote in that article of 
the Conservative member for Fundy—Royal who proposed a $700 
refundable tax credit per child. In the subcommittee last 
Wednesday the member for Fundy—Royal admitted to talking to the 
same reporter that I talked about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion all I did was reflect my personal opinion.  I made 
that clear with the reporter when I spoke to him.  I might have 
erred in judgment, but in no way did I ever disclose the contents 
of the report which will probably be tabled in the House 
tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. opposition House leader wanted to 
intervene last Thursday on this exact matter.  I will recognize 
the hon. House leader of the opposition, but may I put into 
context what we are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To reiterate, as I understand it, last week we had an hon. 
member alleging that another hon. member made a statement about 
some of the things that were discussed in a meeting of a 
subcommittee.  We are honour bound not to repeat anything from 
meetings which are held in camera and we take all hon. members at 
face value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the hon. member who was alleged to have spoken has made a 
statement in the House of Commons.  He says, and I want to be 
corrected if I do not understand it, categorically that he did 
not make any statement of any material forthcoming from this 
meeting.  That is my understanding.  Is that correct? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nick Discepola:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is correct.  I 
would also like to point out for the House that these meetings 
were not in camera.  They were public meetings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The issue here is:  Was this information 
leaked or not?  We have one hon. member alleging that it was 
leaked material.  We have the hon. member who is alleged to have 
leaked the material saying categorically that he did not.  We at 
all times take the word of hon. members of parliament and we are 
honour bound in that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that in mind, and before I render a final decision, I will 
hear very briefly from the opposition House leader if he has 
anything to add.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A report from procedure and House affairs on leaked documents 
that was supposed to resolve the issue of confidence and 
confidentiality within the House of Commons was tabled in the 
House, but that was it.  It was not even concurred in.  We as a 
House are supposed at least to concur in that report, at least 
agree to it so that we could get some guidance from the Chair. 
That has not happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since that document has been produced by the committee, there 
have been at least three such incidents which have been matters 
of complaint by members here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me this will not go away.  I think the onus is on 
the Chair to make some decision.  Obviously the procedure and 
House affairs committee could not make the decision. The House in 
its entirety is incapable of making the decision because it will 
not make any decisions on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask you, Mr. Speaker, to set some standards and guidelines, to 
set some rules and to provide some sanctions for those who show 
contempt of the House and abuse the privileges of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member of course is not addressing 
himself to this specific issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the specific issue that I am dealing with now, 
which is the allegation that the hon. member for 
Vaudreuil—Soulanges leaked information, I accept and I want the 
House to accept the hon. member's word.  I consider the matter 
closed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the other matter that the opposition House leader 
has raised, this was put into the hands of the committee on 
procedure.  We are awaiting its report.  It has not been 
concurred in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is before the House I would tend to be informed about it, 
but if it is not brought to the House in very short order I want 
you to know that I do not feel it is the personal responsibility 
of the Chair to make the rules for this House.  It is up to the 
House to decide how it will conduct itself.  It is up to the 
Speaker to see to it that the rules of the House are adhered to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that this parliament or any other parliament 
should be subject solely to what the Speaker of the day wants to 
introduce as the rules.  I believe that the Speaker is the 
servant of the House, and he or she will take direction from the 
House when the time comes.

leaked committee documents and reports.  I have brought numerous 
problems to your attention.  The need to find a solution to these 
problems has become so great that even the report of the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, which was to analyse 
these cases and propose sanctions, has itself been leaked.  It is 
ridiculous beyond belief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given what has gone on here for the last two or three years or 
so, with more and more of these leaks taking place and members 
saying they are not responsible for releasing documents to be 
tabled in the House before they are made public, now we are 
wondering whether the rule of confidentiality still applies in 
the House and in committees, which are an extension of the

</I></B></P><P align=left>Hugh served in this place from 1993 to 1997.  He was 
particularly active as a member of the House of Commons industry 
committee and as an advocate for the interests of small business 
and for the research and development community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hugh's voyage through life, like that of so many Canadians, took 
him from eastern Canada to central Canada, to western Canada and 
then back to central Canada as a member of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He grew up in Antigonish, Nova Scotia in a family of five boys. 
He obtained his undergraduate degrees in arts and education from 
St. Francis Xavier University.  Hugh then came to this city where 
he obtained his master's degree in education from the University 
of Ottawa. 
He then moved west to pursue his career as a teacher. He taught 
in the Edmonton Catholic school system for some 20 years. He was 
recognized as teacher of the year for his devotion to teaching 
high school students something about economics.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 Hugh returned to Ottawa as the Reform member of 
parliament representing the constituency of Edmonton—Strathcona, 
a constituency which includes many students, faculty members and 
employees at the University of Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally feel that one of the measures of the 
accomplishments and progress of ourselves as human beings is what 
the younger generation thinks of us.  Perhaps that comes from 
being a father of five children.  Do we inspire confidence, hope 
and aspirations on the part of younger people or do they see in 
us particularly as we grow older a wet blanket, an obstacle or an 
impediment to their dreams and aspirations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hugh Hanrahan had a gift for inspiring the confidence and hopes 
of young people which in the final analysis is a greater tribute 
to the positive aspects of his life than anything that I could 
say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was Hugh's students, some of whom had yet to cast their first 
ballot in a federal election, who persuaded him, their teacher, 
to run for public office.  It was Hugh's students and former 
students who helped him win the Reform nomination in 
Edmonton—Strathcona and formed the heart of his successful 
election campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hugh was never happier in pursuing a public issue than when it 
was related to the hopes, aspirations and success of young 
people.  It is no coincidence that when he retired from political 
life because of ill health his constituents chose one of the 
youngest candidates in the 1997 federal election to follow in his 
footsteps as the member for Edmonton—Strathcona. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the official opposition, we pay tribute to our 
former colleague, Hugh Hanrahan, today.  We extend our heartfelt 
sympathy to his wife Dianne, to his daughter Margaret Ann and his 
four brothers.  We thank them for encouraging Hugh to share his 
life with young people and to share his life with us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today on 
behalf of the government to offer tribute to the former MP from 
Edmonton—Strathcona. Hugh Hanrahan was a fellow Edmontonian and 
someone I got to know when we were both elected for the first 
time to the House in 1993. In fact the points of coincidence 
between Mr. Hanrahan and myself do not end there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. Leader of the Official Opposition has pointed out, 
the University of Alberta was in Mr. Hanrahan's riding and I had 
the opportunity and pleasure to teach at the University of 
Alberta for over 13 years before becoming a member of the House. 
Mr. Hanrahan and I on our frequent flights back and forth from 
Edmonton to Ottawa often sat beside each other.  We had the 
opportunity to talk about our shared love and commitment and at 
times concern for the University of Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. Leader of the Official Opposition is quite right that 
Mr. Hanrahan carried a very deep commitment to the University of 
Alberta and the research and development and intellectual life of 
that institution.  He did all that he could to ensure that it was 
nourished and fostered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Leader of the Official Opposition has pointed out, Mr. 
Hanrahan, like myself, was born in Nova Scotia. We then made our 
way west.  Mr. Hanrahan was born in Antigonish, Nova Scotia where 
he earned degrees in both education and arts from St. Francis 
Xavier or as Mr. Hanrahan would say, St. F. X. Later he obtained 
a master's degree in economics from the University of Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He did make his way west where he accepted a teaching position 
first in Calgary.  Soon afterward he moved to Edmonton where he 
taught economics and earned a reputation in and out of the world 
of education as a man of commitment and thoughtfulness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Hanrahan spent over 20 years teaching in the Edmonton 
Catholic school system.  He was honoured as teacher of the year 
in 1998 by the Alberta Foundation for Economic Education.  Many 
of his students have commented on how influential Mr. Hanrahan 
was in their lives.  I thought as a former teacher myself it was 
very fitting that on the night of his election Mr. Hanrahan 
commented on how influential those students had been on his life. 
He acknowledged that it was through the encouragement of his 
students that he actually for the first time seriously considered 
running as a member of parliament.  His lifelong advocacy of 
fiscal restraint and reducing the national debt provided him with 
a strong and obvious platform. His bid at federal politics was 
successful.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Among other duties he served on the industry committee where he 
developed an expertise on small and medium size business and 
research and development.  Mr. Hanrahan worked diligently in the 
service of his constituents until ill health required his 
retirement from elected office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Hanrahan was a religious man and one who found intellectual 
stimulation and comfort from the works of philosophy, religion, 
politics and history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the government, I am pleased to recognize the work 
of Mr. Hanrahan and his commitment to the public service of this 
country.  We offer our deepest sympathy to his wife Dianne, his 
daughter Margaret and other family and friends.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, today we are 
paying tribute to Hugh Hanrahan, who was the Reform Party member 
for the riding of Edmonton—Strathcona between 1993 and 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hugh Hanrahan passed away on May 19. He was only 52. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Hanrahan was considered a thoughtful man with a penetrating 
mind and a great ability to deepen the issues he believed in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He had a BA and a bachelor's degree in education from St. 
Francis Xavier University and a master's degree in education 
from the University of Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He taught economics at a Catholic school in Edmonton, where he 
was known as a wonderful teacher. This was perfectly natural, 
since teaching was a real passion for Hugh. His curiosity was 
great and he never stopped learning, always wanting to think 
more about things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He won his election in 1993 in the riding of 
Edmonton—Strathcona. He got involved in politics through, among 
other things, the encouragement of his students who knew how 
their teacher's interest in and concerns about tax administration 
and problem of the national debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he won, Mr. Hanrahan took time to warmly thank his students 
for their encouragement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He even mentioned at an event that for him one of the nicest 
compliments he got as a teacher was that his students had 
influenced the direction of his life. 
That shows just how much he cared for and respected his 
students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois and I offer our most sincere 
condolences to his wife Dianne, his daughter Margaret Ann, and 
to all his family and friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The loss of someone dear is always very difficult to accept. The 
only consolation lies in knowing that now he will be watching 
over those he loves.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I rise on behalf of my leader, the member for Halifax, and 
the New Democratic Party caucus to pay tribute to Hugh Hanrahan, 
the former member of parliament for Edmonton—Strathcona. I was 
very saddened to learn that Hugh had passed away at such a young 
age, the age of 52. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were both elected to the House of Commons in 1993.  On 
occasion we had the opportunity to talk about certain issues and 
certain values that we shared.  As a matter of fact we had the 
opportunity because we sat at the far end of the House of Commons 
where the Speaker could not keep track of us.  We were able to 
share our common experiences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Hanrahan was a teacher for 18 years in the Catholic school 
system in Edmonton.  He taught social studies, economics and 
psychology.  He was such a good teacher and such a fine 
gentleman. I could see why in his previous life before elected 
politics he was honoured with the teacher of the year award in 
1987-88 by the Alberta Foundation for Economic Education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Hanrahan not only loved Canada and Alberta, he loved Nova 
Scotia where he was born and educated.  He often visited Nova 
Scotia and would talk about his visits there.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things I wanted to raise with the House and his 
family is the fact that we would talk about why we came to the 
House of Commons.  We also shared our various hopes and 
aspirations about Canada, in particular western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my view that Mr. Hanrahan sought elected office because he 
felt strongly about the good fiscal management that was necessary 
for our country.  He was concerned about the problems of the 
national debt.  He was also very concerned that we should be 
focusing our energies on building Canada as opposed to tearing it 
apart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was encouraged by young people to seek elected office.  They 
energized him in his job throughout his duties and career as a 
member of parliament.  He was somewhat discouraged and saddened 
by the fact that he could not seek elected office for a second 
term because of his illness.  I shared his very serious thoughts 
in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the New Democratic Party caucus and my leader, I 
wish to offer my very deepest sympathies to Mrs. Dianne Hanrahan, 
their daughter Margaret Ann, his brothers and other family 
members and friends.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> Madam 
Speaker, on behalf of the Progressive Conservative caucus I join 
in sending our sympathy to Mrs. Hanrahan and their daughter 
Margaret on the loss they have suffered in the passing of Hugh 
Hanrahan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From what others have said, particularly the Leader of the 
Opposition and the Minister of Justice, it is very clear that the 
community in Edmonton is poorer for the tragic early death of Mr. 
Hanrahan.  Yet it is very clear that in his short life he 
achieved much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an educator, orator and member of the House of Commons, Mr. 
Hanrahan served his constituents and his country proudly.  He 
received the accolades and the respect of his peers in each 
capacity, and he served with dignity.  This is not surprising for 
he was a son of Antigonish and the product of St. Francis Xavier 
University.  His attachment to his Scottish and Irish ancestries 
was worn with pride.  He has now returned to the welcoming arms 
of his beloved Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are grateful that Hugh Hanrahan was prepared to serve his 
community and the House.  The country is richer because he did 
so.  He served the public in a noble and dignified way.  The loss 
to his family and his country is immense.  With all members of 
his family, his party and this place, we mourn his loss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise 
on a point of order.  I believe you would find unanimous consent 
of the House to allow me to present a petition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The hon. member is 
seeking unanimous consent to present a petition.  Is there

amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK263"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
this motion arises out of the controversy that followed various 
supreme court decisions and various other court decisions that 
were intended to extend various benefits to same sex couples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really believe that the controversy is an empty controversy if 
we as legislators apply ourselves to a few relatively easy 
changes. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1535"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the majority of Canadians believe in the 
principle, in the rightness as described in our charter of 
rights, of making sure all Canadians have equal access to 
benefits and that they should not be discriminated against 
because of sexual orientation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that over the last 20 years Canadians have come to 
more and more recognize that homosexuality is something that is 
given to us at birth, that it is not really an alternative 
lifestyle.  It is something that nature or God gives us.  It is a 
flaw, perhaps, or an abnormality.  I should say there is nothing 
unnatural about an abnormality because every one of us is born 
with differences, weaknesses or strengths. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think all of us as Canadians believe that we should not 
discriminate against people merely because they are different 
from the norm.  Indeed homosexual couples and homosexual 
individuals I think are generally acknowledged to have 
contributed mightily to the creative life in any country or any 
community to which they belong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, I think we can fix this situation by a 
few simple legislated definitions.  The first should be to 
legislate a definition of marriage that means legally that 
marriage is a union between opposite sex couples.  Second, we 
should legislate a definition of spouse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have no choice but to connect spouse with the idea of 
marriage because the dictionary defines spouse as husband and 
wife, and only the courts can play Samuel Johnson at their whim 
and redefine language whenever they please.  We as legislators 
have to respect language in both English and French and make sure 
that we are using current language and using words as they are 
intended to be used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then what we should do is create a new definition and call it 
dependent partner.  We define dependent partner as an adult who 
is in an emotionally dependent relationship with another person 
leading to material dependency.  We can extend that definition to 
say that it involves siblings, that it involves parent and child, 
or that it involves people of the same sex who are in a physical 
relationship with one another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once we do that then the rest should fall in place.  As long as 
we set aside the fear associated with defining same sex couples 
as being married, as having the right to adopt children or as 
eroding the sanctity of marriage, I think the vast majority of 
Canadians, whether they are very religious or not very religious, 
will join with this parliament in agreeing that we should make 
sure all people who are in an emotionally dependent relationship 
should have equal access to benefits.  The advantage to this is 
that we take, for the most part, sex out of the definition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly believe, as a former Liberal prime minister once 
said, that parliament has no business in the bedrooms of the 
nation. I believe that is so.  We should be talking about 
dependent relationships, not sexual relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this is an easy solution.  We should think about it over 
the summer.  I am glad the Reform Party put this motion forward 
today because we are coming to the end of this sitting and we 
need to reflect on this issue so we can easily resolve it when 
the fall comes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK264"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
listened to the hon. member's comments in support of the Reform 
motion.  The more I hear of this debate and the more I hear some 
members speak and where they are coming from, I actually get very 
scared about what is an obsession with the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we hear from the hon. member that he wants not only to 
define marriage as he sees it but also to define spouse as it 
relates to marriage.  I have to question what right do I, or does 
the member or anyone else, have to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who live together may define themselves as or may 
self-identify as spouses.  They may be in a common law 
relationship as man and woman.  They may be of the same sex.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find quite frightening the way this debate is going in terms 
of hearing on one hand that the state has no business in the 
bedrooms of the nation, which the member has so eloquently called 
forward from the past.  Yet the very motion and debate that is 
taking place would do exactly that.  It would enforce the state 
into people's private lives and define people's relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For what reason do we need to do that?  Who is this threatening? 
Who is being threatened by people's choice and decision about 
how they live if it is not causing harm to other people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am genuinely asking that question because I have difficulty 
understanding for what reason the member believes the state 
should be making this enforcement in terms of a definition not 
only of marriage but now of spouse.  What will be next?  Will we 
define the family? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Madam Speaker, we have just heard an 
example of the rhetoric of intolerance.  It is the proper place 
of this place to define things in law.  That is our job.  That is 
what we are here to do.  It is my right.  I was elected by my 
constituents to do exactly that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member had been here when I spoke earlier, she would have 
heard me say that the danger, and why we have to intervene and 
make these definitions, is that if we do not the courts are 
likely to extinguish the rights of children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure in my conscience that, all things being equal, a 
child should have a homosexual couple as parents.  I am willing 
to acknowledge that homosexual parents can be good parents.  I am 
willing to give the officials the discretion to make them 
parents.  However I am not willing to give them the right of 
being parents because, in doing so, we extinguish the rights of 
children.  I cannot do that.  It is my place to define the law to 
make sure that the rights of children are protected. 
<P><A NAME="LINK265"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I commend the member for Wentworth—Burlington on his 
eloquent remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point to the comments of the attorney general this morning who 
asked in this place why we should be using the already limited 
time of the House to debate a motion on which there will be no 
fundamental disagreement inside or outside the House.  I raise 
this point because the member indicated he thought this was a 
worthwhile motion, as do I. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will he not agree with me that we have heard members of the 
House disagree fundamentally with the principle stated in the 
motion?  I do not raise this as a partisan point but rather to 
demonstrate that the governing party of Canada, and not the 
government, strongly urges the federal government to recognize 
same sex marriages in the same way as opposite marriages in its 
distribution of benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the hon. member recognize that this is a live issue, that 
there is, contrary to what the attorney general said, fundamental 
disagreement about it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Madam Speaker, I believe the vast 
majority of us agree that benefits should be extended to same sex 
couples.  The issue here is simply the danger of allowing 
marriage to be defined as a same sex relationship.  Not only does 
that go against a thousand years of tradition in law, the church, 
language and every other thing, but there is a serious danger to 
the rights of children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, on this side there is great diversity of 
opinion and great freedom to express opinion.  If an attorney 
general somewhere or the solicitor general or the justice 
minister expresses himself or herself in the House, I still have 
the privilege of expressing myself in my way. 
<P><A NAME="LINK266"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am very 
honoured to enter into debate on the very important question of 
the definition of marriage, the definition of spouse, and the 
upholding of the family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will bring a perspective to the debate which is just a little 
different from most of those that have been expressed, although 
there has been a current of what I will say through many of the 
speeches we have heard so far today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of marriage and family in a very special way.  I made 
reference in a member's statement today to the fact that this 
summer my wife and I will been married for 38 years. 
I think that one of our friends had it right when she said at our 
37th anniversary “Betty deserves a medal”.  That was probably 
true.  I try to be a loving and caring husband.  However, as do 
all husbands and all spouses, we sometimes fall just a little 
short of the mark, even the one we would set for ourselves and 
our spouses.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a very solid family relationship based on marriage.  To 
me it goes somewhat beyond the verbal definition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons I am so supportive of this motion is because 
we are talking about words.  We are talking about language. 
Unless we use words which we understand to have a common meaning 
it makes communication very difficult.  We all know that over 
time language changes.  All one has to do is read a bit of 
Shakespeare to realize that the English usage a scant 150 or 200 
years ago was somewhat different in many areas from what it is 
now.  Even in my own lifetime I have seen some changes in the 
language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was a young man “do not speed” meant not to go faster 
than the prescribed limit on the highway.  The word speed had 
quite a different connotation when I was a young man in the 
hippie era.  I remember in my day when “keep off the grass” 
meant not to go on the neighbour's lawn.  Now keep off the grass 
may have something to do with something quite different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose I should hesitate to use this spectacular example, yet 
it is a real example so I will use it.  We had a motto in grade 
eight.  I still remember it well.  Our teacher and the school 
principal were trying to teach us to make sure that we were 
diligent in our work.  The reward for doing good work was to have 
enjoyment for it afterward.  Our school motto was “First we work 
and then we play because that is the way to be happy and gay”. 
In my generation the word simply meant carefree, happy and 
without worry.  Now the word gay has a fairly different 
connotation because it has been pre-empted by the homosexual 
community.  Quite often when I visit high schools and I talk 
about that grade eight school motto it evokes a good chuckle 
because of the change in the meaning of the word.  That happens 
in the English language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are concerned about is not only the legality of it but 
the deeper meaning.  The reason for this motion today is that we 
want to able to give the courts a very clear message of what our 
meaning of the word marriage is and what the definition is in 
terms of what the legal implications are.  As I said in my 
preamble, to me the meaning of marriage is very deep. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On July 15, 1961 my wife and I stood in front of a minister at a 
church.  We expressed our vows to each other.  I still remember 
most of them.  I do not know if I could still quote them 
verbatim; however, they had to do with being true to each other, 
to cling to each other and to no other until death do us part. 
That was the vow that we made.  It was made not only to each 
other in the presence of witnesses, it was also made very 
profoundly in the presence of God. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am here today to share this aspect of a definition of 
marriage.  For many ions of time it has meant the union of a man 
and a woman.  To me it is not only a relationship or that my wife 
and I are living under the same roof and sharing expenses, it is 
much more than that.  It is a deeply meaningful, spiritual 
relationship under God, with an oath that we gave to him as well 
as to each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember my grandparents.  They passed away a number of years 
ago.  We celebrated their 25th when I was a little kid.  I do not 
even remember that. 
However, I do remember celebrating their 50th, their 60th and 
their 65th.  Grandfather died when he was 88, in their 67th year 
of marriage.  That is when this part of the vow came into play 
for them:  “Till death do us part”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My own parents have celebrated their anniversaries over the 
years and I certainly remember their 25th, 50th and 60th.  Lord 
willing, they will be celebrating their 65th next year in the 
millennium year.  That is their millennium project.  They are 
still very healthy and we are very grateful for that.  They too 
have had a lifelong, deep, monogamous, faithful relationship with 
each other.  There is a deeply held meaning in the word marriage, 
a union between a man and a woman for life.  As I have said, my 
wife and I share that same meaning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know whether we are ready in this country to start 
fooling around with a definition that is so deeply meaningful to 
so many Canadians.  I am quite convinced that the definition I 
hold, which adds that further dimension to marriage, is one that 
is held by the majority of Canadians; not only by those of the 
Christian faith, but also by those of other faiths.  I think of 
the Sikhs, the Muslims, the Hindus.  They all have a relationship 
of marriage which they clearly understand to be the union of a 
man and a woman.  We err terribly by even suggesting that 
possibly some court could change that definition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am here today to declare that I am going to very solidly, 
proudly and out of a deep sense of duty and obligation vote in 
favour of the motion, and not because it is immediately a threat. 
The Minister of Justice has told us that.  Some of my colleagues 
have already quoted words which she has used both verbally and in 
response to letters from constituents and in response to 
petitions.  The Liberals have no intention of changing the 
definition of marriage from that which is currently in use, it 
being the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all 
others.  That is the current definition.  I believe that they 
have no intention of changing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we bring this motion?  It is very simple.  We want to 
send a loud and extremely clear message, not only to the Canadian 
people but also to the courts of this country, that the will of 
the people as expressed in this democracy is that the definition 
should remain unaltered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Think of the word “spouse”.  What can spouse mean other than 
the wife of a husband or the husband of a wife?  The courts are 
starting to change the word “spouse”.  Even in this House we 
have had some bills like Bill C-78, which in its obscure parts 
refers to anybody in a conjugal relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marriage keeps the government out of our bedrooms because it is 
a valid relationship which stands on its own without inspectors. 
We err when we go in the direction of changing the definition of 
spouse, the definition of marriage and, indeed, the very 
definition of love and lifelong commitment.

about other kinds of relationships today.  There is no doubt that 
they exist.  There is no doubt that people have remained close 
friends and, as some would say, conjugal friends.  I do not like 
the word in that context, but there it is.  Obviously that 
happens.  That is not what we are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am talking about the preservation of the language, of the use 
of the term, what it means as a deep meaning, and this one is the 
union of a man and a woman in marriage.  I do not really think

Speaker, this is the day on which we are having our last debate 
on the expenditure of over $150 billion that we will have to vote 
on later tonight, much later tonight probably.  I am totally 
mystified as to why we have a motion that is a real bogeyman 
before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion makes specific reference to court decisions and is 
seeking to have parliament confirm the idea of marriage.  I would 
ask the member opposite if he is aware of one court decision that 
has anything to do with changing, modifying, even questioning the 
definition of marriage, which is well established in common law, 
or if he is aware of any court decision that has anything to do 
with changing the definition of family.  The only one I am aware 
of is a decision at the trial court level which says very 
specifically that section 15 of the charter cannot be used to 
redefine marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, in answering the question of 
why we are using one of the last days of parliament on this 
issue, it is because of the fact that things roll on when 
parliament is not in session.  I believe that it is timely for us 
to give a very, very strong and clear message to the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that many of these decisions have been coming down at 
lower court levels and so far the upper court has upheld them. 
However, all of the courts are saying to us that they want our 
guidance.  They have said “unless the court speaks”.  Even in 
the most recent M and H decision I believe there was an 
indication that the court wanted a clear indication from 
parliament as to the direction it should be taking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform members today are using this as our opportunity to do 
what the government should have done a long time ago, and that is 
to have a debate and a vote and establish beyond all shadow of a 
doubt what actually is required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have some instances where the courts have actually asked for 
this.  I have several examples here.  They indicate, for example 
in the Rosenberg decision, that the words referring to the 
spouse, at any time, of a taxpayer, include the person of the 
opposite sex or the same sex.  They are changing the definition 
of spouse.  As I said in my speech, what can spouse in the 
context of marriage possibly mean other than the husband of the 
wife or the wife of the husband? 
<P><A NAME="LINK269"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I must say that I share the mystification of the deputy 
whip of the government when she said it is a mystery why we have 
to talk about this.  I never imagined when I was elected six 
years ago that I would ever be in the House of Commons debating 
this issue, the fact that we need to affirm the meaning and the 
cornerstone policy of marriage in our country. 
I think most hon. members have the same feeling yet here we are.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister in October 1996 said that marriage is a 
contract between two individuals according to the Canadian 
tradition of different sexes to share a life together. A 
spokesman for the justice department in January this year said 
common law says that marriage is a union between a man and a 
woman and that is the way it will stay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think a lot of us had thought, hoped and believed that this 
kind of a debate about the meaning of marriage in Canada would be 
totally unnecessary.  Yet as many of my colleagues and others 
have stated here today, there is a growing uncertainty and 
concern on the part of citizens of our country about this seeming 
bedrock concept of Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recent redefinition of spouse by the supreme court is one of 
the things causing this unease.  Of course a spouse is a part of 
a marriage.  Now the courts have said that a spouse is a part of 
other kinds of relationships as well.  In its decision the court 
said that this ruling that redefines spouse “has nothing to do 
with marriage per se”.  It also said “this appeal does not 
challenge traditional conceptions of marriage”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been moves in other parts of the world to re-examine 
this issue.  In 1996 the American Congress passed what is called 
the defence of marriage act.  As the House knows, issues are very 
closely linked in our two countries and in other countries as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That act did two things.  First, it allowed states not to honour 
same sex marriages even if such marriages were allowed in other 
states.  Second, the law defined for the federal code that 
marriage “means only a legal union between one man and one woman 
as husband and wife”.   Interestingly enough, shortly after the 
act was passed, the state of Hawaii had a court decision which 
ruled that forbidding same sex marriages violated Hawaii's 
constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are reasons for Canadians to feel some unease about this 
issue.  In the interventions by some members of the New 
Democratic Party today there is some hostility toward this 
cornerstone definition of public policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unease of Canadian citizens has been demonstrated in some of 
the petitions filed in the House.  I would like to read the 
wording of the petitions that have been filed. Eighty-four 
members of parliament have stood up to present this petition: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the majority of Canadians understand the concept of 
marriage as only the voluntary union of a single (that is, 
unmarried) male and a single (that is, unmarried), female; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And whereas it is the duty of parliament to ensure that 
marriage, as it has always been known and understood in Canada, 
be preserved and protected; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore your petitioners pray that parliament enact 
legislation...so as to define in statute that a marriage can only 
be entered into between a single male and a single female. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this petition we see the anxiety of thousands of Canadians 
who took the time to sign and submit petitions to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also see that the courts are requesting leadership by 
lawmakers on key public policy issues such as this.  There is a 
clear precedent that the courts are prepared to fill in any 
blanks in respect of these kinds of issues, and sometimes even to 
rewrite our laws.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have for example a quote from an article in the <I>Financial 
Post</I> where a financial planner observes: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the law, whether by statute or judiciary, is slowly but surely 
transforming the notion of “family”...the Egan case said...the 
definition of spouse in the Old Age Security Act, which requires 
couples to be of the opposite sex, contravenes the Charter of 
Rights.  But the contravention was saved by the holding...that 
the discrimination is acceptable in a free and democratic 
society. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was one dissenting judge even on that exception. The 
commentator went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We don't believe that such a change is likely in the foreseeable 
future and we are certainly not about to embark upon a campaign 
for change.  On the other hand, we do recognize that societal 
norms are changing and that even if the politicians are super 
cautious, a goodly part of the judiciary does not seem to be 
intimidated. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there is commentary like that, our citizens are concerned. 
They wonder what is going to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the matter of Bill C-78 wherein the provisions of 
the public service pension act were extended to same sex couples. 
This provision of the bill caused real anxiety not only in the 
public but there was some strong reaction by members of the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was the perception that the government was changing some 
of the notions and the definitions of relationships in our 
society by stealth.  I do not want to be unkind but I think that 
was the impression a lot of members of the House got, that buried 
deep in these big bills were going to be the kind of changes to 
the whole notions and constructs of our society that would not be 
acceptable to many Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we see that courts have said that a couple is a couple is a 
couple and that spouse is not limited to marriage partner, in the 
long run people ask themselves, will the distinction between a 
union to procreate and nurture children and all other types of 
relationships be lost? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This leads me to the purpose of bringing forward this motion 
today is to give us as members of parliament the opportunity to 
say that we are determined to be vigilant in regard to these very 
key elements of our social make-up and that we mean business about 
ensuring the stability of this key social construct.  If there is 
doubt, let us clear it up.  If it takes a day of debate to do 
that, then I think it is a very worthwhile day of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of reasons the institution of marriage is 
important.  In the book <I>It Takes Two: The Family in Law and 
Finance</I> by Allen and Richards it is stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marriage is an efficient institution.  Were there a more 
efficient means to raise children, marriage would not have lasted 
over the millennia as the primary form of organization for 
procreation and social structure.  Raising children, not just 
providing for them physically but embodying them with what is 
good and productive, is a complicated business.  Historically, 
the family has been a type of “firm” that has provided parents 
with proper incentives to see the job through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Traditionally, marriage has been viewed as a relationship in 
which there are many stakeholders:  children, parents, the church 
and the state.  Ours may be a more secular (society) but that 
does not absolve us from collectively caring about the success of 
marriage as an institution. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate that all members of the House are prepared to show 
leadership on this important issue.

thought we would never be here discussing this issue.  I 
empathize with what she is saying, but I say to the member how 
fortunate we are to be able to have this debate so that we can 
alleviate some of this anxiety and the perceptions she also 
referred to.

what our constituents are saying. I thank the members who have

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Madam Speaker, I agree with the 
member.  The intent of the motion is not to be partisan.  The 
intent of the motion is to give all of us an opportunity to make 
it crystal clear what parliament means when we refer to marriage. 
It is to provide a means for parliamentarians from all parties 
to remove any doubt about our position on the value and meaning 
of marriage to this country and to this state. We appreciate the 
fact that lawmakers from all parties are participating and are 
making affirmations on this very important point.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I commend my colleague from Calgary—Nose Hill for her 
remarks and the remarks of members opposite on this subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the hon. member that this is not a motion brought 
forward in the spirit of partisanship but as the attorney general 
suggested, hopefully, everybody would be able to support it.  I 
think we have seen today at least from one party and perhaps from 
some government members that is not the case, but it really does 
raise a question in my mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read the motion and it simply says that parliament affirm that 
marriage is and should remain the union of one man and one woman 
to the exclusion of all others, precisely the government's stated 
and ongoing policy. Then I looked at the talking points 
distributed to members of the Liberal caucus, prepared I think by 
Kevin Bosch at their research unit which among other things 
characterizes this motion as being “fearmongering, extremist, 
malicious, divisive, intolerant, meanspirited, singling out and 
demeaning groups” et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member for Calgary—Nose Hill comment on what she 
feels about partisan, hot button, extremist politics like this 
being employed on what should be a non-partisan issue of 
importance to all Canadian families? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would hope that the 
injudicious characterization of this debate is confined to one 
researcher for the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard from many of my colleagues opposite that they feel 
this is an important debate. It is a debate that is meaningful 
and positive for Canadians.  It gives an opportunity to show true 
leadership as we ought to as the elected representatives of the 
people and, as one of my colleagues just said, as the voice of 
the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It saddens me to see that grubby partisan politics have to 
intrude even in such a deep-seated and meaningful issue in our 
country, but I suppose that is the nature of politics.  I do 
appreciate the fact that although some researchers may get 
carried away members of the House show more judiciousness and 
more good sense than that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I should say to the member for Calgary Southeast that what he 
wrote out is generally a stamp that we reserve for all the Reform 
Party motions that come across the floor. Usually they would fit 
into that category.  We were always writing it out in longhand 
and figured it was probably more appropriate that we just get a 
stamp to use. 
Today is an exception because the motion that is before us will 
find a lot of support on this side of the House.  It will 
certainly find support from me, and I am sure that many of my 
colleagues who have already spoken and who will finish out this 
debate will also support it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take the opposite view.  I do not regret or bemoan the fact 
that we are taking what amounts to an expensive legislative day 
in keeping the House going to debate this.  I thank the Reform 
Party for giving us the opportunity to tell our constituents 
exactly how we feel about the issue of marriage, family and what 
makes the country strong.  It is a great opportunity for us to do 
that and I truly do thank the members opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be splitting my time with the member for Charleswood St. 
James—Assiniboia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to add that the information is clear.  While I believe 
that we have been given the opportunity to get our message 
across, the Reform Party knows that the government remains 
committed and has given no signal and no indication that there 
will be a change in its support of Canadian families.  There are 
no plans to legislate a change in the definition of the term 
marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go back to where that comes from.  The definition of 
marriage in federal law is not in a statute passed by parliament 
but is found in what is called the federal common law dating from 
an 1866 British case of Hyde and Hyde v Woodmansee, a case 
dealing with the legal invalidity of polygamy.  This case has 
been applied consistently in Canada with the result that no 
marriage can exist between two persons of the same sex.  It would 
be void ab initio, which means from the beginning. This is clear. 
No jurisdiction worldwide differs in that particular area, even 
though there may be some European or Scandinavian countries that 
do allow same sex partners to register their relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be very interested to hear the position of the Reform 
Party when the province of Alberta, which seems to be leading the 
charge on this, comes out with a plan—and many of these members 
of course are from that province—that would allow same sex 
partners to register an interdependency on one another and 
thereby have access to certain benefit plans such as survivor 
rights or pension rights.  It is actually an interesting solution 
to the problem for those of us who recognize marriage as a union 
between a man and a woman and no one else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a solution because I was in the province of Ontario when 
we had the debate over whether or not we would extend rights to 
same sex couples for benefits.  Many major corporations in the 
country have already done that and are way ahead of government. 
We had a very acrimonious debate on the floor of the legislature 
in Ontario.  The galleries were filled with people who were 
extremely upset.  When the debate was over and we voted against 
extending same sex benefits, the place was literally taken over 
by a mob. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  How did you vote? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  I voted against it.  It was an 
extremely emotional, high strung atmosphere and a very 
unsatisfactory resolution to the particular problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact remains that time moves on and what people are really 
concerned about is the protection of the family.  We do not lose 
rights based on our sexuality or who we are having sex with.  We 
also, in my view, should not gain rights in that regard.  It 
should not be a defining principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Prime Minister Trudeau said, we have no business in the 
bedrooms of the nation, so why would we be using that as some 
kind of measuring stick to determine whether or not someone has 
access to some particular right? 
What I like about the Alberta solution, although I do not know 
the cost of it and I am sure that is being looked at, is that it 
de-sexualizes the whole issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard a gay rights lawyer say that if we simply adopt this 
without looking at the nuances and the difficulties, we could 
have a grandmother declare that a three year old grandson is now 
economically dependent and therefore subject to the survivor 
benefits.  The three year old would then get the survivor benefit 
when the grandmother passes on.  This would throw pension plans 
so dramatically out of whack that no one would be able to afford 
them.  We would be unable to determine the level of premium we 
should set.  I understand that there are some problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we should recognize that this is not about homophobia. 
This is about recognizing the strength of what makes the country 
good and what makes the country strong.  It is the family.  I 
would doubt that there are very many people, even gay members of 
parliament, who would disagree that family is the key to the 
strength of the future of the nation.  My colleague for 
Mississauga South used the term “a line in the sand”.  I would 
use “thin edge of the wedge”.  This is ultimately what the 
debate is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a quote by David Corbett of the Foundation for Equal 
Families.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nobody has proposed a solution that would have marriage as an 
institution available to same sex couples. It is not constructive 
contribution to the debate and it is certainly premature. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that tell us?  It tells me that we are not going to do 
it at this time because it will upset the apple cart.  We will 
move along an inch at a time until we can make more ground.  Let 
us call it for what it is.  The gay rights activists absolutely 
want to have same sex marriages recognized.  They may say they do 
not, but I honestly believe they do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does that mean we have to get homophobic and panicky?  I do not 
think so.  I think it means that in this country, the country 
over which we have the domain as parliamentarians, we will only 
recognize, as our common law states, that a marriage is two 
people of the opposite sex and excludes anyone else.  This is 
common sense to me.  I do not think we have to have a knee-jerk 
reaction to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to those in the gay community that I have no problem with 
their right to not be discriminated again in terms of housing, 
employment, education, equal opportunity, jobs within the 
government, procurement or whatever.  We should not discriminate 
against them based on their sexuality.  However, they have no 
right to claim that they have expanded rights based on their 
sexuality.  As far as I am concerned, it cuts both ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things I find most fascinating about being in this 
place, especially when many of my esteemed colleagues prior to 
arriving here made their living in pursuit of the law or defence 
of the law in one way or another, is when the debate indicates 
that we should let this particular issue go through the courts 
because they will adjudicate and make the decision.  However, on 
this particular issue we cannot have the courts make that 
decision because we are parliament, we are the ultimate and we 
have the right to tell them what to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a judicial system that is one of the finest in the world 
and supported with a parliamentary democracy that is absolutely 
one of the finest in the world.  What we need to do in all cases 
is to make sure that those two systems work in balance; where 
parliamentarians can say what it is they want to have happen in 
terms of the law, but that the judicial system must be available 
without interference from politicians to interpret that law, be 
it the charter of rights or any other individual law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the family.  I support men and women being married.  I 
believe they are the only two who can be spouses.  The government 
supports that and we will stand behind that regardless of any 
attempts to portray us in any other light.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, my 
colleague has touched on many of the concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a very brief question for him.  Bill C-78 provides for 
benefits based on a conjugal relationship.  Pierre Elliott 
Trudeau told us that the state has no business in the bedrooms of 
the nation and took the state out of the bedrooms of the nation 
back then.  I believe that Bill C-78 has put us right back into 
the bedrooms of the nation.  In order to secure the benefits as 
provided for by Bill C-78, we have to prove a sexual 
relationship.  I wonder if the hon. member would like to comment 
on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Madam Speaker, as in many cases in 
this world of politics, there are issues and bills that have some 
difficulties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real value of Bill C-78 for this government was the fact 
that we were able access some $30 billion in capital funds that 
belonged to the taxpayers.  The position of the Reform Party is 
that we should close our eyes, draw the wheels of government to a 
close and not get that money back into the hands of the taxpayer. 
That is why we did Bill C-78.  I voted for Bill C-78 and would 
again. 
<P><A NAME="LINK274"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
do not know if the hon. member is on the MPs' hockey team, but if 
he is he should get the best skating award.  He knew how to skate 
right away from that question.  I am not going to let him get 
away with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard him announce that the great liberal libertarian 
principle of the state does not belong in the bedrooms of the 
nation, with which I concur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fiscal impact of Bill C-78 aside, does he not agree—and we 
may be dealing with legislation of this nature that is more 
expanded in the fall when we reconvene—that benefits provided 
ought not to be provided on the basis of sexual behaviour but on 
some other characteristics, that is, those of dependency?  Can he 
comment on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Madam Speaker, as I said during my 
speech, I do not believe that people should get rights or lose 
rights based on their sexuality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I have mentioned is that I like the balance that I see.  I 
think our other deputy speaker, a member from Alberta, has put a 
paper out as well.  The Alberta government is dealing with an 
issue that I believe we will be looking at it; that is, if they 
do declare dependency economically and pay a family premium. I do 
not think that two people can live together, declare that they 
want to share benefits and then continue to pay a single premium. 
There may be a requirement to adjust those premiums and create a 
third category which could be a declared an interdependency 
category for setting the premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, pensions, survivor benefits and all of those things are 
based on the long range forecast by the economic professionals. 
They are not based on sexuality but on hard dollars and cents. 
<P><A NAME="LINK275"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I would 
like to try this question one more time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-78 benefits are conferred because of a conjugal 
relationship.  The member in his speech clearly said he was 
against that.  Would he state plainly for the record whether he 
was for or against that portion of Bill C-78? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Madam Speaker, I have made it very 
clear that I believe that benefits, in any particular situation, 
should be based on the premiums that are paid.  If we can adopt a 
situation where we can register dependency, and perhaps establish 
a new level premium, then perhaps we could do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The red herring that the members opposite continue to bring up 
with regard to Bill C-78 is nothing more than that, and they know 
that.  They also know that there are numerous government bills 
that will be brought onto the floor of this place that are going 
to involve the same kind of issue.  That is why the government is 
looking at it and we believe it is necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, in spite of the attempts by the members 
opposite to throw me off, I actually, for the first time in my 
two years-plus in this place, support an idea put forward by the 
Reform Party and it frightens the heck out of me.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to participate in the 
debate this afternoon because I take the subject matter very 
seriously.  Ultimately we are talking about minority rights.  In 
a pluralist society of the kind that exists in Canada we have to 
take the matter very seriously and we have to tread very 
carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I truly question the motive of the Reform Party in putting 
forward the motion on the parliamentary calendar for today, I 
have no trouble whatsoever in supporting it.  I will do exactly 
that later tonight and perhaps I will use some of my time to 
explain why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have any trouble supporting the institution of 
marriage.  I consider it an essential part of the bedrock of 
society.  Our society is founded upon the institution of 
marriage, and I cannot imagine civilization being without it as 
we know it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some experience inside the institution of marriage.  I 
was first married more than 39 years ago.  I consider myself to 
be one of the luckiest men on the face of the earth.  I have what 
I think is the perfect wife and perfect mate.  I thank God every 
day that she came into my life many years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marriage is extremely important.  We as parliamentarians have a 
duty to nurture and to support the institution of marriage.  If 
we can do that in some small way through this kind of debate in 
the House of Commons, so much the better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With those few words in support of the institution of marriage, 
I am more than happy to support the motion brought forward by the 
Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do I question the motives of the Reform Party in bringing 
forward the motion?  I question the motives of the official 
opposition because on this matter, which has to do not so much 
with marriage but with gays and lesbians, the Reform Party 
established a certain fact a long time ago, that it is very good 
at the business of scaremongering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to minority rights relating to gays and lesbians, 
the Reform Party cannot think of anything better to do than to 
spread fear where very little fear exists.  I think it was the 
member for Wentworth—Burlington who described the issue as an 
empty controversy.  It is just that, an empty controversy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not aware of anyone who is rushing around, pushing and 
advocating for some sweeping change in the definition of 
marriage.  Maybe the Reform Party is.  Maybe it is the only one, 
but I certainly do not hear it from anyone whom I would consider 
either credible or in large numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice minister, speaking in the House this morning on 
behalf of the government, said that the government was not 
interested at all in changing the definition of marriage.  I do 
not know of any significant group in the country that is 
demanding a change in the definition of marriage.  There may be a 
few; there may be a few gays and lesbians around but I do not 
think they are in large numbers.

<A HREF="#LINKT78"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this particular time in the debate I think gays and lesbians 
are far more interested in other issues connected with this 
matter, especially when it comes to equal benefits.  There may be 
a few but I think it is an insignificant number.  It certainly is 
not the kind of number that would warrant scaremongering, 
spreading fear by the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are the courts in the country demanding that parliamentarians 
change the definition of marriage?  I do not see that.  I have 
read a number of judgments and, yes, they are pushing us with 
respect to providing certain benefits and to removing certain 
discriminatory practices.  However I am not aware of any court 
that is saying that parliamentarians have to change the 
definition of marriage, that we have to change the law so that a 
man can marry a man and a woman can marry a woman.  I do not see 
that at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is out in front leading the charge: the roof 
will fall in and we will face terrible changes.  Nothing could be 
further from the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It reminds me of the Reform Party on the issue of a carbon tax. 
What is the only party in the country that talks about a carbon 
tax?  As far as I know it is not the Liberal Party.  I do not 
know anybody in the Liberal Party who wants a carbon tax.  I 
cannot speak for the Conservatives, but I do not think they are 
leading the way in calling for a carbon tax.  I do not think the 
New Democrats are and I do not think the Bloc is.  Nobody except 
the Reform Party talks about a carbon tax.  The reason it talks 
about it is that it is in its interest to spread fear.  It is 
called fearmongering.  It is the same on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been decisions by judges, by courts, which in effect 
have said that gays and lesbians are treated with less respect 
than they deserve and that there are discriminatory laws, rules, 
and regulations in the country which ought to be removed.  Slowly 
but surely that is where we as politicians and as institutions 
across the country are going.  Those discriminatory practices are 
being stopped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not aware of anyone saying that in the whole process we 
have to change the definition of marriage.  As far as I know, the 
definition of marriage is a couple of opposite sex living 
together, the union of a man and a woman, and that is the way it 
will be.  I do not know what it will be like 100 years from now 
or 300 years from now.  We will all be long gone.  However, for 
the time being I do not think there will be any change 
whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I listen to Reform Party spokespeople, the one thing I 
always listen for is whether they have respect for minorities, 
particularly minorities like gays and lesbians who perhaps face 
discrimination on a daily basis.  We are really talking about 
tolerance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most Canadians are heterosexual.  I do not know what the number 
is.  Perhaps it is 98% or 99%.  Most Canadians are married.  They 
form a huge majority.  It does not take much strength or courage 
to defend the majority, but it does take a bit more strength to 
defend the minorities, especially those who may face 
discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members should go through <I>Hansard</I> tomorrow and look for 
the tolerance that comes from the Reform Party and look for the 
respect it would afford gays and lesbians.  They will find very 
little, if any, evidence of that, which says a lot about that 
party.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am disappointed to hear the bitter, partisan diatribe 
of the member from Winnipeg and to listen to his employing hot 
bottom, divisive politics, extremist rhetorical tactics to create 
partisan division on what should be an issue of some unanimity, 
as he indicated at the outset of his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He suggested that one could read in the remarks made by members 
of my party intolerant comments.  I have not heard anything of 
that nature.  The motion today is very simple.  I will read it 
into the record.  Perhaps the member has not read it: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, it is necessary, in light of 
public debate around recent court decisions, to state that 
marriage is and should remain the union of one man and one woman 
to the exclusion of all others, and that Parliament will take all 
necessary steps to preserve this definition of marriage in 
Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member opposite could identify what he finds offensive in 
the motion, I would be edified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also suggests that there is unanimity on this definition, 
that no one disagrees with it.  He is also contradicting members 
of his own party who have told us that this is a live issue.  The 
member from Mississauga who just spoke quoted Mr. Corbett from 
the Coalition for Equal Families who said that it was premature 
at this time to address this issue.  The member from Mississauga 
pointed out that its “prematurity” implies that it is an issue 
the foundation will be pushing, the change of the definition of 
marriage, at some point in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from Winnipeg is contradicting the remarks of many of 
his colleagues today who have said that this is very much an 
important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would once more point to the policy adopted while I was there 
as an observer at the last policy convention of the Liberal Party 
of Canada, where the party strongly urged the federal government 
to recognize same sex marriages in the same way that it 
recognizes opposite marriages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the hon. member from Winnipeg say that this is a red 
herring and not a real issue and that the opposition is 
fearmongering when in fact his own party has declared this as 
party policy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am happy to respond to 
those unfounded charges.  There is nothing particularly wrong 
with the motion as it reads.  There is nothing particularly 
offensive about it.  It is about marriage.  All of us in the 
House support marriage.  We support the current definition of 
marriage.  That is not a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I referred to the Reform Party as an intolerant bunch and I will 
not back off from that.  It is not so much what its members have 
said in today's debate.  It is what they have left out.  It is 
what is absent.  It is what they have not said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the motion speaks of marriage and the definition of 
marriage, it is as much about gays and lesbians as anything.  I 
noticed in their speeches a lack of respect, common garden 
variety respect, for a minority group, a group of people who 
deserve our respect and our protection, people who deserve equal 
treatment before the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If my friend from Calgary reads the resolution that was passed 
by the Liberal Party of Canada, he will see that it is not 
calling for a change in the definition of marriage.  It is simply 
talking about equal treatment when it comes to the provision of 
benefits. The operative word is benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The courts in many ways have already said that.  The courts have 
simply said that when it comes to benefits we will have to treat 
them as well as we treat anyone else.  That is all the resolution 
is talking about.  It is as simple as that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Madam Speaker, we are finally getting 
to the bottom of it with this hon. member.  He says the courts 
have already changed the definition.  I will read from the 
resolution: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Be it resolved that the Liberal Party of Canada strongly urge the 
federal government to recognize same sex marriages in the same 
way that it recognizes opposite marriages—

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the hon. member stand in his place and deny that this is 
the policy of his party and it, therefore, is very much a live 
matter for public policy debate and for us as parliamentarians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is pretty difficult 
to carry on a debate with an hon. member who deliberately twists 
facts.  He has just said that the courts were demanding a change 
in the definition of marriage.  No such thing exists.  It is the 
same thing with the Liberal Party motion.  It does not demand a 
change in the definition of marriage. 
<P><A NAME="LINK278"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
find it rather unfortunate that we would even have to debate the 
motion that is before the House today, because it is a 
straightforward and common sense motion.  It is rather 
bewildering that anyone would oppose it, yet that is the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin by reading the motion we are debating in the House 
today.  The Reform Party motion put forward for debate today 
reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, it is necessary, in light of 
public debate around recent court decisions, to state that 
marriage is and should remain the union of one man and one woman 
to the exclusion of all others, and that Parliament will take all 
necessary steps to preserve this definition of marriage in 
Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is very clear, unambiguous and straightforward, and 
although one would tend to think that support for it would be a 
given, and that it would be unanimous, that is not the case at 
all.  Before I explain why that is, I would like to commend the 
Reform member for Calgary Centre who moved this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the House knows, the hon. member is our family values and 
family issues critic.  He has worked tirelessly on behalf, not 
only of the Reform Party, but on behalf of all Canadian families 
to defend the rights and traditional values of families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, earlier this year a court decision in British 
Columbia ruled that possession of child pornography was legal. 
It was under the leadership of the hon. member for Calgary Centre 
that the Reform Party led a motion in the House calling on the 
government to invoke the notwithstanding clause and override that 
decision to make it very clear that the Parliament of Canada does 
not accept that child pornography is something that should be 
legally possessed.  Of course, that motion was defeated by the 
Liberals, unfortunately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also earlier this year, when the issue of tax fairness for 
families arose in the House, it was under the guidance of the 
hon. member for Calgary Centre that the Reform Party led a 
spirited debate urging the government to remove tax unfairness 
against families with children.  That also was unsuccessful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to commend not only the hon. member for Calgary 
Centre but his staff for the excellent work they do on behalf of 
the Reform Party in promoting our family values agenda and on 
behalf of all Canadian families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason we have to debate a motion which simply seeks to 
reaffirm that marriage is the union of a man and a woman, is that 
last summer there was a Liberal Party convention held in Ottawa. 
A motion was put forward, debated, voted upon and passed which 
read: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Be it resolved that the Liberal Party of Canada strongly urge the 
federal government to recognize same sex marriages in the same 
way that it recognizes opposite marriages— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official policy of the Liberal Party of Canada is that same 
sex marriages should be recognized in the exact same manner as 
opposite sex marriages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us now turn to the NDP.  I am looking at 1997 campaign 
literature with a big heading that states:  “Equality for Gays, 
Lesbians and Bisexuals:  Alexa McDonough and Canada's NDP”. It 
goes on to say that the member for Halifax and Canada's NDP will 
represent the concerns of gays, lesbians and bisexuals 
consistently.  In fact, that is exactly what they are doing in 
the House today. 
They are siding with the Liberal government and promoting the 
view that the definition of marriage and spouse should be 
changed.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I will read directly from the official Liberal Party 
policy: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—to recognize same sex marriages in the same way that it 
recognizes opposite marriages— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is where the NDPs and the Liberals are coming from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read directly from the policy book of the Reform 
Party for the benefit of members of the House to know where the 
Reform Party stands on these issues.  The section on equality 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party affirms the equality of every individual before 
and under the law and the right to equal protection and benefit 
of the law. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the heading of family it states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party believes a family should be defined as 
individuals related by blood, marriage or adoption.  Marriage is 
the union of a man and a woman as recognized by the state and 
this definition will be used in the provision of spousal benefits 
for any program funded or administered by the federal government. 
The Reform Party supports the principle that government programs, 
policies and legislation should serve to strengthen and protect 
the Canadian family. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP and Liberal policies seek to change the definition of 
marriage and spouse as opposed to the Reform Party position, 
which is strongly opposed to that.  I delineate the different 
positions of the parties for the benefit not only of the members 
of the House, but for all Canadians who may be watching the 
deliberations today.  I urge all Canadians to scrutinize not only 
what their MPs say in the speeches as we debate this issue, but 
in how they vote tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also urge Canadians from coast to coast to keep in mind at the 
time of the next election, albeit that will probably be about two 
years from now, that if they vote NDP or Liberal they will be 
voting for the redefinition of the terms spouse and marriage. 
They will be voting for the recognition of same sex marriages in 
the same way that opposite marriages are recognized, as cited in 
the Liberal policy which was approved at the convention last 
summer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is it important to separate the Reform Party position 
from those of the NDP and the Liberals for the benefit of 
Canadians who wish to make up their minds on how they are going 
to vote in the next election on this, but this debate is also 
very important because of growing public concern over this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent headlines in some national newspapers serve to illustrate 
my point.  A headline in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> read “Same-sex 
partners declared spouses:  Top court ruling expected to topple 
hundreds of laws”.   A headline in the London <I>Free Press</I> 
was entitled “Redefining our Partnerships:  This week's Supreme 
Court of Canada landmark ruling could send aftershocks into 
almost every sector of Canadian life”.   A headline in the 
Montreal <I>Gazette</I> read “Top Court Rewriting Laws of 
Marriage”.  A headline in the <I>National Post</I> read “Ruling 
Alters Way Marriage Viewed:  Family Law Expert—Implications seen 
for adoptions, pensions, property rights”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The source of public concern is not only recent newspaper 
articles and coverage, but also recent court decisions.  Most 
notably, last year there was a decision known as the Rosenberg 
decision in which the Ontario Court of Appeal changed the 
definition of the term spouse in the Income Tax Act to include 
same sex relationships.  The Reform Party debated this in the 
House of Commons and urged the government to appeal that 
decision, but the government refused.  The reason it refused to 
appeal the decision is because of its official policy which was 
passed at the convention last summer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other recent court decision is that of M. v H., in which 
Ontario's family law act was declared unconstitutional because it 
violated the equality rights of homosexuals. 
Following that the justice minister announced that she would 
change the definition of spouse in federal laws in an omnibus 
bill to come down this fall.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice minister is telling everyone that marriage is the 
union of one man and one woman, but justice department 
bureaucrats continue to put together legislation that will render 
the definition of marriage useless and meaningless.  It is 
typical Liberal arrogance and deception, saying one thing and 
doing another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this Reform motion is to pre-empt future supreme 
court decisions by providing leadership and guidance.  The Reform 
motion instructs the court that the legal definition of marriage 
shall remain unchanged.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
the hon. member made reference to the Liberal Party convention. 
As far as I know, what happens at Liberal Party conventions among 
the members is not what is government policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He seems to be continuously confusing what was a recommendation 
made by the membership of the party, which illustrates, in my 
opinion, that in the Liberal Party there can be various opinions 
expressed by the membership.  We have an open party and an open 
process where members of the Liberal Party can express their 
opinions on any issue, but that is not government policy.  I 
would like to make sure the hon. member makes the distinction 
between what was discussed at a convention and what is government 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has no intention of changing the definition of 
marriage, as the Minister of Justice said in the House earlier in 
her speech and in answer to questions by hon. members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about the Reform Party convention and the 
definition of equality.  I would like him to elaborate a little 
more on what is considered equality in terms of the Reform 
Party's policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  Madam Speaker, I do not know what kind of 
animosity or dissension this is going to cause within the ranks 
of the Liberal Party.  Clearly its membership voted on and 
approved a policy which stated that the Liberal Party of Canada 
strongly urge the federal government to recognize same sex 
marriages in the same way that it recognizes opposite marriages. 
If cabinet decides to ignore the official party policy, that is 
not something I would understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way the Reform Party works is that every two years we have 
an assembly.  The membership brings forward policies and 
principles which are debated and voted upon.  The majority will 
of the party membership determines what those policies are.  The 
policies do not come from the leadership or the MPs down; they 
come from the grassroots membership upward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe the hon. member was listening very closely, so 
I will restate the official Reform Party policy which was 
formulated by the grassroots membership, upon which it is 
incumbent for Reform members of parliament to advocate: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party believes a family should be defined as 
individuals related by blood, marriage or adoption.  Marriage is 
the union of a man and a woman as recognized by the state and 
this definition will be used in the provision of spousal benefits 
for any program funded or administered by the federal government. 
The Reform Party supports the principle that government programs, 
policies and legislation should serve to strengthen and protect 
the Canadian family.

<P><A NAME="LINK280"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
this is exactly what my Liberal colleague, the member for 
Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia, was referring to.  It seems 
the members of the Reform Party who spoke earlier must be blind. 
We are sitting here supporting this issue.  Indeed we are saying 
that we believe in the traditional family of a man and a woman. 
Never in M. v H. was there any reference to marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened with greatest to the debate throughout the day. 
Instead of standing and saying that it is great the Liberal 
members are supporting it and that everybody is behind this, 
Reformers are exploiting the situation, saying “don't forget 
when the election comes”.  They are going to see tonight.  I 
think they are using the wrong approach.  It is fearmongering, 
which the member referred to earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am speaking with a loud voice because I am one of the members 
supporting this excellent initiative, yet here we are playing 
partisan politics.  No wonder they are at 6% and dropping.  It is 
sad to say that they cannot read the pulse of the community.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would correct the hon. 
member on one thing.  He stated “We believe in the traditional 
family”. In fact, last summer at the Liberal Party convention 
here in Ottawa, the Liberal Party adopted an official policy that 
the federal government should recognize same sex marriages in the 
same way that it recognizes opposite sex marriages.  That is in 
stark contrast to the position of the Reform Party which believes 
that marriage should remain the union of a man and a woman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member for raising the point about the next 
election because I strongly encourage all Canadians to keep this 
in mind at that time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK281"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, this 
is indeed one of those debates where emotions run high, feelings 
run deep and the understandings are also very much in a state of 
flux. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend a number of members from all parties who have said 
they understand what the meaning of marriage is and that they 
want to support and affirm that marriage is that of one woman and 
one man to the exclusion of all others.  That is our motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to do three things.  I want to deal with the need for 
definition.  I want to deal with the business of choices.  And I 
want to deal with the matter of leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is rather significant.  On the one hand it seems to be 
absolutely clear that everybody understands what marriage is, yet 
the judges want a clear definition and direction.  All kinds of 
acrimonious statements have been made as to what might the 
motivation be, of why the Reform Party would enter this kind of 
debate.  Is it simply for partisan advantage?  Is it strictly 
crass politics and things of that sort? It is nothing of the 
kind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we get into the question of leadership, and that is really 
what we are into here, we want to recognize that one of the most 
important things in leadership is to influence others. In 
particular parliament influences all the people of Canada.  The 
people of Canada will either be affected positively, negatively 
or they may simply turn off, but influenced they are 
nevertheless.  We influence each other here in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the reassertion of the definition we want to influence 
the judges of the land.  We want to make sure that the courts and 
the decisions they render are indeed consistent with the 
definition that is being proposed here. We want to make it 
abundantly clear as well to all members of the House that we 
agree together on what it is we understand by the term marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that we need to have these definitions?  Marriage is 
one of those words that needs a definition but it also has all 
kinds of emotional connotations.  It has spiritual connotations. 
It has the experiential knowledge of each of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I admit that I am a married man.  As of March of this year my 
good wife and I have shared our lives together for 43 years.  It 
has been a wonderful time.  We have had our ups, we have had our 
downs, we have had our disagreements and confrontations, but we 
have lived together in a very happy relationship.  I am very 
proud of it and very thankful for the wife who is mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important thing here is to recognize that we have the need 
to define exactly what it is.  I want to go back in history as to 
how important definitions really are.  It comes to me from the 
field of science. In science we have a very significant 
suggestion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Mendeleev first put together the periodic table of the 
elements, he defined very clearly the order of the elements by 
arranging them in order by atomic number. He discovered there was 
a systematic recurrence of those elements which had similar 
characteristics even though their atomic number increased. 
It was the definition of the periodic table and how it worked 
with the various elements that became very significant not only 
in understanding how the elements work and interact with one 
another, but in order to communicate with others so that they 
could understand what was being talked about.

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can use another example of the need for definition. I like 
this one even better.  It comes from the field of biology and 
botany, medicine if you will.  The botanist clearly defines each 
of the parts of a plant and distinguishes one plant from another. 
It is in this definition where it clearly indicates what a 
particular plant is or what a particular thing is in distinction 
to the exclusion of all others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we are talking about here today. We are not saying 
what marriage is not; we are simply saying what marriage is.  By 
saying what marriage is means it is absolutely nothing else. 
That seems to be lost in this debate somewhere.  We are focusing 
very clearly and very definitely on a particular institution 
which is marriage and which is said very clearly to be the union 
of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others.  That is 
what this is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within that definition we need to be absolutely clear as to 
exactly what we want the courts and judges of this land to 
interpret when they have before them cases dealing with this 
matter. That this is a live issue has become abundantly clear 
with the kind of statements that have come forward from various 
members on both sides of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We simply want to assure and affirm to the people of Canada and 
to all of us here assembled that marriage shall continue to mean 
today and in the future the union of one man and one woman to the 
exclusion of all others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was an amendment put forward this morning “within the 
jurisdiction of parliament”.  Of course, what else would it be 
but within the jurisdiction of parliament?  That is the most 
important part.  This parliament creates the law.  This 
parliament determines the wishes of the people.  It bases the law 
on the determination of the wishes of the people.  Sometimes 
parliament can be wrong and if the government misinterprets what 
the people think, then it gets thrown out as happened recently in 
New Brunswick. We want it to be clear and if all parties agree on 
what the definition of marriage is, then we can recognize that 
all parties in future will recognize that this is what it is.  We 
are parliament.  We create the law of the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the choice that we have here today?  If that is the 
clear definition we are working on, the choice before us is 
whether we will or will not affirm that.  That is the clear 
choice we have today.  That is the motivation behind what the 
Reform Party is doing. We can talk about crass politics and 
partisan politics, but all of that is totally beside the point. 
The choice is very simple: do we or do we not affirm marriage as 
the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all 
others? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it so important that parliament make that choice and that 
decision?  It comes from a number of judges. Here is what they 
have said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, there is the 
long-established principle that in a constitutional democracy it 
is the legislature, as the elected branch of government, which 
should assume the major responsibility for law reform. 
Considerations such as these suggest that major revisions of the 
law are best left to the legislature. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The affirmations also apply to the legislature.  The issues 
here— 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—are of such magnitude, consequence, and difficulty in policy 
terms that they exceed the proper incremental lawmaking powers of 
the courts.  These are the sort of changes which should be left 
to the legislature. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interpretation should be left to the legislature is exactly 
what is meant. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If anything is to be done, the legislature is in a much better 
position to weigh the competing interests and to arrive at a 
solution that is principled and minimally intrusive. 
</UL>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it so important that we make a choice?  I want to read 
this because it is very important to recognize why choices are so 
significant: “I believe every person is created as the steward 
of his or her own destiny with great power for a specific 
purpose: to share with others through service a reverence for 
life in a spirit of love”. No matter what our age, our 
experience or our position, we can dream a dream that will make 
a difference.  We can have a mission that matters, 
the choices we make end up controlling the chooser. 
<P><A NAME="LINK282"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to compliment the member for his comments and the delivery 
of his thoughts on this issue. We are coming to the end of the 
debate. It was interesting to see the support coming forward from 
almost all sides of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has also been interesting to see that some people in the 
House have tried to turn this into something that it is not. This 
is strictly, as the motion says, to reaffirm the definition of 
marriage and to debate it in the House to let Canadians know how 
parliamentarians feel about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been fortunate.  I was married in 1967 and I am still 
married to the same person.  I am fortunate, but possibly she is 
not so fortunate, but we have managed to stay together all these 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commitment that is made to marriage goes beyond trying to 
seek out a partner to get as many benefits as one can from the 
government.  It is what we are talking about today. It is the 
basis for strong families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to comment on the aspect of families and 
society and how the definition of marriage is the basis for all 
that and what strong families can mean to a better Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, to me the family is the 
fundamental unit in society.  History shows very clearly that it 
is the single most effective way of transmitting values from one 
generation to another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also the place where people learn the first elements of 
communication.  It is where they learn the first loving 
relationships that can be developed. It is where caring can be 
established and recognition of the need to have compassion for 
others who are less fortunate, recognition of the importance of 
sharing what one has with others and recognition that indeed this 
business of getting along with others is not automatic. When 
parents have a debate or an argument the children can see that. 
They can recognize it. They see that ways can be found to resolve 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a tremendous learning experience.  The family is 
absolutely critical for doing that.  What does marriage have to 
do with the family?  That is the initial position of the family. 
That creates the family in the first instance.  Are there other 
definitions of family that can be brought into play? Of course 
there are. But marriage is absolutely central at the first 
instance.  At the first level it is central. That is my belief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to go to another 
part of the member's presentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know how passionately the member feels about being a member of 
the House of Commons and how much pride he has in being here. I 
would like him to comment on how feels about the ability to stand 
in this place today and air this issue on all sides.  How 
important is that to the debate that will take place across the 
land? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, you would almost think 
the hon. member has had a chance to look inside my brain and my 
heart.  I thank the hon. member for that question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed it is an honour and a privilege to be here.  How 
important is it for what is going to happen in the rest of this 
land?  It is fundamental and it is setting the direction. 
This place leads the land, but sometimes we wonder in what 
direction it is taking the land.  When we look at the debt 
situation and various other things we ask ourselves that 
question.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie—Lincoln, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
wish to share my time tonight with the member for Thornhill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very happy and pleased to be able to rise tonight on this 
debate.  The hon. member for Calgary Centre has put forth a 
motion for the consideration of the House that the institution of 
marriage is and should remain the union of one man and one woman 
to the exclusion of all others and that parliament will take all 
necessary steps to preserve this definition of marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me clearly state to the House, to the people of Canada and 
most especially to the people of my riding of Erie—Lincoln that 
I support the motion without hesitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The institution of marriage is clearly and unequivocally the 
union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others. 
This definition has been appropriate and has served us well in 
the past.  It is appropriate and serves us well now.  It will 
continue to be appropriate and serve us well in the future. There 
are no exceptions, no qualifications and no limitations. The 
statement is clear and concise.  It is the union of two persons 
of the opposite sex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, this position of the federal common law goes back to the 
1866 British case of Hyde and Hyde v Woodmansee.  This case has 
been consistently applied in Canada.  This long-standing case 
simply states that no marriage can exist between two persons of 
the same sex or between multiple wives or husbands.  This is the 
definition that has been acknowledged and accepted by the 
citizens of the country and by the courts.  Yes, Mr. Speaker, by 
the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider the Ontario case of Layland and Beaulne where 
the applicants sought to use section 15 of the charter of rights 
to bring a change in the commonly accepted definition of 
marriage.  The court soundly and firmly rejected their arguments 
and reaffirmed the long-standing definition of marriage as the 
union of one man and one woman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has no intention now or ever of changing the 
legal and long-standing definition of marriage, or of legislating 
same sex marriages.  Those who would suggest otherwise only serve 
to foment unwarranted fear and divisiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada faces no social problem more important than the 
strengthening of a family, reducing the number of births outside 
marriage, cutting the rates of divorce and coming to the aid of 
children disadvantaged by broken homes.  Every measure must be 
taken to reinforce and revitalize the institution of marriage, 
real marriage between men and women, mothers and fathers, lasting 
for life.  The hon. member's motion is one step in this process 
and he has my support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Same sex marriages do nothing to advance the position of family. 
Same sex marriages are the antithesis of family.  The same sex 
marriage issue has come before the House previously and I and the 
House have unequivocally rejected the concept.  It is 
unacceptable and will not and cannot be tolerated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hopefully the motion before the House today will clarify the 
position of the House once and for all.  I encourage all members 
to support it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK284"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to participate in the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was talking to a constituent earlier who wanted to know what 
we were debating today.  She was wondering if we were changing 
the definition of marriage in the statutes of the Government of 
Canada.  I told her that we were not changing the definition of 
marriage in the statutes of Canada and that the Reform Party, the 
official opposition, was bringing forward a motion to clarify 
that we would not do that.  She then wanted to know why the 
motion was before the House if we were not doing that.  I told 
her that there had been some recent court cases which suggested 
that some of the laws that are presently on the books in Canada 
are unconstitutional and discriminate against same sex partners 
on the basis of the receiving of benefits.  She then wanted to 
know what that had to do with marriage.  I told her that it had 
nothing to do with marriage.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I begin my remarks, I want to reiterate that the decisions of 
the courts of the land have done nothing to change the definition 
of marriage.  I believe that the results of today's vote will 
clearly state to the people of Canada that the courts have not 
changed the definition of marriage nor is it the intention of the 
government to change the definition of marriage.  However, we 
will address those issues which the courts have rightly pointed 
out to us, those issues which may, in the courts' views, be 
treating some citizens of the country in a discriminatory manner. 
That is the role of the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of my remarks, I will focus on the role of the courts in 
these important discussions on public policy issues.  When the 
courts signal to parliament that the charter of rights is not 
being protected for all Canadians, elected legislatures, whether 
it is the federal or provincial government that has passed a law 
that the court has ruled on, are free to choose how to respond. 
However, the solution must be constitutional. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a constitution and a charter of rights and freedoms in 
Canada that we, as parliamentarians and all elected officials 
across the land, have an obligation to live up to.  We must live 
up to the values and principles that are enshrined in that 
charter of rights and freedoms.  I believe I have a 
responsibility, as the member for Thornhill, to do that not only 
on behalf of my constituents but on behalf of all constituents in 
Canada who expect legislators and parliamentarians to protect 
their freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we may not always like the decisions of the courts, we 
must take heed when they say we are not protecting the rights of 
all individuals, that we are discriminating against some.  We 
must update our laws to bring them into compliance with our 
constitutional responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the government's view, the courts have demonstrated an 
appreciation for their role in a democratic society.  I believe, 
and the government believes, that courts must continue to be 
independent and free to make difficult decisions in accordance 
with the principles set down in our charter of rights and 
freedoms.  That is the role that we Canadians have given to our 
courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there is much room for debate on how exactly that role 
should be carried out, in my view it serves no constructive 
purpose to attack the courts for what Canadians have asked them 
to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the contrary, some of the comments that we have heard in the 
House and elsewhere have suggested that the courts have no 
business making decisions that declare unconstitutional laws that 
have been passed in parliament.  In doing so, some would suggest 
they are usurping the public interest and the public policy 
functions of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This term is often described as judicial activism.  Critics of 
judicial activism, in my view, are deliberately creating an 
impression that the courts are usurping to themselves a role that 
is not contemplated in our democratic constitutional structure, 
an impression which causes people to question the legitimacy of 
the role of the courts in the development of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that has a negative impact on the pride we have in our 
institutions and on the important role that we play.  There is 
clearly a difference between the role of parliament and the role 
of the courts.  We need both of those institutions to hold the 
respect of the public if we are to succeed in the kind of public 
policy making that is in the interests of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impression that is being left as to the inappropriateness of 
the courts having this role is not only misleading, but it raises 
the potential for serious harm to the credibility of an important 
institution, the Canadian court, and the public perception of our 
whole justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I give this cautionary note not only to the people who are in 
this House today listening to this debate but also those who are 
watching.  When concerns are expressed about the extent to which 
the courts are now prepared to use the power of judicial review 
under the charter, it is helpful to bear in mind not only that 
the power of judicial review has always existed under Canada's 
constitution but also, quite apart from the power of judicial 
review, Canada's courts have always had a significant role to 
play in relation to the law making function of government, 
particularly through the development of Canadian common law.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the courts in their interpretation that have given us the 
body of court cases and common law that is the foundation of our 
judicial system.  I would say to the House that if we tear that 
down, we tear down not only a fundamental institution in our 
society but we tear down the freedom and the right of Canadians 
to expect fairness in the judicial system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that the courts have a more high profile 
role since we have the charter, a charter, I might say, that was 
brought to us by our now prime minister.  I know it is something 
he is particularly proud of after 36 years in this wonderful 
House.  His pride in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
is something that I think all Canadians can share. It is their 
charter of rights and freedoms, and it is their supreme court 
that makes the interpretations of that charter that guards the 
rights and freedoms of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that is one of the reasons that the United Nations, for 
the sixth year in a row, has declared Canada the number one 
country in the world.  There are many things for us to be proud 
of, but the important role of our judiciary in safeguarding our 
rights and freedoms, and sometimes pushing parliamentarians and 
legislators to do the right thing, is a very important function. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present debate about the role of the courts is not 
surprising because of how young our charter is.  When we look 
around the world we see that wherever there is a constitution it 
is constantly being defined and refined according to community 
values and standards in the courts in the free world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth of the matter is that the Supreme Court of Canada has 
shown itself to be very sensitive to the concerns about judicial 
review, but that critics of judicial activism over the years have 
done a great disservice to our court.  We are not only talking 
about a judiciary that holds legislation unconstitutional with 
great abandon.  They do not do that.  They are a very 
conservative court.  If we look at the record of their judgments, 
they have acted appropriately in the interest of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should keep in mind the observations of Peter Hogg, one of 
Canada's pre-eminent constitutional scholars, who said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judicial review is not a veto over the politics of a nations, but 
rather, the beginning of a dialogue as to how best to reconcile 
the individualistic values of the charter with the 
accomplishments of social policies for the benefit of the 
community as a whole. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope today's debate will not confuse anyone.  I hope today's 
debate will not send out a message to anyone that is different 
from the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the decisions of the court have been consistent 
with protecting the rights and privileges of every Canadian.  The 
decisions of the courts have said to the governments that they 
cannot and must not discriminate against individuals.  Those 
decisions have done nothing to change the definition of marriage 
in the country and it is not the policy of the Liberal government 
to change the definition of marriage.  What makes the debate 
today very important is that it gives us a chance to state that 
clearly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I wind up the debate, I say to the House that it has been a 
privilege to have the opportunity to clarify and state on behalf 
of the people of Thornhill that I believe that the courts play an 
important role in protecting our rights and freedoms in Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK285"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member for Thornhill once again, as some of her 
colleagues have done, expresses curiosity at why we should be 
discussing this motion here today, as though no one in the 
country, as the attorney general suggested earlier, is even 
discussing the question of the redefinition of marriage.  We have 
plainly had it proposed right here in the House today by members 
of this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member went on to say at the end of her remarks that it 
was not the policy of the Government of Canada to change the 
legal definition of marriage, but eight or nine minutes of her 
ten minute talk was a lecture on the importance of judicial 
review.

<A HREF="#LINKT89"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No member of the opposition or nobody who understands the 
constitution would disagree with the necessity of judicial 
review, that is to say, the appropriate interpretation of 
statutes in light of our charter and constitutional framework. 
Objections are raised by us and others when the courts go beyond 
interpretation to legislate from the bench without an appropriate 
authority in the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see nowhere in the charter a basis for changing the legal 
definition of marriage.  Yet we have recently seen a change in 
the legal definition of spouse, so this is a reasonable question. 
The hon. member said that the government does not have a policy 
on this.  Her party does.  I was at the Liberal Party convention 
last summer where a policy was passed that said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Be it resolved that the Liberal Party of Canada strongly urge the 
federal government to recognize same sex marriages in the same 
way that it recognizes opposite marriages— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply ask the hon. member for Thornhill how this question is 
not relevant.  How is it not a question of public debate when her 
own party introduced it as a matter of public debate and urged 
her government to change this policy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to reiterate 
once again that the facts before us today are very clear.  We 
have not had a court decision which changes the definition of 
marriage.  It is not the stated policy of the government to 
change the definition of marriage.  It is only the Reform Party, 
in its own mind, that is suggesting that any of those things are 
occurring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why Reformers brought forward the motion today.  That is 
why it has been referred to as a red herring.  That is why it is 
frankly confusing Canadians.  I say that again to the member 
opposite who clearly does not want to hear the facts because they 
do not fit with his agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have served in opposition.  It is clear what Reformers are 
doing.  This is opposition for opposition sake.  With all the 
important things on the public policy agenda, these folks today 
come in with a motion clearly designed to confuse Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The courts have not changed the definition of marriage.  The 
government has no intention of changing the definition of 
marriage.  What we are intent on doing is ensuring that Canadians 
are not discriminated against. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the court points that out to us, we are prepared to update 
our laws to ensure that all Canadians live in a society free from 
discrimination wherever possible. 
<P><A NAME="LINK286"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
the hon. member across the way keeps saying that the courts have 
not changed the definition of marriage.  The Liberal approach 
seems to be to wait until the courts change it and then draft 
some legislation around it.  In that way the people are shut out 
of the process.  The courts have changed the definition of spouse 
and the government is now intending to change the legislation 
around that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why can we not take a proactive approach, as we are doing today, 
to pre-empt a court ruling? The government would hide behind the 
robes of supreme court judges to put forward legislation along 
the lines of a redefined definition of marriage.  That is what 
this is about today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If tomorrow the courts were to rule that the opposite sex 
definition of marriage is unconstitutional, what would the hon. 
member across the way do about that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan:</B>  Madam Speaker, I heard the member 
opposite say that he would like to change the definition of 
marriage.  The government does not want to do that.  The Liberal 
Party, as reflected in its policies in the House and during the 
previous election campaign, does not want to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not expect it is an issue that will be before the House. I 
am quite surprised that the member would say that he wants to 
move ahead with a debate and discussion that would change the 
definition of marriage.  We do not believe Canadians want that at 
this time, and I am surprised that he would suggest it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK287"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I will be 
sharing my time with the hon. member for Calgary Southeast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been quite fascinating to sit in the House and watch this 
debate.  Normally we would think an opposition motion supported 
by the government would be cause for celebration.  Normally I 
would expect to say to my colleagues across the way that we are 
on the same wavelength.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened to those who have tried to impugn the motive of 
the motion.  I do not quite understand how anyone can look into 
the heart of someone making a motion and tell what the motives 
are.  I wish the motion could stand as it is, because it is an 
affirmation of marriage as most Canadians understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will explain again to my colleagues why I think the motion is 
worth while and necessary.  It is because there are signs that 
marriage is under some stress in terms of definition.  I will 
list for my colleagues some of the signs I see.  I come to this 
as a clinician who counselled about marriage for 25 years of my 
life.  I have watched marriage decrease in terms of its 
importance in Canada as well as some definitional changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we need clarification?  I say we do.  Do we need 
reaffirmation of the definition of marriage?  I say we do.  One 
of the things I have watched is a redefinition of spouse.  It 
happened so recently that I am surprised my colleagues across the 
way would not reflect upon it.  There has been a recent 
redefinition of spouse in the courts of Canada.  That is an 
indication that there is a very definite need to take a specific 
stand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do my own constituents say about it?  I live in southwest 
Alberta and I took the opportunity to poll my constituents in 
relation to what they think about marriage.  They have some 
concerns and are worried.  They are very firm on the issue of no 
redefinition of marriage.  They say that marriage must be as they 
have traditionally understood it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are the courts gradually changing the institution of marriage 
and the long term future of marriage?  My answer is a resounding 
yes.  Parliament should be, 100%, the last bastion for marriage 
when it comes to definition.  There should be no social or 
judicial activism when it relates to marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look outside Canada for evidence on whether marriage is 
being redefined elsewhere.  There was a recent attempt to 
redefine marriage in the states of Alaska and Hawaii.  I had one 
of my colleagues make light of it and jokingly say that in one 
spot their brains were frozen.  It was not light at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In those areas they tried to redefine marriage in a very 
specific legislative way.  They handled it a different way from 
judicial activism.  Both states went to the public with 
referendums at election time.  It was fascinating to see what 
happened in both Alaska and Hawaii as they tried to openly and 
vigorously redefine marriage.  In both cases the public rejected 
the redefinition of marriage.  That tells me where the public is, 
along with my constituents who say that a redefinition of 
marriage is not on.  The redefinition was renounced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It concerns me that many of my colleagues seem to ignore what 
the social activists say.  We have heard two or three times in 
the House that the redefinition of marriage according to social 
activists is premature.  That tells me whether or not the issue 
is on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had an opportunity in the last parliament to debate Bill C-33 
respecting sexual orientation and non-discrimination.  I stated 
in the House publicly that I felt it was part of an ongoing 
campaign to redefine marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also stated that there were four steps.  The first step was 
what Bill C-33 was trying to do.  The second step was a 
redefinition of spouse.  The third step was adoption.  The fourth 
step would be a redefinition of marriage.  I was roundly 
condemned by my colleagues across the way for saying that, but 
not five minutes after that bill passed a social activist in the 
House stood outside in the lobby and said that was exactly what 
was going on, that was exactly the intent.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To my Liberal colleagues who say there is nothing in the Liberal 
Party of Canada government-wise, I cannot imagine how a 
resolution passed at its last convention can be so quickly 
ignored.  It says: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the Liberal Party of Canada strongly urged the federal 
government to recognize same sex marriages in the same way that 
it recognizes opposite marriages in its distribution of benefits. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was not done in isolation.  This was not done in a vacuum. 
This was done actively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am delighted that my Liberal colleagues will support the 
motion.  The statement we are making today is not so much for 
those of us in the House as it is profoundly important to the 
courts.  The vote on the importance of the definition of marriage 
is probably the most important vote we will take in the House 
during my time here.  I am delighted that my colleagues across 
the way will be supporting it.  For those who cannot, I will be 
interested in listening to their rationale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would normally be a cause of celebration for me to say that 
we are on the same wavelength, that we are on the same path.  I 
have difficulty understanding the issue of trying to find bad 
motives because I think the motives are very plain: affirmation 
of the strongest institution in Canada, affirmation of marriage. 
<P><A NAME="LINK288"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I am informed there are so many people on this side of the House 
who wish to speak that I will not have an opportunity to deliver 
a full speech.  However, I will take the opportunity to ask a 
question or make a comment in respect of the very important 
debate we are having today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I unequivocally congratulate the hon. member for bringing 
forward the motion.  I agree with everything the previous speaker 
just said.  It is absolutely critical that the House speak to 
this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a couple of questions for the hon. member as I have heard 
a few incorrect statements made in the House.  Would the hon. 
member agree there is no statute with respect to marriage that 
deals with the capacity to marry? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he agree that the only statute the Parliament of Canada 
has is chapter M-2 of the Revised Statutes of Canada which 
contains three sections and is called the Marriage Act?  None of 
those three sections deal with the fundamental issue that a 
marriage can only be between a male and a female and only of a 
single male and a single female. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he agree with me that no statute in fact deals with this, 
that it is judge-made law, and that the problem is that if it is 
judge-made law judges can change it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a second question about whether he would agree, for those 
who have been bandying about supreme court cases and in 
particular the case of M. v H., that the majority in this case 
said the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We emphasize that the definition of “spouse” found in s. 1(1) of 
the FLA, and which applies to other parts of the FLA, includes 
only married persons and is not at issue in this appeal. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, M. v H does not deal with the issue of marriage 
and should not be used to cloud this debate.  Would the hon. 
member agree with these two statements? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am not a solicitor or a 
lawyer so when it comes to the nuances of law I have some 
difficulty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do know that the two statements of the hon. gentleman across 
the way are true.  They are accurate statements.  From my own 
perspective I simply want to reaffirm the importance of marriage 
as an institution in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am delighted to hear that the member opposite will be voting 
for the motion as will many of his colleagues across the way.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the 
hon. member made reference to debate that occurred in the House 
on Bill C-33.  I would like to quote one of his members in terms 
of what he said during a debate we had which was to expand human 
rights protection to prohibit discrimination on the basis of 
sexual orientation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Yorkton—Melville said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe this legislation will lead to redefinition of the 
family, marriage and spouse in Canadian law which in turn will 
permit gay marriages, spousal benefits to gay couples, gay 
adoption, restriction of religious freedom and expression, and 
open the door for sex perverts and pedophiles to seek Charter 
protection by claiming that their criminal sexual preferences are 
just another sexual orientation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was said on May 2, 1996.  Despite the member's gloom and 
doom scenario, no Liberal policy has left the door wide open for 
“sex perverts and pedophiles” as the hon. member predicted in 
his fearmongering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the hon. member made reference to Bill C-33, does he agree 
with the comments made by the other member of his party? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill:</B>  Madam Speaker, of course history will 
prove or disprove any comments made in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I of course have paid some attention to what has happened in 
British Columbia with a recent judicial decision that has made 
the possession of child pornography quite acceptable.  My 
constituents disagree vigorously with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important thing I am saying today, and I will say it as 
plainly as I can to the member, is that this is about affirming 
the importance of the institution of marriage.  If the member 
opposite is not comfortable with that I am interested as to why. 
If we want to go off on a tangent in other areas, she may, but I 
will not. 
<P><A NAME="LINK290"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise in debate on the motion brought before us by 
the official opposition, which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, it is necessary, in light of 
public debate around recent court decisions, to state that 
marriage is and should remain the union of one man and one woman 
to the exclusion of all others, and that Parliament will take all 
necessary steps to preserve this definition of marriage in 
Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The definition included in the motion before us is the standard 
common law definition which the government affirms, for instance, 
in its response to the many tens of thousands of petitions 
brought before this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are simply seeking to reaffirm what has been the legal common 
law understanding of the past 150 years or more in Canada and the 
Commonwealth and, more importantly, to reaffirm the normative 
understanding of an essential social institution, the basic 
institution of civil society as it has been understood for 
millennia, through all of human civilization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members opposite, including the member for Thornhill, the 
hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health, have 
indicated that this is a moot point and a redundant motion 
insofar as no one is proposing any changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find this quite unbelievable because I have several times 
today quoted from what I think is a relatively important 
authority which has proposed a change to the law in this respect 
and that institution just so happens to be the Liberal Party of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I want to commend members opposite for supporting this 
motion, and I commend the many members who have stood in the 
House to indicate that they share our view, that this is an 
important debate to have so that we can place on the official 
parliamentary record the importance of reaffirming the common law 
understanding of marriage.  Yet we have heard from certain 
members opposite, such as the member for Thornhill, the member 
for Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia, the parliamentary 
secretary to the attorney general, and the attorney general 
herself, who said this morning:  “Why use the already limited 
time of the House to debate a motion, on which, I suspect, there 
will be no fundamental disagreement inside or outside the 
House?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as I was standing, the hon. member for Thornhill said that 
no one is proposing any changes to the definition of marriage. 
Then why is it that I have in my hand a resolution passed by the 
duly elected delegates of the Liberal Party of Canada at their 
policy convention last summer, where I stood as an observer, 
which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Be it resolved that the Liberal Party of Canada strongly urge the 
federal government to recognize same sex marriages in the same 
way it recognizes opposite marriages—

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just a moment ago the member from Thornhill said that no one is 
proposing a change.  The Liberal Party of Canada is proposing a 
change.  The Government of Canada may not be responding to its 
party members.  That is its own business.  It can govern its own 
affairs as it wishes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is absolutely incumbent upon us to point out that 
people are proposing change in an institution no less than the 
Liberal Party of Canada.  Hon. members say that we should let the 
courts tend to their business of judicial review, that we have 
the charter and the charter will be interpreted fairly by the 
courts and members of this parliament can sit by as passive 
observers and watch that process unfold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one were to have suggested at the time of the introduction of 
the charter of rights that the legal definition of spouse would 
be fundamentally changed, people would have said that is 
unbelievable.  That is fearmongering, they would have said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the major decisions in the charter era was the 
Morgentaler decision striking down section 251 of the Criminal 
Code in 1988.  Yet back in 1981, when the charter was debated in 
this place, the then attorney general, the current Right Hon. 
Prime Minister, was asked at committee whether any section of the 
charter could possibly be used to strike down the criminal 
provisions with respect to abortion and the then attorney 
general, the now Prime Minister, said, “Oh, no”.  He said it in 
<I>Hansard</I>.  We can reference it.  The point is that we cannot 
predict with any degree of certitude what the courts are likely 
to do in their increasingly expanded understanding of judicial 
review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why it is incumbent upon us to accept the invitation of 
the judges, of the courts, to enter into a dialogue.  A dialogue 
is a two way conversation.  It is not a monologue.  To date we 
have merely had a monologue from the courts on issues of this 
nature.  It is now time for parliament to speak so that we are on 
the record as asserting the current legal common law definition 
of marriage as a union between one man and one woman, to the 
exclusion of all others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot imagine why this would be a controversial motion.  I 
cannot imagine why the Liberal Party would propose to scrap this 
definition.  I cannot imagine for my own purposes why the courts 
of Canada would choose to change substantively the nature of 
marriage in law as they have essentially done through the M and H 
and other related decisions regarding spousal relations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear.  The Liberal member from Mississauga quoted Mr. 
Corbett from the Foundation for Equal Families as saying that at 
this point the question of the definition of marriage is 
premature, from which a reasonable person could infer that his 
organization and like-minded individuals will use their 
democratic right to go to the courts to seek a redefinition of 
marriage; not at this time, because they do have an incremental 
legal agenda, and that is quite understandable, but at some point 
in the future.  I do not think any reasonable person can have any 
doubt that a litigant will come before our courts seeking to 
strike down the current exclusionary definition of marriage, the 
common law definition, using as a basis the charter of rights. 
The government's posture, as articulated today, would be to sit 
back passively and allow the courts possibly to redefine the 
meaning of marriage at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we have come before the House today in 1999.  That 
litigation might not occur this year.  It might not occur for 
three or four years, but sooner or later it surely will occur. 
If we pass this motion tonight the Parliament of Canada, the 
supreme lawmaking body of this country, will have spoken and will 
be on the record affirming the age old common law understanding 
of the institution of marriage, which is absolutely central to a 
healthy civil society.

like to applaud the Reform Party for the motion that it has 
brought forward today and the dialogue that has taken place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a lot of unease over the last while with respect 
to some of the decisions taken by the courts.  I do not believe 
that those recent decisions apply to today's debate, but I 
applaud the merits of the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Calgary Southeast said that he could not 
imagine why anybody would have a problem with the motion which 
has been put forward.  He pointed out quite clearly that because 
of the charter a lot of decisions have started to take place.  If 
it was proclaimed that the definition of spouse and marriage 
could be changed when the charter was brought in in 1982, I 
guarantee members that the artificial support we had for the 
charter would not have been there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The definition of marriage has always been that of a union 
between a man and a woman.  In his opinion, does he agree that it 
always should be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Madam Speaker, absolutely, and I 
appreciate the intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Politicians seem to think that we can change the ontological 
meaning of words, of concepts.  Marriage has enormous meaning. 
It has a certain objective meaning.  It is tautological to say 
that marriage is a committed relationship between a man and a 
woman.  It is tautological.  Of course marriage means that.  Not 
even the Parliament of Canada, not even a bunch of judges can 
change a metaphysical reality.  That is what a marriage is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People will come before the courts seeking to change the legal 
privileges given to married people and to expand them. However, 
there is a certain reality.  Marriage is marriage.  It is between 
a man and a woman and it can be between no others.  We are simply 
affirming that basic metaphysical reality through this motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK292"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I have 
listened to the debate today and I want to thank the hon. member 
for his comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the charter of rights was introduced I do not think that 
anyone would have believed that prisoners would receive the right 
to vote based upon the charter.  I do not believe that anyone in 
Canada would have believed that bogus refugees, as soon as they 
land in Canada, would have all of the protections of the charter 
of rights and freedoms.  I do not believe that the people of this 
country, at the time the charter was brought in, would have 
believed it if someone would have said that it would be used to 
strike down the abortion laws of the Criminal Code of Canada.  I 
do not think the people of Canada back in those days would have 
believed that this government would bring in a bill that would 
allow for benefits to be transferred to Canadians based upon a 
sexual relationship, and Bill C-78 has done exactly that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the whole institution of marriage and its 
definition, when we listen to people who scorn or attack the 
motion, saying that it is a moot question or a waste of time, and 
when we look at the history of what the charter has done to 
society in this country, we have reason to be concerned.  I would 
like the member to comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Madam Speaker, the member for Crowfoot 
makes the point very well.  We all support appropriate judicial 
review where the courts narrowly use their appropriate 
constitutional authority to interpret and define the laws. 
But for the courts to invent rights in the charter which are not 
explicit, which were not enshrined in it by the framers in 1982 
is illegitimate in our view.  That is why we must speak, to make 
it clear and plain to the courts that no jurisprudence can change 
the common law understanding of marriage.  This parliament will 
take whatever action is necessary to uphold marriage contra any 
decision by the courts.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
do not hesitate in supporting your calling the House to order at 
such a solemn moment, not just because I am rising to speak, but 
also because I believe the matter raised by the Reform Party is 
an important one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the Reform Party that we need to discuss these 
matters.  I am not of course in agreement with the position 
proposed.  We need to discuss these matters because marriage is 
not a reality of divine right.  It is not something that exists 
in itself, but something set out in legislation, and therefore 
something important for us to discuss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I have about 20 minutes, I will take the time 
to read the wording of the motion in order to clearly set 
today's debate in context.  The Reform Party motion reads as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, it is necessary, in light of 
public debate around recent court decisions, to state that 
marriage is and should remain— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see the imperative nature of this motion. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all 
others, and that Parliament will take all necessary steps to 
preserve this definition of marriage in Canada. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, some people have asked whether the wording “all 
necessary steps” means going so far as to use the 
notwithstanding clause.  The question can be asked, and I think 
that members of the Reform Party will have to answer it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that marriage should be limited to one man and 
one woman.  I am among those who believe—and I will give my 
reasons later—that we should consider opening up the institution 
of marriage because marriage is not a divine right.  It is an 
institution that required lawmakers to step in, and that is why 
conventional marriage as we know it is a prerogative of this 
parliament.  The solemnization of marriage is a prerogative of 
various legislatures, but the definition of marriage has 
required that lawmakers step in, or we would not be looking at a 
motion such as this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If marriage were limited strictly to canonical law, it would not 
concern us as parliamentarians.  But canonical law is not the 
issue here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that throughout their history, our Reform Party 
colleagues have made a number of attempts, some of them more 
adroit than others, to limit or refuse to recognize the right of 
two men or two women to form a conjugal union.  I say again that 
I believe strongly that two men or two women can form conjugal 
unions and that lawmakers must recognize this reality, much as 
the supreme court has done in its recent decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before exploring this topic any further, I want to ask to what 
the motion is referring when it mentions various court decisions. 
Since 1992 a number of decisions both of administrative 
tribunals and of superior courts, such as the Ontario Court of 
Appeal and the supreme court, have progressively recognized and 
established case law and have handed down decisions recognizing 
same sex couples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give a bit of background here.  I know that I 
have the House's full attention and I am delighted.  In 1992, 
when Kim Campbell was the minister of justice—I do not want to 
dredge up bad memories in the House—a decision was handed down by 
the Ontario Court of Appeal. 
This decision was the start of abundant jurisprudence.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992, in the Haig case, the Ontario Court of Appeal 
overturned the Canadian human rights legislation saying that it 
was unconstitutional because it did not recognize sexual 
orientation as a prohibited grounds of discrimination. The 
government amended the law and we are grateful to it for doing 
so. This was at the time the current Minister of Health was the 
minister of justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the Haig decision, there was increasing recognition in 
legal annals that continued to grow in strength. 
Real case law was therefore born giving recognition to the fact 
that there could be common law conjugal unions between two men 
and two women, that is, partners of the same sex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was the decision in Haig. Recently there was the decision 
in Rosenberg where once again the Ontario Court of Appeal 
overturned certain provisions of the Income Tax Act saying that they 
were not compatible with section 15 of the Canadian charter of 
human rights by not according same sex partners survivor 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Treasury Board amended this legislation. 
We would have preferred an omnibus bill.  I have been tirelessly 
proposing year after year since 1994 in private member's bills 
that parliament acknowledge same sex spouses and permit passage 
of a single piece of legislation amending all existing laws. 
There are some 70 laws. All heterosexual definitions according 
benefits and requirements would include a homosexual definition 
of spouses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not despair because increasingly persistent rumours—and I 
ask the parliamentary secretary to nod if she believes these 
rumours have some basis—are intimating that in October the 
government will table, in an unprecedented act of generosity, a 
bill recognizing same sex spouses. 
I can tell him in advance that he can count on my support and, 
more widely, that of the Bloc Quebecois, I believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When addressing these issues, we are speaking of the recognition 
of spouses of the same sex.  That is what the Reform Party 
members are against.  They have in fact introduced a motion 
against the Rosenberg decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians, Quebecers and all those who support human rights must 
know that the Reform Party does not recognize that two women or 
two men can love each other and be protected by the legislator. 
That is the starting point of a debate such as the one we are 
having here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since they do not acknowledge the existence of such a reality, 
hon. members will realize that anything even remotely connected 
to this is also disapproved of by the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is their right as parliamentarians to discuss these matters 
and to hold that position but, in my opinion, 
their position is archaic and dated. It is rooted in another 
century.  Canadians and Quebecers are far more generous in 
spirit than the Reform Party would have us believe.  All those 
who agree with me applaud now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, we agree that Canadians and Quebecers are 
far more generous, tolerant and open-minded than the Reform Party 
would have us believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B> Long live Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> I would ask the hon. parliamentary secretary 
to keep her cool.  I sense this may be going somewhere I do not 
wish to go.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no one in the House who can say how many people of 
homosexual orientation there are.  Why is that so?  Because it 
is not part of our tax returns.  When people file tax returns 
they do not declare whether they are heterosexual or homosexual. 
When there is a census we do not declare whether we are 
heterosexual or homosexual.  So no one can say how many in the 
population are gay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we do know, however, is that gays are taxpaying members of 
society, members of the workforce.  Often they are involved in 
their communities.  There is no reason that would justify our 
not recognizing that reality, as parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recognition of marriage, as you 
yourself have experienced it, Madam Speaker, is not something 
the gay community is calling for.  In the last five years I do 
not think I have met ten people in the community who have told 
me they thought I should take up this battle.  It is not a big 
issue in the gay community, which is not to say that it is not 
discriminatory to prevent homosexuals from marrying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may not be a big issue in the gay community but last year an 
application was made to the Quebec superior court for a 
declaratory judgment nonetheless.  If Reform Party members wish 
to read this application I am prepared to table a copy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would bring home to parliamentarians that although this is 
not a major issue in the community and although there is a 
stronger body of opinion calling for recognition of same sex 
spouses, there are in fact a few cases pending before the 
courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year two Quebecers, Michael Hendrix and René Leboeuf, made 
an application for a declaratory judgment to strike down article 
365 of the Civil Code.  A number of arguments were advanced that 
I think it would be useful to share with the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to digress at this point to say that if someone 
offered to marry me tomorrow morning it is not a course I would 
take, although someone does have his eye on me and any desire I 
may have had to remain unattached is flagging.  After three 
years, perhaps my colleagues have noticed that I am a different 
man when I am in love. 
I say that even if marriage were legalized I would not commit 
to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in all logic, in all fairness, I think we must 
recognize that homosexual men and women are similar to people 
who have married. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will share with members some arguments that were made in the brief 
tabled by Mr. Hendrix and Mr. Leboeuf in an application for a 
declaratory judgment. I dedicate these arguments to the Reform 
members and hope they will listen carefully. They wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are considered to have the same rights and the same 
obligations in their union. Together they have acquired 
matrimonial property and therefore have a common heritage. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that when we live together for five, six, 
eight or ten years we build a common heritage. This is 
undeniable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They wrote further: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They vowed respect, fidelity, help and assistance to each other. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If fidelity, respect and mutual assistance are attributes of a 
heterosexual union, there is no reason to think that they are 
not also attributes of homosexual unions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They lived together without interruption from the start of their 
union. 
Although there were no children, they have formed a family unit 
since the start of their relationship, just like childless 
married couples. 
</UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT98"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude this part of my remarks by saying that 
the co-applicants, just like heterosexual married couples, 
established and maintained from the start of their shared life a 
permanent family residence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why am I doing this? Because, in strict civil and legal terms, 
there is no argument against the fact that two men or two women 
may live in extremely similar unions that have the same 
characteristics of heterosexual unions characterized by ties of 
marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally what make the difference—and I respect that—are 
religious convictions. 
It is obvious that in the official line of the church, in its 
official doctrine, there is no recognition of homosexual 
marriages just as there is no recognition of divorce.  Does 
this mean that if the Reform Party insists on sticking to 
strictly religious arguments it will have to have an 
opposition day before the end of the present session in order to 
have it acknowledged that divorce also cannot be recognized?  If 
one sticks to official church doctrine, divorce is something 
reprehensible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members can see where this type of argument, which seeks to 
limit the debate to religious considerations, can lead. 
My point is that. if men and women make a commitment to a union, 
provide each other with support, are together and are happy 
together in a free-will arrangement, if they share assets, if 
they have a family home and define themselves as a family—what is 
termed common repute—then in my opinion there is no reason 
whatsoever not to recognize a marriage between two men or two 
women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the principal spokespersons of the gay community were here 
right now—which, as hon. members may know, means the gays in 
three major centres, Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal—I believe 
they would agree with me that this is not an important debate 
among them, that it is not a demand being made by the gay 
community. 
The fact remains that it is discriminatory to deny people access 
to the institution of marriage and to recognize it as the sole 
prerogative of the heterosexual community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that along the way we will understand and once and for 
all the Reform Party members will rise in the House and admit 
that their arguments are based on religious beliefs, which I 
respect.  However religious beliefs cannot be included in a bill 
because any reference to God has to be in the plural.  Religion 
is a system of symbols that help us to understand the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians, we are well aware that the days of 
religious monolithism are gone.  The God of the member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve is not the God the Reform Party member 
might invoke. 
It is not the God that certain of our Muslim colleagues or some 
of our colleagues from other religious denominations might call 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore not our place, as parliamentarians, to try to 
limit debates to religious considerations given that religion 
is a question of pluralism.  If we set this argument aside 
there is no reason not to recognize marriage and not to open 
this institution up to same sex couples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solemnization of marriage remains a 
provincial jurisdiction. 
The basic conditions are the prerogative of the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Reform Party had wanted to make a useful contribution, it 
should have asked the House to vote on a motion to put marriage 
back under the jurisdiction of the provinces, which are much 
closer to any matters related to the family and family policy. 
I think that would have been as useful a debate as the one moved 
today.

want to thank the hon. member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve for

</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member clarify for me that he does intend to

very happy to have this debate. The credit goes to the Reform

</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I believe fundamentally that there are no reasons 
beyond religious considerations that may not be included in a 
bill. I believe that there are no reasons why the institution of 
marriage, a social construction existing in laws and in the 
civil code, should not now be open to homosexual couples.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I have been waiting all day for a chance to make a few 
comments.  I realize a lot of other people would like to do that. 
Perhaps we will have to extend the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the criticism we have received as Reformers is that 
there are more important things to talk about.  We are talking 
about the family, the fundamental building block of society. It 
is necessary that we discuss this and send a clear signal to the 
courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to read from an article written by Lorne Gunter in the 
Edmonton <I>Journal</I>. The title is “Cohabitation costly for 
the taxpayer”.  He wrote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—studies consistently find that 80 to 85 per cent of couples who 
start out by living together fail to make it through life 
together. Among couples who never lived together before wedding 
one another, the failure rate is under 20 per cent.  Still, what 
gives anyone else the right to suggest common-law marriages are 
wrong?  Just one thing: the cost of cleaning up the wreckage. 
Children whose parents' relationship breaks down are much more 
likely to underachieve at school and in life.  They are nearly 
twice as likely to drop out, and girls are nearly three times as 
likely to get pregnant before leaving their teens and far more 
likely to have abortions.  Suicides are higher, illegal drug use 
is greater and the incidence of `getting into trouble with the 
law' is nearly six times more.  Simple marital breakdown is the 
leading cause of social problems, perhaps the leading cause.  So 
because common-law relationships are so prone to breakdown they 
contribute disproportionately to the social ills that everyone 
must live with and subsidize. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, we are talking about the family. We are talking 
about children.  We are talking about the fundamental building 
block of society, not all the other things that people are trying 
to bring into this discussion. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Madam Speaker, I would first like to reassure 
the member that I was not born on the planet Mars, but rather in 
a family I visit frequently, that loves me and that I love and 
with whom I have a growth and affectionate relationship that is 
very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not see the rationality of his remarks. I think that, 
whether a person is homosexual or heterosexual, we are all born 
in a family. When the member comes out without much warning and 
says that marriage is the main cause of divorce, I think there 
would be broad consensus in the House for accepting that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think there is a problem with his definition of family. I 
would be grateful if he allowed our colleague from Scarborough 
Southwest to ask me a question. I know he has a lot of 
expertise, not on gay issues but on the question of marriage.

<P><A NAME="LINK314"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, despite the hon. member's previous comment which of 
course was unnecessary, I do want to compliment him for his 
passion on this issue.  I know that he has very serious concerns 
in this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to compliment him in particular because he has been 
consistent throughout his entire career here in the House of 
Commons in his position that this is the place to decide these 
issues.  He has consistently indicated that it is the House of 
Commons that is to decide these issues, not the courts of Canada. 
I want to applaud him for that because he has been very 
consistent on it and I agree with him completely on that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask him very clearly because he did not give an answer 
to the hon. member for Calgary Southeast.  The official 
government position is that the term marriage is defined as the 
union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others.  I 
would say that his speech was the perfect reason that we have to 
vote on this motion this evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask him very clearly, if the government's position is that the 
definition of marriage is clear in law, does he accept that law?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to respond to the motion 
before the House and the objection raised by some hon. members in 
connection with the vote for the Senate program expenditures for 
the fiscal year ending March 31, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to use the time I have been given to try to expand 
the debate and to describe the context surrounding this 
initiative by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I think we need to draw a distinction between two aspects 
of the debate:  On the one hand, the place of the Senate within 
our parliamentary system and, on the other, the financial 
requirement in connection with the exercise of that role.  It is 
one thing to promote the improvement or even the abolition of the 
Senate, but the issue before us today is rather whether the 
Senate ought to obtain the moneys it needs to fulfill its mandate 
under the constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, I think it would be wrong to block this vote 
simply because one favours improving or, even for those who want 
that, abolishing the Canadian Senate.  Let us all agree on one 
thing.  The current Senate is an institution which has its 
foundations set down in the constitution and is therefore 
fundamental to the functioning of the Parliament of Canada.  It 
has a constitutionally mandated role to play.  Therefore, it must 
have the resources it needs to fulfil that role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate, in its current form, may not be the most popular 
there is within our system of government in the eyes of some.  It 
is easy for members to sidetrack the debate with knee-jerk 
speeches about its usefulness and its legitimacy.  It may be that 
changes could be made to the current Senate so as to enhance its 
legitimacy and make it more representative.  My party has 
advocated such changes in the recent past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, there is now, and I do not think it is any secret, 
no consensus as to what those changes should be and how they 
should be made neither among Canadians nor within parliament. In 
the meantime, the Senate must continue to fulfil the role it has 
been assigned, and it is the government's role to ensure that it 
has the means to do so and that includes an adequate supply 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not surprised by the criticism that has been made by some 
hon. members who have opposed this vote.  For those who feel that 
the current Senate is ineffective, any vote for the Senate 
expenditures, no matter what the amount, will always be for them 
too much.  It is easy to question the relevance of a vote for the 
Senate program expenditures, but it must be emphasized that these 
votes are essential for our parliamentary system to function and 
that the members of the House have a responsibility to concur in 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government has made modernizing our federation one of its 
top priorities.  We have made our system of government more 
efficient in many areas and have ensured that government programs 
and co-operation agreements concluded with our provincial 
partners better serve the interests of the community.  Indeed, 
co-operation between the two orders of government is an inherent 
part of our system of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am dwelling on this aspect of the debate because the reason 
the hon. members have opposed this vote is because they believe 
the Senate ought to be reformed or abolished.  We all know that 
there is no consensus on this issue among Canadians, as I have 
already stated.  Furthermore, the issue can be resolved only 
through a constitutional amendment.  You don't amend the Senate 
by cutting the supply.  Few members of the House can seriously 
claim that the current context lends itself to such an initiative 
of amending the constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More specifically, under section 42 of the Constitution Act, 
1982, reforming the Senate would require the consent of at least 
seven provinces representing no less than 50% of Canada's 
population. 
That is the prerequisite.  It is not cutting supply.

<A HREF="#LINKT103"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To then abolish the Senate, for those who think that is a proper 
course of action, the government would likely have to comply with 
section 41 of the Constitution Act, which requires the consent of 
the House of Commons, the 10 provincial legislative assemblies 
and the Senate itself which would have to vote itself out of 
existence.  That is the prerequisite for doing that under our 
constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think I am going out on a limb in saying that the 
constitutional debate is not a priority for Canadians today.  I 
was in my riding all last weekend and amending the constitution 
was not the favourite issue raised by my constituents.  They had 
many other topics in mind.  A grand total of zero people have 
raised it with me in the last several months. I think we can all 
agree that this is not a scenario that could be really taken 
seriously in the short term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government is not opposed to Senate improvement, but we have 
to be realistic and operate in the context of how things really 
are.  In terms of constitutional amendments, when the population 
has asked for those we have provided and have accommodated that, 
be it the issue of schools in Quebec, the issue of amending the 
Constitution to recognize the linguistic duality of New 
Brunswick, even the school situation in Newfoundland and several 
other such changes that had to be made. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program expenditures in the main estimates for the fiscal 
year ending March 31, 2000 total $30,051,000.  This may perhaps 
strike the members with objections to the allocation of credits 
as a lot, but I would ask them what other choice does the 
government have under the circumstances? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Senate seems to them to be an inefficient institution, 
and they have every right to think so, how does restricting the 
credits it needs to operate render it any more efficient?  Of 
course, the answer is obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go still further.  This debate provides me with the 
opportunity to rectify certain points. 
The Senate, in its current form, already fills an important 
role, which too many of our citizens are unaware of. The Senate 
committees perform an important function in our legislative 
process by clarifying and improving legislation from the House 
of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need only think of Bill C-49, which was before the House on 
Friday last and which will come back in a few days. The Senate 
has made some constructive amendments, and we all realize it, if 
we are prepared to admit it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes proposed by the senators to these bills have 
frequently improved them. I have just given one example. Our 
Senate colleagues' contribution in clarifying certain laws means 
time saved for the courts. This too must not forgotten. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All too often parliamentarians say that it is the role of this 
House to legislate not that of the courts. 
We have a House that helps us legislate and clarify the law and 
some people want to abolish it. The effect of this would 
probably be to transfer even more powers to the courts, which we 
say every day that we do not want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of senators have vast experience in varied fields, such 
as law, the world of business, public administration and so on. 
I am thinking of people such as Senator Eugene Whelan who will 
retire in a few days. He is an eminent Canadian who served as 
minister of agriculture for many years. He is a 
parliamentarian with three or four decades of experience. This 
is the calibre of people they are. There is also Frank 
Mahovlich, a world famous personality and a member of the 
Senate. Senator Wilbert Keon is a doctor with a worldwide 
reputation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have named only a few. 
This is the sort of person who represents us in the other place. 
We must not forget it either.

<A HREF="#LINKT104"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The experience of these senators becomes very important for all 
Canadians when it comes to crafting legislation that is a 
faithful reflection of Canadians' needs and aspirations. 
Obviously this cannot be readily measured, but one thing is 
certain and that is that it is part of the legislative process 
and part of our reality in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, on several occasions senators have been called 
upon to look specifically at such problems as poverty, 
unemployment, inflation, the status of the elderly and science 
policy.  There is even a Senate committee that is studying 
monetary issues right now, and the list goes on.  The reports 
these studies produce have had an impact on the resulting 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we are now debating the granting of supplies to the 
Senate, I would even go so far as to say that these studies have 
enabled Canadians to realize important savings since they have 
made it unnecessary to establish royal commissions of inquiry. 
God knows how expensive these commissions can be, I remember 
some.  The senators are already being paid, already have 
staff and, most important of all, they have an extensive 
institutional memory.  They have contributed much to this 
process and will continue to do so. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like to ask the House to support the 
estimates of the other place. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's position on Senate reform is simple.  We 
support the idea of such reform but when the circumstances are 
right, when there is first of all a consensus to that effect 
among Canadians and when all partners in our federation are 
resolved to move ahead with such a project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also believe that such a reform must be carried out in a 
comprehensive and considered manner, not piecemeal and 
certainly not on the fly as certain opposition parties too 
often suggest in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, our government is pursuing the same policy, one 
of common sense. 
It appoints as senators people recognized for their competence, 
people wishing to contribute with us to the well-being of 
Canadian society.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I have a couple of questions for the government House leader who 
appears to be running for a position in the Senate with the 
speech he made today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He says that there is no consensus on the Senate issue.  I want 
to say that he is right in one way but I think he is wrong in the 
other way.  I want him to concede that tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a division in the country as to whether the Senate 
should be reformed or abolished.  According to the polling it is 
roughly 50:50.  According to the polling, only about 5% of the 
people support the existing Senate.  About 95% think the existing 
Senate is not the proper institution for a democracy.  I want to 
know whether or not the minister recognizes the reality that 
about 5% of the people support the existing Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister also talked about giving the Senate supply.  The 
Senate got an extra 10% last year.  This year it wants another 
6.1%.  That is 16.1% over two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look across at the minister in charge of homelessness and ask 
her whether or not her budget was raised 16.1% over two years for 
the homeless in the country.  I know it has not.  I know she is 
struggling in cabinet for money for the homeless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the health budget, the education budget, the 
agricultural budget or any other budget.  None of them have been 
raised by 16.1% over two years.  My friend from Sarnia tells me 
that the budget of the House of Commons is going up by around 2% 
this year.  The Senate wants three times as much as what is going 
to the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the minister is responding tonight on behalf of the 
government on the very important issue of the other place, how 
can he possibly justify an increase of 16.1% over two years?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want him to answer that question and to admit today that there 
is a consensus in the country that the other place is not working 
and is a blight on democracy.  It is not elected.  It is not 
accountable.  It is not democratic.  Over 90% of the Canadian 
people do not support the existing Senate.  The debate is what to 
do with it.  However they do not support the existing Senate. 
There is a consensus on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like to draw the 
attention of the hon. member to two points.  The second point he 
raised was about the issue of supply, the amount that we are 
voting tonight.  The hon. member talked about the increases this 
year and last year.  He forgot about the decrease the year prior 
because it is not convenient for his argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the hon. member talks about increases perhaps he should 
remember that there were decreases in the past.  He made a 
comparison between the two houses of parliament.  If he goes back 
over the last number of years he will find that his argument is 
inaccurate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He raised a question on another facet of supply with respect to 
what this money will be used for.  I remind the hon. member 
across the way that a portion of it is the increase that we voted 
on in the House regarding the compensation for parliamentarians 
in both houses.  I will not reflect upon that vote.  We voted and 
that is done.  Once we vote for something we have to furnish the 
funds to accommodate that on which we voted.  It sounds like a 
rather elementary proposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next part of that component is the one involving the 
collective agreements of the employees.  I know that the NDP is 
not always together with the unions.  Sometimes they have 
differences.  In this case there is one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the hon. member thinks that the employees of the Senate, 
having duly signed a collective agreement, should not get their 
paycheques.  He can take it up with the union people.  That is 
his privilege. Meanwhile he will know that those two 
expenditures, one that we voted on in the House and the other 
being the collective agreement of the employees, form the 
majority of the increase.  He knows that.  I have told him that 
in answers in the House on several occasions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His first proposition was about reforming the Senate. He said 
that many Canadians would prefer if senators were chosen 
differently than the way they are now.  Me too.  What is the 
point?  The point is not whether the hon. member and I want to 
choose senators differently.  The point is that he wants to 
abolish the Senate and I would like to see it elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some provinces want the Senate abolished.  Some want it elected. 
Some want to change the number of senators a jurisdiction has and 
so on.  Some members across the way say they want a triple E 
Senate.  They want the same number of senators for P.E.I. as for 
British Columbia.  They have a right to think that way.  I do not 
happen to think that is proper and equitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has to be some other mechanism of arriving at that.  Every 
province in Canada has a different definition of what that should 
be.  The provincial premiers cannot agree among themselves on a 
proposition, and the hon. member knows it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, I agree with him.  I would prefer to see senators chosen by 
another system when the constitution is amended.  That is not the 
point.  The point is until it is amended there is only one way of 
naming senators, and that is by the Prime Minister choosing them 
and choosing high calibre people, which he does all the time.

since 1993 there have been 34 appointments by our current Prime

That makes for a total of 38 seats.

available for a total of 52, the majority of seats in the Senate 
since the Prime Minister has taken office.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That was on CBC <I>Prime Time News</I> on December 29, 1992. 
Those are all quotes from our current Prime Minister.  What has 
changed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Madam Speaker, I agree with everything 
the hon. member has just said.  He has quoted the Prime Minister 
so obviously I agree with what he just said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has been quite forthright.  He says that he 
favours Senate reform.  The hon. member across the way has just 
told us what the Prime Minister said in 1991 about an equitable 
Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I campaigned on that in 1992, door to door in the rain, trying 
to get people to vote for the Charlottetown accord.  In my riding 
we won it by almost 65%, the largest majority outside Quebec from 
Ontario all the way to the west coast of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where was the hon. member and his colleagues?  They were working 
against trying to get that Senate reform at the same time as I 
working for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order to ask for unanimous consent to allow the government House 
leader to accept one more question, if possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is that agreed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the co-operation of the government 
House leader in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was a candidate in the 1993 election I went door to door 
with a petition calling for the abolition of the Senate.  At that 
time I received about 39% of the vote.  Some 99% of the people to 
whom I spoke on doorsteps over a six month period signed the 
petition, even though most of them did not vote for the NDP at 
that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the government House leader to understand that this is a 
very serious issue with respect to the Senate and the supply of 
money to the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of this supply will go toward the pay expenses, travel 
expenses and benefits of two senators, Senator Bernston and 
Senator Cogger who are convicted felons.  How long will the 
government support paying salaries and expenses to these two 
convicted felons? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will it allow this happen for two years as in Mr. Cogger's case,

for years and years take place?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Madam Speaker, the first question the 
hon. member raised was the issue of abolishing the Senate.  I 
fundamentally disagree with the proposition of abolishing the 
Senate.  As far as I am concerned, improving the Senate, electing 
it and all of these things, once we can get that consensus in 
Canada, is the right approach.  Abolishing it outright is a 
different story.  Personally I do not favour that. We would be 
the only federated country on earth without a bicameral 
legislature and that is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member across the way has just suggested a proper 
comparison is Russia.  Let the facts speak for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other issue the member raised of whether it is the 
position of the government to protect, or whatever words he used, 
two Conservative senators, and I will leave out the other 
expletives, that is not for me to say.  The courts, the appeal 
process and so on will deal with that.  As to whether I support 
Conservative senators, I do not support Conservative anything, 
let alone Conservative senators so that should be quite clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member wants to ask the leader of the Conservative 
Party if he thinks the members of his caucus should no longer be 
members of his caucus, he is quite free to do that.  Of course he 
will have to do that outside the House because the leader of the 
Conservative Party does not sit in the House at the present time 
and perhaps never will, I do not know.  That is a matter to be 
taken up in another forum, in the lobby or some other place, but 
obviously not in the House of Commons at the present time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To repeat, I do not favour abolishing the Senate.  I favour 
improving it.  That is what I believe Canadians want. Do I favour 
Conservative senators, MPs, Conservative period?  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask unanimous consent to extend questions and 
comments for 10 minutes since we have the rare privilege of 
debating with such a respected and knowledgeable minister in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent to proceed in this way? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK324"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
will get this speech under way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to acknowledge the eloquent defence of the Senate 
by the government House leader, but unfortunately it was not just 
a defence of the Senate, it was a defence of the status quo, do 
nothing Liberal government.  We already heard in speeches by the 
Prime Minister how he was going to do something about the Senate. 
Now that the Liberals are in power, they do nothing about the 
Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to go all the way back to 1867, to the time the 
constitution of Canada was written and which we are unable to 
change because of circumstances that seem to be beyond our 
control. There are two things about the Senate.  It is not 
elected and every Canadian knows that.  The other thing the 
constitution has required of senators since 1867 is that they be 
able to demonstrate a net worth in excess of $4,000.  That is 
nothing today, but in 1867 $4,000 was a heck of a lot of money. 
If candidates could not come up with $4,000, they could not sit 
in the Senate.  That was the magic dividing line between the 
commons, which is everybody, and the elite, the powerful, the 
moneyed who could sit in the other place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the constitution was written in 1867 it was modelled on the 
example of Westminster in London, England.  It had the House of 
Lords, the aristocracy, the rich, the powerful, the people who 
inherited the money from generation to generation and the House 
of Commons, the plebes who had to struggle to survive under the 
leadership of the aristocracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aristocracy said they did not mind giving most of the power 
to the House of Commons, but they wanted the sober second 
thought.  They were basically saying “If they stomp on us too 
hard, we are going to slow them right down, if not put a stop to 
it.  We do not mind the House of Commons thinking it has all the 
power, but sober second thought means if it is going to trample 
on us too much, we will shut it down”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate is this age old tradition of the aristocracy, the 
rich and the powerful keeping a short leash on the rest of the 
country.  That is the reason we in the Reform Party say things 
have got to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was glad to hear the government House leader say that he is 
all for an elected Senate.  This has got to be called progress. 
We now have an admission by someone on the government side right 
here in the House on the record saying that he favours an elected 
Senate.  I can see by the smiles on the other side that perhaps 
they do not all agree.  We know where the NDP comes from. 
Progress may be glacial in its speed, but progress is being made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate needs reform.  The government could provide the 
impetus for reform if it wanted to.  Obviously, while the 
rhetoric of the Prime Minister says he would like reform, he has 
no intention of instituting reform, hence the impasse.  The 
Reform Party has said let us move on Senate reform.  The 
government talks about Senate reform.  The NDP says to abolish 
the Senate.  Maybe one day we will make progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate is one area where a lot of money is wasted, but there 
are other areas where money is wasted.  I can think of no finer 
example of waste than the National Film Board.  The National Film 
Board makes all kinds of films, some about the Senate, some about 
other things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I published a waste report today. It is available on the 
Internet.  I do not have my website address here, but the report 
is available on the Internet and if anybody wants to get a copy 
of it they can find it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I brought out some interesting little things on how the National 
Film Board spends taxpayers' money.  We are talking about 
taxpayers' money today as this is the business of supply. In the 
House of Commons later on this evening we are going to vote on 
about $160 billion worth of spending.  We started the debate at 
6:30 p.m. and we will be wrapping it up at 10:00 p.m.  In three 
and a half hours we are going to get the job done, all $160 
billion.  There will be close, analytical inspection.  Every dime 
is going to be checked over in three and a half hours, if you can 
believe that, Mr. Speaker.  I do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at a couple of things at the National Film Board. 
<I>Democracy à la Maude</I>, a profile of Maude Barlow and her 
crusade for social justice and economic sovereignty as the head 
of the 100,000 member Council of Canadians.  We spent 
$288,336.52, do not forget the cents, on a profile of Maude 
Barlow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 100,000 Canadians who belong to the Council of Canadians are 
going to say this is great stuff.  But for every member of that 
organization, I am quite sure I could find 10 others who would 
say it is a waste of money, which is why I put it in my waste 
report because I let Canadians judge.  It is their money that is 
being spent.  When I ask them if this is good value for money, or 
is it a waste of money, they say it is a waste of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What else do we have in here?  <I>And So To Bed</I>. We spend a 
lot of time in our beds, not all of it sleeping, but I am not 
going to get into that debate.  We spent $249,007.75, do not 
forget the $7.75, on a delightful look at the evolution and the 
history of the bed.  I have to admit that I have not seen the 
movie, but if we are going to take a delightful look at the 
evolution and the history of the bed without talking about what 
people do in the bed, I do not know what is in this movie, but my 
imagination starts to go on a little bit, especially when we have 
been talking about same sex benefits and everything else recently 
in the last few weeks.  There has been Bill C-78, same sex 
benefits and conjugal relationships, and now we have beds.  When 
we bring it all together our imaginations can run riot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Tell us more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  He wants to hear more.  Perhaps I 
should not. You will shut me down for being 
unparliamentary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How about <I>Frank the Wrabbit</I>.  This is interesting. 
We must not let our imagination run off here. This is a film 
about how humans and rabbits formulate and justify beliefs. How 
much?  $194,855.30.

a film about people who in some capacity are linked together by 
rats.  The film explores the netherworld of the sewers in Toronto 
seen as a metaphor for the unconscious.  Great stuff. The 
National Film Board was so enthusiastic that it threw $140,000 
behind this effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not found a Canadian yet who agreed with the National 
Film Board, but that is how the money is being spent and it goes 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>Strange Invaders</I>, a portrayal of a happy couple who feel 
blessed by the sudden arrival of a small child—is that not 
wonderful—until they realize the child is an alien from 
outer space.  Trash.  Absolute, unadulterated trash which cost us 
$71,135. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we are back into pornography.  A few weeks ago we had 
<I>Bubbles Galore</I> which cost us $55,000.  The movie did win an 
award.  It won the best film award at the Freakzone International 
Festival of Trash Cinema.  It is right up there as the worst of 
trash or the best of trash, whichever way one wants it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now there is <I>Stolen Moments</I>, a film which combines the 
hidden aspects of lesbian history and of contemporary lesbian 
life and culture featuring well known lesbians for $40,000 
hard-earned Canadian taxpayers' dollars down the drain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My waste report goes on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the auditor general published a report about the Small 
Business Loans Act.  He said this was going to cost us big time. 
The reason it was going to cost us big time was that the Liberal 
government increased the amount of money a person could borrow to 
100% of the cost of what the person was trying to buy.  For 
example, if someone wanted to buy a large piece of equipment 
costing $100,000, every prudent lender not just in the country 
but in the world would say “Put your money down and maybe we 
will help you to finance the rest”.  But no, the government said 
the lender would give the person 100% of the cash and he or she 
would not have to put in a nickel.  It was that simple.  Is this 
good business?  It is going to cost the taxpayer a bundle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the province of Quebec a franchisor had this great idea about 
selling hot dogs.  To set up a hot dog franchise, between $25,000 
and $50,000 had to be paid for the privilege of getting the 
franchise right to sell hot dogs.  The franchisor put this money 
in his pocket.  He collected $2.15 million, thank you very much, 
and he is gone. But the money he got had been borrowed from the 
bank and secured by the Small Business Loans Act.  The taxpayer 
ended up paying over $3 million.  One has to wonder if this thing 
was even legitimate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prudent lending?  We have to question the competence of the bank 
manager.  Obviously the franchisor had got the measure of this 
bank manager and convinced him it was a hot deal for hot dogs. 
One branch alone gave out 30 of these franchises and they all 
went bad.  We picked up the tab.  The auditor general told us 
about it in 1997 and the fruits are coming home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on.  There are computers with legs on them.  In my last 
waste report I talked about computers with legs.  Now we find 
that even if the computers disappear, even if we know that they 
are stolen, nothing happens.  It is not even reported to the 
police.  They only report it to the police when they have the 
criminal by the neck.  When they know who the criminal is, they 
tell the cops to arrest the fellow.  If they do not know who it 
is, they say “Well, we guess we do not know who it is”. They do 
not want any disruption in the office by bringing in the police 
to say they are losing their computers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are paying for that.  The taxpayers are paying for that.  We 
are paying for the Senate.  We are paying for this.  We are 
paying for waste.  We are paying for mismanagement. 
We are paying through the nose.  The House leader gave a great 
and eloquent defence of the status quo, but we also have a great 
and eloquent defence of the status quo of mismanagement and waste 
when it could so easily be tackled.

chair, we had officials of the Department of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development appear before us.  The auditor general had 
pointed out some serious problems in that department, about how 
we are spending $6 billion a year through the Department of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Health Canada and so on, 
which is going right into the pockets of the first nations 
people.  I have no problem helping them, but I would like to 
help them get up on their own feet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I read in the paper that some chiefs are collecting a 
salary in excess of $167,000 a year, tax free, and the people 
they are supposed to govern have absolutely nothing, and DIAND 
does not seem to care about it, and they admitted as much in 
committee this afternoon, I get a little upset.  That taxpayer 
money is going straight into the coffers of the people who are 
supposed to administer it on behalf of the people they govern. 
They are robbing them blind and taking it for themselves.  It is 
criminal.  It cannot be allowed to continue. Yet the Liberals 
continue to allow it.  We wonder why we keep having to pay more 
and more money in that direction.  We need accountability.

transparency, where the books and the records are open for public

the Prime Minister and whatever has been going on with the grants 
and so on in his riding.  Openness and transparency are 
absolutely fundamental to a healthy democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the departmental officials this afternoon why it is that 
the financial statements of these first nations reserves are not 
made public.  I got the answer.  It is because they may have a 
small proprietorship or business, or whatever, and when they 
prepare consolidated financial statements that contain, built in 
there somewhere, buried in the numbers, revenues and expenditures 
pertaining to private business, then the whole thing has to be 
kept under wraps.  The Privacy Act prevails, which says it cannot 
be made public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet when I asked them if they could not separate government from 
private business, as we do in in the rest of Canada, as we do in 
the rest of the world, they said “Perhaps we could think about 
it so that we would be able to publish the financial statements 
of first nations which consider themselves to be government”. 
DIAND considers them to be government, and yet DIAND tolerates a 
situation where their financial statements and records and 
mismanagement are kept under wraps because of one little quirk 
that could be fixed any time the government wanted.  The status 
quo is disgusting on Senate reform, in the way the Liberals 
handle first nations, in the way they tolerate waste and 
mismanagement and in the way that the whole government conducts 
its business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in 1995 when we were voting on supply, as we will be voting 
on supply later this evening, we had about 150 votes to go.  We 
thought we were going to be here all night and well into the next 
morning.  We reached a compromise with the government that we 
would form a committee to address the situation, to bring some 
sanity and modern thinking, some accountability and governance 
into the management of the estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The deputy whip, who was the chair of the committee, myself, a 
member of the Bloc and others worked on a committee and produced 
a report on the business of supply.  It called for three 
fundamental things.  First, that we as parliamentarians be given 
the right to move money from within a department from initiative 
<I>a</I> to initiative <I>b</I> if we felt that was appropriate 
because we are parliamentarians and we should have that kind of 
authority. 
We oversee government.  Second, that we create an estimates 
committee to review on an ongoing, year round basis the estimates 
and the proposed spending of government.  Third, that we 
introduce what is called program evaluation to look at the $100 
billion in spending that will not be voted on this evening.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Program evaluation asks four fundamental questions of all 
program spending.  It asks what is the public policy that the 
program is trying to achieve, which is fairly simple and yet it 
does not exist.  Canadians say they cannot believe that the 
public policy of programs is not articulated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it goes on to ask how well this public policy is being 
addressed.  Once that is articulated we can measure it. However, 
the government does not want to measure it.  It just thinks that 
as long as it blithely spends the money and throws money at the 
wall some will stick.  Waste and mismanagement is everywhere. 
Surely we could make progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on to say that we should look at the efficiency of 
program delivery.  Can we achieve the same results in a different 
way? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After two years of hard work we finally got the government 
response to the committee's all-party suggestions and 
recommendations, which it dismissed out of hand and said “No, we 
cannot change.  It is too much of an effort to change.  We do not 
want to bring accountability into government.  We do not want to 
have to answer to Canadians about how their money is being 
spent”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is about the same response we had from the government House 
leader on his defence of the Senate.  It was a defence of the 
status quo.  The response to the business of supply was a defence 
of the status quo.  “We do not want to change, even though we 
know how to change.  We can change and we know that change will 
save billions of taxpayer dollars.  It will give a more focused 
program delivery”.  The government says it does not even want to 
hear about it.  It reminds us of the three monkeys:  hear no 
evil, see no evil and speak no evil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has the responsibility to manage the country.  It 
has the responsibility to govern the country and it is abdicating 
that responsibility every day. 
<P><A NAME="LINK325"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have a question for the hon. member who I know is very interested 
in making sure that the books are frugal, that they are well 
kept, that we do not waste money and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that many in his party advocate the idea of a triple E 
Senate:  elected, equal and effective.  Prior to the 
Charlottetown accord a lot of us took a very serious look at that 
idea.  Theoretically it is an interesting idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a compromise by the three parties in the House of 
Commons at that time that we advocate an elected Senate based on 
proportional representation.  That went to the first ministers, 
who changed what we had recommended.  They came up with a 
different formula for an elected Senate, which would have had 
some powers, but it would not have been very effective, and there 
was some equality in it.  Of course, that was turned down in the 
referendum.  It would have taken the unanimous consent of the 
provinces, in any event, to implement it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is a frugal man and wants to look after the 
public purse.  We spend roughly $60 million a year on the 
existing Senate.  In all these years, try as we might, we have 
never had a solution and a consensus as to how we would reform 
the other place, which has to be done through the amending 
formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How long do we go on trying?  It is a bit like the dog chasing 
its tail.  When does it stop?  It goes around and around in a 
circle, and every time it goes around we spend another $60 
million on a House that is not elected, not democratic and not 
accountable.  In fact, the chairman of its internal economy 
committee would not even appear before the industry committee of 
the House of Commons to be accountable for the expenditures of 
the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With great respect to the ideas he has espoused in the past 
about a triple E Senate, how long would he suggest we keep on 
waiting before we try the other alternative of just abolishing it 
altogether and saving that $60 million?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we may be stuck in the end with either the status quo, 
which we have had for over 130 years, or building a national 
consensus, which is growing toward abolition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember during Meech Lake and even the Charlottetown accord 
that support for abolition, according to the polls, was around 
21% or 23%.  The hon. member from Sarnia is confirming that. 
About a year ago, it was about 45%.  About 45% want to reform it 
but, again, people who want to reform it have all kinds of 
different formulae.  Bert Brown wants triple E.  Somebody else 
wants one E, which is elected.  Somebody else wants the house of 
the provinces or the house of the federation.  One may want more 
powers.  One may want fewer powers.  The hon. member from Calgary 
may want a mixture of powers.  We could never find consensus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How long do we let this dog chase its tail before we say “Let 
us put a stop to it”?  The hon. member is a watchdog on finances 
and I anticipate his response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  How long do we wait, Mr. Speaker?  In 
the greater scheme of things, the Reform Party is a very young 
party, having been around for only 12 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea of Senate reform, by and large, started with the Reform 
Party, which brought it to the national stage and to the national 
agenda.  In 12 years we have moved it from the idea that a few 
people agreed with to the national agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the House knows, our party has gone from being strictly an 
idea to today when it is sitting in the House as the official 
opposition.  I know they are trembling over there because the day 
will come when we will trade places.  At that time the hon. 
member from Qu'Appelle may find that he does not have to wait any 
more and that the time will have arrived for Senate reform. 
<P><A NAME="LINK326"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I must 
say that I enjoyed, for the most part, the comments of my hon. 
colleague from the Reform Party in terms of what he was 
espousing, the concept of a triple E Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to having the upper chamber elected, for me that is 
a non-starter.  If we asked, most Canadians would say that if 
there is going to be an upper chamber then it should be an 
elected chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  He is a Tory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  That is not exactly a unifying kind of 
comment that I am hearing from my hon. colleague.  I am sure he 
actually shares some of the sentiments I am trying to express, so 
I would hope that he would give me the courtesy to be able to 
express those very concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member believes that the origin of Senate reform 
started in 1987, out of the blue, and that nobody was even 
concerned with the fact that the Senate was not elected until 
1987 when the Reform Party started.  Would he think in his heart 
of hearts that there were possibly other individuals in this 
country who espoused an elected Senate prior to 1987?  I would 
like to tell him that when I was in university I was one 
individual who espoused that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have to think about 
these non-starters.  The Reform Party, as I said, coalesced 
opinion in the country to bring the idea of Senate reform to the 
public agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talks about the fact that he was on to Senate 
reform a long time ago, but his leader sat in the prime 
minister's chair in the House and did nothing about Senate 
reform.  His party was in power numerous times in the past and 
did nothing about Senate reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current Prime Minister is on record on numerous occasions 
before he became Prime Minister as saying that he advocated 
Senate reform, but he blithely forgets about it now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, we are making progress because now we have the 
government House leader also saying that he favours an elected 
Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the hon. member for Regina—Qu'Appelle thinks that 
co-opting one government member every five years is pretty slow 
progress, and I have to agree, but if we change places I can see 
it moving a lot faster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to the hon. member's comment, he has to be serious 
and recognize that the Reform Party raised the agenda of Senate 
reform. 
<P><A NAME="LINK327"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to pose a challenge to my hon. colleague.  I am going 
to cite two quotes and I am going to ask the hon. member to tell 
me who made these statements. 
A certain individual who sits in the House said on February 2, 
1990 in front of a reporter with the Windsor <I>Star</I> and 600 
people in Edmonton:  “I am not interested in patronage because I 
am a Liberal”.   This same individual, on page 196 of a book 
entitled <I>Straight from the Heart</I>, published in 1985, said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I didn't want to be trapped in making decisions on patronage, 
local contracts, and appointments that cause so much friction and 
bad blood. 
</UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT113"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to be too vague on this.  I also want to say that 
this individual who sits in the House has appointed a former 
Liberal member of Parliament, William Rompkey; has appointed a 
former Liberal premier of Prince Edward Island, Catherine 
Callbeck; has appointed another former MP, Jean Robert Gauthier; 
has appointed former Liberal candidates in New Brunswick for the 
Liberal leadership race there; and, has appoint prominent people 
in the Trudeau cabinet.  The list goes on to include prominent 
B.C. Liberal organizers who are golfing and business buddies of 
this individual who sits right across the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that I have given this information, I would like to see if 
the hon. member can guess who that individual is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, when one is on national 
television it is very hard to be posed with these very tough 
questions without any preparation whatsoever.  However, I will 
make a stab at it.  As members know, I did not grow up in this 
country so I do not know my history, but I think I know who the 
hon. member is referring to.  Am I correct in saying that it is 
the member for Saint-Maurice, the Right Hon. the Prime Minister? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  It was that obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  I got it right.  Hallelujah, one for 
me. 
<P><A NAME="LINK328"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia—Lambton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
from the beginning of this evening we were told that this is not 
a debate about Senate reform or Senate abolition, and I agree. 
This is a debate about the supply motion.  In about two and a 
half hours we are going to start voting on those supply motions. 
The first item we are going to vote on is the $30,051,000 which 
is the allocation for the Senate of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are being told that the Senate is a legitimate body. Legally, 
that is absolute correct.  The Senate of Canada today is legally 
a legitimate body.  It is half of the Parliament of Canada.  The 
Senate of Canada today is politically an illegitimate body, and 
that is what is creating the clash here. There is a clash in a 
sense between the two solitudes, one at this end of the building 
called the House of Commons, and the other at the red chamber, 
the other place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are being asked to pass judgment on today by voting for 
these estimates is, in my opinion, what is reasonable and what is 
correct.  If we flash back 132 years, we will know that when the 
Senate was created it was created by the British parliament after 
negotiations with our Fathers of Confederation who were beholden 
to the British House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Out of that process came two chambers, the Senate and the House 
of Commons, the Senate being the mirror image, or the clone of 
the House of Lords and being populated with the elite of this 
country, and that was true in 1867.  The Senate was better 
educated, more worldly and more outward looking.  By and large, 
senators were better off.  That was very acceptable.  They were 
socially and educationally legitimate and they were, in a sense, 
politically legitimate having regard to 1867. 
We were, by and large, a society which was trying to emulate in 
its governance the British system which had a House of Lords and 
a House of Commons.  Let us consider that in 1867 the House of 
Commons, this very place, was populated by people who were less 
educated, were perhaps a little rough around the edges, were less 
outward looking and were in fact what we would call today very 
provincial people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we flash ahead 132 years, much has changed in the country. In 
1867 it was thought that the Senate would be a check.  It would 
be the brakes on the House of Commons.  It would be the brakes on 
the excesses of the House of Commons.  It would be the 
constitutional arbiter of the House of Commons because at that 
time, being a new country, we were beginning to explore what were 
the divisions of powers and what were the rights of the federal 
government versus the rights of the provincial governments.  The 
Senate was there to be a constitutional court, a constitutional 
check on this place called the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had no supreme court in 1867.  That would not come until the 
days of Alexander Mackenzie in the 1870s.  We had very little in 
the way of checks on the House, and hence it was the Senate's job 
to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We move ahead 132 years and what do we have?  We have the 
Supreme Court of Canada which came into existence in 1949.  Until 
that point, we still sent our appeals to the Privy Council in 
Great Britain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a number of agreements which are checks on the House of 
Commons, such as agreements on federal-provincial relations in 
trade, NAFTA and the WTO.  They are all checks on the House of 
Commons.  For those who doubt that, I would invite them to look 
at Bill C-29 that was passed by the House and the Senate.  It was 
thrown out because it was deemed to not be within the powers of 
the Parliament of Canada, in particular the House of Commons, 
because it offended federal-provincial agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many checks today on the House of Commons, but I would 
suggest that the Senate is not one of them.  As we know, the 
Senate today is less educated than the House of Commons.  The 
Senate only works about 66 half days a year.  Just this past week 
a local newspaper stated that the attendance record for senators 
at committee meetings versus members of the House of Commons were 
quite dismal.  We have a rather dispirited group of people where 
history has passed them by.  Political legitimacy has passed them 
by.  However, they are still in a place where they have legal 
legitimacy.  They are there and they have “a job” to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the history of the Senate of Canada, we will know 
that there has been but one change in that place in 132 years. 
That change was made by former Prime Minister Pearson in 1968 
when it was deemed that senators who had originally been 
appointed for life would only be appointed to age 75. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we compare that to what occurred in Great Britain in 1919, 
the British government moved to cut in half, some would say, the 
powers of the House of Lords.  The House of Lords today is under 
full attack by the government of that country.  There is massive 
change and it looks like they are going to disappear with time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had this institutional stagnation in Canada, in 
particular in the other place, to the point where it is still 
legally correct and legally legitimate, but politically no one 
believes it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard reference to polls today.  My colleague from 
Regina—Qu'Appelle referred to an Angus Reid poll earlier that 
says that about 90 to 95% of Canadians recognize that the other 
place is politically and totally illegitimate.  Five per cent of 
people either do not know or are willing to accept it.  I 
understand that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we go to the one big difference between the House of Commons 
and the other place, we will know that although the other place 
has powers tantamount to this place, when it comes to the 
appropriation of dollars we have the exclusive domain.  We know 
that last year the Senate year had a budget increase of a little 
more than 10%.  We also know that the chair of the internal 
economy board in the other place has tabled a budget which calls 
for an increase this year of 6.1%. 
If members look at the actual document they will see that it 
shows $30 million.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To follow up on a speech made by the government House leader 
earlier, he pointed out that we cannot do anything about some of 
this because we already voted for it.  That is correct.  That was 
the salary increase for senators, which was passed earlier this 
year, but that does not appear in the estimates and has nothing 
to do with the estimates.  It is statutory requirements.  The $30 
million we are talking about is the $9,000 housing allowance that 
was voted on by senators for themselves for this year.  That is 
$9,000 to live in Ottawa, when they are only here for 65 or 66 
days in total, and for the operation of the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard from the government House leader that the Senate had to 
raise the salaries for its staff, and we understand that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one looks at the estimates and at the speech, the only speech 
made in the Senate with respect to its budget—there was but one 
speech made in that place—we would see that it is not $3 million 
going toward salary increases but about half of that.  It is about 
$1.5 million in salary increases.  The other $1.5 million is 
going into that black hole called services in the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate estimates have eight headings, such as information 
and rentals.  What does this all mean?  I have no idea what it 
means. However, the fact is the House of Commons is the place 
that has to approve appropriations.  Tonight we are being asked 
to blindly approve a 6.1% increase for the other place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy to say that senators are doing their job.  I have no 
disagreement with that.  They have a job to do and it is in our 
constitutional framework.  It was set in stone in 1867.  However, 
I think we can have a legitimate debate in the country on 
whether we are going to abolish the Senate, have a triple E 
Senate, or have a single E Senate.  I totally agree with that and 
I think my position is well known. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, are we to blindly approve a 6.1% increase because the 
other place has said that it needs the money?  We must not put this 
into the context that because they have requested it we, in the 
House of Commons, must blindly give it to them.  Let us put it in 
the context of what is reasonable, reasonable under current 
economic circumstances, reasonable in making a comparison to other 
sectors of the economy and reasonable in terms of what the Canadian 
public, who will ultimately pay for this, would say is the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we clearly look, we will see that nobody in the country is 
getting 6.1%.  There is nobody in the country getting 6.1% save 
and except the Senate of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not talk about this being an all or nothing 
proposition.  It is clearly not that.  What the government House 
leader failed to point out is that there are three motions for 
amendment on the Order Paper.  One of the motions calls for zero 
dollars for the Senate.  The second one calls for zero dollars to 
the Senate.  I understand both of these motions, but the third 
motion states that we should limit the Senate's increase to 2%, 
which would represent an increase of about $1.5 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are we looking at in the Senate?  According to the chair of 
the Senate's internal economy board, the Senate needs about $1.5 
million to meet its budgetary increases in terms of employees.  I 
think we can all understand and agree with that.  People in the 
public service have certainly not had raises for a number of 
years.  I do not think it is unreasonable to give them a 2% 
increase?  I also do not think it is an issue that the Canadian 
public would feel offended by.

</I></B></P><P align=left>By and large I do not think anyone in the Canadian public will 
react to a 2% raise for employees whether they work on Parliament 
Hill or for someone else in the country, especially having regard 
to the history of limited increases for some time now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However there is a big but that I want to emphasize and 
underline.  Is 6% reasonable having regard to the fact that in 
the past year they had 10%?  Is 6% reasonable, knowing full well 
that the chair of the internal economy board of the Senate has 
said that they are asking for 6.1% today but do not think it will 
be enough and will have to get more before the fiscal year is 
out? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I have said that the Senate is legally legitimate I 
think it is politically illegitimate.  That is my opinion.  If we 
cannot debate parliamentary reform in this place, I do not know 
where we can do it.  If this is a body which is legally 
legitimate, which it is, should it not act in a reasonable 
fashion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians ask is that their political institutions be 
reasonable.  Should that place, which has a very limited function 
today, not send a signal?  Should it not be a symbol?  Should it 
not send a message to all Canadians that it understands money is 
hard to come by, that it has a constitutional obligation or duty 
to fulfil, and that it will do it in a fashion which does not 
increase the demands upon the public purse in an unacceptable 
fashion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many cases we get back to what I term as the test of 
reasonableness which comes from making comparisons with other 
sectors of the economy.  I have noted that no one is getting this 
kind of increase whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate says it is doing its job.  I think to a certain 
extent it has a function to perform.  I learned earlier today 
that it has found strange ways of spending the $30,051,000 that 
it requested and has already started to spend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier today I was pleased to participate in a demonstration in 
front of this building with colleagues from other parties in the 
House.  I learned from certain media representatives that the 
Senate was concerned about the demonstration.  In fact it was so 
concerned that it hired two public relations gurus to spin its 
story.  Today the Senate of Canada used public money to spin its 
side of the story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would think that a legislative body which is under attack 
from all directions would try to be prudent, would try to be 
circumspect, and would change its behaviour in some way.  I do 
not know.  To find out today that questions being posed by 
reporters to those who participated came from media gurus or 
public relations and media relations agents which were hired by 
the Senate is an interesting, bizarre and pathetic set of 
circumstances.  If that is the way that place uses its money, let 
us pull it back, recognizing that it needs some money to fulfil 
its constitutional obligation but not 6.1%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the right in this place to pass judgment on 
appropriation.  As noted earlier, the chair of the internal 
economy board of the other place refused point blank to appear 
before a House of Commons standing committee to answer some 
simple questions.  His comment as reported in the press was “I 
account to the public”  That is very easy to say but the public 
knows that is not the case in any way.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The same member of the other place has been quoted as saying 
that they do legitimate work and that they clarify and improve 
legislation from the House of Commons.  Is it not interesting 
that when the Senate makes an amendment to a bill it is deemed to 
be a clarification issue or an improvement issue?  Is it not 
interesting that we would allow a group of people who apparently 
are now a house of distinguished Canadians the right to pass 
judgment on what the elected officials have decided? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not interesting that after 132 years we have all corners 
of the country crying out for change to this legally legitimate 
body?  We can argue that change at another time.  Yet it uses 
that institutional shield to protect itself from change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not talking about profound change in the sense of 
downsizing.  We cannot change its constitutional mandate.  I am 
talking about change in terms of consumption of money, change in 
terms of being open to the public, change in terms of working 
with the House of Commons when it comes to its budget, and change 
in terms of answering the questions that the elected people will 
be asked to pass judgment on tonight.  We are being told by the 
Senate that we have no choice.  The appointed body will say that 
we will pass it or else.  We will pass it or it will have a work 
stoppage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a sad commentary that 132 years after Confederation we are 
still living in a society where the elected representatives of 
the people are being held hostage by a group of 104 people who 
have no political legitimacy.  Therefore I ask members tonight, 
especially those in the Conservative Party, to seriously consider 
what they are doing when they vote for Senate appropriation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK329"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to ask my Liberal colleague a question about the 
Senate.  As he knows, the New Democratic Party supports the 
abolition of the Senate because it is unelected.  As a matter of 
fact the people who occupy the Senate are friends of former prime 
ministers and the current Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senators are appointed to age 75, and 104 of them and their 
staff spend about $55 million a year.  They have no 
accountability to anyone.  They do not have to go to 
constituencies to report on what they have been doing on their 
behalf.  They do not do much of behalf of people unless it is a 
very wealthy family or a very large corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has my Liberal colleague ever heard of someone by the name of 
Jim Balfour?  Perhaps he could nod his head yes or no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has never heard of Mr. Balfour.  We have a senator by the 
name of James Balfour who was appointed 20 years ago by Joe 
Clark.  He was a friend of the then prime minister.  He is a 
Conservative who comes from my home town in Regina. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been involved in the public community of Regina for 26 
years and I have never met this person.  Nor have any of the 
6,000 people to whom I have talked.  They have never heard of 
this guy who is a senator representing Saskatchewan, let alone 
Regina. Over the years Mr. Balfour has an attendance record of 
maybe 18% or 23% depending on the year we are looking at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Liberal member opposite, who also supports the 
abolition of the Senate, believe that there should be more 
accountability for the people who are there now?  Perhaps they 
should go back to their cities and provinces on occasion to meet 
one or two people, at least once or twice a year, so that people 
know they are alive and maybe doing something progressive for the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the Liberal member comment on Mr. Balfour, the phantom 
senator from Regina? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roger Gallaway:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from 
the NDP for his question. I must say that I have never heard of 
this individual.  It is not my habit to comment on individuals 
from the other place.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to respond in general to his question.  Let us look to 
other places, other parliaments that have had senates, houses of 
lords or like bodies.  We are the only country in a parliamentary 
democracy which has an appointed body, save and except Malaysia, 
a great democracy, which has a strictly appointed upper chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at other parliamentary democracies we find that they 
are tied to performance.  If one gets to the upper chamber by 
some appointment route or by the election route, it is tied to 
one's presence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House of Lords is identical to our Senate in terms of 
accountability.  It has imposed that its members have to show up 
to get paid.  Here they get paid and if they do not show up a 
little bit is taken off.  In Britain, one who by accident of 
birth is in the House of Lords has to show up to get paid.  It is 
tied to performance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize there are people in the other place who believe they 
represent their regions.  I come from southwestern Ontario.  For 
the last two years we have had a senator from southwestern 
Ontario.  Southwestern Ontario is a very densely populated area. 
We have a senator who lives maybe 100 miles from me.  He is a 
fine man.  He is a nice gentleman.  I like him and all that.  It 
is nothing to do with him, but he no more represents the region 
than Senator Balfour does the region of southwestern Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senators are today representative of what I believe to be 
special interest groups.  It is nothing more, nothing less. 
<P><A NAME="LINK330"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I had 
the honour today to participate in a rally on Parliament Hill 
with several of my colleagues, including the hon. member across 
the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to pose a question to my hon. colleague.  I 
remember having taken part in committee meetings with regard to 
the whole idea of accountability.  I remember very well refusals 
by representatives from the Senate to speak to the accountability 
of that body. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us analyse it.  Is the Senate accountable to the taxpayer? I 
do not happen to think so because I do not think taxpayers would 
approve a 16% budget increase over two years when the House of 
Commons gets 2% and generally government operations get 3%.  I 
cannot think of anyone who would make such demands, especially 
under the circumstances when the Senate works 66 half days a 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I then look at it in terms of whether or not the Senate is 
accountable to the House of Commons.  According to the Senate it 
is not accountable to the House of Commons.  That is one of the 
reasons it is willing to raise its budgets, not be accountable to 
anybody else, and say that it will go ahead and hold hostage the 
House of Commons and push for work stoppages in this place if we 
try to call it into question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate always likes to say that it is not accountable to the 
Prime Minister either.  I could go through all the appointments 
various prime ministers including this current one have made, but 
once they are appointed they say they are no longer accountable 
to the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that the Senate is accountable to taxpayers.  I 
do not believe the Senate is accountable to the House of Commons. 
I do not believe the Senate is accountable to the Prime Minister. 
To whom is it accountable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roger Gallaway:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
Calgary West for that most interesting question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree the Senate is not accountable to taxpayers.  There is 
absolutely no question about that whatsoever.  Is it accountable 
to the House of Commons? 
The senators have sent a message through the chair of the 
internal economy board of the other place that that individual 
would not appear before a standing committee of the House of 
Commons to explain the Senate budget, to in some way answer some 
very rudimentary questions about the budget tabled in the other 
place.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are they accountable to the Prime Minister?  I think the answer 
is no but we could argue about that.  If we go back in time and 
look at the list of appointments, there are people who were 
appointed in the seventies.  I do not know if there are any left 
from the sixties but certainly there are some from the seventies, 
the eighties and into the early nineties.  Of course they were 
accountable to other prime ministers but they have come and gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The open ended question is are we going to put up with a body 
that is unaccountable and that continues to demand relatively 
large sums of money for rather obtuse purposes? I think my 
position on it is well known. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I pose another question to 
my hon. colleague.  Can he think of another job, any job, where 
one would be able to work 66 half days a year and get a salary in 
excess of $64,000 plus $12,000 in an expense account and then 
over $10,000 in a non-receiptable expense account, which 
basically amounts to a payout because no receipts have to be 
given for it?  I would like my hon. colleague to let us know if 
he can think of any other job where somebody could enjoy for 66 
half days a year those types of benefits, and more than that that 
someone could serve for one day— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am sorry, but the 
hon. member for Sarnia—Lambton is only going to have 30 seconds 
to think of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roger Gallaway:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know what the hon. 
member is saying in his question.  The total benefit package for 
a senator in terms of cost to the public is about $100,000 plus 
travel which includes 64 return trips and a VIA Rail pass.  It is 
quite a large number of dollars.  The answer is that the only 
other person in this country who probably has an equivalent 
lifestyle is someone who has won a very large lottery.  That is 
the only person I can think of. 
<P><A NAME="LINK331"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will say a word or two about the motion before the 
House.  We are being asked to vote tonight on a motion by the 
government to reinstate the spending estimates for the Senate of 
Canada for $30,051,000.  That is roughly half of what the Senate 
spends in a year.  The other roughly $30 million is in other 
votes that will be taken later on tonight.  The Senate costs 
about $60 million a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  Over 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  A year, and it goes up almost every year. 
Last year it went up by some 10%.  The year before it went up by 
some 6%.  That makes 16% over two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  That is a lot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  That seems like a lot of money for 
the member for Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It might be better if there were some system of accountability 
but what kind of accountability is there?  Can the members for 
Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, Calgary West or Sarnia—Lambton 
know how we are accountable for this money? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tonight maybe a lot of people are channel flipping between 
hockey games and baseball games and are watching this debate. 
Sixty million dollars is being spent.  The Liberal member across 
the way laughs, but tonight there is going to be a vote and he 
has to be accountable to his constituents on how he votes.  Is he 
going to vote for spending $60 million a year for that unelected 
undemocratic house?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a request by a lot of MPs to have Senator Rompkey, who 
is the chair of the internal board of economy for the Senate, to 
appear before the relevant committee of the House of Commons.  He 
would not appear.  He refused to appear to justify the estimates 
and the expenditures of the Senate of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every department has to appear before the relevant committee of 
the House.  The Ministry of Transport, the Ministry of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, the CRTC, the Canadian Wheat Board, 
they all have to be there, except the Senate of Canada.  Senator 
Rompkey said no that he was not accountable to the House of 
Commons, yet the House of Commons has to sign this blank cheque 
for the Senate of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the member for Brandon—Souris, that famous Tory who 
supported David Orchard for the leadership, must be hanging his 
head in shame on this one.  I can hear him rattling his head from 
this far away.  Is he going to get up and say he is going to sign 
this blank cheque for the Senate of Canada?  His constituents are 
watching as they flip channels tonight.  They are watching. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senator Rompkey refused to appear before any committee of the 
House of Commons.  No senator has justified the expenditures.  No 
senator has been willing to sit there and be cross-examined by 
members of parliament asking why they want to spend so much money 
on the salary for Senator Balfour, or on a restaurant, or on a 
tunnel, or on a fancy committee room, or for travelling the world 
to study boreal forests and so on.  They are not doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Canadians should do is take out their pencils and paper 
because the Senate unlike the House of Commons has a toll free 
number.  We do not have a toll free number but it has one. They 
should call a senator.  The member for Sarnia—Lambton did not 
know who Senator James Balfour was.  Phone him tonight.  Give him 
a call. They can call a senator at 1-800-267-7362.  Does the 
member for Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre remember that number? Can 
the member from Calgary remember that number? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the Canadian people should be doing tonight and 
tomorrow.  Pick up a phone and call their favourite senator.  Ask 
why senators had a 10% increase last year, a 6% increase this 
year, a 16% increase over two years more than any government 
department received, more than the Department of Health for 
medicare, more than the educational system in this country, more 
than the salary increase the member for Regina—Lumsden—Lake 
Centre was lobbying for.  People should do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am anxious to see how the House will vote tonight on this 
particular motion, including our Conservative Party friend from 
Brandon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a little demonstration outside the Senate today.  A 
member from the Reform Party, the Liberal Party, the New 
Democratic Party and the Bloc Quebecois organized a little rally. 
No one from the Conservatives was there.  They did not show up. 
Their caucus is dominated by senators.  They were not there. They 
have a lot of senators in that caucus.  They could have been 
there protesting this huge cash grab by the Senate of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has come for members of parliament to reflect what 
their constituents are saying when it comes to the Senate. About 
5% of the people support the existing Senate.  The rest either 
want to abolish it or reform it, change it in some way.  Members 
of parliament should be listening to what their constituents are 
saying and reflecting what their constituents are saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge every member of parliament, including the member for 
Brandon—Souris, to go out and knock on doors in their ridings. 
Ask the first 10 people on the street whether or not they support 
the existing Senate.  Unless they run into a senator from 
Manitoba, the answer will be a resounding no. We should start 
reflecting that in the House of Commons and actually do in this 
place what the people of this country want us to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also believe along with many others in the House that the 
Senate should be abolished.  I also know there are members of the 
federal cabinet who would be on the record for talking about 
abolishing the Senate.  The external affairs, constitutional 
affairs and industry ministers among others have spoken out at 
various times in the past about the abolition of the Senate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I am saying that is I have given up on the idea that 
we are going to reform the Senate.  It has been tried ad nauseam 
year in and year out.  We have had 132 years of the existing 
Senate.  As the member for Sarnia—Lambton said, 132 years ago it 
was set up as part of our constitutional framework because we 
copied the model in Great Britain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1867 the people elected the house of commoners.  The people 
here were commoners. The aristocracy in those days thought there 
should be someone looking down on the commoners and keeping them 
in line. That was the House of Lords or the Senate in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have long evolved through that system where the commoners 
have to be looked upon and controlled by the aristocracy or the 
elite. We have come to the position now where there is no place 
for an unelected, undemocratic, unaccountable house.  I believe 
we are never going to reform the Senate. There are many people in 
the Reform Party, some Liberals and some Tories who think we can 
still reform that place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can still have the equality of the provinces, with Prince 
Edward Island with as many senators as Ontario or as many 
senators as Quebec.  Quebec has seven million people and Ontario 
has ten million.  Prince Edward Island has 130,000 people.  But 
we are never going to get an agreement that will call for the 
equality of all those provinces in terms of the configuration of 
a new Senate. I believe it is never going to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should go out across the country and campaign among the 
people of Canada. Between now and the next federal election we 
should campaign on the issue of abolishing the other place. Make 
it an issue in the next campaign. Force the people in all 
political parties to take a position on what they want to do with 
the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do that and we get rid of the other place we then have to 
reform the House of Commons and bring into this place many of the 
things the Senate was supposed to do.  It was supposed to be a 
place for checks and balances.  It was supposed to be a place to 
review legislation. That is obviously not happening in the other 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can do it here by strengthening parliamentary committees, by 
having fewer confidence votes, by having more free votes.  We can 
do it by giving the committees of the House of Commons the power 
to initiate legislation, initiate studies and reviews.  There can 
be better budgets for committees so they can set their own 
timetables, and they can actually timetable when legislation must 
come to the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also time to take away power from the executive, namely 
the Prime Minister.  This is no criticism of any particular Prime 
Minister; it is a criticism of our system.  The Prime Minister's 
office in Canada has immense power to appoint cabinet ministers, 
parliamentary secretaries, parliamentary committees, even though 
there is a so-called election in the committees. A lot of that 
power should be taken away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also take away a lot of the power that the Prime 
Minister has in making major appointments to crown agencies. I 
think of the CRTC, the Canadian Wheat Board and many other 
agencies, boards and commissions. I also think of the Supreme 
Court of Canada and federal judges.  I do not think the federal 
government should have the unilateral power to appoint federal 
judges to the Supreme Court of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In most of these cases the federal government should have the 
right to nominate someone it wants to nominate but it should go 
to the relevant committee of the House to have hearings and 
ratify or reject the nomination of the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I came to that conclusion in about 1978 or 1979 when I saw the 
then Prime Minister, who happened to be Pierre Trudeau but it 
could have been anyone else including the member for 
Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, appoint Bryce Mackasey as the head 
of Air Canada.  Bryce Mackasey knew as much about Air Canada and 
aviation as I know about the Atlantic fishery, which is very 
little. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not meet a single Liberal backbencher in those days who 
supported the nomination of Bryce Mackasey, who by the way was 
and is a friend of mine and a very honourable gentleman.  He is a 
very wonderful person.  I am not criticizing him.  But that was 
not the position he should have been appointed to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not meet a single Liberal backbencher in those days who 
supported the nomination of Bryce Mackasey as the president of 
Air Canada.  Of course it was a crown corporation in those days. 
But because of our parliamentary system, they were handcuffed. 
Their hands were tied. They could do nothing about it because it 
was the prerogative of the Prime Minister to appoint the 
president of Air Canada, just like the Prime Minister now 
appoints the president of the CBC who last time around happened 
to be another good friend, Perrin Beatty, who was a minister in 
the cabinet of Brian Mulroney. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event if we had had serious parliamentary reform in those 
days and the Prime Minister could have only made the nomination 
but the relevant committee, transport at that time, would have 
the right to have hearings and ratify or reject, Mr. Mackasey 
would never have been nominated by the Prime Minister.  The Prime 
Minister would have known that Mr. Mackasey would never have 
survived those review and ratification hearings.  There would 
have been a nomination by the Prime Minister of someone who would 
have been more able and capable to be president of Air Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we need some serious parliamentary reform. When we 
vote in the House of Commons to reject the estimates of the 
Senate, we do so knowing that we just cannot get rid of the other 
place and leave a vacuum and a vacancy but it is important to 
also reform the House of Commons. Bring the process of review and 
the process of checks and balances into the House of Commons 
itself.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I also believe that other powers should be taken away from the 
prime minister.  There are many countries in the world, for 
example, where the prime minister or the president cannot set the 
election date unilaterally.  I think we should look at that as 
well.  Many countries do not give the right to their prime 
minister to set the election date.  If we took that right away 
and had elections every three, four or five years, that would 
take a lot of power away from the prime minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also think that we should have in statute set times for throne 
speeches and budgets so that we could have a timetable for those 
items as well, not in accordance with the wishes or the agenda of 
the prime minister, but in accordance with what is best for the 
country as a whole.  We pretty well have the practice of setting 
the budget date in the month of February, but it is not in 
statute and we do not have set throne speech dates.  If we did 
there would be a better planning process for the provinces, the 
municipalities, the school boards, the hospitals and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that these are some of the things we should be looking 
at as parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make one final comment this evening, which is a bit 
more radical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Radical, from the NDP? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  A bit more radical.  I know the hon. 
member for Calgary West will support this, but I am not sure 
about the more frugal member for St. Albert. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we should also be looking at incorporating the idea of 
at least some proportional representation into our electoral 
system so that we give a voice to all Canadians in the country, 
regardless of whom they want to vote for and where they come 
from.  I have presented a private member's bill to this effect. 
This would give some regional representation to the central 
institution of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, when Tony Blair reforms the British 
parliament the election after next, we will be the only 
parliamentary system in the world that does not have at least 
some PR mixed into our system.  I am not talking about advocating 
a totally pure PR system like there is in Israel.  I think we 
should have a mixed number proportional, where we have some 
members, maybe half or two-thirds, representing constituents. 
That would be topped up by members elected by PR in a very 
democratic way, where the party leadership does not choose the 
people who go on that particular list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that because this House of Commons is supposed to be a 
reflection of the Canadian people.  However, if we look at the 
composition of the House today, we have a majority government 
with the constitutional right to govern for five years.  What 
vote did it get last time?  It got 38%, with a turnout of about 
67%.  The turnout has been plummeting in the last 30 years.  In 
1968, 80% of the people voted.  Last time it was 67%, largely 
because people asked “Why bother?  Why waste my vote? 
Politicians do not listen.  How I vote does not seem to make any 
difference”.  In many cases that is absolutely true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1921 we have only had two elections where a majority of 
the people voted for the government in power.  They were in 1945 
with Mackenzie King and in 1958 with John Diefenbaker.  Brian 
Mulroney came close in 1984 with 49.7% or 49.8%.  During that 
time we have had many majority governments and every one of them, 
except for those two, was elected by a minority.  Really what we 
have is the tyranny of the minority in the House of Commons 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have other distortions in the House of Commons.  The Reform 
Party and the Conservative Party got about 19% of the votes each. 
The Conservative Party got 20 seats and the Reform Party got 60 
seats. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are now 21 NDP members and 44 from the Bloc 
Quebecois.  In the last election, the Bloc Quebecois obtained 
11% of the vote and the NDP also obtained 11%. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had the same vote as the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The votes are not reflected in the House of Commons in 
accordance with the way that the people of this country vote. 
Therefore, most people consider that their vote is wasted.  Most 
Canadians voted for losing candidates.  If we had a system of PR 
incorporated into the House there would not be a single lost vote 
in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A person could, for example, vote Liberal in parts of the 
prairies where that party cannot win and that vote would still 
count. A person could vote NDP in southern Alberta and that vote 
would count.  A person could vote Reform in Newfoundland and that 
vote would count.  A person could even vote Conservative in 
Saskatchewan and that vote would count.  I suppose that a person 
could vote for the Bloc Quebecois in British Columbia and that 
vote would still count, if there was a system in this country 
that had a measure of proportional representation built into it 
like every other parliamentary system in the world.  Every other 
parliamentary system in the world has it except Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think these are some of the changes we need, some of the 
reforms we need.  What we need in this country is big democracy. 
Allow the people in.  Let the people's voice be heard.  Let the 
people say what they want in this country. 
That is the way we should go.

Balfour, Berntson, Cogger and everybody else in the Senate.  I 
hope the member does that this evening in the House of Commons.

democratize our electoral system and democratize our

serious democratic change for the people of this country.  If we 
do that we could make a real contribution to the new millennium

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
a brief comment to make before asking my honourable colleague a 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently mailed out in my riding 48,000 copies of a 16-page 
pamphlet containing a great deal of information on senators, 
with a breakdown of their income and benefits, and what they do 
in the Senate.  In addition to being extremely well paid and 
having a multitude of benefits, they serve particular interests. 
Some even sit on the board of multiple corporations, as well as 
defending the interests of certain parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reaction in my riding was extremely virulent. 
Hundreds of people called up to ask “How can Canada allow an 
institution that is not representative, not elected and not 
accountable?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the pamphlet, I gave two phone numbers, one for the Senate, 
which I think is still connected, and the other for the PMO. 
They have been swamped with calls and the PMO line had to be 
disconnected.  The Senate line may well follow suit before long 
if people keep on calling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the points raised by the leader of the government in the 
House was that there were a great many constitutional problems 
relating to the Senate regulations.  In this document, since we 
have the power to set the Senate's budget, I propose that its 
budget be limited to $1 per senator per year. 
This will encourage the senators to retire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would therefore ask my colleague if he finds that budget 
formula more acceptable than allocating $30 million to the 
Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree with the member for 
Québec East.  A unique way to abolish the Senate of Canada would 
be to reduce its budget from $60 million a year to $104, or $1 
per senator.  With a budget of $1 per senator, the Senate would 
be abolished de facto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would perhaps be a way of coming up with a solution that 
did not involve the Constitution of Canada or its amending 
formula.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with him, and I think that our party does as well, if 
there is a way to do this without going through the lengthy 
process of amending our Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with the Constitution is that we need unanimous 
consent to abolish the Senate and even to reform it.  We need 
unanimous consent for a great many things.  In other cases the 
section 42 formula applies.  We then need the consent of 
two-thirds of the provinces representing 50% of the Canadian 
population, in addition to the support of parliament.  I 
therefore agree with the hon. member. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK333"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened 
very closely to what the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle said.  He 
made some excellent points.  Without question, the Canadian 
public does not support a non-elected Senate.  If a survey was 
sent out to 100 Canadians, I dare say that 70 of them would say 
they do not support a non-elected Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  It would be 99. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  No, I would not put it that high, 
certainly not in the riding I represent, because I sent a survey 
out to every household in the riding, which came back with 70% in 
favour of an elected Senate, not in favour of abolishing the 
Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike both hon. members who spoke, I do not think we do such a 
great job in the House.  I do not think we are the last line of 
defence for the Canadian public.  I am not so full of myself that 
I could believe that we could put something forth in the House of 
Commons and have the final say for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not for a moment say that we should not have another 
house to keep check of the House of Commons, regardless of who 
sits on that side or on this side of the House.  I also do not 
think that we are doing justice to Canadians by having four 
official opposition parties in the House of Commons.  I would 
like the hon. member's comments on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fully agree that we should do something about the Senate, but 
stopping their budget?  Let us be real.  Let us have an elected 
Senate.  Let us do something about it.  I do not care if it is a 
triple E Senate or a double E Senate, I want the word 
“election” in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to holding back its budget, the Senate does do 
some good work.  It has some members who should not be members of 
the Senate.  We have some members of parliament who should not be 
members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us do something progressive and positive.  I will offer my 
support to reform the Senate, but not to abolish it.  It is as 
simple as that.  I would like to have the hon. member's comments 
on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not sure what more 
I could add.  First, let us say that we have a consensus that the 
existing Senate is not supported by many people in this country. 
The survey which the hon. member took indicated that there was 
about 30% support in his riding.  The Angus Reid poll indicated 
that around 5% of the people of this country support the existing 
Senate. Pollara did a poll which indicated that it was a bit 
higher than that.  By the way, just in terms of the record, the 
Angus Reid poll indicated that 41% of the people wanted to 
abolish the Senate and 43% wanted to reform the Senate.  Pollara 
did a poll which indicated that 36% of the people wanted to 
abolish the Senate and 35% wanted to reform the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit to the hon. member that his constituents probably think 
in a similar way to people right across the country.  If he had a 
question worded as to whether his constituents wanted to reform 
the Senate, abolish the Senate or maintain the status quo, I am 
sure in his riding the opinion would be overwhelmingly to not 
have the status quo, but would be divided on whether we should 
abolish or reform it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should unite in terms of getting rid of the status quo.  Let 
us listen to that 90% or 95% of the Canadian people.  Liberal 
members feel the same way, if we could get rid of these crazy 
handcuffs of confidence votes on estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that if Conservative members were to reflect the 
interests of their constituents and forget about their friends in 
the Senate they too would vote in favour of reducing Senate 
estimates.  If we could unite on that point, that the status quo 
is not good enough and it has to go, then we could have a real 
debate after the next federal election to come up with a formula 
either to elect it or abolish it.  I would like to see that be 
the real debate.  At that time I will obviously be continuing my 
support for abolition.  One reason for that, and I want to throw 
this at my friends in the Reform Party, especially my friend from 
St. Albert who is so concerned about money, is that if we have an 
elected house it is not going to cost $60 million.  We could 
probably double or triple that because it will have legitimacy. 
We will then have an awful lot of money being spent in terms of 
its elections, its staff, its travel and its facilities.

always stood against.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>POINTS OF ORDER

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>APPROPRIATION BILL 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK336"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
on a point of order with respect to the appropriation bill which 
we are about to consider at all stages tonight.  In my opinion 
the bill is out of order since it is attempting to approve 
expenditure for the Department of Canadian Heritage Parks Canada 
Agency for the fiscal year 2000-01. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subclause 6(2) at page 3 of the bill states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amounts appropriated by Schedule 2 may be spent at any time on or 
before March 31, 2001, so long as every expenditure is charged 
first against the relevant amount appropriated that is earliest 
in time until that amount is exhausted, next against the relevant 
amount appropriated that is next in time until that amount is 
exhausted and so on. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Schedule 2 of the bill at page 58 attempts to appropriate 
$245,857,000 for the fiscal years April 1, 1999 to March 31, 
2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, if you review the standing orders and our 
practices, the estimates process is designed to deal with the 
next fiscal year and not the fiscal year after that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will start with citation 933 of Beauchesne's sixth edition 
which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the Estimates is to present to Parliament the 
budgetary and non-budgetary expenditure proposals of the 
Government for the next fiscal year. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citation 934 states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In accordance with Standing Order 81(4), in every session the 
main Estimates to cover the incoming fiscal year for every 
department of government shall be referred to the standing 
committees— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If citation 934 is read in full, it goes on to talk more about 
the current fiscal year.  Citation 944 states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Estimates are limited to setting out only the sums which it 
is calculated will be required in the current year, and do not 
show the value of assets held or the liabilities outstanding from 
the previous financial year or to be spread over future years. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While these citations refer to the estimates, citation 968 ties 
the appropriation bill into this argument.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concurrence by the House in the Estimates is an Order of the 
House to bring in a bill, known as the appropriation bill based 
thereon. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we review the standing order starting with Standing Order 
81(1) and follow through to Standing Order 81(22), they all deal 
with the principle that the estimates are to cover the incoming 
fiscal year and not the year after that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have example after example before us from both Beauchesne's 
and the standing orders of the House which clearly demonstrate 
that the estimates and appropriation acts are intended to deal 
with one fiscal year at a time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fear that the legislation such as this before us is eroding 
the power of parliamentarians and the power of the House to make 
informed decisions on granting supply to the crown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this bill is allowed to remain on the order paper, it will 
set a dangerous precedent where the estimates will no longer be 
required to be published and passed on a yearly basis. 
Therefore, I believe that Appropriation Act No. 2, 1999-2000, 
Bill C-86 as it will become known, should be ruled out of order 
and removed from the order paper forthwith.

<P><A NAME="LINK339"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
guess I must start my dissertation with what vitriolic balderdash 
we hear from members of the New Democratic Party, of the Reform 
Party and of the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if it has any bearing on the fact that all three of 
those parties have no representation or membership in the Senate. 
Quite frankly they never will have any representative in the 
Senate because they would have to form government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc will never form government.  The NDP is lucky to even 
be here and, if the New Brunswick and Ontario elections are any 
indication, probably will not be here in the future.  As for the 
Reform Party, we do not know where it is.  We do not know who the 
Reformers will be running under, what they will be running under 
or if they will even be in the House.  It would be best for 
Canadians if they did not come back to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about a couple of issues.  We are dealing with 
government appropriations for many departments.  We could be 
standing here today debating the appropriations for the 
Department of Health, a huge budget and an issue that resonates 
across the country with every individual Canadian.  Health deals 
with each and every one of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could be dealing with appropriations for the Department of 
Agriculture, which has a budget of $1.2 billion, not $50 million. 
Its budget should be increased because there are some very 
serious issues within the Department of Agriculture such as the 
development of a long term policy that deals with natural 
disasters.  The member from the NDP should have talked to that 
because his constituents are being directly affected by what is 
going on as we speak.  Members of the Reform Party should be 
talking about it because their areas are directly impacted by 
what is going on right now in agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are having a Senate bashing debate.  We have a $50 million 
appropriation and we are having a full debate in the House of 
Commons when there are issues out there that certainly should be 
talked about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if members would listen 
they would learn something.  We are a party unlike some other 
parties in the House that do not know whether they are fish or 
fowl at this point in time.  We will not get into those debates 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I first came to the House, probably as uninformed as Reform 
Party members or perhaps not quite as uniformed because I do have 
a tendency to learn and listen, I too had some questions as to 
the viability and the responsibility of members of the Senate.  I 
have an advantage because my party has members sitting in the 
Senate.  I have the advantage of listening, learning and keeping 
an open mind, which obviously sometimes is not shared by other 
members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I first came to the House I looked across the House and saw 
a government with a majority and a piece of legislation called 
Bill C-4. 
That piece of legislation was to revamp the Canadian Wheat Board. 
It was a very important piece of legislation to my constituents 
and to others.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I was wondering what relevance reference to Bill C-4 has 
to a vote on money for the Senate.  I wonder if you could rule on 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is the hon. member 
for Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre suggesting the Chair should rule 
on relevancy in the debate tonight? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  No, not at all sir. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if that were one of the 
criteria, the hon. member would never have been able to speak in 
the House since he was elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell him how Bill C-4 becomes relevant to the debate on 
whether the Senate has a place to play in parliamentary democracy 
in the country.  Bill C-4 had some serious flaws when it came to 
the House, but a government with a majority has a tendency not to 
listen to members of the opposition who quite frankly have some 
very good ideas and thoughts about how legislation could be made 
better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately that piece of legislation was rammed through 
committee and through the House.  The only opportunity I had to 
make that legislation better was to elicit the support of the 
Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate did a wonderful job.  The senators went out and 
listened to the Canadian public.  They were accountable to the 
Canadian public.  They held Senate hearings at which they 
listened to the stakeholders.  They made changes that made the 
legislation better.  It is a check and balance.  It is an 
opportunity for parliamentarians to solicit and elicit the other 
house to make legislation better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a stroke of a pen the Reform Party would abolish the 
Senate.  Where would we be?  We would have a majority government 
able to do anything it wanted to the citizens of the country 
because it has a majority.  The Reform Party has no plans.  It 
has no understanding of parliamentary democracy.  There is a 
requirement to have that check and balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should there be reconstruction of the existing Senate?  Of 
course there should but it should be done logically and with a 
well thought out plan.  Let us not do it with vitriolic 
balderdash.  Let us go forward and make sure that not only 
Canadians agree with the new plan but that the House and the 
Senate agree with the new structure and plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give the House some ideas that were put forward in the 
Charlottetown accord.  The Charlottetown accord came forward with 
restructuring of the Senate in mind.  Who did not support it? The 
Reform Party did not support it.  It did not want to restructure 
the Senate and make a change to the status quo.  It did not want 
to think logically about how Canadians could be better governed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The governance of the country was not important to that party. 
What was important was simply the matter of partisan politics, 
the hot button issues, instead of health care, agriculture and 
all other departments that are important to the country which we 
should be talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell the House about the Senate.  The Senate has helped 
me in the job that I do.  I have that opportunity.  When I came 
here I did not think that what was there was right.  In fact 
there has to be some restructuring, but members opposite should 
take the time to phone the 1-800 number to talk to the senators. 
They are very accessible and very open.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Phone the 800 number that has been advertised by the NDP right 
now.  Talk to the senators.  Ask them their opinion.  There are 
some very bright, experienced and very dedicated people in that 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not mention names like the hon. member from Saskatchewan 
did because I do not think it is fair that we use those names in 
this House, but I can take members to the people who spend as 
much if not more time in their house than do probably the 
majority of members of parliament.  There are good and bad in 
every house.  I believe that the majority of the senators who sit 
on our side in the Senate are very good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about what would happen if there was not that check 
and balance.  Simple solutions for very complex issues is where 
the Reform come on this one; a stroke of the pen and let us get 
rid of the Senate.  Where would we be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now we have a government that sits in power with its 
majority coming from Ontario.  Do we want Ontario to run Canada? 
I think not.  The Reform Party has a mantra that the west wants 
in.  It would certainly be a heck of a lot harder for the west to 
have its voice heard if it was simply an Ontario or Quebec based 
government.  Now we have the opportunity for the check and 
balance because we have the other house to call on when 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talked about an elected Senate.  I have to honestly say that 
I have not got my head around this one yet.  I have tried to 
analyse it; I have tried to look at all the pros and cons which 
is obviously something some of the members in the Reform Party 
and the NDP have not done.  They simply like to push the button. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I looked at the American system.  The member from Regina said 
that we look at other jurisdictions and what is good and what is 
bad.  I look at the American senate which is elected. I see an 
administration of one political stripe and a house and senate of 
another political stripe.  They get nothing done.  They stop each 
other.  They block each other. That is not good for democracy 
either.  I am not so sure that the elected side of it should be 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about the reform in the Charlottetown accord.  We 
talked about term limitations, something that everybody here 
should talk about and discuss logically.  At one point in time a 
senator was appointed for life.  That was wrong.  Now senators 
are appointed until age 75.  That too may be wrong.  But what are 
the solutions?  Should we have term limitations? Perhaps. 
Personally I could support a term limitation on the appointment 
of a senator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was also mentioned there should be some gauge as to what the 
efficiency and the effectiveness was for an individual.  I agree. 
There should be gauges, attendance requirements and effectiveness 
and efficiency standards that have to be met. There is nothing 
wrong with that.  We do it in the House.  Our gauge and our 
standard is obviously an election.  The Senate should have gauges 
and standards as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also talk about the effectiveness of the Senate and 
how it could be more accountable to the public it represents. The 
example was given that the senator from Regina has not been seen 
in Regina.  That is wrong.  A senator who is appointed to a 
provincial responsibility and jurisdiction should represent that 
responsibility and jurisdiction.  That is part of the 
restructuring that should go on within the Senate, but it should 
not be a stroke of a pen abolition because it is not good 
governance for this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was also said that senators do not do anything.  I just gave 
the House the example of Bill C-4 which was very important, 
although the member from the NDP decided that Bill C-4 was not a 
very important piece of legislation.  Probably because he agreed 
with Bill C-4 we disagreed with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of this House were treated as fools when Bill C-55 was 
put through. There was an urgency because we were going to 
protect the Canadian heritage. We were going to make sure that we 
would not back down from the Americans.  It was a piece of 
legislation that was absolutely necessary. 
Where is Bill C-55 now?  The only people who held up Bill C-55 to 
have it checked by the Canadian public was the Senate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government will be accountable for that.  It was the wrong 
way to put that legislation through, it was the wrong legislation 
and it will be accountable.  The only one that had the 
opportunity to bring that out in the open was the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-78 is a piece of legislation that came through the House 
because the Liberals are the majority.  It was to take pensions 
away from superannuates.  Thirty billion dollars will be taken 
away from Canadians because the government has a majority, but 
the bill has not passed the Senate.  There will be accountability 
to the government because we have that check and balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not get me wrong.  I said earlier that I believe very 
strongly there has to be some restructuring, but to sit here and 
say that we will not approve a $50 million budget for the other 
House is balderdash.  It is not the way to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am disappointed and frustrated that we are not talking about 
real issues.  Canadians should be able to deal with real issues. 
Canadians should have an opportunity to speak to real issues such 
as services that should be delivered by this government and that 
are not being delivered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We waste our time talking about a budget of $50 million instead 
of the billions of dollars being wasted by this government or the 
billions of dollars being taken by this government from 
legitimate Canadians.  Why? Because Reform wants to Senate bash. 
That is all it wants to do.  It is the hot button politics of the 
Reform Party.  Frankly, Canadians are losing when they have 
representation from the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A member of the NDP said that if most constituents would not 
support the Senate. In New Brunswick, most Canadians spoke and 
they did not support the NDP.  There is one NDP member.  In 
Ontario the constituents listened and they did not support the 
NDP.  It has no official party status in Ontario.  I believe in 
the electorate.  I believe the electorate does the right thing. 
In this case, they certainly did the right thing.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the member for Brandon—Souris just stood in this House 
and gave a speech.  The same leader of his party appointed a 
senator 20 years ago, the phantom senator from Regina, a fellow 
by the name of James Balfour who has not been seen in the city of 
Regina for 20 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder whether he was giving this speech to get himself in the 
Senate or whether he actually believes that taxpayers' money 
should be invested in someone by the name of James Balfour, a 
senator who has not been to Regina in the 20 years I have been 
around.  I have never met the guy.  Regina is a small city with 
about 200,000 people.  I have been in public office off and on 
and have been involved in community associations for about 26 
years. I had never heard of this guy.  He was appointed by former 
Prime Minister Joe Clark, a friend of James Balfour.  I guess 
James Balfour disappeared at the same time Joe Clark did because 
we have not seen Joe Clark for about 10 or 20 years either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder whether the Conservative member for Brandon—Souris 
continues to support the Senate when Conservatives in 
Saskatchewan, 18 former elected Conservatives were jailed because 
of the corruption they were involved with. One was the former 
deputy premier, Eric Berntson, who is now a senator.  After years 
of gouging Saskatchewan taxpayers he was appointed to the Senate. 
He was found guilty on a number of fraud charges and breach of 
trust and now he is being paid as a senator as a result of the 
wonderful Conservative Party.

</I></B></P><P align=left>How long does the hon. member for Brandon—Souris believe the 
taxpayers of Canada should be supporting convicted felons such as 
Senator Michel Cogger and Senator Eric Berntson to the tune of 
about $500,000 a year for them, their expenses and their offices 
each before we toss them out because of their convictions in the 
courts? How much longer will this member support the subsidy of 
these individuals who have gouged Canadians for far too long? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think even the member 
of the NDP who obviously is a bit of a socialist would agree that 
individuals are in fact innocent until proven guilty and have 
gone through all the opportunities for appeal.  I am sure that 
every member would defend that aspect of our judicial system and 
of our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I would say that we as parliamentarians, even though the 
hon. member may not agree with this, do not do a very good job of 
keeping that side of the House in order.  There are others in 
this parliamentary system who are required in order to have that 
check and balance and that control.  For a $50 million budget, I 
certainly have no difficulty in keeping that house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, and I am sure the hon. member did not listen very well 
when I said it, that does not mean there should not be some 
changes.  That does not mean the status quo must stay. That does 
not mean there should not be some restructuring within the Senate 
itself.  We would have done that a long time ago had those 
members supported the Charlottetown accord.  Instead, they voted 
against the Charlottetown accord.  That would have been in place.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I and 
other members of this place, some of whom are in the House today, 
went through a fairly exhaustive process of gathering petitions 
from across the land.  Media outlets, such as the <I>Sun</I> 
newspaper chain and QR77 radio, put out their own forms of Senate 
petitions.  I collected petitions on the whole idea of Senate 
reform and Senate election.  Other members of the House collected 
petitions on the issue of Senate abolition.  I do not think that 
those people felt as though they were heard. They did not get 
responses from senators or from the Prime Minister's office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talked about phoning senators and the Prime 
Minister's office.  The member of the NDP mentioned the number. I 
have a note here that if somebody wants to call the Senate I 
believe the number is 1-800-267-7362.  I ask the hon. member if— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  As you can obviously see, and certainly anyone watching 
on TV can see, the hon. member is holding up a prop.  He is 
writing on the back of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
South Shore is quite correct.  It is inappropriate to use a prop 
in the House and I accept the admonition.  I should have stopped 
it immediately.  I did check on my monitor and it was impossible 
to read, the hon. member will be unhappy to know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I apologize. 
I ask the hon. member of the Progressive Conservative Party, was 
the number 1-800-267-7362 to call senators?  There was a question 
about the Prime Minister as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  If the hon. member 
gets away with it once, shame on me.  If he gets away with it 
twice, really, that is it.

anything of any substance in those comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Actually people do not have to call the 1-800 number.  If they 
wish, they can call my office and I will put them in touch with 
the senators I know with their personal phone numbers. Those 
phone numbers are listed, so I am sure the hon. member could find 
them.

for Brandon—Souris. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am looking for the right adjective.  I thought it was perhaps 
a cathartic address, but I will settle for the notion that his 
remarks were fertilizing in an atmosphere where one badly 
demanded ideas.

movement to give British Columbia, rightly recognized as the

Manitoba to share a third of another 20%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, Manitoba already has the 
third of the 20% of the seats.  We have seven senators currently 
in the province of Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No you don't.  You only have six.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  I don't know where he's at.  I was 
looking for the seventh senator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I very honestly suggest to the hon. member that obviously would 
require a constitutional change.  I am prepared to look at 
anything that will give better representation to the country. I 
will also look at making sure that there is a fair and honest 
distribution of those senators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier in my dissertation I said that I had not gotten my head 
around elections just yet.  However, I feel very strongly that in 
part of that reform we should look at the possibility of 
provincial governments playing a much more active role in the 
appointment process, not necessarily the appointments but the 
appointment process of senators to the Senate of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak to this fundamental question of supply for 
the maintenance of the Senate of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To begin with, I need hardly point out that the Bloc Quebecois 
is against granting any such supply, in whatever amount, to the 
upper chamber, because our party proposes its abolition pure and 
simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was the position we took in our 1993 election platform.  It 
is a position that still has unanimous support among our 
members.  The reason I am taking this position in the House 
today is not just because it was part of our election platform 
in 1993. 
There are obviously a number of empirical, objective arguments 
underlying this position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, let us start by pointing out that this institution, which 
is the Upper House of Canada's parliament, has no basis in the 
realities of Quebec or Canada. Let us look back at the context 
in which it was created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The British Parliament in London, which is in a way, as 
anglophones say, the mother of the British-type parliaments, is 
obviously a bicameral parliament, with an upper chamber, the 
House of Lords, and a lower chamber, which is the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of the House of Commons, the parallel, the link 
between the House of Commons in London and the House of Commons 
here in Ottawa, is very easy to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As regards the House of Lords, they wanted to create a similar 
House when Canada was born, when they realized, horror of 
horrors, that there was no nobility in Canada. So they could not 
create a House of Lords on the same principle and model as the 
one in London. They therefore created something a little bit 
different, drawing on the model in London. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United Kingdom, as we know, there is hereditary nobility, 
which is passed from father to son or from mother to daughter 
now. There are counts, viscounts, barons, dukes, duchesses and 
so on. There are also nobles who are given titles which are not 
hereditary. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2105"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT132"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been the case of a number of Canadians in history, such 
as Sir John A. Macdonald or Sir George-Étienne Cartier, but these 
people could not pass their nobility on to their descendants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They wanted to create something similar here in Canada, since in 
the middle of the 19th century, in Quebec for example, the 
seigniorial system had been abolished. So there was, properly 
speaking, no more native or local nobility in Canada. 
Accordingly, they created a system that made it possible to 
basically appoint people and give them the nobility by 
appointing them to the Senate, not by giving them a title but 
by giving them the title of senator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members will recall that initially appointment was for 
life, until it was realized in the 1950's and 1960's that having 
senators for life had, one might say, lowered the level of 
debate in the other place, it having become a rather— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard: </B>Aging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> —aging place, to say the least. At that 
time, the decision was made to do away with the notion of 
appointments for life and to drop the age to 75, which is far 
earlier needless to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first finding is that this institution, which has absolutely 
no connection with our reality, is obsolete, archaic and 
totally devoid of any meaning to the people of Canada or Quebec, 
or any connection to their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, this House ought to promote and defend the interests of 
the various regions of Canada.  A noble objective, if ever there 
was one, but it became quickly apparent that far from defending 
the interests of the regions, the institution was far more what 
one might call an asset for the government by defending the 
interests of the party in power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am weighing my words carefully but that chamber has, over the 
years, for all intents and purposes, turned into a veritable den 
of patronage in that the nominations go to friends of the 
party, friends of the regime. 
They would never have gone as far as to appoint people of other 
political persuasions, which has meant that the other place has 
representatives of only two parties despite the fact that there 
are five parties represented in the House of Commons.  In the 
upper chamber only the two parties that have divided the power 
ever since Confederation are represented, in other words the 
Liberals and the Progressive Conservatives.  They are 
surprisingly in favour of allocating supply to the upper 
chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That chamber, which was intended to defend the regions, has 
finally come to defend the interests of the government far more 
than those of the regions.  It is not representative of the full 
political spectrum represented here in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, I think it should be pointed out that this House, 
as I said, whose job it was to defend the regions, does not 
represent the full range of the political spectrum of the 
regions.  For instance, there are New Democratic governments in 
western Canada. Are these governments represented in the upper 
chamber?  Of course not.  There is a sovereignist government in 
Quebec.  Are the interests of the sovereignist government of the 
national assembly, with its sovereignist majority, represented 
in the other place?  Of course not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So the initial purpose for which the other chamber was created, 
which was to defend the interests of the regions, also no longer 
holds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other factor is that this chamber is a somewhat dusty 
institution that has accomplished the feat—if feat it be—of 
breaking the records for unpopularity and lack of credibility, 
even beating out lawyers and politicians according to the polls. 
That takes some doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Joking aside, we unfortunately have an image of the Senate 
as an institution where people go to live out their retirement 
years in peace, after loyal service to the party in power, and 
where there is really no incentive to do more than is necessary, 
where people can pursue their professions on the side thus 
building up their income.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are, of course, extreme cases—former Senator Thompson comes 
to mind—who do serious damage to the Senate's credibility in the 
eyes of the public.  The public, which should normally have 
faith in its political institutions, sees one of the Houses of 
Parliament as completely discredited and no longer has any faith 
in them at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This parliament, according to the advocates of federalism in 
this House and throughout Canada, is a model of democracy around 
the world. Yet one of the Houses that pass the laws of this 
country is appointed by the Prime Minister. What is the 
democratic prerogative of such an institution? Is the presence 
of the Senate in this parliament not a democratic disadvantage 
in this great country, which wants to be an example for the 
world as a whole? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are few countries around the world that are real 
democracies and of those there are few around the world that 
may boast of having their Houses appointed by the Prime 
Minister, appointments that are basely and blatantly partisan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should look at the relevance of having such a House, which 
costs taxpayers a minimum of $50 million annually. 
We need only look at the situations of manifest suffering in a 
number of ridings, and even in all ridings in the country to 
various degrees. I am thinking of the riding of my colleague 
from Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, which has the highest rate of poverty 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can his fellow citizens allow an institution that costs $50 
million annually to continue to survive while they can barely 
make ends meet? These people experience anger, confusion and 
indignation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could say that in any self-respecting democracy the presence 
of two Houses is a guarantee of balance and against the 
appropriation of power by a single House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people in this non-elected House on the other side are simply 
there because of service rendered to the government opposite and 
therefore really do not need to take the interests of the public 
to heart. I say that with an aside because there are, needless 
to say, and we all know some of them, senators who give fully of 
themselves and work very hard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is not so much the individuals making up the 
institution, although for most of them, for the reasons they 
were appointed, it may in fact be a problem. But the institution 
itself, because of its nature, is the source of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can this institution claim to constitute a balance aimed at 
preventing this House, elected by the people of Canada and 
Quebec, from gaining the upper hand?  Every single provincial 
legislature has got rid of their legislative councils.  The last 
one to do so, the Quebec National Assembly, abolished its 
legislative council in 1968, if I am not mistaken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the supporters of the Senate dare to claim here in this 
House that the provincial legislatures and the Quebec National 
Assembly are less democratic institutions because they have 
abolished their legislative councils?  Absolutely not.  There is 
no connection whatsoever.  We are very much aware that the best 
guarantee of democracy is the people's choice.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This choice translates into the presence here in the House of 
Commons, as well as in each of the provincial legislative

who have been duly elected by their fellow citizens.  That is 
the true guarantor of democracy, not the presence of a phoney 
second chamber which does nothing but serve the partisan 
interests of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit once again that this House, which is duly elected by 
the people, must not lend any credibility whatsoever to the 
other chamber by voting supplies to it, which it will spend like 
crazy, while in each and every one of our ridings there are 
people who can scarcely make ends meet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore urge every one of my colleagues to oppose this 
motion aimed at granting supply to the Canadian Senate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, would 
the hon. member accept the conclusions of the Pepin-Robarts 
commission on an elected Senate, dividing the number of its 
members among the five regions of Canada, but with a veto for 
Quebec on matters concerning linguistic rights, culture and 
similar elements? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I nearly fainted when I 
heard my colleague from Vancouver—Quadra candidly suggest the 
conclusions of the Pepin-Robarts report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was thinking that it was a long time ago the government 
opposite shelved this report, not wanting to give it any 
credibility or relevance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must realize that if this institution had really been 
intended to play the role of defender of Canada's regions, it 
would not have been created as it was, and even now we would not 
maintain it in its present form by simply having the senators 
there elected. 
These people would, if I could put it this way, challenge the 
legitimacy of this House in which we sit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, for the benefit of our colleague, I would like to 
mention two examples of upper houses around the world, which 
might originally have provided an example, had they existed, to 
Canada's Senate, in the spirit that its creators wanted to give 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the German Bundesrat, which represents each of the 
assemblies of German Landers, or provinces. Accordingly, no 
legislation is passed by the German parliament, the Bundestag 
and the Bundesrat, without the support of the Landers' 
legislatures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another example. The Russian federation council, which 
is the upper chamber, the equivalent of our Senate, has two 
representatives for what they call there the subjects of the 
federation, the equivalent of our provinces. 
Generally it is the governor of the province and the president 
of the legislative assembly, therefore one representative of the 
executive body and one representative of the legislative body of 
each of the subjects in the federation, who sit on the council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, once again, it is very clear that no legislation 
may be passed by the Russian parliament without the subjects of 
the federation, that is the Russian provinces, giving their 
approval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, as it exists the Senate is totally incapable of 
meeting the initial objective set for it, that is of defending 
the interests of the regions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK345"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the member for Verchères—Les-Patriotes for his excellent 
speech.  As a political scientist, he is obviously very up on 
these issues.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like him to clarify for us what else these supplies, 
which we are refusing to approve, could be spent on.  They will 
very likely be approved because of this government's 
overwhelming majority in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of those listening today, I would like our 
colleague to give some concrete examples of how this $54 million 
budget, which will probably be approved for what I might call 
purely gerontocratic purposes, could be put to better use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could he also give other examples of funds being used to provide 
relatively long term care and perhaps examples of areas where 
the money would be put to much better use? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve for his question.  I think he has hit it on 
the head. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all due respect, I think he would have been in a much 
better position than I to give excellent examples of how these 
supplies, which are about to be approved for the other place and 
the usefulness of which still seems a bit nebulous right now, 
could be better spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, we already have the feeling we are paying for two 
structures.  We are paying for a provincial member 
and for a federal member. We are even paying for a senator 
who represents each of our regions.  Each senator in Quebec 
represents what is called a Senate division. 
I doubt there is anyone in Quebec who has the slightest idea 
which senator is responsible for the Senate division in which he 
lives, since these people are completely absent from the 
political scene in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, as a more direct reply to the question by my 
colleague from Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, certainly reference could 
be made to a number of issues that have been addressed in this 
House in recent months and recent weeks, particularly employment 
insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government diverts billions of dollars from the employment 
insurance fund, supposedly to cover increased expenses, like 
eradicating the deficit, while it would be far easier to get it 
hands on some $50 million or $54 million in the other place, instead of 
dipping into the pockets of the unemployed, the workers and the 
employers across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Needless to say, it is unacceptable that while social transfers 
to the provinces are being cut forcing the provinces to make 
some really hard decisions on social and health services and 
post-secondary education, we would continue to hand over $50 
million annually to this institution that is right next to ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government needs to make some societal choices. At the 
moment, the government seems to lean as much to the right as the 
whole of Canada does as far as the directions it is taking are 
concerned. The choices made by this government are totally 
unacceptable.  They leave the least advantaged in a precarious 
and difficult situation and continue to maintain this sort of 
living dinosaur.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
one understands the lateness of the hour produces that mixture of 
melancholy and euphoria that we have seen at various stages of 
the debate this evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pity perhaps that such an interesting subject has been 
consigned to a late evening session.  There has been an absence 
of concern or attention in this parliament and perhaps the one 
before it with fundamental questions, the large principles of 
government.  Yet in a way I think we are seeing the creaking and 
groaning of parliamentary institutions that are already out of 
date and, in some ways in this country, lag behind the creative 
changes that have been made in other countries with similar 
systems. 
In a sense, it is all a consequence of the too exclusive 
preoccupation for the last 30 years with the Quebec question 
narrowly defined.  The narrow definition is not the fault of all 
the opposite side of the House.  I think the blame lies equally. 
One could suggest that the larger solutions for the Quebec 
problem would better be obtained in a larger solution of general 
constitutional problems, but here we come back again to this 
basic principle that it is very difficult, since the Constitution 
Act, 1982, to change the Canadian constitution, but it is not 
impossible.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day I encountered a very distinguished senator and 
former member of this House who had to retire because he had 
reached the term of years, 75 years.  He was complaining that he 
was forced to retire at that age.  I told him that it was 
possible that it was not constitutional to compel retirement for 
age.  I asked him if he had ever considered invoking the charter 
of rights and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would certainly be possible, without going to the provinces, 
for the federal parliament to establish within the federal 
parliament, with parliamentary power alone, a term of years for 
the Senate.  It would be possible for this House and the Senate to 
make a constitutional amendment limiting future senators to four 
years, or eight years or two renewable terms of four years.  This 
is solely within federal power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be possible to extend the age issue.  The only reason I 
think the age issue arose is simply because people had enough 
sense, 100 years after 1867, to realize a life term was just 
unacceptable in the conditions of North America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The biggest problem in electing a Senate is that it would be a 
Senate elected on a basis of regional representation that 
reflected the social realities of 1867, the demographic realities 
that are totally inequitable today.  There is no way in which 
British Columbians for example, would vote for Charlottetown or 
any other agreement that perpetuated an inequitable division of 
the Senate, even an elected Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to change these things we have to go the long route 
unless we take the surprising step, but not so surprising in 
other countries, of getting a court ruling on the 
constitutionality of these provisions of the constitution viewed 
in contemporary terms.  Why not?  Unless we go the ultimate route 
of a constituent assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are, in a certain sense in our parliament at this time, 
engaged in a form of low level problem solving largely because 
people, in reaction to the failure of the Meech Lake accord and 
the failure of Charlottetown, have said they do not want to 
discuss fundamental change.  There is no particular evidence of 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier in the debate, I remember one of the members citing the 
example of a Gallup poll that he had consulted, or the 
equivalent, and finding that 43% of the people wanted to abolish 
the Senate.  I wonder if he had asked how many people wanted to 
abolish the House of Commons as it is presently constituted. 
He might well have found that there was a similar large 
public disillusionment with the legislative process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we badly need, on the evidence of this parliament, to 
reform our committee structure.  We badly need to re-examine the 
relationship of executive and legislative power.  These are areas 
that could be changed without the necessity of going to the 
provinces and going through that seven out of ten or ten out of 
ten formula.  They have largely been left to one side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think one of the problems we have with the proposals put 
forward today on Senate reform is that they do not recognize the 
interdependence of constitutional institutions.  If we abolish 
the Senate, we will dramatically change the House of Commons as 
it is now, and it is presently staggering under its current 
burden of office.  Something obviously is needed: a little more 
comprehensive thinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1960s, 1970s and 1980s were golden periods in terms of 
producing a consensus on constitutional change.  Let me read the 
sort of consensus that emerged:  That an elected Senate, if it 
were to be achieved, should have the power to ratify all 
international treaties; that it should have the power to confirm 
nominations or reject nominations to the Supreme Court of Canada; 
and that it have the power to confirm ambassadorial appointments 
and appointments as deputy ministers.  Why not? 
It is common in other systems of government.  It might have the 
power, if the governor general were to be a wholly Canadian 
appointment, to conduct the election of the governor general.  An 
elected Senate could perform the function that we give at 
enormous public expense and with a term of years seemingly 
without limit to royal commissions of inquiry.  Should a 
legislative body not be doing that?  It is quite obvious that the 
House of Commons cannot do it.  If we look at the overburdening 
and the number of committees and the mandates of the committees 
today, I do not think we are able to discharge the functions that 
are given to us now.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The cause of Senate reform is I think an interesting one.  It 
offers the most promise in terms of changes in our federal 
institutions, if we can get over this dilemma of constitutional 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noted the comments by the member for Brandon—Souris.  He said 
that he had help with a wheat bill.  I would simply say that I 
faced a situation in which a House committee, for some reason, 
produced a unanimous report last December.  Then, after the 
unanimous report had gone to the House, some members decided to 
change their minds.  Having accepted that a committee obviously 
would be well informed on the subject, I read the project and 
decided it was not as well informed as it could have been. 
Looking for an arena for change, I also went to the Senate and 
spoke to senators.  I was able at the Senate level, because the 
Senate has co-ordinate constitutional powers with the House, to 
produce changes which I think are more in line with contemporary 
legal thinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a role for a second chamber, certainly if the House 
continues to be overburdened in the way it is with the present 
committee structure, which I do not think is very satisfactory 
unless we have this unique combination of an experienced and 
pragmatic committee chairperson and a good parliamentary 
secretary working as a team, and sufficient co-operation or 
acceptance of the rules of the game by government and opposition 
members.  It does occur in some committees, but not in all, and 
we have noticed the difficulty in achieving a quorum in 
committees in the last few weeks.  That is one of the realities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome the suggestions that have been made.  I think the 
suggestions for the abolition of the Senate are simplistic.  They 
ignore the fact that taking the Senate out will dramatically 
change the House too.  I am not sure that we have yet learned to 
assume the new types of burdens that would be placed upon us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tackling the issue of how to make reform, as I say, electing the 
Senate with the present totally inequitable and unacceptable 
basis of regional allocation of the seats, would be a step 
backward in time and I do not think we can go that way.  But why 
not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the suggestions made, which was an interesting suggestion 
from outside, was why do we not attempt a mini-Senate reform. 
One of the most popular steps the present Prime Minister has 
taken has been to appoint senators who, in essence, will serve 
for a short term of years only.  I think they are among the best 
quality senators we have had in a long time.  These people, 
usually with two or three years to go, were never expecting an 
appointment to the Senate, but bring a surprising degree of 
expertise and knowledge and a very large degree of pragmatism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the suggestions made, and I know it is taboo to speak of 
anything the former Prime Minister in the previous government 
introduced, was with respect to the so-called GST senators.  It 
is a section of the constitution that was forgotten, which had 
been raised with me by a thoughtful correspondent.  Could we not 
in some way correct, partly at least, the regional inequities of 
Senate representation by region by using that section and 
appointing more senators for those underrepresented areas of the 
country, in particular if it was done on a term of years basis, 
four years or something else? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I offer these simply because we are not completely in a 
straitjacket. 
To get movement in the upper House in that way might encourage 
the larger type of reform that so many people in all parties 
favour.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at the expert committees, the Lamontagne-MacGuigan committee, 
the Goldenberg commission, the father of the gentleman who is on 
the Prime Minister's staff, Pepin-Robarts that I have referred 
to, much the best constitutional report that has been made in 
Canada in the post-war period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we directed our attention to these matters we would see a 
time when parliamentarians thought in an ambitious way, looked at 
larger ideas, and a great deal of it came across.  Except for 
certain egregious errors in tactics, the Pepin-Robarts report, as 
reflected in Meech Lake, would have gone through.  It is one of 
those interesting things, the overconfidence of the political 
leaders who were directing the situation at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will we get around to these larger questions?  I have raised 
this issue.  I think the next generation of Canadians will have a 
rendezvous with the constitution.  I am sure the imbalances, the 
inefficiencies that have accumulated in this inherited British 
system that we have not kept up to date in the way the British 
and other British derived systems have, will become large enough, 
and in a very short time from now we might get a movement toward 
general constitutional renewal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we go the constituency assembly route and we go the usual way 
in which constituent assemblies are adopted, we get out of the 
straitjacket of the chapter 5 amending sections of the 
constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could say more, but the hon. member opposite has pointed out

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish 
to thank my colleague for his speech.  I know he takes a great 
interest in these matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will share a fond memory with him.  When I was doing my MA 
with Professor Edmond Orban, our required reading was texts that 
he had written as a law professor at the university. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a bit surprised at the vigour with which he is defending 
the Senate at a time when there is, in our ridings—in any event, 
it is very obvious in Quebec, and I am sure that my colleagues 
from Quebec, whatever side of the House they sit on, will agree—a 
push for increased democracy and for putting citizens at the 
heart of that democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite the member to read what one of our excellent focus 
groups had to say about citizenship and democracy, because we 
are engaged in a process of renewing and giving concrete form to 
the sovereignist discourse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have trouble seeing how we could be interested in reforming 
the voting method. 
Why would we want people to have increased authority in the form 
of petitions, with the possibility of setting in motion 
mechanisms leading to public consultations?  We are very 
involved in reviewing the role of members, yet the member for 
Vancouver Quadra is saying that there is an advantage to keeping 
the Senate and that we must rediscover this chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate has no democratic foundation.  This is well known. 
This does not mean that there are not individual senators who 
can earn our respect through their diligent efforts.  I could 
mention senators Prud'homme and Beaudoin.  There are, of course, 
some excellent people but it is the institution that is the 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member the following question: Is it not fortunate 
that there is a widespread push in civil society for increased 
democracy, and is this democratic fervour among members of the 
public not incompatible with maintaining an institution as 
outmoded as the Senate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B> Mr. Speaker, very briefly, I wish to remind 
the hon. member that the best idea to come out of the quiet 
revolution advocated by the great Jacques-Yvan Morin and a few 
other scholars was the recommendation for a reformed Senate on 
condition that it be divided 50:50 between francophone and 
anglophone regions, but the idea of a second chamber had the 
approval of intellectuals during the quiet revolution.

would like to lead into my question with a quote, which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I...support Senate reform.  If it is done properly, a 
restructured and revitalised Upper Chamber can give Albertans a 
voice in the governance of Canada.  If elected Liberal leader, I 
pledge to work for a Senate that is elected, that has legislative 
powers of its own, and contains strong representation from all 
regions of Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was said on June 23, 1990 at the Liberal leadership 
convention.  It gets better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same individual said on September 24, 1991, as reported in 
<I>Hansard</I>:  “A reformed Senate is essential.  It must be a 
Senate that is elected, effective and equitable”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same individual, speaking to 400 delegates at the annual 
general meeting of the Alberta branch of the federal Liberal 
Party in 1990, said: “The Liberal Government in two years will 
make it (the Senate) elected.  As Prime Minister I can take steps 
to make it happen”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same individual went on to say to the Toronto <I>Star</I> on 
February 2, 1990:  “You want the triple E Senate and I want one 
too”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same individual, who I will reveal to the House, went on to 
say once again, as reported in <I>Hansard</I> on May 14, 1991: 
“As I said before, and repeat, reform of the Senate is extremely 
important.  I believe in it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same individual said on February 1, 1997 to the Calgary 
<I>Herald</I>:  “If he names him”, referring to Senator Stan 
Waters, “that's the end of appointed senators who are not 
elected”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same individual, speaking to <I>Prime Time News</I> on the 
CBC on December 29, 1992, said:  “I know that in western Canada 
they were disappointed that there was not, there's the Senate, 
because they wanted to have an equal Senate and an elected Senate 
and I thought it was a good thing to do”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only one man could make that type of speech.  Only man could 
make that quote.  It is the same individual who also said “I'm 
not interested in patronage because I'm a Liberal” to 600 people 
in Edmonton, which was reported in the Windsor <I>Star</I> on 
February 2, 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I leave members with one last quote:  “I didn't want to be 
trapped into making decisions on patronage, local contracts, and 
appointments that cause so much friction and bad blood”.  That 
is found at page 196 of a book which he wrote in 1985 called 
<I>Straight from the Heart</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put it to my hon. colleague:  Who could that person be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think it has been 
already established that it was Dr. Randolph White, Jr. who is 
the author of these well known remarks.  It may present him with 
some problems of explanation to his colleagues.  I think honour 
is due where it falls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is known for his ways of eloquence in support of a chamber 
which Plato said should be reserved for those who made their mark 
in life, who gained the top of their professions and who are 
prepared to serve without salary.  That is the Platonic 
conception and Dr. Randolph White has made this a leitmotiv to his 
own career, which has brought us all waves of brilliant oratory 
and an example that stands out to this country in a period of 
cynicism and despair, leading the charge to the new world and the 
new world order.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will 
be splitting my time with the member for Langley—Abbotsford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The person I was talking about and those copious quotes I just 
read in favour of Senate reform were from none other than the one 
who sits across the way from us, the Right Hon. the Prime 
Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are substantive, clear, demonstrable reasons that once the 
Prime Minister won the Liberal leadership in 1990 and was elected 
in 1993 he changed his mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One reason was Lorna Milne, a former Liberal riding president 
and a Liberal Party worker who was appointed on September 9, 1995 
and is now sitting as a senator.  I think another reason was 
Joseph Landry, a former Liberal member of the legislative 
assembly who was appointed on February 26, 1996.  I also think 
another reason was Joan Cook, a provincial Liberal candidate and 
loyal Liberal worker who was appointed on March 6, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reason was Sharon Carstairs, a former Manitoba Liberal 
leader and long time ally of the Prime Minister who was appointed 
on September 5, 1994.  Another reason was Ross Fitzpatrick, a 
prominent B.C. Liberal organizer, golfing and business buddy who 
was appointed on March 6, 1998.  We seem to notice a trend in 
recent days with golfing buddies of the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reason was Nick Taylor, the former Alberta Liberal 
leader who was appointed on March 7, 1996.  Another reason was 
Landon Pearson who is married to the son of former Liberal Prime 
Minister Lester B. Pearson and was appointed on September 15, 
1994.  The list goes on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reason was William Rompkey, who refused to appear before 
members of the House of Commons that wanted to look at the Senate 
estimates.  He was a former Liberal member of parliament and a 
Liberal cabinet minister in the Trudeau government appointed who 
was in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reason was Catherine Callbeck, former Liberal premier of 
Prince Edward Island who was appointed in 1997.  Another reason 
was John Bryden, a candidate for Liberal leader in New Brunswick 
and someone who managed the Prime Minister's leadership campaign 
in New Brunswick in 1990 and was appointed in 1994.  Another 
reason was Serge Joyal who had a prominent backroom role in the 
federal Liberal Party since he lost his Commons seat in 1984 and 
was appointed in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993 there are 34 reasons the Prime Minister has gone 
ahead with what he has done with the Senate and not carried 
forward on his 1990 promises when he was elected Liberal leader 
and when he was elected Prime Minister in 1993.  There are 
currently four vacancies.  If the government holds term until the 
year 2001, this mandate would allow it another 14 reasons, for a 
total of 52 reasons the Prime Minister has gone back on his word 
with regard to Senate elections.  Senators are obsessed but the 
truth shall be known. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to put those reasons on the record because they are 
very important.  I ask all hon. members to keep in mind that no 
one in the country can get away with only working one day in the 
spring and one day in the fall and getting a 16% budget increase 
in two years, for a total of $50 million plus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask members in good conscience to apply their own good 
judgment when voting on the Senate estimates.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have several questions to ask my colleague which may 
take a few minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we are talking about the Senate, I often sit back and 
wonder what life might be like in Canada had the Senate been 
elected, equal and effective.  Let us take, for instance, some of 
the laws and changes that went through the House of Commons and 
were rubber stamped by a group of partisan individuals in the 
other place who basically take the legislation from the House and 
rubber stamp it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can think of some things that happened recently in the House 
of Commons.  For instance, the age of consent for young people to 
have sex was 16 years old at one time.  The government in its 
wisdom changed that to age 14. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had there been a non-rubber stamp Senate, I do not think that 
would have happened.  The place called the place of sober second 
thought would probably have gone around the country and tested 
the grassroots feelings in this regard.  It probably would have 
come back and said that the average Canadian did not want the age 
of consensual sex to go from age 16 to 14.  Had the Senate been 
effective and had the authority to turn that back, this would be 
a different country today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at some other things that happened.  Three years ago 
the government changed the fact that the <I>Lord's Prayer</I> was 
read in the House of Commons.  Would that have occurred if the 
Senate had been effective and elected, with no particular ties to 
the government?  After talking to some senators, I think the 
answer is no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the government said it shall occur.  It was in 
majority and its good old boys in the other place would rubber 
stamp it because they are in majority as well.  That is the 
problem with an unelected Senate which is not effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People across the country are wondering why it is, with all the 
good people in opposition, that laws get passed anyway, even 
though they are unpopular and even though there is a Liberal 
government elected with 38% of the vote.  The fact is that 
legislation does not have to be checked through grassroots 
individuals.  It just has to come in from cabinet and passed by 
telling people to put up their hands.  Then it goes over to the 
Senate and the good old boys are told to stamp it because that is 
what they are there for.  That is totally improper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my colleague believe that Canada would be a different place 
if the Prime Minister were not appointing his friends to the 
Senate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if the Prime Minister of the 
land had abided by his promises when he was running for Liberal 
leader in 1990 and if he had abided by the mandate that was given 
him when he won the election in 1993, the Senate would be a 34% 
different place than it is today.  It would be well on the way to 
being an elected and effective place, which he said he wanted to 
see in the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
now that I have the full attention of the real guy who is 
standing here, I would like to make some comments pointed to the 
Prime Minister.   He often says in question period, after we go 
at him with this Senate issue, that the Reform Party is 
responsible for having an unelected Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Prime Minister does not say to most Canadians is that 
at that time there was one Reform member in the House of Commons. 
It was a number of provinces and millions of Canadians who did 
not go for the Charlottetown accord.  For the Prime Minister to 
give us— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Who was that one member? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  That one member is here too.  Here she 
is, the member for Beaver River.  Now that we have the Prime 
Minister and the member for Beaver River, let us have a contest 
to see who is right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that many Canadians voted against it.  I want to 
talk about one issue I am particularly concerned about, and that 
is drugs.  The problem in the country, as I said before, is that 
the government has the majority.  Even though it was elected by 
38% of the people in the country, it has the audacity to bring in 
its own agenda and not the agenda of the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I keep referring in the House to the drugs on the street and the 
drug addiction on the street.  The problems with drugs in the 
country are very serious.  We keep raising in the House of 
Commons that addiction in prisons, of all places, is at a 
critical stage.  We keep coming back to it and the government 
keeps saying that it will study it.  We are long past that 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I go to various cities to talk to various people about this 
problem.  In Vancouver there are some 4,000 to 5,000 addicts.  In 
British Columbia there are 15,000 addicts.  They do not 
understand some things.  They do not understand why we spend 
money on foolish projects and in many cases not one red dime 
comes from the federal government to areas that need it such as 
to help people who are addicted to drugs and alcohol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see a mess in front of me in the waste report produced by the 
public accounts chairman.  This is not a prop.  This is reality. 
It talks about $1,057,933 for the Canadian Canoe Museum.  That is 
just one item, but if we talk to people on the streets who need 
money to help those who are addicted, they ask what is more 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where are the priorities of the government?  Members across the 
way do not know what they are talking about.  How is it that the 
Canada Council used $55,000 of taxpayers money to bankroll a 
lesbian porno film titled, <I>Bubbles Galore</I>?   The movie won 
the best film award at the Freakzone International Festival of 
Trash Cinema in France. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it that we spend $55,000 of the taxpayers dollars on that 
trash and do not have one red dime to help those who are addicted 
on the streets?  Why is that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I must interrupt the 
hon. member at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I put the question, I would like to advise the House that 
the point of order raised by the hon. member for St. Albert will 
be answered by the Speaker after members have been summoned to 
the Chamber.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>APPROPRIATION BILL—SPEAKER'S RULING 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK354"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> Order, please. I am now prepared to give my 
ruling on the point of order raised earlier this evening. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for St. Albert earlier tonight raised a most 
interesting point of order challenging the notion of multi-year 
appropriations and I thank him for doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must confess that ever since the supply bill was made 
available to members earlier today, I have had several 
discussions with the Clerk and his assistants on the very matter 
raised by the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House is quite aware of the concept of the fiscal year which 
runs from April to March, and the concept of the yearly 
appropriation bill which must be based on the estimates for a 
fiscal year and which must be adopted by parliament to cover the 
government's expenses for that fiscal year. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very familiar with these notions of fiscal year and 
annual appropriations, which are the cornerstones of our 
parliamentary financial process. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After having looked carefully at the supply bill which is now 
before the House, I am satisfied that indeed it is based on the 
main estimates for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2000.  Indeed 
that fact is well expressed by the short title of the bill which 
reads in clause 1 “Appropriation Act No. 2, 1999-2000”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The multi-year appropriation authority covered in schedule 2 of 
the bill is based on legislation approved by parliament in 1998 
by which Parks Canada Agency is granted the authority to carry 
over to the end of 2000-01 fiscal year the unexpended balance of 
money in fiscal year 1999-2000.  But in my view, that money is 
originally appropriated for the 1999-2000 fiscal year.  Despite 
what the long title says, we are still talking here about a 
yearly appropriation bill for the fiscal year 1999-2000.  What is 
included in schedule 2 and referred to in clause 2 is there 
strictly for information purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My ruling is therefore that the supply bill is properly before 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I must express strong reservations about the reference 
in the long title of the bill to two financial years. The 
reference is not at all needed and is in fact, in my view, 
misleading.  It is obviously too late in the supply process to 
envisage an amendment to rectify that anomaly, unless of course 
the House were to proceed immediately to do so by unanimous 
consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, I do hope that in future supply bills the 
government will ensure that the title reflects that the 
appropriation requested from parliament, in keeping with our 
longstanding practice, is for the single fiscal year covered by 
the estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the hon. member for St. Albert for his 
vigilance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. 
Based on the ruling which you have just given, I would seek 
unanimous consent to change the title of Bill C-86 to “an act 
for granting to Her Majesty certain sums of money for the public 
service of Canada for the financial year ending March 31, 2000”.
