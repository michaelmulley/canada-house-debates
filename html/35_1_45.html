	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues, the Chair is now ready to 
take up the matter of gender neutral language raised on 
Thursday, March 17 of this year by the hon. member for Ottawa 
West, the Parliamentary Secretary to the President of the 
Treasury Board.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I wish to thank her for her comments and I would also like to 
thank the hon. members for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell and 
for Surrey-White Rock-South Langley for their 
presentations.
<P>
	There is no doubt a strong movement in society to eliminate 
the occurrence of sexual stereotypes in all forms of 
communication.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Concerning the word ``chairman'' specifically, the current 
trend seems to be to remove any gender connotation, although 
there is no clear consensus on the most satisfactory alternative. 
For example, since the beginning of this Parliament the practice 
has emerged whereby the chairs and vice-chairs of committees 
have been identified using the terms ``chair, chairperson or 
chairman'' as desired, in the publications in the House. My 
colleague, the hon. member for Saint-Laurent-Cartierville, 
refers to herself as Deputy Chairperson of Committees of the 
Whole.
<P>
	In our standing orders we have eliminated any reference to 
Mr. Speaker. At the end of each issue of our <I>Votes and 
Proceedings</I> the Speaker is referred to simply as Speaker. As 
well, any reference to a member or a minister is gender 
inclusive; that is, the references are to ``he or she'' and ``him or 
her''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	However, as the hon. Member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell rightly noted, the Standing 
Orders still contain a number of words and phrases which could 
be considered gender-biased. This is also the case in a number 
of other parliaments and provincial legislatures. In some of 
these legislatures, just as in the  House of Commons, the 
terminology used in their Standing Orders is not necessarily the 
same as that found in their publications.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This is an issue which has been raised many times over the 
years both in the House and in committee and the Chair 
continues to be deeply concerned about it. Given the 
inconsistencies in the use of language in the publications and in 
the House and its committees, perhaps it is time for a committee 
of the House to examine the matter with a view to 
recommending standardization of terminology.
<P>
	I agree with the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell that this is a matter which should 
be pursued or might be pursued by the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs. I would urge that committee to 
address it during its current review of the standing orders.

	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (for the Minister of Finance)</B> 
moved that Bill C-17, an act to amend certain statutes to 
implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament 
on February 22, 1994 be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
rising on a point of order to make a procedural argument 
concerning the omnibus nature of this piece of legislation.
<P>
	This is a new Parliament which I think has been working 
reasonably well in spite of our recent difficulties. I really would 
like to call the attention of the Chair to the nature of this 
particular bill and to urge the Chair to re-examine a practice we 
have fallen into.
<P>
	The particular bill before us, Bill C-17, is of an omnibus 
nature. I put it to you, Mr. Speaker, that you should rule it out of 
order and it should not be considered by the House in the form in 
which it has been presented. I would hope that in making your 
decision on the acceptability of Bill C-17 in its present form you 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2776"> 2776 </A></B>
<P>
will refer to the famous ruling by Mr. Lamoureux of January 26, 
1971 in which he said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>However, where do we stop? Where is the point of no return? The hon. member 
for Winnipeg North Centre, and I believe the hon. member for Edmonton West, 
said that we might reach a point where we would have only one bill, a bill at the 
start of the session for the improvement of the quality of the life in Canada which 
would include every single proposed piece of legislation for the session. That 
would be an omnibus bill with a capital <I>O</I> and a capital <I>B</I>. But would it be 
acceptable legislation? There must be a point where we can go beyond what is 
acceptable from a strictly parliamentary standpoint.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Even though the Speaker in that case went on to rule that this 
point had not been reached, I submit to you that it has become a 
standard practice with governments to bring in omnibus 
legislation following every budget under what we might call the 
kitchen sink approach.
<P>
	Beauchesne's sixth edition, citation 626 bears directly on this 
aspect of the matter. It states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(1) Although there is no specific set of rules or guidelines governing the 
content of a bill, there should be a theme of relevancy amongst the contents of a 
bill. They must be relevant to and subject to the umbrella which is raised by the 
terminology of the long title of the bill.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mr. Speaker, I would argue that the subject matter of the bill is 
so diverse that a single vote on the content would put members 
in conflict with their own principles.
<P>
	In this present case, the drafters of Bill C-17 have 
incorporated in the same bill the following measures: public 
sector compensation freezes; a freeze in Canada assistance plan 
payments and Public Utilities Income Tax Transfer Act 
transfers; extension and deepening of transportation subsidies; 
authorization for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to 
borrow money; and changes to unemployment insurance with 
respect to benefits and the payroll taxes.
<P>
	First, there is a lack of relevancy of these issues. The omnibus 
bills we have before us attempt to amend several different 
existing laws.
<P>
	Second, in the interest of democracy I ask: How can members 
represent their constituents on these various areas when they are 
forced to vote in a block on such legislation and on such 
concerns?
<P>
	We can agree with some of the measures but oppose others. 
How do we express our views and the views of our constituents 
when the matters are so diverse? Dividing the bill into several 
components would allow members to represent views of their 
constituents on each of the different components in the bill.
<P>
	The bill contains many distinct proposals and principles and 
asking members to provide simple answers to such complex 
questions is in contradiction to the conventions and practices of 
the House.
<P>
<B>(1010 ) </B>
<P>
	As well this will cause fairly serious difficulties in 
committee. This bill will ultimately go to only one committee of 
the House, a committee that will inevitably lack the breadth of 
expertise required for consideration of a bill of this scope. 
Furthermore, the workload of that committee will be onerous 
and it will be very difficult to give due consideration to all 
relevant opinion.
<P>
	In concluding my point of order, I would like to quote the hon. 
member for Windsor West, the government House leader who 
said on May 30, 1988: ``For all the reasons I have given, I 
respectfully submit that this bill is of improper omnibus nature. 
This is consistent with what I consider and I respectfully submit 
to be, the relevant precedents. This is consistent with the 
traditions of the House and, more important, the purpose of 
those traditions in terms of the relevance of this House to the life 
of the country now and in the future''.
<P>
	This is a new Parliament. I do ask that we take a new approach 
to this in spite of previous rulings on this matter. I would ask that 
you give consideration to this, Mr. Speaker. I would also ask the 
government members, particularly those who have spoken on 
precisely this question in the previous Parliament with precisely 
the same concerns, to give serious consideration to this issue of 
democracy and the functionality of this Parliament now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am surprised that the hon. member has raised this point today in 
the House. The bill has been before the House for a period of 
time. I am surprised that if he had objections to the format of the 
bill he would not have raised them in a procedural way before.
<P>
	However having done so, it is only fair for the hon. member to 
bear in mind this is not a particularly onerous bill in terms of the 
material contained in it. It is actually quite short. It is only 21 
pages and by any standard in this House it is not a thick bill. 
There are ones with many more pages which have been 
introduced in this session already.
<P>
	I also note that all the provisions in this bill are ones that arose 
out of the budget presented by the Minister of Finance a month 
ago. As such they were debated in the House for four days in the 
course of the budget debate. All the issues were discussed 
during those four days and those same issues will be discussed 
again on second reading of this bill.
<P>
	The issues are exactly the same as those raised by the minister 
in his budget address and which have been debated by the House 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2777"> 2777 </A></B>
<P>
already. I do not think there is anything unusual about lumping 
these together for the purposes of debate. The hon. member 
suggests they are  totally disjointed and I suggest they are not. 
They are part of the overall economic plan of the government as 
announced in the budget.
<P>
	There are many different acts involved in terms of 
amendments because of the freezes imposed on various parts of 
the public service, including members of Parliament, judges and 
so on. All those amendments to the various acts that are involved 
in those freezes are part of an overall freeze on payments made 
by the government.
<P>
	Similarly the changes to the Unemployment Insurance Act 
fall into the same arrangement. The changes with respect to the 
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation deal with freezes that were 
put in place in previous legislation and previous budgets and 
allow for some borrowing authority.
<P>
	While the subject matter may be diverse, I suggest to the hon. 
member that given the fact they were all introduced in the 
budget, they form a whole, unified policy thrust which the 
government has put forward and which it will be defending in 
the course of the debate on this bill. Therefore in my 
submission, the bill is entirely in order.
<P>
	In support of my position I refer to Beauchesne's, sixth 
edition, citation 634. I recognize the hon. member for Calgary 
West quoted a citation from Beauchesne's and quoted from a 
ruling of the Speaker in 1971 which is quoted in citation 634 of 
Beauchesne's. Notwithstanding his very able argument, I think 
he has missed the point. Citation 634 reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Speakers have expressed deep concern about the use of omnibus bills, and 
have suggested that there must be ``a point where we go beyond what is 
acceptable from a strictly parliamentary standpoint''. Nevertheless, the practice 
of using one bill to demand one decision on a number of quite different, 
although related subjects, while a matter of concern, is an issue on which the 
Speaker will not intervene to divide the bill.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1015 ) </B>
<P>
	I do not know what the hon. member is asking, if he is asking 
Your Honour to divide this bill or not. The authority in 
Beauchesne seems to be that the Speaker will not intervene to do 
that. I suspect he is really raising this matter this morning as a 
bit of a red herring.
<P>
	I point out citation 635 of Beauchesne sixth edition. It says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In the case of an omnibus bill, the Speaker has encouraged the use of motions 
to delete a clause at the report stage, pursuant to Standing Order 76(2) to permit 
the House to decide a specific issue contained in an ominbus bill, even though 
the motion might offend the principle of the bill.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	If the hon. member genuinely believes that this is an omnibus 
bill that involves too many subjects for him to deal with in the 
committee or for the committee to deal with in a reasonable way, 
he has a remedy. He may propose amendments at the report stage 
to delete sections of the bill that would constitute obviously a 
one policy thrust if indeed he regards this as a series of  different 
policy thrusts and have the House make a decision on that at 
report stage.
<P>
	I suggest that is a fair and reasonable remedy, certainly in this 
situation. I do not think this falls in the category of a bill that 
deals with a host of subjects that are massive in their import. 
This is a relatively modest bill by any standard. As I have 
indicated it follows from a major policy thrust, namely this 
year's annual budget from the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to add very briefly a few points to what has been 
raised by my colleague the parliamentary secretary.
<P>
	The member across the way invoked the fact, and I believe I 
am quoting him accurately, when he said: ``We may be in favour 
of some articles and against others''. That is precisely why 
committees of Parliament exist. Clauses can be deleted from the 
bill at committee.
<P>
	There is a second remedy as well as was quoted by my 
colleague the parliamentary secretary for those members who 
do not sit on a particular committee. Of course that is the report 
stage of the bill where motions can be introduced to delete 
sections of the bill.
<P>
	Finally, the member opposite indicated something to the 
effect that the bill was disjointed or did not fit the criteria of 
omnibus bills. He indicated that the subjects were diverse.
<P>
	If that argument stands then surely it should have been made 
on the budget itself. After all this is a bill to implement the 
budget. If the bill has that disjointed characteristic that was 
ascribed to it by the member opposite, surely the argument 
would have also stood for the ways and means motion that was 
debated in the House and the budget itself.
<P>
	If that was not true or if it was not invoked at those stages, and 
it has not been invoked since the bill in question was introduced 
on March 16, may I suggest that the argument has no more value 
today.
<P>
	Perhaps I could add one last point. The Speaker ruled in the 
last Parliament that a bill which was far more comprehensive 
than this one, this bill only having some 20 pages, was not 
deemed to be offensive and against rule 634 of Beauchesne. That 
bill was at least 10 times the size of the one that we have now. If 
a bill 10 times the size was not deemed to be so omnibus that it 
offended this House, surely a bill one tenth the size of the 
previous one would not be any more offensive.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2778"> 2778 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, if I could just 
comment. Of course I am disappointed that the government 
cannot see the merit of its own previous arguments on matters 
such as these.
<P>
	I would ask you to consider one point that has been raised by 
both of my colleagues on the government side. That is to 
acquaint the scope of the bill with the size and the length of it 
and the number of pages. I think that is an entirely inappropriate 
consideration. We all know that the scope of the bill is not 
necessarily related to the volume of paper it contains. A bill 
could be of the absolute maximum scope conceivable and be 
extremely short. Likewise we had a very thick bill in this 
Parliament on the income tax amendments which was actually 
quite narrow in scope. It is the scope of the bill rather than the 
size that is important.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	I put it once again that this bill touches on a wide range of 
areas of public policy, what would normally fall in the purview 
of several House committees to look at.
<P>
	I would also point out to you, Mr. Speaker, that if you examine 
carefully the arguments of the government members on the tests 
of the relatedness of these subject matters that the only relation 
the government has really pointed to is the fact that they are, 
broadly speaking, all part of the government's legislative 
agenda. I submit to you that that is not an adequate test of their 
relationship and their relevance to each other.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Chair would like to thank all three 
members for their thoughtful interventions on this matter. In 
fact, the severance issue as it is called has been argued in courts 
many times. The lawyers in the House will know that. We have 
all argued it often in court, usually in matters of criminal 
charges. It is an issue which is most important.
<P>
	The references that were made by the various members with 
which this chair occupant is familiar and the matters will all be 
considered carefully. Unfortunately it is going to take more than 
an instant to give a proper ruling on the matter.
<P>
	We have had many omnibus bills in the past in this House. The 
bill will therefore have to proceed and if close examination is 
made a ruling will be made on it further down the trail, so to 
speak.
<P>
	For the time being the bill will proceed and I would call on the 
hon. President of the Treasury Board.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
one of the many groups of Canadians that are affected by Bill 
C-17 is the Public Service of Canada. When we came to power 
we found the public service under considerable stress. We have 
already started the rebuilding process and by the end of our 
mandate we expect the public service will have recovered its full 
ability to serve Canadians.
<P>
	The wage and increment freeze which was announced in the 
budget is a difficult but necessary measure. The freeze which 
ensures that $1 billion can be booked in the fiscal framework to 
be reached in the year 1996-97 is something I recognize that 
public service employees will not welcome with open arms. But, 
frankly, we are freezing salaries to save jobs.
<P>
	This government also announced in the budget an efficiency 
in program review aimed at reducing the cost of government. 
How that is connected is that if we find enough savings to meet 
the reduced departmental expenditure targets, we can apply the 
additional efficiency savings to reducing the length of the wage 
freeze.
<P>
	Though the cool reception of many union leaders to the freeze 
of wages and increments announced in the budget is certainly 
understandable, I want to place our actions in perspective and 
show that we have been as fair as we could be to the public 
service in the present circumstances. I am confident that public 
service employees will accept this budget, especially when they 
understand the sacrifices that we are asking all Canadians, other 
groups of Canadians, to accept as well.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Most Canadians do not suspect how much they owe their 
quality of life to the employees of the Public Service of Canada. 
Let me give you three examples of the contribution of public 
servants to Canadians' welfare.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	For more than 150 years members of the Geological Survey of 
Canada, using them as an example, have mapped the mineral 
resources of this country. This year and in future years 
commercial exploration will take place and new mines will open 
because of the work that is being done now by these public 
service employees.
<P>
<B>(1025 ) </B>
<P>
	Canada, as we well know and appreciate and as I have said 
many times, has just about the most respected police force in the 
world. Indeed, it is a national symbol. Everywhere Canadians 
are safer because of the work of policemen and policewomen of 
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
<P>
	Every Canadian who flies in this country as we all do benefits 
from a network of services that the Government of Canada has 
developed and maintains. The maps used to fly the planes, the 
air traffic controllers that guide them through the air, the 
weather warning systems, all come from the public service.
<P>
	The organizations and people working for government are too 
diverse for any less to do justice to them. In addition to the 
people I have just mentioned, the examples I have given, are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2779"> 2779 </A></B>
<P>
peacekeepers, scientists, postmen and postwomen, grain 
inspectors, trade negotiators and on and on.
<P>
	The purpose of this list is not just to catalogue the jobs that 
government employees do but, more important, it illustrates the 
real and substantial value of these jobs. The people of Canada 
are getting a good deal from the people who serve them.
<P>
	Public service employees have long accepted the notion that 
although they would never get rich working in the public 
service, they would at least feel more secure in terms of job 
security than perhaps in some other sectors.
<P>
	The main source of employment security for our employees is 
this government's policy to preserve jobs for Canadians. The 
main instrument of this policy in the public service is the 
workforce adjustment directive. In essence this directive says 
that no employee will be laid off because of reductions in the 
workforce unless he or she has received another reasonable job 
offer, provided the employee is mobile and willing to be 
retrained where necessary.
<P>
	The previous government made it clear that its intention was 
to legislate unilaterally an end to the employment security 
features of workforce adjustment. It was saying to affected 
employees that it was only a matter of time before they would be 
out the door. Remember that phrase pink slips and running 
shoes?
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I am sure that you can realize the effect that this 
would have on the morale of the public service and its capacity 
to deliver quality service to Canadians. That is why the 
government will make no changes to the employment security 
features affecting workforce adjustment without agreement of 
the public service unions. In other words, it is subject to 
negotiations. They may want changes, we may want changes. 
We are not going to act unilaterally as the previous government 
had suggested it would do.
<P>
	This government has no dogma about downsizing the public 
service. Our priority is and will continue to be to provide quality 
service to Canadians in the most efficient way possible. Of 
course some departments will shrink, others may even grow.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Our objective will therefore be to help employees affected by 
the cuts in some departments to obtain another position in the 
public service or elsewhere. Specific measures are provided for 
this purpose.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	First, we shall continue to limit external recruitment and 
improve the management of the priority staffing process for 
employees whose positions are being eliminated.
<P>
	Second, we shall ensure that departments have access to the 
incremental funds that they need to train for new jobs those 
employees who are affected by the workforce adjustment. When 
departments have additional training requirements because of 
this program the Treasury Board will provide central funding to 
complement departmental budgets for that purpose.
<P>
	I would like to turn to the measures in this bill and explain 
their origins. The measures are a realistic combination of two 
elements. First, the budget recognizes that it is necessary for the 
attack on the deficit to book savings from the operating funds of 
departments through a wage freeze.
<P>
	Second, it creates an opportunity for public service managers 
and employees to find more efficiency savings in an effort to 
shorten the duration of the wage freeze. Bill C-17 extends for a 
further two years the wage freeze for the Governor General, the 
lieutenant governors, federally appointed judges, members of 
Parliament and senators, members of the armed forces, RCMP 
as well as the employees of the public service. Why are we 
freezing salaries and suspending pay increments? Why are we 
taking these measures when the existing freeze still has another 
year to run? Public service employees deserve and need the 
answers to these questions.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	The Minister of Finance gave the most evident and 
compelling reason for the freeze in his budget address. Simply 
put, there is no money for increases. The total salary costs of the 
government amount to $18.5 billion, thus making salaries a very 
important part of federal expenditures.
<P>
	Though the government would rather proceed by negotiation 
than by legislation, I am convinced there really was not a 
reasonable alternative. In my consultations with our 
unions-and I did have prebudget consultations; other people 
engaged in them as well-they made it absolutely clear they had 
no interest in negotiating concessions. I understand that point of 
view.
<P>
	If we had waited until the 1995 budget, a year from now, 
several bargaining units would have already been eligible to 
start negotiations and could have been off seeking third party 
arbitration by that point in time. Rather than let those processes 
begin under false premises we decided, albeit most reluctantly, 
to act this year in the budget and in this bill.
<P>
	Bill C-17 also suspends normal pay increments. These 
increments, which are the pay increases automatically awarded 
to employees as they gain experience in new jobs, are common 
in both the public and private sector. We have chosen to suspend 
them because they were allowing a substantial number of public 
service employees to continue to get pay increases while their 
colleagues' salaries were frozen. The freeze on increments will 
put everybody in the same boat for the  next two years. At the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2780"> 2780 </A></B>
<P>
same time this two-year measure on increments will reduce 
costs by some $400 million.
<P>
	I might add that even in the years where there were zero 
increases in the existing legislation for wages the actual wage 
bill was going up at about 3 per cent because of the increments.
<P>
	Though Bill C-17 does not allow the government to shorten or 
lift the freeze-it is not in the wording that we see before 
us-the government has made a very clear commitment to do so 
if efficiency savings in operating costs by December 31 of this 
year warrant it. Therefore we will make the decision on the 
freeze and our opportunity to lift the freeze, if it can be done, in 
the run-up to the 1995 budget.
<P>
	The government is initiating a review of its operations, I think 
it is important to point out, to generate efficiency savings, 
reduce overlap and duplication, and eliminate low priority 
programs. The review for which my ministry will be responsible 
is intended to produce results by the end of December for use in 
the planning of the 1995 budget.
<P>
	The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and Minister 
responsible for Public Service Renewal will lead with one 
component of the review that will focus on government 
programs, the roles and responsibilities. It will determine what 
services the government should provide and what services the 
taxpayer can in fact afford. It will also seek to eliminate overlap 
and duplication both within the federal government and among 
other levels of government and to reduce or eliminate programs 
that are no longer a priority. The efficiency component of the 
review will concentrate on increasing the efficiency of 
government operations. The emphasis will be on how to deliver 
existing services more cheaply.
<P>
	We have invited public service unions to contribute to the 
review with a focus on efficiency at two levels: national unions 
working on issues with the Treasury Board secretariat on 
governmentwide savings, and local components of the unions 
working with departmental management on efficiency savings 
in each department in each locale in the country.
<P>
	My parliamentary secretary, the hon. member for Ottawa 
West, is meeting with union representatives this week to explore 
the most productive ways for them to participate in the review. 
We hope the review will generate savings over and above the 
restraint measures that this and previous budgets have put in 
place.
<P>
	The added savings from changing government programs will 
be available for such purposes as reducing the deficit, 
reallocating funds to other major programs or shortening the 
length of the wage freeze. The government's decision on what to 
do with these savings will be part of the 1995 budget.
<P>
	The government believes that unions, managers and 
employees share a common desire to serve Canada well. We 
therefore want to put before the public service unions and the 
employees a broad range of issues for them to consider at 
various times and in various forums. The unions have proposed 
several of these issues for joint resolution. Management will 
suggest others.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	Here are some examples. For years the issue of contracted 
services has been a bone of contention among public service 
unions, managers and government. The unions see it as an attack 
on their members, while others consider it a cost effective way 
of doing business. We want to look at all aspects of the issue and 
make the best decisions for the people receiving our services 
and for taxpayers.
<P>
	I have made a commitment to provide the Standing 
Committee on Government Operations with detailed 
information on contracting for services in the federal 
government. I have suggested to the committee that it undertake 
a broad review of the subject, here again opening to members of 
Parliament the opportunity to be involved in the decision 
making process.
<P>
	In announcing the decision I wish to thank my parliamentary 
secretary, the hon. member for Ottawa West. Through the years 
of the previous government she and other members from the 
national capital region kept Parliament's interest in the public 
service alive. I know they are ready to make a strong 
contribution to the committee, as will members from across the 
country. After all, the public service is not just an Ottawa 
institution. I should point out that two-thirds of its members are 
located outside the national capital region in all parts of Canada.
<P>
	The parliamentary committee may wish from time to time to 
examine other public service issues. The government remains 
committed to its employees and to their employment security. 
We intend to stabilize public service employment levels as much 
as we can. Nevertheless we must have the flexibility to make 
program adjustments as the needs of Canadians evolve.
<P>
	Accordingly we will seek to make some modifications to the 
existing workforce adjustment directive, but we shall do so with 
the public service bargaining agents through the negotiation 
process that is now in place. They want changes as well.
<P>
	Let me deal with pension management for a moment. There 
are compelling reasons for fundamental reform of major federal 
public service pension plans. The Public Service 
Superannuation Act, for example, is more than 40 years old and 
subject to criticism from several quarters. Plan members seek 
greater security of benefits. Taxpayers see the unlimited 
indexing of benefits as overly generous. The Auditor General 
has advocated changes to the plan's funding arrangements. 
Public service unions seek a greater voice in designing and 
managing the plan.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2781"> 2781 </A></B>
<P>
	The government is determined to respond to these concerns 
with reforms that make the plan simpler, more affordable and 
easier to manage. We will develop the reforms in partnership 
with my advisory committee which comprises representatives 
of the plan's major stakeholders including the public service 
unions. We will renew the mandate of the advisory committee 
to develop a strategy for the complete overhaul of the program 
and to produce a framework for a replacement.
<P>
	The Government of Canada and its employee unions have 
been unable to come to a full resolution on the issue of equal pay 
for work of equal value. Indeed the issue is now before a human 
rights tribunal where it could sit unresolved for another two 
years if no means are found to settle the matter through 
negotiation.
<P>
	At the same time, to make it easier to resolve pay equity 
concerns in the long term we need fundamental changes in the 
job classification and remuneration structures of the public 
service. I am looking forward to trying to find a less 
confrontational way of ensuring that employees receive 
compensation that is in fact gender neutral. We are looking for 
ways to try to bring about a negotiated settlement of the matter.
<P>
	The notions of what is a job and what is work are changing. 
We are moving away from the 9 to 5 routine, the old office and 
factory of the age of industry. For example, more work is being 
done at home under a policy that we have: Treasury Board's 
three-year Telework pilot project. Work schedules have to be 
adjusted to the needs of clients. We need to be more flexible. We 
need to change the structure of work. As the public service 
unions and managers have a big role to play in the evolution, this 
topic will be on the table for joint action.
<P>
	I raise all of these matters, as I reach my conclusion, to 
illustrate that even though there is a wage freeze, which means 
we cannot go to the bargaining table on wages, we can go to the 
bargaining table to attempt to deal with a number of other issues. 
These are just examples. There are others that both we and the 
unions want to raise at the table. Through those means we will 
help to build the relationship between employer and employee 
over the years ahead.
<P>
<B>(1040 ) </B>
<P>
	I hope my remarks have made clear the main elements of the 
approach the government will take with the public service.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	To begin with, we respect and are fully aware of the 
contribution to be made by employees of the Public Service of 
Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We shall seek the broadest possible dialogue with public 
service unions and managers.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We will involve Parliament closely in all the major issues 
affecting the public service.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	When necessary we shall act directly through legislation to 
ensure that the government's fiscal requirements are met. We 
shall respect the employment security of public service 
employees. I summarize these principles because they will 
guide all our actions. We expect to be held to them and I 
welcome that.
<P>
	Let me conclude where I began. This is a responsible budget. 
A responsible bill flows from that budget. I look forward to 
working with the managers and the union leaders of the public 
service in implementing the budget measures that I have just 
discussed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Since there are no questions and 
comments, debate is resumed. I will now recognize the hon. 
member for Mercier.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to start by pointing out that the previous speech was made by the 
President of the Treasury Board, and with respect, I think it is a 
disgrace that this government wants to change substantially how 
unemployment insurance works without introducing a separate 
bill to do so. Something even the Conservatives would not have 
dared to do.
<P>
	The figures released yesterday on the total value of benefits 
paid, which will be reduced during 1994-95 and 1995-96-and 
I may recall that for each year this will be $630 million in the 
Atlantic Provinces and $735 million in Quebec-these figures 
show that the Maritime Provinces and Quebec will be hit with 
nearly 60 per cent of the cutbacks, although together they 
represent only one-third of the population. In fact, the 
Maritimes are being hit even worse. The Maritimes, or should I 
say the Atlantic Provinces, with 8.5 per cent of the population of 
Canada, will feel 26 per cent of the cuts, while Quebec is also 
seriously hit, with 25 per cent of the population and 31 per cent 
of the cuts.
<P>
	I wanted to make this point because this amendment to the 
Unemployment Insurance Act does more than change the rules 
and the number of weeks. It marks the end of the redistributional 
effect of unemployment insurance. This effect was needed 
because of the widely differing economies in some of Canada's 
regions. I do not think the workers in these regions should be 
penalized for the poor state of the economy, especially when a 
government gets elected by saying: jobs, jobs, jobs, vote for us!
<P>
	By making these cuts, the government is passing judgment on 
the economy of these provinces and the Maritimes. It is saying: 
It is useless to do anything to help you. Move somewhere else! 
So workers will have to move, and if they do not, they will only 
have themselves to blame. One minister says we can give them 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2782"> 2782 </A></B>
<P>
some hope  for the future by letting them pick up trash when they 
are between the ages of 50 and 65.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	This bill will endear the government to no one, especially in 
the Maritimes, where the Liberals were elected with a strong 
majority and where they never told the workers who voted for 
them and their promises of jobs, that all these people who were 
seasonally employed would soon see their benefits cut by an 
omnibus bill.
<P>
	These cuts are substantial, Mr. Speaker. We saw the overall 
figures, but to the individual, it means a loss of thousands of 
dollars and a change of status. For the benefit of those who have 
never been unemployed, there is a world of difference between 
being on unemployment insurance between jobs and being 
forced to go on welfare and feel like a social reject.
<P>
	Measures to provide that in some cases, people could be 
employed for a certain time and then go on unemployment 
insurance, were introduced by a previous Liberal government. 
The Liberals initiated this mechanism to provide for a measure 
of equity regions and between individuals.
<P>
	Did the Liberals not realize that these cutbacks would come 
down harder on the Maritimes and Quebec? Was this a 
coincidence and were they convinced that this was the route they 
had to take? No. Were they unaware of the consequences? Not on 
your Nelly. In the unemployment insurance bureaucracy it was 
common knowledge that people with short term employment 
could depend on unemployment insurance to supplement their 
income and could apply again, if they had to, but not every year. 
They could have this security, this money to tide them over. 
They knew, because there are plenty of tables at Unemployment 
and Immigration Canada that say so. These tables show that 
repeaters, as they are commonly called, tend to be from the 
Maritimes and Quebec. Individuals with between 10 and 20 
weeks of employment are from the Maritimes and Quebec. In 
fact, in 1991, the proportion of repeaters was 65 per cent in 
Newfoundland, compared with 4 per cent in Ontario.
<P>
	If the Liberals wanted a debate on the redistributional effect 
of unemployment insurance, they should have tackled this issue 
head-on. If Ontarians are sick and tired of paying for the rest of 
Canada, let us be honest about it, instead of hiding behind an 
omnibus bill that is touted as a set of new mechanisms but in fact 
introduces only technical changes.
<P>
	What does this government want? What is it drawn to? The 
American model? Is it adapting to the North American model? I 
ask the question but, as a well-known Liberal Prime Minister 
once said, to ask the question is to answer it. Is the government 
adapting its policies to those of the United States, where the 
norm is six months on unemployment insurance and coverage is 
50 per cent of the average industrial wage? We are very close. 
We are almost there.
<P>
	These are the same Liberals who fought against free trade and 
NAFTA, and they are going to make the workers, the victims, 
pay for the impact of these globalization policies.
<P>
	On the basis of the figures for the Maritimes and Quebec, our 
conclusion is that economic problems experienced by 
individuals can only be addressed by helping the individual. It is 
economic policy which determines whether or not Quebec's 
regions can develop. That is the issue.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	Since this omnibus bill is presented to implement the budget, 
let me talk about the economic policy underlying it. This week, 
during debate on the motion concerning job creation, I said that 
there are two kinds of countries. There are those where 
employment is the residue, the leftover, what remains when all 
the rest has been dealt with, when inflation, the debt and 
business subsidies have been considered. What else! In other 
countries, employment is the goal and it conditions all the 
parameters of a government's policy; it is part of an overall 
employment policy or strategy, not half-measures. We find 
half-measures not in what is done but in the promises. We are 
promised half-measures.
<P>
	The government has refused to address fiscal policy. It 
rejected the Bloc's proposal to set up a committee to look at all 
budget expenditures. The government has pursued the same 
monetary policy as the Conservatives, unsuccessfully, since we 
see how threatened the rates are now. The government does not 
care; on the contrary, the Liberals have always been the natural 
governing party, especially in Ottawa, so they do not care about 
giving the regions what they need to develop.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, Alain Dubuc, the famous editorialist of <I>La 
Presse</I>-by famous, I mean well-known; I do not always agree 
with him-recently wrote something which I believe is very 
important, especially coming from him. Unfortunately, I do not 
have a copy of the newspaper with me, but I am not 
misrepresenting him with this quotation: ``Lloyd Axworthy did 
not do what had to be done. He cut before putting measures in 
place to help workers''.
<P>
	The unemployment insurance measures which arouse the 
anger we see developing, understandably, will make the most 
vulnerable and the most disadvantaged pay for a reform that is 
still poorly defined, but whose outlines we can suppose. Before 
putting assistance measures in place, before implementing an 
employment-based economic policy worthy of the name, they 
cut. They cut and attacked those in the most difficult situation.
<P>
	As a member of the Committee on Human Resources 
Development, I heard the testimony of people from Sydney who 
are completely discouraged. Just raising the qualifying period 
from 10 to 12 weeks in a region where unemployment is 15 or 16 
per cent, there are no jobs and shutdowns are everywhere, 
throws many individuals and families into despair, because 
instead of having an  adjustment period to find their feet, they 
are forced to 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2783"> 2783 </A></B>
<P>
go on welfare. They are rejected. They feel downgraded, 
abandoned, left behind by this government which, I repeat, was 
elected by a very large majority of people who voted Liberal in 
the Maritimes on the promise of jobs.
<P>
	By the way, I want to point out the complacency of the Quebec 
Liberal government as well, which is not speaking out strongly 
to say how much these measures will cost it in additional 
welfare payments.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	A booklet released yesterday by Employment and 
Immigration Canada broaches the subject of social assistance. 
The following is stated: ``The minister invited provincial 
officials to meet with those responsible for human resources 
development with a view to identifying estimates and 
developing a common agreement on the implications of social 
assistance''. Representatives in Ottawa currently put the 
potential repercussions for the provinces at between $65 million 
and $135 million. This means roughly $40 million for Quebec, 
given the situation in which it currently finds itself.
<P>
	Is the Government of Quebec complaining? No. Of course, 
there is an election coming and the Quebec Liberal government 
is a prisoner of its own political options.
<P>
	Once again, it is the workers who are going to pay dearly very 
soon for this government's refusal to keep its promises. The 
least fortunate are going to have to pay for the complicity of 
other governments seeking only to settle their own structural 
problems by paying no heed to ordinary people.
<P>
	I see that I must wrap up my remarks, Mr. Speaker. I would 
have liked to continue, but I have been told that my time is 
nearly up. When I speak from the heart, I can go on for quite 
some time. However, before concluding, I would like to table 
the following motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That all of the words following the word ``That'' be rescinded and replaced 
by the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``this House refuse to proceed with the second reading of Bill C-17, an Act to 
amend certain statutes to implement certain provisions of the budget</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>1) given that the amendments to the Unemployment Insurance Act do not 
reduce the inequities between have and have-not regions in the country and 
contain no specific measures to reduce youth unemployment;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>2) given that the amendments to the Unemployment Insurance Act do not 
cancel the increase in premiums paid by workers and employers in effect since 
January 1, 1994.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Having tabled this amendment, may I now use the time I have 
remaining?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member may continue later. I will 
take the motion under advisement, examine it and make a ruling 
immediately following oral question period.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
happy to inform hon. members of the issuing last week of a 
commemorative stamp to honour the 125th anniversary of the 
founding of Eaton's department stores by one of 
Huron-Bruce's favorite sons, Timothy Eaton.
<P>
	Canada Post has issued a prestige booklet which includes 
stamps, photographs and a written text outlining the history of 
the T. Eaton Company.
<P>
	Last week in London at the Galleria Eaton store there was a 
presentation of an enlarged commemorative stamp to the 
Kirkton-Woodham Community Centre and to Ray and Wendy 
Venturin, operators of the Kirkton market, the ancestor of 
Timothy Eaton's original business.
<P>
	After coming to Canada in 1856 from his native Ireland, he 
settled and eventually opened his first store in the 
Huron-Bruce town of Kirkton, Ontario. In a small wooden 
cabin with his brother James, Timothy Eaton operated a small 
general store and post office.
<P>
	Later Timothy Eaton left Kirkton for St. Mary's, Ontario, 
where he began a small dry goods store. In 1869 he headed for 
Toronto where he founded the store that eventually became the 
famous Eaton's chain, which prides itself on customer service, 
and quality merchandise for a good price.

circumstances in my riding will now haunt a Calgary family 
forever.
<P>
	A cold-blooded murder, apparently premeditated, tells a 
story that in Canada is becoming all too common. Something 
must be done as Canadians everywhere are demanding major 
criminal justice reforms.
<P>
	The chairman of the justice committee stated on March 23 
that the justice system should be more lenient toward first 
degree murderers. He suggested that the eligibility for parole be 
reduced from 25 years to 15.
<P>
	My constituent died as a result of a shotgun blast to the back at 
point-blank range. Why should there be any leniency in a case 
like this? How can such a change, as suggested by the Liberals, 
make our streets safer?
<P>
	It is time to strengthen parole mechanisms, not to weaken 
them. Despite what the Liberals want, I can categorically say 
that Canadians do not want leniency at this cost. Convicted 
killers indeed have a place: off our streets and behind bars.

birthplace of hockey in this great country.
<P>
	As documented by the Windsor Hockey Heritage Society, the 
game of hockey had its origins in Windsor, Nova Scotia in the 
early 1800s. It was first played by the students of Kings College 
School where it evolved from hurley, an Irish field game. In fact, 
hockey was played in Windsor for nearly a century before it was 
played in most other Canadian towns.
<P>
	I am proud that in my riding of Annapolis Valley-Hants the 
Windsor Hockey Heritage Society continues to promote the 
history of this great game, both locally and across Canada. I 
would like to congratulate this organization for its dedication in 
preserving such an important part of our heritage.

behalf of all Manitobans and Canadians, I rise today to salute 
and congratulate 11 year old Anna Paquin.
<P>
	Miss Paquin was awarded an Academy Award this week for 
best supporting actress for her role in the movie <I>The Piano</I>.
<P>
	Anna Paquin was only four years old when she left Winnipeg 
and according to her uncle, Dr. Wayne Paquin of St. Boniface, 
she was always ``very precocious, very bright, very outgoing 
and very talented''. Miss Paquin became the youngest Oscar 
winner since 10 year old Tatum O'Neil won in the same category 
for <I>Paper Moon</I> 20 years ago.
<P>
	Anna's grandmother, Mrs. Agnes Tuckwell, watched with a 
great deal of pride from her St. Boniface home as her

<P>
	Unless excused for a very good reason Canadians when asked 
are obliged to do jury duty. Most people do not complain 
because it is a service to our country.
<P>
	But consider what happened to one of my constituents. She 
was on unemployment insurance when called to jury duty. She 
met her obligation but discovered later she lost her UI benefits 
while serving as a juror. What we have here is one department of 
government ordering a citizen to carry out her duties to Canada 
while another department penalizes her for doing so.
<P>

<P>
	The work of the committee has confirmed the new role of 
parliamentary committees promised by our party during the last

a spirit of co-operation and commitment toward achieving a 
consensus report which will soon be tabled in the House.
<P>
	Once the committee report is tabled it will be up to the 
government to respond with the appropriate legislation to 
implement the moratorium called for by that committee. I would

<P>
	Fetal alcohol syndrome is defined as a random pattern of 
mental, physical and behavioural defects which may develop in 
the unborn child when the mother consumes alcohol during the 
course of her pregnancy. A pregnant woman never drinks alone.
<P>
	Canadian estimates of children affected by fetal alcohol 
syndrome are over 36,000 yearly. These statistics tell us that 
over 50 per cent of these children become wards of the state. The 
same percentage will need corrective surgeries while many will 
suffer from blindness, deafness, epilepsy and most frequently 
mental retardation.
<P>
	The government must take some responsibility for this 
situation and make sure that measures are taken to educate 
people by labelling all bottles of alcohol, posting signs, 
introducing health programs in the schools, et cetera.

	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the income gap between francophones and 
anglophones, which keeps widening, is partly due to the fact that 
francophone minorities in Canada do not have management 
control of their elementary and secondary schools. This opinion 
is also shared by the hon. member for Ottawa-Vanier. After 
thirty years of futile struggle, half of the Franco-Ontarian

getting poorer every year.

	Francophone and Acadian minorities in Canada do not need

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
downward slide of the Canadian dollar, coupled with the fact 
that interest rates appear to be on the increase, is cause for great 
concern. This disturbing situation comes at a time when the 
dollar has fallen to its lowest level in eight years.
<P>
	For the consumer preparing to renew a $100,000 mortgage, 
this could mean an increase of $80 a month, just at a time when 
the largest number of real estate transactions are made.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Does the Minister 
recognize that the downward slide of the Canadian dollar and the 
upward pressure on interest rates are largely attributable to the 
actions of Japanese investors who are divesting themselves in 
mass numbers of their Canadian securities?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. 
member's question and the tone in which it was put. However, as 
you know, international markets are extremely volatile and it is 
really not the Minister of Finance's place to comment on the 
reasons why this is the case.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the 
minister recognize that the falling Canadian dollar, which has 
tumbled even further than the US dollar, and the reaction in 
Japanese financial circles are directly attributable to the failure 
on the part of the Finance Minister to introduce strong measures 
to control public spending?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, perhaps I could refer the 
hon. member to an article in yesterday's <I>Le Devoir</I> by Mr. 
Sansfaçon who lists the reasons why markets are nervous and 
gives his own views about the Canadian dollar. He notes that a 
survey of the vast majority of foreign stock exchanges and a 
review of their reports has revealed one clear fact, namely that 
the reasons for the uncertainty surrounding our currency 
obviously have nothing to do-and these are his own 
words-with the February 22 budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the 
Minister of Finance not agree that his strategy, which consists in 
shifting the deficit onto the backs of the provinces, is being 
judged very harshly by foreign markets and that this strategy is 
the direct cause of the problems which the Canadian dollar is 
currently experiencing?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, when we were in 
opposition, we made it very clear that shifting the burden of the 
federal debt onto the backs of the provincial governments was 
extremely harmful. That is why we did not take this kind of 
action in our budget. In fact, we did quite the opposite.
<P>
	A month and a half before the budget, we adopted our 
equalization program which, I must say, is very beneficial to 
Quebec and to the seven provinces which receive equalization. 
This was a program that the previous government had neglected 
to ratify, preferring instead to merely extend its provisions. We 
have signed a five-year agreement and even Quebec has said 
that we have been generous. Moreover, when the time came to 
move on social security reform, we provided a two-year period 
of predictability with respect to payments and we have indicated 
that we will work with the provinces. And I must say that the 
provincial ministers of finance, including Mr. Bourbeau of 
Quebec, have reacted very positively to our actions.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Confirmation was given to us yesterday that the poorest of the 
provinces, that is to say the Maritime provinces and Quebec, 
will be the hardest hit by unemployment insurance cuts. In 
Atlantic Canada and Quebec alone, cuts will total $1.36 billion a 
year for the next two years. Furthermore, these cuts will cause a 
substantial increase in provincial expenditures for social 
assistance.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance confirm the statement made by 
his colleague the Minister for Human Resources Development 
to the effect that only 3 per cent of UI recipients will be affected 
by reductions in benefit rates, which means that, in Quebec, 3 
per cent of our unemployed work force will foot the $735 
million bill passed on to the provinces as a result of the 
minister's cuts?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, in terms of per capita UI 
benefits, Atlantic Canada will be receiving $970 and Quebec 
$739, as compared to a national average of $575. Following 
these changes to the UI system, Atlantic Canada and Quebec 
will continue to receive much more than the national average. 
So, there is no basis for saying that they are hit harder.

<HR>

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sure 
that this answer will sound incredibly cynical to all unemployed 
men and women in Quebec and the Maritimes, and the scale 
of the demonstrations held by people who are seeing more and 
more clearly what the government is up to should prompt him 
to act.
<P>
	Here is my question. Is the Minister of Finance prepared to 
defer cutbacks in the unemployment insurance system at least 
long enough to put in place a real job creation strategy to help 
the jobless find work instead of forcing them onto welfare?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>I will answer the hon. member 
through you, Mr. Speaker. Our budget is a real job creation 
strategy. Atlantic Canada and Quebec stand to benefit the most, 
because these regions are unfortunately the most seriously 
affected by unemployment.
<P>
	I must say that the rollback in unemployment insurance 
premium rates will benefit small business in Quebec and 
Atlantic Canada and thus foster job creation. I must say that our 
technology network will help small business, Atlantic Canada 
and Quebec. I must add that our budget will help those provinces 
where the unemployment situation is the most serious because it 
is designed to create jobs by calling upon one of their strengths, 
small and medium-sized businesses.
<P>
	Allow me to quote this statistical data published today 
concerning Quebec. There are apparently real signs of an 
upward trend in employment in Quebec. This fact was 
confirmed by the Quebec manpower development agency. From 
August to January, the employment level in Quebec has grown 
by 51,000 jobs to 2,983,000, the highest level since October 
1991. Last January, a net number of 23,000 jobs were created, as 
opposed to 13,000 lost in December.

goodness it is Friday and thank goodness it is Easter break.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Contrary to 
repeated assurances by the minister that he is not terribly 
concerned about interest rates, these rates continue to climb.
<P>
	My purpose today is not to ask the minister why rates are 
climbing, whose fault it is or even whether he can do anything 
about it. My purpose is to get a straight answer to a specific 
direct question: Can the minister tell this House whether his 
department has developed any contingency plan to meet its 
deficit reduction targets if interest rates continue to climb.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister

We have built into our budget sufficient room to manoeuvre 
given the number of variables which well could affect our 
targets. Let me simply say to the member that we are going to hit 
our target.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, not only are interest rates rising but the dollar is falling 
at a dramatic rate. The minister must realize that a falling dollar 
will increase the cost of imports and will inevitably cause 
inflation. The minister is counting on a low inflation economy 
and that is not a traditional characteristic of the Liberal 
government.
<P>
	Can the minister tell the House if he has a strategy to maintain 
low inflation in Canada if imports begin to drive the inflation 
rate above 3 per cent?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, I know that this is not the case but the 
member seems to be almost rubbing his hands in glee at what is 
happening. I am sure that is not the case because all members in 
this House will seek the best for the Canadian economy.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Right on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard):</B> Before Christmas the 
Governor of the Bank of Canada and I sat down and set out our 
inflationary targets for the next five years. Those inflationary 
targets we did in a very short period of time, something that took 
the previous government two and one-half years to arrive at.
<P>
	Those inflation targets are among the most disciplined of any 
of the industrial countries in the western world. They are a 1 to 3 
target with mid-point 2. The Governor of the Bank of Canada 
testifying before the Senate the other day made it very clear that 
we are going to stay within those targets.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, certainly this boasting that the budget is a great success 
may impress backbenchers but it has obviously failed 
impressing those who finance Canada's $500 billion debt, 
namely taxpayers and investors.
<P>
	For six weeks now the minister's promise of a strong 
medicine next year has been undermined by repeated statements 
by the Prime Minister that all cuts are already on the table.

minister ask the Prime Minister to remove the handcuffs and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2789"> 2789 </A></B>

allow him to use the only available solution to the problem, 
deeper cuts in public spending and a revised fiscal plan?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Develop-ment -Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have heard the Prime Minister 
repeatedly within this House in response to questions from the 
other side say exactly what I said in the budget speech. That is 
that the cuts in our budget in and of themselves are sufficient for 
us to reach the 3 per cent of GDP target that we have within three 
years.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has gone on to say that within the budget 
reference is made to the review of government operations which 
is going to be undertaken by the Minister responsible for Public 
Service Renewal in which we are rethinking the role of 
government, rethinking the way in which we approach the 
economy. That is an essential part of our budget and it is an 
essential part of our ultimate plan to clean up this nation's

<P>
	At the end of February, Hydro-Québec received the go-ahead 
from the Quebec government to start construction on the 
Sainte-Marguerite project, in the Sept-Îles region, where 
unemployment is very high. At the time of this announcement, 
Quebec had obtained political assurances from Ottawa that the 
federal government would support the project. But failing 
federal permits, the construction of the dam, scheduled to start 
next week, may have to be postponed.

question.
<P>
	When the government announced on February 24 that it had 
accepted the BAPE report on the Hydro Quebec project it also 
indicated at that time that there would be certain steps taken 
before a permit was issued.
<P>
	As the member should know, the environment must and will 
be protected. The Department of Transport is working very 
closely with the province and all other parties to finalize the 
permit. It has only been a month since the government has 
accepted the project. It will not be issued until all the pieces are 
in place.
<P>
	I can assure the hon. member that yes, we are concerned that 
jobs are at stake and yes, we want the project to go ahead; but 
there are conditions to be met before the permit is issued and we

unemployment is running rampant?

of federal-provincial co-operation.
<P>
	Complete agreement was achieved with the province with 
respect to project description, conduct and content. At present, a 
permit is to be issued by Transport Canada. Of course, this is a 
complex and detailed document and there are still a few pieces

<P>
	The budget projects an overall growth in the economy to be 10

actions does the government intend to take to prevent Canadian 
industries from bearing the brunt of the Americans' measures 
against all their trading partners?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
International Trade):</B> First of all, Mr. Speaker, the Uruguay 
Round to be signed by April 15 will resolve many of the 
difficulties encountered from time to time. We hope that the 
international community will find ways to settle all trade 
disputes between countries in a positive fashion, by keeping the 
lines of communication open, encouraging dialogue and 
avoiding controversy between the United States, Japan and the 
other countries.

	I would like to know what kind of support the government is 
giving to the publishing industry in Canada. Would the minister 
also give his impression of this particular support?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. The 
government considers that the publishing industry is a vital 
sector of the Canadian economy. I would add that I am also 
convinced the strong culture or strong identity of Canada could 
not do without a strong publishing industry.

apparent plan to appoint a wholly unqualified Liberal supporter 
as chairman of the board.
<P>
	The minister assured me that if I provided details of the 
problem he would respond quickly. The same day I supplied the 
minister with a list of the number of calls made to his office and 
the persons who called. I also supplied the names of three highly 
qualified people recommended by community leaders to fill 
these positions. To date I have received no reply.

the hon. member can rest assured that this government will only 
appoint people who are qualified to do their jobs. It is extremely 
important that we keep the confidence of the Canadian people. 
Every single appointment this government has made to date 
speaks to the fact that this government will only appoint people 
who are highly competent for the job at hand.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the board of referees normally has two chairs but now is shut 
down because the government chose not to renew the term of the 
only current chair.
<P>
	Will the minister agree to extend the term of Rocco 
Mastrobuono so that the board can continue to function, given 
the length of time the government seems to need to deal with this 
problem?

to ask the Minister of Public Works a question. On February 24, 
the Minister of Public Works said in this House that the Canada 
Mortgage and Housing Corporation intended to save $120 
million over four years and that this amount would be used for 
social housing.
<P>
	Since the minister promised to use this $120 million to help 
the poorly housed, can he tell us how many social, co-operative 
and non-profit housing units will be built this year with these 
savings?
<P>

	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and

her excellent question.
<P>
	I apprise her that we are attempting to achieve greater savings 
than $120 million over the next four years in view of the 
co-operation which is taking place between the Government of 
Canada and the different provinces. Until such time as we can 
identify for this fiscal year the amount of those savings it would 
be premature for me to announce on the floor of the House of 
Commons the exact way in which those expenditures are to be 
made.
<P>
	I do want to assure the hon. member that we are consulting 
with the provinces. We will be consulting with various 
stakeholders across the country in order to try to achieve better 
value for the taxpayer's dollar.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East):</B> Mr. Speaker, in view of the 
information which the minister wishes to give us, even though 
we still lack quite a few details on this subject, I would like to 
know if he could also confirm that he intends to offer shelter 
assistance, that is, direct aid for tenants, instead of investing in 
collective housing projects like low-income housing and 
housing co-ops, in case he should change his mind.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and

changing one's mind. It is a matter of getting the best value for 
the taxpayer's dollar.
<P>
	All options will certainly be examined. There will be 
meaningful consultations with the provinces and various 
stakeholders. I want to assure the hon. member the suggestion 
she has made which seems to be coming not only from members 
of her party but also from other individuals in the province of 
Quebec and elsewhere is something my government and

<P>
	We also suggested that a problem existed in the adjacent

Fisheries and Oceans and Environment Canada?
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the member for Delta for giving notice of his 
question.
<P>
	I want to assure the hon. member exactly as I have assured the 
member for Central Nova. Neither the Department of the 
Environment nor the Department of Fisheries and Oceans under 
section 35 of the Fisheries Act has yet completed a full and 
proper assessment of the proposal that has been put forward for 
the effluent diffuser into the Northumberland Strait. No such 
decision has been reached nor will it be reached until a full and 
proper assessment is done and until a full consultation occurs 
with the fishermen from that region.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta):</B> I appreciate the minister's 
answer, Mr. Speaker, and recognize he is concerned about these 
environmental issues.
<P>
	However government officials have suggested that the 
designation of the boat harbour treatment facility be changed to 
allow some pollutants in the effluent to be increased by as much 
as 800 per cent.
<P>
	Can the minister assure this House that present effluent 
regulations will not be gutted to allow Scott Maritimes to 
increase pollutants by 800 per cent?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have an obligation under section 35 of the Fisheries 
Act to protect habitat. That is an obligation I have in law.
<P>
	This government has not hesitated to take the most difficult 
decisions in the name of conservation of habitat. This is the 
government that took the decision to close down a food fishery, 
a basic hook and line fishery, in the name of rebuilding critical 
cod stocks. Decisions, like those to not allow pollutants contrary 
to the Fisheries Act into critical spawning areas, would be easy 
for us to take.
<P>
	This government will not compromise conservation of habitat 
for any reason. We have acted forcefully and we will continue to 
act forcefully in the interests of conservation.

the circumstances around the sale of Ginn Publishing to 
Paramount. The minister would rather refer the matter for 
consideration to the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage. 
However, in this morning's <I>Globe and Mail</I>, we read that the 
minister's Liberal colleague, the chairman of this committee, 
has made it clear he does not want to conduct an inquiry into this 
controversial matter.
<P>
	Does this mean that the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
suggested referring the matter to the Commons committee, 
while he knew perfectly well his colleagues would refuse to 
consider the matter, probably because they also sensed the

for the finance minister.
<P>
	The federal government and the provincial government of 
Quebec have paid $46.4 million in government grants to 
Hyundai motor company to assemble cars in Bromont, Quebec. I 
understand the finance minister plans to spend another $32 
million on this project in the name of job creation.
<P>
	When is the finance minister and his government going to 
learn that regional development programs do not work, that 
injecting cash into the private sector distorts the marketplace 
and that these dollars ultimately dig our debt hole deeper? When 
will the finance minister learn something and stop wasting 
taxpayers' dollars on direct grants and subsidies to businesses?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, as has already been announced in this 
House, the respective ministers responsible for the development 
agencies, namely the minister responsible for ACOA, the 
minister responsible for western diversification and the minister 
responsible for FORD-Q, have all said the way in which 
regional development policies have been carried out in the past 
are certainly ineffective and really not in accordance with the 
needs of a modern economy.
<P>
	As a result, all three ministers have said they are reviewing 
and in fact have either imposed or brought in substantial 
changes in the way government interacts with the economy.
<P>
	Our position has been very clear on that and we are in the 
process of doing it. In fact a great deal of that is manifested in 
the budget and will be manifested in subsequent budgets to 
come.
<P>
	In terms of the particular incident the member raises, first of 
all this agreement was signed prior to our taking office. It was 
also within the context of a larger overall agreement between 
Quebec and the federal government, as has been signed with 
many other governments. While there are numerous problems

question.

bad? Does he know the answer?

	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury </B><B>Board

the first annual report on employment equity in the public 
service which I just tabled is a requirement of the Financial 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2795"> 2795 </A></B>
<P>
Administration Act as a result of amendments that were passed 
in December 1992 as part of the Public Service Reform Act.
<P>
	I would like to remind hon. members of the important 
role-those who were of course in the last House will recognize 
this-that my parliamentary secretary, the hon. member for 
Ottawa West, played in ensuring that this report would be tabled 
in the House.
<P>
	Indeed, when the act was in committee she introduced an 
amendment that the government of the day accepted and that 
became the section on employment equity in the Financial 
Administration Act.
<P>
	In speaking in the committee the hon. member for Ottawa 
West said that the amendment represented a renewed 
commitment to some very positive action to ensure that people 
in the four designated groups are no longer denied opportunities 
to be whatever they are capable of being in the public service of 
this country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	To return to the annual report that I have tabled, I should note 
that the Treasury Board has been publishing employment equity 
data since 1988.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	These information packages which were made available to the 
public, although not tabled in this Parliament, have provided 
useful information on the state of employment equity in the 
public service.
<P>
	However, they did not show the range of positive initiatives 
and activities that the Treasury Board and the Public Service 
Commission together with departments had been taking to 
advance the goals of employment equity programs.
<P>
	The annual report that I have just tabled tries to fill that gap. 
As the act states, the purpose of employment equity programs 
and policies in the public service is to improve employment and 
career opportunities for four designated groups. They are 
women, particularly women in non-traditional and executive 
positions, aboriginal peoples, persons with disabilities and, 
finally, persons  who because of their race or colour are in a 
visible minority.
<P>
	How are we to achieve this result: By eliminating 
employment barriers against persons in designated groups; by 
introducing and supporting, as the legislation requires, positive 
policies and practices; and by trying to ensure that persons in 
designated groups are represented in the public service in 
proportion to their representation in the workforce of this 
country and of the particular communities they serve in. 
However, focusing on the number of designated group members 
in the public service is not enough. Public service managers and 
employees must value diversity and must show it consistently 
through their actions.
<P>
	At this time I want to reiterate the government's commitment 
to employment equity and specifically its commitment to 
employment equity in the public service. It was in the red book, 
we made that point and we stick by it.
<P>
	The numerical goal of employment equity may be more 
difficult to achieve in times when the public service has stopped 
growing. However, let me assure hon. members that the 
employment equity program is a high priority of this 
government and that we will do everything possible to ensure 
that its goals are met.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	For example, just three months ago, we made a lot of changes 
to the Special Measures Program that was put in place by a 
Liberal government in 1983.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The report does not provide details of these revisions because 
it covers the period April 1, 1992 to March 31, 1993 which is 
before we came into office. However, I would like to inform the 
House that the Treasury Board has approved funding for a 
restructured special measures initiative program which will 
provide for pilot projects co-funded with departments that help 
increase our employment equity opportunities.
<P>
	One of these initiatives aims to improve, for example, 
employment opportunities for persons with disabilities in the 
public service.
<P>
<B>(1205 ) </B>
<P>
	As of April 1, 1994, I am pleased to announce that a special 
fund of $500,000 will be created to assist employees with 
disabilities. This is replacing a program that was a mere $40,000 
I might add. This assistance includes attendant care, 
modifications to computer equipment, materials and alternative 
formats and special telephone equipment.
<P>
	Second, retention of aboriginal employees is of concern to the 
government. The Treasury Board is developing a guide for 
managers to help them create a work environment that will 
encourage aboriginal employees to join and to remain in the 
public service.
<P>
	Furthermore, an executive development program for persons 
in a visible minority is being extended. Of course the 
recruitment program for visible minorities is also being 
continued.
<P>
	The progress of women in the public service has been steady 
and we shall be putting more emphasis on the development of 
opportunities for women in the public service.
<P>
	Courses on cultural awareness and diversity in the workforce 
are widely available to both public service managers and 
employees who are encouraged to take such training. It is 
important to set the right atmosphere in our public service and 
that kind of program helps a great deal.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2796"> 2796 </A></B>
<P>
	Finally, the Financial Administration Act requires the 
Treasury Board to prepare annual employment equity plans. All 
departments and agencies are required to have employment 
equity plans ready by this coming April 1, 1994. Anyone 
interested may obtain copies of the plans from departments and 
agencies.
<P>
	I also invite members of this House to make suggestions on 
how, since this is our first report, we might improve the annual 
report on employment equity.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I want thank 
the hon. minister for tabling his report, although we have been 
waiting for it since June 30, 1992, in accordance with the Public 
Service Reform Act.
<P>
	This document highlights, among other things, the 
representation profile of designated groups in the public 
service. It also provides the evolution of this profile from 
December 1988 to March 1993. It shows that, during those five 
years, female representation in the public service only increased 
by 3.2 per cent; aboriginal groups by 0.3 per cent; handicapped 
people by 0.4 per cent; and visible minorities by 0.9 per cent. In 
other words, the representation of designated groups barely 
changed over the last five years.
<P>
	In its red book, the Liberal government stated its intention of 
doing something for these designated groups. Yet, the 
Employment Equity Act still does not apply to the public 
service, nor to federal commissions or agencies. What did the 
government do in the light of these findings and policy 
statements?
<P>
	Today, the government announced pilot projects for the 
restructuring of special measures programs. It announced the 
creation of a special $500,000 fund for handicapped people 
which, divided by ten provinces, barely represents $50,000 for 
each province. There is certainly nothing extraordinary about 
this initiative.
<P>
	The government also announced a development program for 
visible minorities which, for all intent and purposes, was 
already in place. Consequently, this is merely a measure 
ensuring the <I>status quo</I>. In the case of women, whose 
representation only increased by 3 per cent over the last five 
years, which means barely 0.6 per  cent per year, the government 
announced development initiatives for administrative support 
positions.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	There seems to be a significant gap between the government's 
avowed intentions, or at least its stated intentions, and the 
measures actually taken to correct the situation. Just to give you 
an idea of how inconsistent the government is, on the one hand it 
announces measures which will have a very limited effect while, 
on the other hand, it is going to court to challenge 
representations made by the Public Service Alliance of Canada 
in favour of pay equity. Moreover, the government tabled Bill 
C-17, which freezes salaries in the public service, prevents a 
reform of salary scales, blocks a reform of job classification, 
and also delays wage parity and prevents it for the time being.
<P>
	What will be the real impact of Bill C-17 on the 
reclassification of groups of employees? What concrete 
measures is the government taking to ensure that the salary 
freeze will not jeopardize negotiations on wage parity? There is 
a gap between the government's stated intentions, the 
low-impact measures it advocates, and the real problem of pay 
equity in the public service. That gap has not been closed and 
nothing leads us to believe that it will be closed in the coming 
weeks or years.
<P>
	I will conclude by saying that the tabling of this report 
highlights the obvious contradictions between the government's 
real intentions and the weak measures it is taking to correct the 
situation. The government would be well advised to state its real 
intentions quickly, so that those affected can have some hope 
and confidence. After all, some have been waiting since the 
1980s to improve their plight, and they have to have some hope 
that things will finally improve.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this employment equity in the public service targets four 
designated groups: women, aboriginal peoples, persons with 
disabilities and visible minorities. It covers people in the federal 
public service and other sectors under the public influence such 
as banks of federal charter and certain businesses that do 
business with the government.
<P>
	In so far as the employment equity in the public service has as 
its primary goals, one, the removal of barriers to employment 
and, second, to encourage and support those in the designated 
groups to apply for advancement, then we endorse these 
activities and we applaud the public service for taking a 
leadership role.
<P>
	However, we would caution that it is one thing to remove 
barriers to provide encouragement and quite another to promote 
or hire because of ethnic or gender considerations. I would 
caution the public service not to practise reverse discrimination.
<P>
	As to persons with disabilities, the Standing Committee on 
Human Rights and the Status of Disabled  Persons tabled a 
report last year. That report clearly indicates that a primary 
barrier to employment of persons with disabilities is a catch-22 
situation. That is when persons with disabilities get a job and 
gain income from employment they do so very often at the 
expense of the very benefits they have been receiving that 
allowed them to get the job in the first place.
<P>
	This is an area that we already know the answer to which is 
one of taxation. The standing committee brought the report 
forward and it should be reviewed by the employment equity 
people.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2797"> 2797 </A></B>
<P>
	Our position is that emphasis must be on individual 
achievement. Employers must treat people as individuals in all 
aspects of recruitment, training, hiring and promotion. The 
emphasis must be on the individual's experience, ability and 
performance. Putting the emphasis on individuals will ensure 
that women, racial minorities, aboriginals and the disabled are 
not held back by stereotypes or other discrimination.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	Finally, there may well be those in the identified groups who 
need a helping hand and they should be encouraged. It is quite 
right that the public service would have this body to do just that, 
to encourage and to ensure that barriers do not exist.
<P>
	However we should recognize that the vast majority of 
women, visible minorities, aboriginals and the disabled would 
resent being categorized as somehow disadvantaged and unable 
to compete on their own merit. That is something that needs to 
be understood, that many people have made tremendous strides 
in their achievements. They have done so and will continue to do 
so on their own merit, not because they have benefited by some 
special program.
<P>
	We are, all of us, human beings with the same strengths, 
weaknesses, hopes and dreams as everyone else regardless of 
our defining characteristics.

Mr. Speaker, I have the honour to present, in both official

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Pursuant to the order of reference of February 8, 1994, your 
committee has considered the modernization and restructuring 
of Canada's social security system.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This interim report represents the first phase of your 
committee's consultation with Canadians on the modernization 
of Canada's social security system.
<P>
	Your committee is already preparing its second phase of 
consultation in anticipation of the release by the Minister of 
Human Resources Development of the government's action plan 
and proposed changes.
<P>
	In conformity with the House's reference on February 8, it is 
your committee's intention to table its final report with 
recommendations on or before September 30.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I want to thank most sincerely all members and staff of the 
committee as well as the hundreds of Canadians who have 
contributed to that phase of our work.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to say that the Bloc Quebecois, the Official Opposition, is 
tabling a dissenting report that the Standing Committee on 
Human Resources Development has agreed to append to the 
majority report.
<P>
	I would like to point out that the time frame set by the House 
in the committee's terms of reference is much too short to fulfil 
the obligation to consult all Canadians, in spite of outstanding 
and strenuous efforts on the part of the entire committee.
<P>
	There is one major flaw in the report and it pertains to the 
respective responsibilities of Canada and the provinces. You 
will understand that this is a fundamental question, for Quebec 
in particular. In our view, this matter was dealt with much too 
quickly in the relevant section of the report for it to be 
acceptable. In the second phase of our work, we will give this 
matter all the consideration and attention it warrants.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak on Bill C-17, the omnibus bill on the 
implementation of a number of measures in the recent budget. I 
am doing so on behalf of the hon. member for Lethbridge who is 
unable to be here. He has asked me to make a few comments on 
the general orientation of our caucus toward the bill and some of 
the measures in it. I will also take some time to comment further 
to that on some of our specific concerns with regard to the 
sections on transfer payments to the provinces, the area for 
which I am specifically responsible in the bill.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	Before doing so I would like to take a moment to draw to the 
attention of the House that Ernest Manning High School in the 
south part of my constituency of Calgary West has been holding 
a model parliament this week where they are debating many of 
the same things. I had been scheduled to attend their model 
parliament today but due to this commitment and other 
commitments particularly with regard to Bill C-18 and the 
committee hearings we had last night, I was unable to depart 
Ottawa.
<P>
	I have had the honour on many occasions in the past to attend 
model parliaments at Ernest Manning High School. If my 
experience is any example, I am sure the students would have 
much to recommend to the House in terms of not only the 
informed level of debate but also the democratic procedures that 
are in place in that particular parliament.
<P>
	Having said that, let me move to Bill C-17. As I indicated in 
earlier remarks today when we were discussing a point of 
procedural order, our party would be opposed to this kind of 
measure, to an omnibus approach to government legislation. In 
my remarks today, specifically to start with, I will deal with the 
five general parts of the bill: part I which applies to public sector 
compensation considerations; part II, the cuts in the Canada 
Assistance Plan and PUITTA transfers; part III, the reductions 
in transportation subsidies of various kinds; part IV, the 
authorization of borrowing authority for the Canadian 
Broadcasting Corporation; and finally part V, the significant 
changes to unemployment insurance.
<P>
	Our party has mixed views on these various items. It is 
unfortunate that the nature of the legislation itself would not 
allow us to independently support some of the more desirable 
aspects of the bill, at least at the voting phases.
<P>
	In part I, public sector compensation, the effect of the 
measure as in the budget is to extend wage freezes that have 
been in place now to the end of 1997, saving the government up 
to $1.5 billion over the next three years. In the zero in three 
deficit reduction program Reformers ran on during the election, 
we supported general reductions to the costs of the federal 
bureaucracy, the civil service, and to some degree civil service 
compensation, although certainly we would prefer to see most of 
the savings in the public sector concentrated on non-wage 
overheads.
<P>
	However it has been our experience that in the private 
sector-and, as members know, my area in particular is 
dominated by private sector activity-a general lack of raises in 
private sector wages has been the norm for several years now 
and downsizing in many organizations has been commonplace. 
In comparison, the public sector has been relatively lightly 
affected by the ongoing recessionary problems that we believe 
ultimately originate in the public sector through not only the 
expenditure practices of governments but also their taxation 
policies and taxation responses to deficit situations.
<P>
	Public sector compensation has continued to remain generous 
during this period and downsizing relatively light compared to 
that experienced in many other areas of our society. It is only 
justified that the public sector would experience these kinds of 
wage freezes during the period in question.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	I hope the committee will examine some of the specific 
measures and some of the broadness of the wage freezes which 
are actually very rigid across categories and do occasionally 
lead to some inequities or incongruities in application. There 
may be some specific things the committee could do to examine, 
while not violating the principle of freezing the overall wage 
bill, whether any more flexibility could be given.
<P>
	We also would like to support the one-time adjustments 
involved in government policy for relocation and incentive 
payments to workers who are being displaced from the public 
sector, particularly in the military area. There may be 
disagreement with the specific programs proposed, but I think 
no one questions the principle that there is a need to provide 
interim relief to those affected by government cutbacks. In 
particular we compliment the government for beginning to 
encourage the use of these funds toward retraining and 
relocation rather than just 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2800"> 2800 </A></B>
<P>
payments that encourage recipients to welfare when adjustment 
payments run out.
<P>
	We strongly support the freezes we are applying to ourselves 
in line with this, freezes to senior people in government and to 
members of Parliament. We would also take this opportunity to 
urge the government once more to make substantial cuts in 
benefit related areas to members of Parliament that are out of 
line with standards the public expects.
<P>
	I refer specifically to the MP pension plan. Even the 
contribution levels of members of Parliament to that plan 
exceed normal contribution to a plan. On top of that, the 
government is now matching our contributions on a six to one 
basis to preserve the soundness of the plan over the long haul.
<P>
	This simply cannot be justified at this time. I call on the 
government once again to bring in serious measures to cut back 
the benefit of this plan. It should ensure that the tremendous 
liabilities which have built up are not simply the responsibility 
of the taxpayer and that some of the current recipients who quite 
unjustifiably and quite irresponsibly voted themselves this kind 
of defined benefit also share in the reduction of the costs of the 
plan over the long run.
<P>
	In addition I raise the concern we have in this party about 
non-accountable expense allowances being used as 
supplementary pay. These allowances are substantial. I receive a 
cheque of $3,000 a month for my work here but then I receive an 
extra $1,775 for an expense allowance for which I do not have to 
account. I have absolutely no problem in saying that my 
expenses as a member of Parliament are high and I will account 
for them. However I know the total value of that particular 
money plus the additional expense accounts in our operating 
budgets exceeds the expenses I incur. I am certain they exceed 
the expenses incurred by members who live much closer to 
Ottawa. That is something the House should re-examine while it 
is looking at the compensation of ordinary public sector 
workers.
<P>
	Part II of the bill concerns reductions in transfer payments to 
the provinces, specifically in the area of the Canada Assistance 
Plan and the public utilities income tax transfer arrangements. I 
will not comment on those at great length here because I want to 
do so when I am finished my more general remarks. Let me just 
say in summary that these measures in many ways are an 
extension of some existing policies of government.
<P>
	Nevertheless we have concerns. We do support the fact-and 
we said during the campaign that the government was realizing 
it-that transfer payments to the provinces are substantial and 
will be affected by any kind of long term deficit reduction plan. 
We are seeing the government do that. Nevertheless it is doing it 
without a plan. We have some specific concerns with some of the 
proposals here and where exactly they are going. I will discuss 
that in a few minutes.
<P>
	Part III of the bill concerns reduction in transportation 
subsidies extending and deepening some reductions in the area 
of subsidies both to Atlantic sectors and to western grain sectors 
of our economy. During the campaign our party had called for a 
general reduction in money spent in the area of subsidies to 
transportation.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	We would prefer rolling together all grain transportation 
moneys for farmers along with other agricultural programs into 
a series of two or three programs. That would basically have the 
effect of giving individual farmers much more choice in how 
they utilize government assistance, particularly in the area of 
the type of transportation and the methods of transportation 
chosen to move their product. That is the direction in which we 
would like to go.
<P>
	We emphasize, though, that we only support the continuation 
of these subsidies as long as there is not an equal playing field 
with regard to the farm situation internationally. We favour a 
multilateral approach through the GATT to reducing these 
international subsidies. In line with that we would see our 
subsidies drop as well.
<P>
	I note that this question came up once before in the House of 
Commons. The government insisted that was everyone's 
position but of course it is not. There are people in this country 
and particularly in other countries who are opposed in principle 
to any kind of reduction in this area. We will not sacrifice our 
farm sector when other farm sectors are not experiencing similar 
reductions.
<P>
	Part IV of the bill, as I indicated, is the part that perhaps gives 
us the greatest difficulty. The Canadian Broadcasting 
Corporation is being given its own borrowing authority for the 
first time in its history in the magnitude of $25 million. This is a 
thinly veiled attempt to give the CBC more money without 
increasing its direct grants. We have already seen the 
government restructure the downsizing, the subsidy reduction 
program to the CBC, and spread it over a number of years to 
allow it to be less costly to the broadcasting corporation and 
more costly to taxpayers.
<P>
	What assurances do we have that in next year's request for 
moneys the CBC will not include the increased costs of paying 
back these loans as yet another financial need? In other words it 
could be a backdoor way for the CBC to get increased funding 
once again.
<P>
	In our view there will have to be a thorough examination of 
whether we support a large or small reduction to the budget of 
the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, a significant 
re-evaluation of its role and its mandate. Particularly as 
technology 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2801"> 2801 </A></B>
<P>
advances and we see these tremendous changes in the world, we 
recognize that the CBC will have to be re-examined.
<P>
	Whether or not the government likes it, shortly we will have 
the choice of hundreds of television stations for ordinary 
viewers. The CBC will be in a very different position than what 
it was when this kind of policy was first brought on to the stage. 
In recent years the CBC with this borrowing authority has been 
increasingly forced, like it or not, to compete, to go out into the 
market to raise revenues.
<P>
	With the implied backing directly or indirectly of the 
Government of Canada, it is crowding out the efforts of private 
advertisers and private investors to fund their own activities, 
their own borrowing and expansion requirements, at a time 
where money is very tight in the markets. The complaint I hear 
constantly from people in the radio and television business, not 
only in Calgary but in other cities where I visit, is that the CBC 
is not on a level playing field.
<P>
	It is a very tight and very competitive business right now. We 
know that a large percentage of private radio stations, for 
example, have gone out of business in the past several years. 
This is not the kind of competition they look upon favourably.
<P>
	We need to decide whether CBC should be strictly a medium 
to promote and produce Canadian television or whether it is a 
market player just like other stations. If so, does it compete on a 
level basis or does it have an unfair advantage? Before we 
extend this kind of borrowing authority we should be asking 
what mechanisms are in place to ensure the investments made by 
borrowing this money are profitable. Ultimately the CBC is 
fully supported by the Government of Canada and may lack the 
necessary incentives to invest prudently.
<P>
<B>(1245 ) </B>
<P>
	Part V of the bill concerns the government's changes to 
unemployment insurance. As I have said in previous speeches 
on the budget, these are the most significant changes in the bill 
and we certainly support the general direction the government is 
taking.
<P>
	In the second year of implementation of these changes, we 
will be saving the taxpayers in the order of $2.4 billion. This is a 
significant amount of money. It is certainly the most significant 
expenditure reduction in the budget. It is also a very significant 
reduction not just for the money saved but for the direction the 
government now appears to be mapping in this area which is 
very much along the lines of what Reformers have been 
advocating for a number of years.
<P>
	These changes are an important signal to the marketplace. The 
government is hinging a great deal of faith on holding its budget 
through the first year to try to  keep things on track, convincing 
the marketplace that this is the direction it is looking at and that 
it is looking at only less costly social programs in the future but 
much more responsibly structured ones.
<P>
	It hopes the marketplace will buy this signal even though it is 
really the sole big dollar application in the budget and will be 
able to hold off any kind of precipitous developments in the 
financial markets toward the dollar and toward the Government 
of Canada in the next year.
<P>
	As I said in my speech on the budget, that is the gamble the 
government has taken. I would note that except for this measure, 
the will is not in this budget. It is very unclear at the moment 
with the problems we have with interest rates and the dollar that 
the market is accepting this signal as the real direction of the 
government.
<P>
	Let me mention the good things in this development with 
unemployment insurance. There are several. First, it shows the 
government is moving in a good direction by not only reducing 
expenditure but also reducing payroll taxes.
<P>
	What is interesting is that the government claims reducing the 
payroll tax is one of the centrepieces of its job creation program. 
It is nice for us to see that the Liberals are acknowledging that 
decreases in these types of taxes are a real solution to the job 
creation problem and to the unemployment dilemma we have in 
the country. Certainly it is a more effective approach than things 
like the infrastructure program, an approach we hope they will 
expand in the future. We need to stimulate through tax relief 
sustainable private sector job creation. That really should be the 
focus of our economic strategy.
<P>
	The second desirable point about this is that the change 
proposed by the government to unemployment insurance is 
making the program more of a true insurance program rather 
than simply a haven for seasonal workers to top up their income, 
in other words, an income support program.
<P>
	The long run drift of the unemployment insurance program 
from insurance principles has been extremely costly in the 
number of dollars spent but also many economists would agree 
it has had a lot to do with the increase in structural 
unemployment and the distortion of the regional economies.
<P>
	Through the changes the government is proposing in the bill 
and in the budget, it is taking us down the path of linking through 
contributory programs like UI, contributions to the program 
much closer to the benefits that one is eligible to receive. Of 
course that is really the justification on which such contributory 
programs should operate.
<P>
	The third point in the government's proposed changes to 
unemployment insurance is that it is good to see the Liberals 
slowly crumbling their mantra of universality. I have already 
noted that while the government has attacked us on our proposed 
changes in these areas, for  example changes to seniors' 
programs, the government itself has taken absolutely no steps to 
restore the clawback to old age security which it fought when it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2802"> 2802 </A></B>
<P>
was in opposition. In fact it has gone additionally in that area. It 
has now imposed means testing on some of the tax benefits to 
senior citizens. This is another example of getting away from 
universality. We could disagree with the specific mechanism but 
the drift is definitely there. In the case of unemployment 
insurance there has been an increase in benefits for lower 
income Canadians under some circumstances and a decrease for 
others.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	The government is moving in all of these directions, and I 
repeat them: the reduction of payroll taxes, the return to a link 
between contribution and benefit in unemployment insurance, 
in other words, insurance principles and finally a move toward 
some targeting in this program and away from universality.
<P>
	These are all positive aspects in our view. I also acknowledge 
they were difficult decisions. The changes will be significant for 
the people affected and this particular decision I am sure will not 
be an easy one for the government although it will have our 
support. I regret it is one of a very few difficult decisions 
contained in the budget.
<P>
	I want to express one reservation. There is also a change 
which gives employees the benefit of the doubt when dismissed 
for misconduct. In our view it has the potential of encouraging 
employees to dispute all dismissals in the hope of collecting 
premiums. This could clog up the system and result in increased 
claims. We hope the government in committee will examine the 
direction it is going although I would acknowledge that some of 
the things the previous government did in that area were 
questionable.
<P>
	Finally, we also acknowledge the need for the pilot projects 
that are part of the bill and we urge the government to keep the 
House current on the spending of this money and to report to the 
House evaluations of the success of these kinds of projects. Too 
often in the past we announce initiatives for the sake of 
lessening the impact of unpopular measures. These continue 
permanently, they are never properly evaluated and they end up 
being simply a way that we mitigate the effect of having tried to 
save money in the first place.
<P>
	Having said those things, I regret we are unable to support the 
bill over all. There are many things we do support but do not 
support the bill over all because of its omnibus nature.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would also like to comment very briefly on the position 
taken by the Bloc Quebecois regarding Bill C-17, an act to 
amend certain statutes to implement certain provisions of the 
budget tabled in Parliament on February 22, 1994.
<P>
	I may add that most of the measures in this bill concern 
specific cuts in the government's budget, especially the 
government's proposed cuts in unemployment insurance.
<P>
	Apparently, the Bloc is opposed to this bill, as it is opposed to 
any major changes proposed by the Reform Party which concern 
major government programs, and I find this disturbing, because 
I see a party that is in favour of the greatest change of all, the 
break-up of this country.
<P>
	When we talk about federal programs, programs created 
under the federal system, our party is proposing major changes, 
while the Liberals are proposing changes that are as significant 
as ours, but when the government starts to discuss issues that are 
vital to the future of our country, we see that the Bloc is always 
opposed to these changes.
<P>
	I find it hard to explain to my constituents why a party that 
cannot abide the Canadian federal system still supports federal 
programs and in fact supports the status quo.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is always prepared to recognize the 
benefits of federal programs and it does so clearly and 
incisively, but when it talks about what is wrong with the federal 
system and especially about the programs we are discussing 
here, they tend to lack that incisiveness. I must say that I find it 
hard to understand why they are opposed to the system, to the 
program in general, while they are not to specific cases.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I hope that we will get a better understanding of these 
positions as we debate these things in the future.
<P>
	If I could for a few moments turn specifically to Part II which 
is the area of my particular expertise, the fiscal arrangements 
section of this bill, I note that it affects two areas, the Canada 
assistance plan and the Public Utilities Income Tax Transfer 
Act.
<P>
	The Canada assistance plan changes are in clause 12 of the bill 
and the purpose is to limit future federal CAP contributions to 
each province to the amount they received in the year ending 
March 31, 1995 until superseded by social security program 
reform in fiscal 1996-97.
<P>
	Our position generally has been to recognize the need for 
reduction in the area of federal transfers and specifically in the 
area of welfare. I guess what we ask is why we are imposing 
targets for reduction in the absence of any particular policy for 
change and even in the absence of any particular policy direction 
that would indicate what the changes would be.
<P>
	In our view there have already been inequities created through 
this situation. The previous government brought in specific caps 
to the payments that went to the so-called have provinces: 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2803"> 2803 </A></B>
<P>
Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario, caps that reduced quite 
significantly the expected revenue  of these provinces from 
federal transfers for welfare payments. This has been a big 
problem in the case of Ontario.
<P>
	This seems to be happening without an overall plan and now 
we are asked to implement additional projected cuts. Once again 
we do not know where this is going. In fact, we have various 
committees studying these things at the moment.
<P>
	I am concerned about the lack of restructuring of the program, 
the lack of overall financial direction, just these arbitrary 
reductions. What is interesting is they are done really on the 
basis on which the Liberal Party often criticizes us, saying we 
are slash and burn, we have no plan and we just cut the dollars. In 
fact, this is precisely what this bill does. It lays out some areas 
for reduction to a significant social program and provides 
absolutely no rationalization why that would be done or plan to 
implement it.
<P>
	Just to give some idea of the money involved, Canada 
assistance plan payments have been a rapidly growing area of 
government expenditure. In the last 10 years they have grown 
from $3.4 billion in 1984 to approximately $7.7 billion in fiscal 
1993-94. They are projected to grow by another 5.4 per cent this 
year. Obviously we can agree with the fact that there does need 
to be some reduction.
<P>
	The social assistance case load in this period has grown from 
about 750,000 in March 1980 up to 1.6 million today. I would 
point out once again to hon. members that the period of massive 
deficits, structural deficits, ongoing deficits and accumulation 
of debt has not been a period in which we have produced jobs in 
economic growth but one in which we have restricted and stifled 
it. I once again would ask the government to re-examine its view 
of the link between financial mismanagement at the federal 
level and job creation.
<P>
	The ministers often assert that there is a positive link between 
deficits and job creation. I think the evidence is increasingly 
otherwise. There are projected savings from the reforms here of 
$466 million up to 1995-96. These are significant amounts of 
money. However, once again I suggest that we do not know the 
direction and we are concerned about further penalization of 
particular provinces as we had in the past as opposed to 
something that may treat all provinces much more fairly.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	Clause 13 of the bill is the changes regarding the Public 
Utilities Income Tax Transfer Act. What this really does is 
preserve the current 10 per cent reduction of transfers under that 
act for an additional period of time.
<P>
	Just to inform the House, the Public Utilities Income Tax 
Transfer Act exists because in some parts of the country, 
particularly Alberta but not exclusively, utility companies are 
private sector whereas generally speaking they are public sector 
utilities. As a consequence the operations of these corporations 
are subject to taxation whereas crown corporations are not taxed 
in the same  manner. This has given rise to an inequity that is 
compensated for by the Public Utilities Income Tax Transfer Act 
which transfers back to the provinces some of the corporate 
income tax revenues that are taken out of certain provinces 
because they are private sector companies but not out of other 
provinces.
<P>
	The purpose of this program has been to create a level playing 
field in other words. This is obviously undone when we begin to 
freeze or reduce these kinds of payments.
<P>
	By the way this goes back to 1948. We recognized this 
inequity a long time ago. From 1966 on we refunded to the 
provinces virtually all, about 95 per cent, of the moneys that 
were collected from private utility companies back to the 
provincial governments. It was only in 1990 that we began to 
effectively freeze these payments. It had been done in the past 
but was reversed. However, in 1990 we started the pattern of 
freezing payments at fixed levels and of reducing the percentage 
that will be returned to provincial governments. In our view that 
is not fair.
<P>
	It has a particularly unfair effect on the province of Alberta 
which is the major beneficiary. These tax revenues in other 
provinces are generally retained by the province, but in Alberta 
the province rebates these tax revenues to the utility companies 
with the stipulation that they must be passed on to their 
customers. In other words the purpose here is not to allow the 
operation of the Income Tax Act to lead to higher utility prices in 
the province of Alberta.
<P>
	I suggest that the purpose of the act is fair. The government 
proposes to continue the present reductions in freezes that the 
Conservatives implemented. It is certainly no worse than we 
have at the current time but it is not an issue of equity.
<P>
	I come back to that time and time again when I speak about 
transfer payments and how we change transfer payments to the 
provinces, whether it is through the equalization formula on 
which we have already had a bill or through cap changes here or 
through PUITTA changes.
<P>
	In all cases what we see are programs that proceed without a 
plan. We either give money with minimal restriction in the case 
of equalization or cap it in the CAP or in the case of PUITTA. We 
have no particular rationalization for these things. The common 
theme seems to be that certain provinces, of which mine is one, 
seem to always come out at the short end of these 
non-systematic changes and revisions to policies that transfer 
money to provincial governments.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2804"> 2804 </A></B>
<P>
	I remain unclear of what my view is of these measures. I can 
support the philosophy of the CAP transfers but I do not know 
where they are really headed or what the public policy purpose 
is. In the case of the PUITTA transfers I do not support the 
philosophy but I do recognize that the government has not 
introduced additional cuts. Of course we would fight that quite 
strongly. Those are measures we are going to have to examine 
in committee.
<P>
	I see your signal, Mr. Speaker. I believe there will be other 
speakers on some of the other matters. I say once again there are 
things in this bill to recommend it. I just regret that we are 
proceeding with this omnibus approach to legislation which, 
because it lumps in things we support and things we do not 
support, unfortunately deprives us of the ability to support the 
government in votes where that would be appropriate.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	I appreciate very much your patience, Mr. Speaker. I believe 
we will hear later in debate from the hon. member for 
Lethbridge, who was unable to be here today, as well as other 
members of our party.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There are no questions or comments 
for the first three speakers on these matters, so the hon. member 
will have a chance with another speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
noted the hon. member for Calgary West who just spoke was 
bemoaning his lack of opportunity to vote against segments of 
this bill, but I assure him that he will have that opportunity in 
committee and if he moves the appropriate amendments at 
report stage, as I indicated in my argument this morning. We 
will see how many of the clauses of this bill he supports and in 
fact would vote for.
<P>
	I look forward to the support of the Reform Party for a large 
part of this package because this package of proposals I submit 
is a sound one.
<P>
	Last month this government introduced its first budget and 
today we are considering legislation that will help turn the 
budget goals into a bottom line reality for the long term benefit 
of Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Just a week ago, the Minister of Finance and a few other 
ministers attended in Detroit the G-7 special Summit on 
unemployment. The G-7 members confirmed the view held by 
many that February's budget was exactly what Canada needed at 
this stage of its economic development. This budget promises 
no panacea. Instead, it restores confidence in our capacity to 
cope successfully with the economic, financial and social 
challenges we are facing.
<P>
	We will succeed because our budget proposes innovative 
measures taking effect immediately to deal with three major 
concerns raised by Canadians in our pre-budget consultations. 
It contains measures to ensure job creation and stimulate 
economic growth. It reduces expenditures and brings them 
under control to enable us to substantially lower the deficit. 
Finally, the budget is laying the groundwork of an 
unprecedented reform and renewal of our social security 
system.
<P>
	Each of these points is dealt with in one way or another in this 
bill before us in second reading. Together, these measures will 
help set the strong foundation on which the future of our country 
will be built.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I congratulate the Minister of Finance on the leadership that 
he has shown to Canadians in presenting this budget of which 
this bill is the obvious manifestation in legislative form. I 
congratulate him also on the consultation process that he 
engaged in that has resulted in a budget that is acceptable to so 
many Canadians.
<P>
	Before describing the specific measures in this legislation we 
should remember the broader budget context that the measures 
reflect. In the lead-up to the February budget the Minister of 
Finance and his colleagues, as I indicated, listened to what 
Canadians told them.
<P>
	Canadians wanted a government to set the stage for job 
creation and this government has done that. Canadians wanted 
action to restore our country's economic vitality. This budget 
does that.
<P>
	The government responded with such important measures as 
the $6 billion shared cost infrastructure program, the restoration 
of the residential rehabilitation program, new programs for 
apprenticeship and youth service and support for technological 
innovation and for the small business sector in particular.
<P>
	Canadians also told the government that they wanted to have 
the deficit reduced. They wanted to have the government stop 
pushing the tax burden constantly higher.
<P>
	The February budget makes fiscal responsibility part of a job 
strategy for Canadians. At the same time it recognizes that 
getting the deficit down is important. It also means that getting 
economic growth up is very important. Increasing economic 
growth will result in a decreased deficit and increased economic 
growth will lead to greater employment for Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	That is why this legislation contains key measures that will 
reduce the demands on the public purse and accordingly on the 
taxpayers' wallet. These are measures affecting Parliament, the 
public service, the private sector and Canadians in all regions of 
the country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2805"> 2805 </A></B>
<P>
	The measures in this legislation work to one clear goal. They 
will set us on the path to bring down the deficit to our interim 
target of 3 per cent of gross domestic product by 1996-97, as 
promised in the famous red book.
<P>
	I note that members of the opposition delight in quoting from 
the red book. I am delighted to see that they have taken the time 
to read and study that work because as my colleagues know it 
represents a blueprint for action. Although it is a red book it is a 
blueprint for action by our government and one that we as 
candidates in the last election were proud to support. It 
represented, in my view, the standard by which all other parties' 
programs were judged and Canadians expressed a clear 
preference for the blueprint in the red book.
<P>
	There should be no question about the government's ultimate 
objective, and that is to deliver a balanced budget. Equally 
important, over the next three years there will be $5 of spending 
cuts for every dollar of revenue increases on a net basis.
<P>
	Under our budget plan, gross fiscal savings including the 
savings announced in previous budgets and secured by this 
legislation total $28.6 billion over the next three fiscal years. 
Net savings in that period after taking into account the cost of 
new economy boosting initiatives total $20.4 billion.
<P>
	These measures will help shrink the deficit from $45.7 billion 
in the year just ending to $39.7 billion in 1994-95 and to $32.7 
billion in the year thereafter. The measures announced in the 
budget will be supplemented with further initiatives next year as 
we reform major spending programs. The government is taking 
action now and will take action in the future to ensure that the 
deficit continues to decline steeply.
<P>
	What I would like to do now, Mr. Speaker, is turn to the 
specific elements in the bill before us today.
<P>
	First, the bill proposes amendments to the Unemployment 
Insurance Act. In making these changes the government had two 
goals in mind. First, it wanted to provide a concrete incentive to 
the private sector to create jobs and, second, it wanted to begin 
to deal in a fair way with the serious problem of dependency that 
the unemployment insurance system has created for many 
Canadians.
<P>
	Payroll taxes are recognized as a significant barrier to job 
creation. To ease this burden the government will roll back the 
unemployment insurance premium rate for 1995 and 1996 to $3. 
As a result, by the end of 1996 the government expects there will 
be 40,000 more jobs in the economy than would be the case if the 
premiums were allowed to rise to $3.30. That is the level 
required by 1995 under existing legislation if the government 
takes no action.
<P>
	This rollback must be done in a way that supports deficit 
reduction. That is why this legislation proposes measures to 
reduce unemployment insurance expenditures by $725 million 
in 1994-95 and $2.4 billion annually thereafter.
<P>
	It must be stressed that we are taking these steps to encourage 
job creation while ensuring the financial integrity of the 
unemployment insurance program.
<P>
	Members of the House can also be assured that the 
unemployment insurance changes in no way prejudge the social 
security form process announced by the Minister of Human 
Resources Development. Indeed, many of the provinces have 
undertaken their own work in this regard and of course the 
federal government will continue to work closely with the 
provinces to ensure stability for Canadians.
<P>
	Second, the bill deals with the process of social security 
reform which will involve the federal government and the 10 
provinces and the two territories.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	The common goal of all will be to renew and revitalize 
Canada's social security system over the next two years. The 
government will preserve and protect those most in need in 
order to survive. The government will work to improve 
incentives for Canadians to work and the government will 
ensure that the social safety net remains affordable.
<P>
	To help create a positive, co-operative climate for this 
challenging task the government is providing a two-year period 
of predictability and modest growth in social security transfers 
under the Canada assistance plan and established programs 
financing.
<P>
	This means that in 1994-95 there will be no new restraint 
measures applied to either CAP or EPF transfers. The legislation 
before us today however will place a ceiling on subsequent CAP 
transfers to each province. As a result, these transfers will not 
exceed their 1994-95 levels. This ceiling will remain in place in 
1995-96 pending social security reform in 1996-97.
<P>
	Established programs financing transfers are not affected by 
this legislation. However existing restraints will be maintained. 
EPF will grow in line with the population in 1994-95 and then a 
GNP minus three percentage points for subsequent years.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The following part of this bill affects us all personally. It 
extends the present salary freeze for public servants, the Prime 
Minister, members of Parliament and senators, federal 
magistrates, the Canadian Armed Forces, the RCMP and other 
government workers for a two-year period. Also, pay 
increments will be suspended for two years.
<P>
	We recognize that this measure will have repercussions. Some 
391,000 people will be affected by this freeze. The need to take 
this action is explained by a simple inescapable reality: salary 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2806"> 2806 </A></B>
<P>
costs make up much of the government's operating budget. Any 
measure to control the deficit must take these costs into account.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Many public servants in my riding are affected by this freeze. 
Like them I feel the pinch the government has applied in making 
this applicable to all members and to all members of the public 
service. I do not think there is a member in this House who has 
not had some comment from a constituent about the freeze. It is 
regrettable but it is a necessary part of the government's fiscal 
program.
<P>
	Next, this bill provides for changes to regional transportation 
subsidies under the Atlantic Region Freight Assistance Act, the 
Maritime Freight Rates Act and the Western Grain 
Transportation Act. Some brief background perhaps would be 
helpful.
<P>
	Under the first two acts, government payments defray part of 
the cost of certain freight shipments in the four Atlantic 
provinces and the Gaspé region of Quebec. Payments to the 
railways under the third act help reduce the transportation costs 
paid by western grain producers.
<P>
	The budget proposed to reduce these subsidies by 5 per cent. 
This legislation takes that action. As well, it implements the 10 
per cent reduction announced by the previous government for 
1995-96 and subsequent years, a reduction not yet implemented 
in legislation.
<P>
	This saving is in keeping with the overall reduction being 
made in most federal grants and contributions. It is important to 
remember that during the pre-budget consultations a constantly 
repeated suggestion was to reduce subsidies to business. This 
measure honours that advice. The 5 per cent cut to these 
subsidies announced in the February budget will save in the 
order of $40 million annually.
<P>
	The bill also confirms a reduction in transfers under the 
Public Utilities Income Tax Transfer Act. These transfers return 
to provincial governments most of the federal business income 
tax paid by privately owned utilities.
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	In 1990 the federal budget established a ceiling on PUITTA 
transfers. Then in 1992 a 10 per cent reduction was imposed for 
1993-94 and 1994-95. This legislation confirms last year's 
budget announcement which extended both of these measures 
beyond 1994-95.
<P>
	Finally, this bill implements a measure to provide flexibility 
to the CBC. We propose to give the CBC authority to borrow up 
to $25 million subject to case by case approval by the Minister 
of Finance. As well the granting of this borrowing authority will 
be reviewed in two years' time.
<P>
	This borrowing authority will allow the corporation to operate 
more efficiently. It will give the CBC the flexibility to take 
advantage of investment opportunities that promise a healthy 
return. It supports the government's pledge to provide this 
important national institution with a more stable funding 
environment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, as you can see, the bill before us today is an 
essential element of this government's program to put 
Canadians back to work. This bill would ensure that our budget 
goals translate into concrete results. It is based on the advice we 
received from every region of the country. It outlines our overall 
socio-economic situation and meets the challenges facing us. In 
short, it proposes measures to create jobs and revive the 
economy, measures to reduce the deficit and bring the debt 
under control, and measures to overhaul and sustain a social 
safety net all Canadians are proud of.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	By taking this action this bill, as with the budget announced 
by the Minister of Finance, builds a solid foundation for 
success. It is one based on frugality, on fairness and on a clear 
focus on the future.
<P>
	With that in mind I urge all members of the House to join the 
Minister of Finance, his cabinet colleagues and members on this 
side of the House in supporting this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in one part of the hon. member's speech he specifically 
mentioned a freeze on the general percentage grid increase.
<P>
	There is a contract in place and the movement within the grid, 
the annual increments, should be honoured and the savings made 
elsewhere. We can support the broad general percentage 
increase. However we believe the increment freeze itself within 
that grid will increase disparities rather than relieve them. Will 
the hon. member comment more specifically on the rationale for 
the general freeze as well as for the freeze on the increments 
within a grid?
<P>
	This is particularly disturbing to the RCMP. I understand 
there was a meeting in Surrey, British Columbia of over 800 
members of the RCMP. They were very upset that promises were 
being broken. Certainly within its structure the RCMP is given a 
budget and rules to live by and therefore cannot do much about 
it.
<P>
	We are saying that the breaking of a promise or a contract to 
honour the increments within an overall framework needs to be 
addressed even though we agree with the broad approach of a 
spending freeze.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am surprised to hear my 
colleague from the Reform Party talk about the virtues of 
undoing any of the freezes the government has put in place, 
given that party's obsession with deficit reduction.
<P>
	The government chose the freeze as the method of dealing 
with this problem. It was not because it was going to be a 
popular method or an easy sell to the public servants, the 
members and the senators who are affected by the freeze. The 
government chose this option because it was very concerned if it 
did something else, it would result in substantial layoffs in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2807"> 2807 </A></B>
<P>
public service. We have witnessed that in the provinces, 
particularly in Ontario  where there was a social contract put in 
place with rather disastrous consequences.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	The purpose of the government in choosing this particular 
option was to ensure that as many members of the public service 
as possible could retain their jobs. In spite of the significant 
cutbacks in funding that are available for all manner of 
government programs, by freezing we have avoided the 
necessity to eliminate jobs while others get an increase.
<P>
	Even if the increments could be allowed to employees, as I am 
sure the government would like to do, that would result in an 
increased salary cost to the Government of Canada. That would 
have to be met out of the existing budget. Since the government 
has no additional funding to give to government departments for 
this purpose the only solution to capping the total salary cost 
would be to eliminate someone else's job. That is why there is a 
freeze on the increments and that is why there is a freeze on 
salary increases.
<P>
	I do not think it is popular. I do not think it is the greatest thing 
by any means. However it is the best thing the government could 
come up with given the financial circumstances we are facing.
<P>
	I know the hon. member and his party are very supportive of 
government cutbacks and government freezes. I am delighted to 
know he will be supporting this part of the bill.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to follow up on the point my hon. 
colleague raised. Our party has very little problem with freezing 
salaries. However when we start talking about freezing 
increments it goes a little bit further.
<P>
	With the RCMP constables the government is cutting into 
what was considered training advancement through an 
incremental process.
<P>
	British Columbia has the largest number of RCMP. It is the 
largest division in the country. There are over 700 constables in 
the E division. A large part of the cost the member is talking 
about controlling is municipal. It is through the municipal 
taxpayers.
<P>
	In the Surrey detachment 90 per cent is picked up by the 
municipality. Provincially, 70 per cent is picked up by the 
province. When the hon. member starts talking about saving real 
dollars for the federal government he is talking about minimal 
savings on the backs of low paid constables who are in training.
<P>
	The Reform Party certainly supports the concept of freezing 
salaries. However it does not support freezing increments which 
are based on training that are part of an ongoing contract with 
these individuals and should not have been put into a collective 
package.
<P>
	I do not think the government can make those kinds of 
decisions without looking at individual circumstances in 
different programs that fall outside the normal salary range. I 
would like the minister to give this further consideration.
<P>
	Morale in the RCMP is at an all time low. There was a meeting 
of 800 members of the RCMP in my constituency last night. The 
deputy commissioner made the statement: ``It would be futile 
for me to say that there is not a morale problem in terms of this 
incremental freeze''. Would the hon. member please respond to 
this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am surprised to hear this from 
the hon. member for Surrey-White Rock-South Langley 
because she is a member of a party that keeps telling us there is 
only one taxpayer. It does not matter two hoots if the federal 
government raises the salary costs for these people but then 
recoups 90 per cent of the cost from her municipality which 
taxpayer is paying. It is the same taxpayer that is going to pay 
that cost. It is just that instead of the federal government paying 
it, the municipality or the province in which she resides is going 
to pick up the tab.
<P>
	She nods her head that that is okay. Yet the other members of 
her party, and I am sure she has been part of this, keep telling us 
there is only one taxpayer and we have to cut costs. When we do 
it I am surprised we face criticism from the Reform Party on this 
matter.
<P>
	Let me turn to the essentials of the question. She says it would 
not cost the federal government anything to allow the 
increments to go into place for a group of RCMP officers in the 
province of British Columbia. I do not know for certain but I 
would bet any money that the rates are the same across the 
country. If the federal government is to give that kind of 
increase in British Columbia, it will have to give it in other parts 
of Canada too. It will have to give it in parts of Canada where it 
does not receive a subsidy from a province for operating a police 
force such as all RCMP forces in Ontario and in Quebec. While 
there may be fewer, the cost would still be significant for the 
federal government.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	Surely the hon. member agrees with me when I tell her that it 
would be unfair to give the increase in the provinces where the 
federal government picks up only a part of the share and not give 
it in the provinces where it is paying the full shot. I think she 
would agree with that. She must recognize the wisdom of the 
government's decision in this matter, given the regrettable 
circumstance that led to it, the very substantial deficit that her 
party said it would eliminate in three years.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2808"> 2808 </A></B>
<P>
	The next time she asks a question, I ask her to tell us where 
she was going to make the cuts to eliminate the deficit in three 
years. She would not have only frozen the increments. She 
would have slashed the wages of these people and she knows 
it. She would face much tougher criticism then.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I have a short comment to make. The member opposite knows 
well where the Reform Party would makes its cuts because they 
were well publicized.
<P>
	Would the minister be prepared to amend the bill so that the 
increments were paid if the Reform Party showed him how to 
save $2 for every $1 it costs without causing any job loss?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party likes to talk 
about its steps to reduction plan. As I read the figures, it 
announced an $18 billion reduction in government expenditures 
and said that $18 billion would bring the deficit to zero in three 
years.
<P>
	The deficit we now know is something like $45 billion or $47 
billion. Whatever it is this year it is a very substantial figure, 
and $18 billion off that takes it down to about $28 billion. Where 
would the other $28 billion come from? That figure was a fraud. 
The whole paper put forward by the Reform Party during the 
election was a complete fraud. I invite hon. members to tell us 
the truth. Where was the $45 billion coming from? That is what 
the deficit is. We have never heard that figure from anybody in 
the Reform Party and we never will.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There are about three minutes left to be 
divided between the two members.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Mr. Speaker, it will not even take me that long to 
expose the hoax of the question he posed.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary knows well that much of the 
reduction was coming through a growth in the economic 
situation in the country. Using a figure lower than the one 
proposed by the finance minister at that time, using a figure that 
was compatible with the one that the Liberal government is 
using right now, it was based on a real deficit, not one that was 
propped with non-recurring factors added to the budget to make 
it look worse than it really was.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member can argue that if 
he wishes. I will go back to Mr. Mazankowski's budget deficit 
figure last year which I think was $35 billion, if I am not 
mistaken. If the hon. member subtracts $18 billion from $35 
billion, my arithmetic takes it down to about $17 billion. Where 
were the other $17 billion in cuts? The question is the same. It is 
only a matter of the amount. However $17 billion is $17 billion. 
Maybe it should have been $25 billion, I will not argue that. I 
still ask: Where are the other $17 billion in cuts?
<P>
	The Reform Party had no idea where those cuts would come 
from. It still has no idea where those cuts would come from. We 
will never hear from them as to where those cuts would come 
from because I predict that when the time comes for the Reform 
Party to tell us those figures it will be a dead duck.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Resuming debate. I should perhaps tell 
the hon. member for Lévis we have about ten minutes of debate 
left.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will do my best in 
ten minutes.
<P>
	Bill C-17, an Act to implement certain provisions of the 
budget, reveals this government's true identity. Liberal 
government members succeeded in getting elected by 
denouncing the unfair policies of the Conservative government 
which widened the gap between rich and poor, as well as the gap 
between anglophones and francophones. A study released this 
week showed this to be the case everywhere, except in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	However, once again we see today how the public's hopes for 
justice, dignity and equity have been blithely crushed by 
politicians who, when in opposition, denounced others for doing 
exactly what they are now guilty of.
<P>
	Once again, the government is attacking the least fortunate in 
society. A recent analysis carried out by three experts from the 
economics department at the University of Quebec at Montreal 
showed that 60 per cent of the cuts to the federal deficit 
announced in this budget will be borne by Canada's 
unemployed. This is totally unfair since the government will be 
forcing the least fortunate to bear a bigger share of the burden of 
putting the nation's finances in order.
<P>
	Lowering the number of weeks of benefit entitlement while at 
the same time increasing the number of weeks of work needed 
for benefit entitlement does nothing to address the problem of 
those who defraud or take advantage of the system. What this 
measure does above all is attack the vast majority of 
unemployed workers who have lost their jobs through no fault of 
their own and who must now face increasingly harsh economic 
conditions.
<P>
	This unravelling of the social safety net on which workers 
depend will also affect regions and provinces already hard hit by 
the recession. By taking this action, the Minister of Finance is 
getting the provinces to foot the bill by forcing the unemployed 
onto social assistance sooner than necessary.
<P>
	According to the figures provided by the Department of 
Human Resources, the federal cutbacks mean that the 
Government of Quebec will have to spend an additional $65 
million to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2809"> 2809 </A></B>
<P>
$135 million on social assistance. Benefits  paid to Quebec's 
unemployed in 1994-95 will be cut by a total of $735 million.
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Minister of Finance still claims to promote 
job creation. How can he indulge such fantasies when he is about 
to take more money out of the pockets of a large group of 
consumers in this country, the unemployed?
<P>
	Although it makes no sense at all, the Liberal government 
continues to apply the same policy as the Conservatives, in other 
words, it prefers to attack the unemployed instead of creating 
jobs. So far, the present and previous governments' mindless 
cuts in unemployment insurance have produced very 
unsatisfactory results. In 1989, 1 million Canadians were 
unemployed. In 1993, there were 1.6 million, an increase of 60 
per cent.
<P>
	On the subject of job creation, I think we must realize it will 
take more than a good old fashioned infrastructures program to 
improve the employment situation. Although this program 
invests federal funds, it also involves additional expenditures by 
the provinces and municipalities. In most cases, this money will 
have to be borrowed, which means additional debt.
<P>
	In this scenario, I think reducing the number of insurable 
weeks will have no effect at all. In fact, this reduction will come 
down harder on regions and provinces where the unemployment 
rate is high, in other words, Quebec and the Maritime provinces. 
This measure will affect six regions out of thirteen in Quebec 
and seven out of thirteen in the Maritimes. The proposed 
amendments will not only affect whole regions, they will also 
have a devastating effect on the most vulnerable people in this 
group, and I am referring to claimants who work only for short 
periods. Unfortunately, the majority of workers in this category 
are young people.
<P>
	In Quebec, youth unemployment is around 20 per cent, 
involving about 137,000 unemployed in this age group. The real 
problem, in their case and in the case of other labour market 
``rejects'' is not that they have no incentive to work because 
unemployment benefits are too generous, but that there are no 
jobs available.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	Here we have a perfect example of a government saying one 
thing and doing another. On the one hand, we have the 
government stating in its official discourse that the gap between 
the poor and the rich must be bridged and, on the other hand, 
implementing measures which shamelessly make the less 
fortunate bear the brunt of the federal deficit.
<P>
	It is more obvious than ever today that this ship is sinking. 
Constant infringment upon provincial jurisdictions, particularly 
with respect to job training, has led the federal system to the 
brink of bankruptcy. And now the supporters of this system want 
the most vulnerable segment of our society to bear the brunt of a 
misguided policy of infringement, which prompts more and 
more Quebecers to say it may be high time we get out of that 
system.
<P>
	It has become nothing more than a vast and expensive smoke 
screen for the financial abyss the Liberal government is leading 
us to. Much would need to be done in terms of administrative 
management and even about the way ministers carry out their 
duties.
<P>
	As reported last Saturday in <I>Le Soleil</I>, following the Minister 
of Intergovernmental Affairs' example, the Minister of Human 
Resources Development also used a government jet, at a cost 
estimated, using the Auditor General's method of calculation, at 
$117,900, to go and talk about cuts in compensation to 
fishermen in Quebec and the Maritimes.
<P>
	The minister has a lot of nerve to try to make the people of 
Quebec and Canada believe that they are going to be consulted 
concerning social programs reform. This is the kind of 
consultation I do not hesitate to call a sham because the minister 
did not even wait for the report to be tabled, which it was today, 
to start making cuts in the unemployment insurance system.
<P>
	As we speak, the Standing Committee on Human Resources 
Development is releasing its report on the first phase of the 
consultations it has held on social programs. But by proposing, 
as it did, the adoption of Bill C-17, which deals mainly with cuts 
to the unemployment insurance system, that is to say one of the 
most important elements of our social programs, the 
government is actually going ahead and making cuts in that area 
without even waiting for the report from its own committee. 
What message is it looking to send to the public for the second 
phase of the consultation process?
<P>
	The minister did not wait either for the rapport of a study 
group which held similar consultations in all provinces at the 
same time as the committee. I myself attended last Tuesday in 
Montreal a meeting organized for community organizations by 
the coalition of organizations for the development of 
employability, acting under a mandate only three weeks old.
<P>
	Most of the organizations said that the time is too short; they 
did not have time to prepare, but were coming anyway; they 
have experiences to share; they will tell you what they think of 
it; employment should be the priority; maintain the level of 
social programs. But we did not expect this: the government 
consults but meanwhile takes measures attacking the most 
disadvantaged.
<P>
	The second phase of consultations is approaching. I am a 
member of the human resources committee; the report is to 
come out in September. I think that it would have been wise 
under the circumstances-with a less improvised, less rushed 
consultation, with more serious briefs presented, further to the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2810"> 2810 </A></B>
<P>
options announced by the minister himself-to wait for the 
report from this consultation before passing Bill C-17.
<P>
	No, when it comes to attacking the poorest people in our 
society, the Liberal government is in a hurry. To help those who 
need jobs, they propose measures and studies and suggest that 
those people wait for the result of these studies. They say one 
thing about jobs and another about cuts.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="AUDITORGENERALACT">AUDITOR GENERAL ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Robert Gauthier (Ottawa-Vanier)</B> moved that 
Bill C-207, an act to amend the Auditor General Act, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, today I have the honour to introduce 
Bill C-207 and to recommend that it be passed.
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is to amend the Auditor General Act, 
in order to allow the Auditor General to report to the House upon 
completion of his report or as he deems necessary.
<P>
	I am the adoptive sponsor of this legislation, since many other 
members of this House have thought of this initiative. As well, 
former colleagues in previous Parliaments have tried to have 
such a measure passed under circumstances which may have 
been different from those prevailing today.
<P>
	This private member's bill was approved by nearly all of the 
Public Accounts Committee chairpersons of the last 15 or 16 
years. The bill is also based on several recommendations from 
the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, the Standing 
Senate Committee on National Finance, and others. I am pleased 
to say that the Auditor General of Canada, Mr. Desautels, also 
gave me his support in a three-page letter which he sent to me 
last March 22, and which I will be glad to show to hon. members 
if they wish to take a look at it.
<P>
	The Auditor General of Canada is a senior civil servant of the 
Parliament of Canada; he is an official of this House. This is a 
very important position. That person has the responsibility of 
reviewing expenditures authorized by the House, and must tell 
us if these expenditures are done in an efficient and effective 
manner, and if they meet the objectives.
<P>
	So, the Auditor General's report, which is currently tabled 
annually-members are familiar with this thick document 
containing about 750 pages-is very important, since it allows 
us to evaluate the government's business and strategic 
management. This report provides essential data to help 
parliamentarians and government to better evaluate the 
relevancy of a program, and to correct within a reasonable delay 
administrative practices which are not sound.
<P>
	At present, the Auditor General must table his report on or 
before December 31, in the year to which the report relates. Yet, 
the evaluation included in the report covers the fiscal year 
ending on March 31 of the previous year. Since the evaluation of 
a department or an agency can take up to two years, this means 
that the information contained in the Auditor General's annual 
report is sometimes more than three years old. This, in my 
opinion, hinders the efforts of the House to make the 
government and its management accountable to Canadians. The 
information is often not up to date and even less relevant.
<P>
	Indeed, sometimes, after so many years, managers 
responsible for the activities scrutinized have been transferred, 
or the incumbent at the time the Public Accounts Committee 
conducts its review has no idea of what happened, or was not 
there at the time, or does not care about what happened or what 
was reviewed by the Auditor General.
<P>
	Of course, a department's management team may have 
changed since the evaluation was done, since the department is 
informed during the evaluation conducted by the Auditor 
General. In fact, it even participates in the exercise and it is 
invited by the Auditor General to submit reasons explaining the 
situation which will be exposed in the annual report.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	Generally speaking, however, it is only after the Auditor 
General of Canada has tabled his report in the House that we 
parliamentarians are informed that departments or agencies are 
under pressure to make the necessary changes to these bad 
administrative practices.
<P>
	Delays cost taxpayers billions of dollars. I will give you just a 
few of many examples. In his assessment of programs for 
seniors, as described in chapter 18 of his last report, the Auditor 
General of Canada observed significant deficiencies in the 
management of the Canada Pension Plan program. For instance, 
pensions were paid to deceased beneficiaries. Systems and 
procedures were inadequate to identify, control and collect these 
overpayments.
<P>
	According to the Auditor General, overpayments range from 
$120 million to $220 million. If the act had allowed him to, the 
Auditor General could have tabled his report four months 
earlier, thus helping to save a large part of the hundreds of 
millions of dollars lost.
<P>
	The dividends paid to Canadian companies by foreign 
affiliates have deprived the government of hundreds of millions 
of dollars in revenues. I am not exaggerating, as close to $400 
million have been lost.
<P>
	Before the 1993 general election was called, the Committee 
on Public Accounts tabled a substantive report proposing 
measures to correct these practices costing money to the 
government. In the time available between the audit and the 
tabling of the report, the committee would have been able to ask 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2811"> 2811 </A></B>
<P>
Department of Finance, before the election, to submit its 
response to  Parliament within the 150 days provided for in the 
Regulations for tabling a departmental response to a 
parliamentary committee.
<P>
	The delay is frustrating for the members of the Committee on 
Public Accounts who worked hard to try to correct a situation 
that is very costly for the government. If we go back ten years, 
many of you will remember the scientific research tax credit, 
which cost the government some $2 billion over ten months.
<P>
	In 1985, the Committee on Public Accounts sharply criticized 
the Auditor General of Canada for not bringing earlier before 
Parliament the results of his audit. But the act forbids him to do 
so. He may table only one report annually. That is where my bill 
comes in. I want to change this situation. Had he informed 
Parliament seven months earlier, the Auditor General might 
have allowed us to save over $1 billion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In his last report the Auditor General of Canada devoted an 
important chapter, chapter 22, to airport transfers. The auditor 
might have easily presented his report in May or June 1993 when 
his evaluation was terminated. If so, the report could have had a 
great influence on the Pearson airport transaction, for example. 
Unfortunately the auditor's report was tabled after the event.
<P>
	Chapter 15 in the same report indicated that $587 million was 
spent by the government on the northern cod adjustment and 
recovery program without clear legislative authority. The 
Auditor General of Canada raised grave doubts regarding some 
of the hurried allowances given to those ineligible persons who 
ought not to have benefited from that program. The auditor 
might have tabled his report in March of last year rather than 
wait for December thereby again saving Canadians millions of 
dollars.
<P>
	Particularly in this era of budgetary restraints it is imperative 
to improve governmental management practices. It is 
imperative for us to have better accountability for public funds. 
Moreover, I say that we in the Liberal Party said in our red book 
during the election that we would exercise unwavering 
discipline in controlling federal spending and would reorder 
current spending priorities to make sure that maximum return 
was obtained on each investment.
<P>
	I am of the opinion that punctual reporting by the auditor 
without being the only solution would give the Liberal 
government of today additional tools to allow cutting of waste 
while realizing valuable objectives. Therefore the adoption of 
my bill would constitute a step in the right direction.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	Some would suggest that punctual reporting, and I have heard 
it, would possibly reinforce or feed the media hype over this 
annual report. As we all know it gets the attention of the media 
for maybe two or three days a year, possibly a week sometimes, 
but no more. After that it pales into oblivion and the public 
accounts committee is asked to look into some things that 
sometimes date several years and sometimes are frustrating for 
us to examine because we know the press are not interested.
<P>
	Let us not kid ourselves. Some people want to eliminate 
waste. We as parliamentarians have an obligation to the people 
of Canada to do our best to try to meet that challenge. Canadians 
want to be assured that legislators have all the information to 
reduce wasteful spending in the government infrastructure.
<P>
	Moreover, the last annual report of the Auditor General for 
1992-93 contains 775 pages. As I said it is a huge volume. It is 
complicated. It is indeed technical sometimes and it is very 
important in my view. The report, in my experience having 
chaired the public accounts committee, is a source of invaluable 
information for members of Parliament who want to know how 
the government administers public funds.
<P>
	It brings forth information to improve the management of 
public funds. It would make us more efficient. It would make the 
government certainly more effective in trying to come to grips 
with the huge administration of some $160 billion a year.
<P>
	The public accounts committee, as we all know, has been a 
very non-partisan committee over the years. That is the way it 
should be. It should be able to plan and order its business in a 
more efficient and quicker way of doing business. It should be 
able to profit from the examples set in England, Australia, New 
Zealand and other parliamentary systems similar to ours where 
the study or the overview of public accounts is done on a more 
regular basis by Parliament.
<P>
	I would be astonished, for example in my riding of 
Ottawa-Vanier, if a business person or somebody said to me 
that he had to wait a year and a half before knowing if he made a 
profit and that he had to wait another two years to figure out 
which corrective he had to use to reduce the losses. Nobody 
could operate a business that way. The government should not 
do it that way either. I would hope the House would see fit to 
support the bill which only presents a small amendment but in 
my view a very important change to the way we do business.
<P>
	I mentioned at the beginning of my speech it is useful to note 
that the Auditor General wrote to me on March 22, 1994. I want 
to read into the record one paragraph of that letter if I have time:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2812"> 2812 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This office would benefit from efficiency improvements resulting from completing 
work in progress rather than having to put it aside and then pick it up again at the time of 
tabling of the annual report. This disruptive effect of the annual report tabling on the 
smooth and orderly flow of work through this office cannot be overemphasized.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Underlying this Mr. Desautels said: ``Ultimately the 
taxpayers of Canada will be the main beneficiaries''. Earlier 
reporting of audit results will lead to faster correction of 
problems. In my view this means greater savings for Canadians, 
reduced risk, better management and generally better 
government.
<P>
	Therefore for these reasons I ask the House, in a spirit of 
better accountability to Canadians, in a free and open spirit, to 
assure the passage of the bill. By the way I am proud to say I 
have the support of many members of Parliament. I have at least 
70 letters of support for this bill from this House. I am very 
proud of that. I think it is a good sign. It is a hopeful sign.
<P>
<B>(1400) </B>
<P>
	I hope the bureaucracy does not meddle in this issue, that it 
stays out of this debate and does not start trying to prevent this 
from happening. It did it before. I hope this time we 
parliamentarians keep our minds open, that we do it with an 
open and free will. Let us not have the bureaucracy tell us what 
we should be doing in this House.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Does the hon. member for 
Ottawa-Vanier wish the unanimous consent of the House to 
table the document? He did not move it at the end. I do not know 
whether he wants to or not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier (Ottawa-Vanier):</B> I would ask, Mr. Speaker, 
that this letter be tabled. I think it is an important letter and it 
should be appended to today's minutes.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: See Appendix.</I>]
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let me begin by thanking my hon. colleague from 
Ottawa-Vanier for introducing Bill C-207. He explained very 
well the overall nature of the bill which is aimed at giving the 
Auditor General of Canada a little more room to manoeuvre so 
as to allow him to present the information the House truly 
requires as quickly as possible. The hon. member gave a good 
account of several great examples of totally outrageous 
spending. We had heard of these expenditures. He pointed out 
that the Auditor General's report was enormously useful to 
members, and I cannot disagree with this statement.
<P>
	However, I would like to say that this report should also be 
useful to the people. The public can obtain copies of the report 
from the Auditor General of Canada. The published report is 
available free of charge. Many citizens would do well to read it. 
The Auditor General's Office will be happy to send them a copy 
if they request one.
<P>
	To all those who are listening to us at this moment, let me say 
that the role of the Auditor General of Canada is to act as the 
government watchdog in matters of national finance. Each year, 
the Auditor General inspects a portion of the government's 
books and each year, as my colleague from Ottawa-Vanier 
said, he releases a report anywhere from 600 to 700 pages long 
describing some administrative horrors of which the 
government is guilty.
<P>
	Very often, and that is something that my colleague also 
stressed, the media jump on this report and it makes headlines 
for two or three days, a week at best, and then it is shelved. I 
believe my colleague was right to mention it.
<P>
	Naturally, the Bloc Quebecois will support this bill, but I must 
say that ever since we arrived here, we have asked for something 
much larger than this. We believe that the role of the Auditor 
General is not wide enough. We have been asking the 
government to open its books to the public, so it can review, item 
by item, all government spending, including fiscal spending. By 
the way, we know that fiscal spending is beyond the reach of the 
Auditor General, he is not suppose to review that, it is nor part of 
his mandate, and I talked about that with Mr. Desautels during a 
meeting we had with him.
<P>
	For those who would like to know what fiscal spending is, I 
recommend a book published in Toronto I believe, a couple of 
year ago. It is called<I> The Lion's Share</I>, by Linda McQuaig, and it 
describes how people who control Canadian fiscal policy could 
grab it for their own profit.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the way things are now, I believe that 
government operations are not fully transparent since some 
elements which should be audited are not accessible to the 
Auditor General of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1405) </B>
<P>
	That is the case for tax expenditures; that is also the case for 
family trusts, which the government does not want to touch. We 
do not know how much money there is in these at the present 
time. There were also other examples, such as Ginn Publishing, 
things that remain secret, but that should be known in the House.
<P>
	There should not be secret relationships between secret 
people on secret decisions. What is going on in the government 
should be known here, in the House, so that we could take good 
decisions on the matter.
<P>
	Unfortunately, that is why we got the budget that we did. If we 
look at that budget, and that was still evident in the media today, 
the government is directly attacking the unemployed. In that 
budget, it is the unemployed and the old people who will be hurt. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2813"> 2813 </A></B>
<P>
Unfortunately, in the meantime, the budget does not talk about 
the billions of  dollars in waste noted by the Auditor General of 
Canada. It does not talk either about solving the issue of 
program overlappings. It does not talk about eliminating family 
trusts or at least taking a look at what is going on there. The 
Auditor General should be the one examining that.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the budget does not talk about that or about the 
more than 90,000 profitable companies that presently do not pay 
any taxes in Canada, while in the United States, which is 
certainly not a communist country, all profitable companies 
must pay a minimal tax.
<P>
	In general, we are not satisfied with the way the current 
government is fulfilling its task of managing public funds. 
Canadians will not be either. Let us just think about the kind of 
reception the Prime Minister got during his recent visit to his 
riding. The same is true about the welcome they gave the 
Minister of Transport. I am not talking here about members of 
Parliament, but about people who experience problems which 
the government has the power to solve.
<P>
	Unfortunately, I think this dissatisfaction is bound to increase 
because the measures implemented by the government affect the 
poorest among the have-nots while we know that public funds 
management could improve if they would only follow up on 
reports like the one by the Auditor General and give him more 
authority to push his analyses further.
<P>
	However, I must stress the fact that the present bill does give 
more authority to the Auditor General. On the whole, this bill 
provides for better management and that is why the Bloc 
Quebecois will support it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to stand in this House 
today and support the private member's bill of my hon. 
colleague for Ottawa-Vanier.
<P>
	Our party, as members know, is very supportive of increasing 
the reporting opportunities of the Auditor General to this House. 
We sponsored a supply motion in the early stages of this 
Parliament that tried to set up a procedure for the Auditor 
General to be able to make reports more often on a regular basis 
to this House rather than just once a year giving his annual 
report.
<P>
	This bill, as mentioned by the hon. member for 
Ottawa-Vanier, has been introduced at various times or 
something like it has been introduced various times in this 
House, in 1985 and 1988 just to mention a couple of occasions. 
It is the feeling that this is a step in the right direction but not 
necessarily the only step that should be taken. However, it would 
start to solve some of the concern that with a yearly report is 
more than often after the fact.
<P>
	It has been brought to the attention of the House that the 
public accounts committee holds hearings on chapters of the 
Auditor General's report which deal with government waste and 
mismanagement. It seeks to ensure that Canadians receive value 
for their tax dollars.
<P>
	Due to the fact that the Auditor General's report is only tabled 
once a year, the committee is often dealing with problems that 
are more than a year old and any remedial action that should be 
taken is unnecessarily delayed.
<P>
	We feel that this private members' bill C-207, that is 
sponsored by a former chairman of the public accounts 
committee, would allow the public accounts committee to deal 
with reported cases of fiscal mismanagement in a more timely 
manner than currently exists.
<P>
<B>(1410 ) </B>
<P>
	That certainly is a very positive step. We feel that it would 
allow the committee to report to the House what remedial action 
could be taken more expeditiously since it would be able to hold 
hearings more expeditiously. We feel that is a very good step in 
the right direction. We feel it would contribute to an improved 
process to correct government mismanagement.
<P>
	We like to think that if the government is truly concerned 
about using taxpayers' dollars wisely that it will endorse this 
completion date reporting as suggested in Bill C-207.
<P>
	We feel that taxpayers are entitled to receive value for their 
money and when they do not, such as when the Auditor General 
reports cases of mismanagement, taxpayers are entitled to have 
the problem rectified as quickly as possible, not once a year or 
after the fact.
<P>
	In conclusion, this idea has been supported by former NDP 
and PC members in this House and endorsed by public accounts 
committees and the office of the Auditor General. The Reform 
caucus now has the pleasure to endorse it.
<P>
	We feel that the member for Ottawa-Vanier, a Liberal MP 
and former chair of the public accounts committee, should be 
supported in this private member's bill.
<P>
	I urge all members of this House to give their support so that 
this can be referred to the public accounts committee after 
second reading.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I too am delighted to rise in this House and give support 
to this initiative.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I want to congratulate my colleague on taking this initiative 
and I will tell you why. For me, the key point is that information 
could be available when needed and before changes are made.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2814"> 2814 </A></B>
<P>
	When you look at the size of the government machine, which 
is massive, it seems to me that, when there is a problem, it is 
absolutely essential to be aware of it as soon as possible and 
take corrective measures, so that we can still meet our 
objectives. This is in keeping with other objectives set by the 
Liberal Party of Canada which wants government's operations 
to be much more open than in previous years. We want to 
improve our cost-effectiveness.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This bill at least in principle, and one might want to quibble 
with the niceties and the details and what have you which I will 
leave to parliamentarians to do, not only reaches a prime 
objective of providing information when we need it so that we 
can take corrective action, but permits us to conduct a more open 
and more transparent type of government which is one of the 
goals of this party and this government and to improve our 
accountability. For me that is of critical importance.
<P>
	It is important, certainly for me, that the Auditor General play 
a critical role in the efficient management of government. 
Obviously it is not the Auditor General himself with his team 
but certainly the Auditor General and that team are major 
players working with government in trying to make it more 
efficient and trying to make absolutely certain that we spend 
taxpayers' money as wisely as we can.
<P>
	I applaud not only this Auditor General but Auditor Generals 
in the past for their efforts in that area.
<P>
	Just the other day in the operations committee, a statutory 
committee of the House of Commons of which I am a member, I 
chatted with the Auditor General and his team about a number of 
important concepts such as Renouveau 2000, of how we can in 
fact determine criteria for success when we look at the civil 
service and the operations of government, what measures other 
governments have undertaken to establish that and how we 
compare with other governments. We are going to have 
additional discussions.
<P>
	I want to underline the main point which is that the Auditor 
General, with the team available and the tools that are there, can 
help this government, its ministers, the members of Parliament 
of this government and whatever party to understand 
government better, to come forth with creative solutions to the 
problems we have and to put forth mechanisms that are going to 
help us reach the objectives that we think are valid for all 
Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1415 ) </B>
<P>
	While the Auditor General is obviously a critical component 
of government and has an important role to play, I want to 
remind members that we have many other sources of 
information.
<P>
	Personally I feel as a member of Parliament that the greatest 
benefit I have which is never mentioned is all the sources of 
information at my disposal. Unfortunately the one thing I do not 
have is the time to read all those sources of information. There 
are many and excellent.
<P>
	Let me mention just a few. For example, the Commissioner of 
Official Languages brings forward a report that is insightful and 
potentially very helpful, whatever our position happens to be on 
official languages. I think mine is fairly well known.
<P>
	There is a report as well from the Human Rights Commission 
which is extremely useful and insightful that I would 
recommend to all parliamentarians. There are reports from the 
Public Service Commission. Again they have much useful 
information.
<P>
	Some will know that many valuable reports on a wide range of 
public policy and management issues from Canadian and 
non-Canadian institutions are available to parliamentarians 
through the Library of Parliament. We must never forget the 
Library of Parliament is there to make those available to us.
<P>
	There are reports from the private sector think tanks or from 
international bodies such as the OECD while others are the 
works of academics, business, labour, professionals, 
associations or other interest groups. These are useful tools to 
inform us, to help us get to know government, our country 
better, to help us understand what the goals of a government 
might be and how we might reach those objectives.
<P>
	I want to say at this point how much I appreciate the 
contribution of the Library of Parliament itself. I have seldom 
found an institution that is as responsive as it has been to my 
needs. I use it a lot. It responds with a great deal of sensitivity. It 
responds rapidly and with excellent information that I have 
learned that I can trust. There are very few instances where I 
have not been very satisfied at the response to my request. I want 
to applaud all the men and women who work very hard for all of 
us.
<P>
	I want to mention another source of information that perhaps 
is overlooked on occasion. The Government of Canada has 
established from time to time royal commissions, various task 
forces to study in depth and report on issues which are important 
to the public policy agenda.
<P>
	Another source that is often forgotten is the Senate of Canada. 
It often produces superb reports that are extremely useful. For 
those members who have never had an opportunity to read them, 
I would suggest that they do so. In fact, if they did I warn them, 
and I can see the facial expressions of certain colleagues, their 
view of the Senate and senators might change. If members do 
not want their view of the Senate and senators to change then 
perhaps they should not read them. If members are interested in 
accurate information and insightful commentary I suggest that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2815"> 2815 </A></B>
<P>
they read them and decide for themselves. I would be delighted 
to chat with them about it if they want more information.
<P>
	As members know, a steady flow of reports come to us from 
the government departments, agencies and crown corporations 
on their activities, their accomplishments and their plans. I find 
them exceptionally useful as a member of Parliament, 
particularly those agencies and institutions that are of interest to 
me.
<P>
	Finally, I want to focus on the departmental program 
evaluation and internal audit programs. To my way of thinking, 
they have not received the visibility they deserve. Some will 
know I was a former deputy minister and had access to internal 
audit reports and to program audits. I found them extremely 
useful.
<P>
	During the course of the year, we had an opportunity to sit 
down and look at those with a team of colleagues and try to 
decide what it was that was working, what it was that was not 
working and what it was we could do to change our direction in 
order to meet not only financial obligations but others as well.
<P>
	I want to quote something useful with respect to the internal 
audit. By the way this comes from the Auditor General. It goes 
like this: ``The internal audit has the potential to contribute 
greatly to improving management practices. The government is 
looking to internal audit to play a vital role in providing 
assurance on management systems and practices and in 
addressing re-engineering productivity and government 
issues''.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	My view is, actually it is one that has been communicated by 
the Auditor General, that the internal audit has a tremendous 
potential to help us all manage government more effectively and 
to reach the targets that we have set for ourselves either as a 
government or collectively as parliamentarians.
<P>
	I want to point out as well that the program evaluation data 
has a lot of potential because it provides information and 
analysis for government managers on the results which 
government programs are producing. It finds innovative and 
less costly ways of serving Canadians. I think we have all talked 
about that.
<P>
	Apparently, this is something that should be noted because we 
are not often willing, I think we do not do it often enough-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. The time has expired.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to address the House on Bill C-207, an act to amend 
the Auditor General, proposed by the hon. member for 
Ottawa-Vanier.
<P>
	This bill will among other things allow the Auditor General to 
report to Parliament on various matters of interest throughout 
the course of a year. Under these proposals the Auditor General 
would have the opportunity to bring his reports to the attention 
of parliamentarians as his work on a particular audit is 
completed or he could report to Parliament at a time he judged 
appropriate on matters of urgency or pressing  importance. He 
would no longer be limited to one annual report.
<P>
	These are most interesting and constructive ideas. They are 
not new concepts. I know that the hon. member for 
Ottawa-Vanier proposed them in the previous government and 
I believe deserve thorough consideration.
<P>
	However as part of our study of these proposals I believe it is 
important to review carefully the existing system: what are its 
basic precepts, how is it working, does it allow the House to 
benefit to the fullest extent possible from the work of the 
Auditor General and his staff?
<P>
	First let us examine the current system and how it is 
functioning. Currently legislation requires the Auditor General 
to audit the accounts of Canada, including those related to the 
Consolidate Revenue Fund and to report annually to Parliament 
on his findings.
<P>
	This annual report relates to the publication every year of the 
public accounts. It facilitates consideration of these accounts by 
Parliament which of course also operates on an annual 
expenditure cycle. This procedure ensures regularity in the 
reporting process. It makes it possible to compare one year's 
performance with the next.
<P>
	Once tabled in the House the annual report is then examined in 
detail by the public accounts committee. This committee, 
chaired by a member of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition, looks 
closely at the issues raised each year by Mr. Desautels and his 
staff. The committee members look carefully at how 
government departments and agencies are running, respond to 
the Auditor General's suggestions for improvements, his 
request for information from Parliament and for the public.
<P>
	They call before them senior officials of government 
departments. When their work is complete the committee gives 
the government the benefit of its findings.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I agree with the member for Ottawa-Vanier who believes 
that the Auditor General's role and responsibilities are of a 
paramount importance for MPs and senators, for the 
government and the Canadian people. Moreover, I am convinced 
that the present system is a good one.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This year's report is a case in point. The Auditor General and 
his staff made a valuable contribution to a better understanding 
of the many complex issues faced by government. When this 
year's report was tabled in February it quickly became clear that 
the government shared many of the Auditor General's 
preoccupations. I am pleased to report that we have already 
acted on and publicly set out our plans for addressing many of 
the areas of concern that he highlighted: more information for 
Parliament 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2816"> 2816 </A></B>
<P>
and a more open budget process, a bigger role in policy making 
for members of the House.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	These are only some of our shared concerns. In addition, of 
course, we agreed on the need to review existing programs and 
policies to ensure they continue to meet the needs of Canadians.
<P>
	Specifically, the Auditor General has consistently advocated 
the need for better reporting of financial information for 
Parliament. This year was no exception. This year Mr. Desautels 
devoted an entire chapter of the report to his view that better 
information is required on the debt and deficit.
<P>
	To address this need the finance department has issued two 
publications that will help Canadians understand the debt and 
the deficit. A short booklet entitled ``Basic Facts on Spending'' 
summarizes spending as it is presented in the federal budget and 
public accounts. It will help Canadians better understand the 
federal government's budgetary spending. In addition, a longer 
background document called ``Federal Spending'' provides 
more detail.
<P>
	As a member of Parliament it is a matter of personal 
satisfaction for me that the public accounts for the year ending 
March 31, 1993 were accepted without reservation by the 
Auditor General.
<P>
	Their fundamental purpose is to provide information to 
Parliament and through Parliament to all Canadians. Their 
purpose is to facilitate understanding of the full nature and 
extent of the financial affairs and resources for which the 
government is responsible.
<P>
	It is the Auditor General's job to examine them. Last year the 
Auditor General said that in his view: ``The government's 
financial statements would be more understandable if they were 
presented in a comprehensive but succinct annual financial 
report''. What Mr. Desautels was calling for was a financial 
report similar to the annual reports published by corporations in 
the private sector. The government has done just that. To make 
the financial statements of the Government of Canada more 
understandable to the public we added a new section to the 1993 
public accounts.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	For the first time, we gave a summary of this year's economic 
developments, a review of our financial situation and a set of 
consolidated financial statements. The new graphs and 
organization charts present complex financial data in a way that 
is easy to understand.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In his remarks to the Canadian Club, Mr. Desautels 
specifically lauded the new section in the public accounts which 
he said included a number of indicators that should help 
Canadians gain a better appreciation of the government's 
financial condition. On the same occasion the Auditor General 
gave the government good marks for beginning the process of 
improving information about deficits and debt and for opening 
up the budget process.
<P>
	This government made great strides in opening the budget 
process through pre-budget consultations. The Minister of 
Finance met hundreds of Canadians and heard from them 
directly what they felt had to be done to turn the economy 
around and create jobs and to restore Canadians' faith in the 
future.
<P>
	In conclusion, I have emphasized the importance of the 
contribution the Auditor General makes to a better 
understanding of the issues facing the government. There is no 
doubt that the Auditor General's work is an important stimulus 
to constructive action.
<P>
	However would this stimulus be any greater if Mr. Desautels 
reported to Parliament several times a year? We have a system 
now that is working well to the benefit of all Canadians. Would 
we lose more in coherence, comparability and impact than we 
would gain? These questions deserve the most careful scrutiny.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Prince Albert-Churchill River):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to address the House on the 
frequency of reporting by the Auditor General. I would like to 
compliment the hon. member for Ottawa-Vanier for 
introducing this bill.
<P>
	All members of the House are aware of the valuable 
contribution the Auditor General makes every year in improving 
the way the government spends the taxpayers' money. All of us 
look forward as do the taxpayers and the media of this country to 
the annual fall ritual of the tabling of the Auditor General's 
report.
<P>
	The Auditor General as an institution in Canada dates back to 
before Confederation. There was a time in our land when every 
cheque issued by the government had to be pre-approved by the 
Auditor General.
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
	The role of the Auditor General has changed considerably 
since then, as has the way government works. Yet the Auditor 
General remains the independent watchdog for this House and 
for the taxpayer. The hon. member for Ottawa-Vanier is right 
in trying to make sure that the job is well done.
<P>
	We should keep in mind that the Auditor General does not act 
in isolation. His work supports and affects that of other 
institutions and mechanisms in place to guard over the 
management of government. The financial program 
management of depart-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2817"> 2817 </A></B>
<P>
ments is scrutinized by the Treasury Board secretariat, by 
internal auditors as well as evaluators who work in concert with 
the Auditor  General to provide an efficient and effective system 
of controls over the management of the public service.
<P>
	The Auditor General's present mandate and his general 
approach including the fact that he reports annually dates back 
to 1977 when the present Auditor General Act was passed by this 
House.
<P>
	Much of the preparatory work for that act was done by an 
independent review committee which examined the 
responsibilities, relationships and reporting procedures of the 
Auditor General's office. I should note that at that time the 
committee recommended that the Auditor General should report 
annually to this House and not periodically.
<P>
	It will soon be 20 years since that report was tabled in this 
House. The hon. member for Ottawa-Vanier is right to call for 
a review of the issue of frequency of reporting. However, I 
would like to take this opportunity to build on my colleague's 
efforts and suggest that as much has changed in those past 20 
years this House should take a broader look and look at other 
issues concerning the Auditor General's mandate and 
procedures which the passage of time now calls into question.
<P>
	This is a very different world from what it was in 1977. At that 
time the government was expanding and there were serious and 
legitimate concerns about the adequacy of existing financial and 
management controls. The then Auditor General, Mr. 
Macdonell, did us all a great service by bringing this to the 
attention of this House in no uncertain terms.
<P>
	Things are quite different today. The public service is no 
longer growing and the reduction in the operation budgets of 
departments is imposing a discipline of its own. Things have 
changed and it may be that the Auditor General's usefulness to 
this House is constrained not just by the annual reporting 
requirement but by other limitations as well.
<P>
	There are a number of areas I would like to recommend that 
this House explore as part of a review of the mandate and 
operational procedures of the Office of the Auditor General. For 
example, I note the hon. member who brought forward this bill 
expressed considerable concern during the recent hearings of 
the standing committee on external affairs of which he is the 
chairman about what role the Auditor General should have in 
commenting on government policy.
<P>
	If we look at the Auditor General Act we find that section 7 
sets out in detail the responsibilities of that office. Specifically 
it tells the Auditor General to report on instances of 
unauthorized spending, lack of due regard to economy and 
efficiency, and the lack of procedures to measure and report on 
the effectiveness of a program.
<P>
	It does not authorize the Auditor General to report directly on 
the effectiveness of programs but rather only on whether there 
are systems in place to measure and report on effectiveness. This 
is an issue which the Auditor General has struggled with for 
several years.
<P>
	If we look at his reports over the last 15 years it becomes 
evident that on some occasions the Auditor General decided that 
in the public interest it was necessary to go beyond a strict 
interpretation of his mandate and report on programs which he 
felt were ineffective.
<P>
	There are other issues which I am sure the Auditor General 
would like this House to review which are at least as important 
to the Auditor General as the frequency of reporting. They 
include for example the question of resources.
<P>
	In the late 1970s and early 1980s the Auditor General's 
resources grew faster than those of the government as a whole as 
it staffed up to meet its new mandate under the 1977 Auditor 
General Act. In 1977-78 the Auditor General's office spent 
about $20.5 million while its estimates for 1994-95 are for over 
$56 million.
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	If this House sees fit to change the reporting requirements of 
the Auditor General it should take the opportunity to examine 
whether such a change would affect the resources necessary to 
carry out this modified mandate.
<P>
	I do not think there is anybody in this House who would wish 
to increase the costs of the Auditor General's office. However 
perhaps changing the reporting mandate as proposed could 
actually reduce the budget of the Auditor General's office.
<P>
	At present over half the staff of the Auditor General is in the 
senior management category, a significantly greater proportion 
than in the rest of the public service. Part of the reason for this is 
having to staff up to meet the one annual deadline for all 
chapters of the report simultaneously. If the Auditor General 
were to go ahead with a format of periodic rather than annual 
reporting, would this enable him somehow to streamline his 
operations?
<P>
	Finally there is the issue of who audits the Auditor General. I 
know the Auditor General is concerned with retaining his 
independence. At the same time like any other public 
institution, he knows he must be accountable for the resources 
he consumes and the quality of his work. At present there is no 
mechanism by which the Auditor General is made to account in a 
detailed way for his operations.
<P>
	As you can see, Mr. Speaker, there are quite a number of 
issues waiting to be tackled if we are looking at the mandate of 
the Office of the Auditor General.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2818"> 2818 </A></B>
<P>
	It is in the best interests of this House and of the Canadian 
taxpayers to make sure the mandate and resources of the 
Auditor General are right for the job which we want him to 
carry out. In my opinion these issues are interrelated. I would 
prefer that this House deal with all of these issues as a package 
and not on a one by one basis.
<P>
	In conclusion I agree with the hon. member for 
Ottawa-Vanier that it is time to review how the Auditor 
General reports to this House. However we should look at all 
related issues and not just the frequency of reporting to make 
sure the Canadian taxpayer gets the most out of the work of the 
Office of the Auditor General at the lowest cost.
<P>
	Thanks to the member for Ottawa-Vanier for making this 
debate relevant to this House and bringing it forward so we can 
all do a better job for the taxpayers of this great nation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Lincoln):</B> Mr. Speaker, I speak with great 
pleasure on this bill to amend the Auditor General Act, 
introduced by the hon. member for Ottawa-Vanier.
<P>
	The issue of whether the Auditor General Act should be 
amended to allow the Auditor General to report the findings of 
his audits as often as he deems necessary or when he has 
completed each audit rather than just annually has been 
discussed in this House on many occasions over the last 10 
years.
<P>
	The hon. member for Ottawa-Vanier has been a long time 
supporter of this notion. His experience as a former chairman of 
the public accounts committee has undoubtedly given him good 
reason to propose such an amendment to such a significant piece 
of legislation. It is important that we have this debate today.
<P>
	As I understand it the primary reason for introducing such a 
change is to ensure that Parliament and the public accounts 
committee receive and have the opportunity to discuss the 
important findings of the Auditor General on a more timely 
basis. This implies that corrective action could be taken on a 
more timely basis and that Parliament would be in a better 
position to influence that action.
<P>
	I also understand this approach to reporting may lead to 
certain efficiencies within the Office of the Auditor General. 
These are admirable goals.
<P>
	I also note as has been argued that other countries such as the 
United Kingdom and the United States have a system of periodic 
reporting. This does not mean, however, that we should jump on 
the bandwagon without serious debate and consideration of the 
issues.
<P>
<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
	The United States of course has a system that is quite different 
from our own and even the United Kingdom has different needs 
and traditions.
<P>
	The issue of reporting was discussed fully when the Auditor 
General Act was first introduced in 1977. It was the considered 
opinion of the experts at that time that annual reporting best 
suited the needs of the Canadian Parliament. It was felt that 
annual reporting was appropriate because it relates to the annual 
issue of public accounts. It facilitates consideration by 
Parliament which operates on an annual expenditure cycle. It 
introduces a note of regularity into the report process and it 
makes it possible to compare from one year to the next.
<P>
	It is interesting to note also that the provinces have similar 
reporting requirements to those of our Auditor General. There 
must be some reason why, although there seems to have been 
general consensus in previous debates on the purposes of these 
proposed amendments, no government to date has taken action 
to amend the act.
<P>
	There are several possibilities for this lack of action. One 
reason may be that the Auditor General already has the authority 
to make special reports to Parliament. Section 8 of the current 
act allows him to make a special report to the House of 
Commons on any matter of pressing importance or urgency that 
in his opinion should not be deferred until the presentation of his 
annual report. This provision ensures that Parliament can be 
informed of major issues as determined by the Auditor General 
on a timely basis.
<P>
	Another reason may be that there was concern that allowing 
the Auditor General to report more often during the year would 
lead to a loss of focus by both parliamentarians and Canadians at 
large on the results of the Auditor General's work.
<P>
	The annual focus on the Auditor General's report is most 
important. As we well know, it is this attention, this potential to 
effect change through public scrutiny, that makes the work of 
the Auditor General so valuable.
<P>
	I think, however, that the real issue here is what would be the 
impact of the proposed changes on the independence of the 
Auditor General. We would not want to support changes that 
would in any way put at risk the effectiveness of the Auditor 
General. I am sure the hon. member for Ottawa-Vanier 
concurs.
<P>
	The Auditor General is held in such high esteem by 
parliamentarians and Canadians and his findings are given such 
credence primarily because he is seen as being independent 
from government and above the politics of Parliament.
<P>
	If the Auditor General were put in the position of bearing the 
sole responsibility for choosing the timing of his reports, as 
suggested by this bill, he might be faced with the dilemma of 
presenting a report on a subject currently being hotly debated in 
the House. There is real risk that one or the other side of this 
House would perceive that as being in some way partisan.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2819"> 2819 </A></B>
<P>
	Just one ill-considered accusation by a member of this House 
or by the media could affect the non-partisan image that all 
Canadians have of the Auditor General. It would therefore be 
regrettable if the timing of the tabling of individual reports 
were to become yet another concern for the Auditor General's 
busy office.
<P>
	There was further concern. Under the present system the 
Auditor General is free to choose the areas and issues he wishes 
to audit and report on. The office of the Auditor General has a 
very considered planning process that has served us well. Of 
course, when choosing he takes into consideration the concerns 
of parliamentarians and Canadians. If, however, he reports more 
frequently he may be put under increasing pressure by 
parliamentarians, committees, the government and the media to 
address hot topics of the day.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, the general accounting office in the 
United States does issue its reports-

<P>
Dear Mr. Gauthier
<P>
I was pleased to learn that your Private Members' Bill C-207 to amend the Auditor General Act had been selected for consideration 
by the House and that it has been declared a votable Item.  As you well know, my Office wholeheartedly supports this adjustment to 
our enabling legislation which would allow us to report our audits on a more timely basis.
<P>
The purpose of this letter is to reaffirm for you the major reasons why we feel the change proposed in your Bill would operate to the 
advantage of all parties affected including government, Parliament, this office and the taxpayers of Canada.
<P>
First, Parliament, including the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, would benefit from having more timely audit reports and 
being able to ensure more quickly that appropriate corrective action is taken.  With the current annual report, audit findings can be 
more than a year old by the time they are tabled in the House.  Parliamentarians could keep informed more effectively about the 
results of my audits if they were presented in a series of smaller reports through the year rather than in one large volume of some 700 
pages.  We would also be able to respond more rapidly to emerging Parliamentary interest, including those of standing committees, 
by reporting on completed audits when Parliament is interested in the issue.
<P>
Second, there would likely be reduced intensity of media coverage and less concentration on the more negative findings that seem to 
be natural by-products of the once-a-year ``event'' created by annual reporting.  A related benefit is that the positive findings 
reported by my office would have a greater chance of surfacing since they would not be submerged by the negative findings set out in 
one annual report.  Government managers, including the central agencies, would have a better chance of digesting and reacting 
appropriately and in a timely fashion to findings presented in a series of smaller reports.
<P>
Third, we believe that the central agencies of government would benefit from the more timely support for their various initiatives to 
improve management of government programs across all departments that would result from reporting our audits on a more timely 
basis.  Periodic reports would also assist the central agencies in monitoring compliance with their guidelines and in taking early 
action to correct emerging government-wide problems.
<P>
Fourth, this office would benefit from efficiency improvements resulting from completing work in process rather than having to put 
it aside and then pick it up again at the time of tabling the annual report.  The disruptive affect of the annual report tabling on the 
smooth and orderly flow of work through this office cannot be overemphasized.
<P>
Ultimately, the taxpayers of Canada will be the main beneficiaries.  Earlier reporting of audit results will lead to faster correction of 
problems.  And this means greater savings, reduced risk and better management generally of government programs.
<P>
Times have changed since the annual reporting requirement was established by Parliament in 1977.  The business of governing is 
more complex.  There is more information moving faster on more aspects of government today than in 1977.  Periodic reporting is 
one way of helping all stakeholders in the work of my office deal with this increased information flow.
<P>
The trend over the last ten years in national audit offices around the world has been away from annual reporting to the reporting of 
audit results when the job is completed.  The United Kingdom and Australia are two examples of this shift.  The Comptroller 
<P>

<P>
General of the United States has always reported his findings to 
Congress when the work is completed.  From our exposure to the 
practices of other nations' audit offices, it seems fairly safe to 
say that periodic reporting is becoming the norm around the 
world.  In our view, this would be a good time for Canada to join 
the trend.
<P>
I hope you will find these thoughts helpful.  Should you wish to share them with any of your Parliamentary colleagues, please feel 
free to do so.  I would be pleased to discuss any of these points with you.
<P>
Yours sincerely,<IMG SRC="graphics/nen045Au02.gif"  >
