	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the Immigration and Refugee Board 
should be dismantled and its functions subsumed into the Department of 
Citizenship and Immigration where refugee claims would be heard and decided 
by well trained and accountable immigration officers.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address private member's 
Motion No. 120 which calls for the dismantling of the Immigration 
and Refugee Board. I will refer to the board as the IRB from here 
on in.
<P>
	This motion is in response to more than two years of inaction on 
the part of the department of immigration and its political 
management by the current government. For more than two years 
the former minister and his replacement have skirted issues and 
generally avoided questions, all the while refusing to take 
responsibility for the inadequacies which exist within the 
immigration portfolio.
<P>
	Under the current Liberal regime the government has brought 
forward legislation which has juggled the status quo and made 
minuscule changes. However, it has not addressed the legitimate 
concerns of Canadians who want the system fixed.
<P>
	It must be hard for old style politicians to see past the trough of 
political patronage and grasp the concept of populous opinion. 
Since the time of Confederation the political machine in Canada 
has been rife with corruption and the harbour of patronage. The 
latest Liberal instalment is yet another chapter in the patronage 
book. Many initiatives are undertaken to accommodate campaign 
contributors, regardless of the cost to public funds or public safety.
<P>
	The government is out of touch with the average Canadian, so I 
will take this opportunity to inform it of how rank and file 
Canadians view the shortcomings of the current immigration 
system.
<P>
	Canadians are a remarkable people. Their selfless commitment 
to helping those less fortunate has gained the admiration of the 
world. Canadians want to provide a safe refuge for those who, 
through no fault of their own, are in legitimate danger of 
persecution. This is our home and we are happy to share it with 
those in need.
<P>
	However, this responsibility has its limits. No one likes to be 
taken advantage of and that is exactly what is occurring today. 
Some of those who have come to our land seeking asylum are 
fugitives, war criminals or people who have not been 
straightforward in disclosing their situation or their past. The 
current system does not allow for thorough scrutiny, resulting in 
heightened risk to Canadians.
<P>
	This situation did not arrive overnight. There has been a long 
stream of inept decision making which has brought our 
humanitarian efforts to the disastrous state which exists today. 
Contrary to routine embellishment by ministers of immigration, 
past and present, there is plenty that can be done to rectify the 
situation. It involves some creativity, hard work and may upset 
some of those who have been getting fat off overburdened 
taxpayers. These criteria alone would cause the minister to run 
away in fear, yet we with a Reform backbone are willing to make 
the changes in the interest of Canadians.
<P>
	Let us look at the function and makeup of the IRB. The IRB was 
created in response to the Supreme Court of Canada's 1985 ruling 
in the case of Singh <I>v.</I> the Minister of Employment and 
Immigration. The supreme court, under the direction of Chief 
Justice Bertha Wilson, had ruled in Singh that all refugee claimants 
were to be granted all hearings in accordance with standards of 
fundamental justice and that the prior practice violated those 
standards. The board was also empowered to hear the appeals of 
those who had been ordered removed from Canada.
<P>
	The decision was predicated on the theory that the IRB would be 
a determining body able to sort out those seeking asylum under the 
United Nations definition of a conventional refugee from those 
simply seeking entrance to Canada. From this point on the trouble 
starts.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2640"> 2640 </A></B>
<P>
	Let me start by addressing the makeup of the board. The IRB, 
which is comprised of over 235 amply  remunerated appointees, is 
both larger and better paid than is appropriate. The body incurs an 
operating cost of over $80 million a year, not including the cost to 
legal aid and social services which result from their decisions.
<P>
	By dismantling the IRB and subsuming its function into the 
Department of Citizenship and Immigration, the system would 
become more accountable, more cost effective, more ethical and 
would fulfil our humanitarian obligations.
<P>
	Like all other appointed quasi-judicial bodies, the IRB is 
autonomous in its decision making practices. As the minister of 
immigration is so fond of saying, it is at arm's length to the 
government.
<P>
<B>(1110 )</B>
<P>
	Unfortunately it was not an acceptable form of recall. This 
process could take as long as five years and fall outside the 
mandate of an elected government. Those making decisions on 
behalf of Canadians should be directly accountable for their 
actions. Without the direction of the House of Commons, the IRB 
is pursuing its own mandate regardless of the wants and needs of 
Canadians.
<P>
	Many of those who land in Canada as refugees should have been 
considered immigrants, others should have been denied entry 
altogether. As Canadians we have an obligation to accommodate 
only those who qualify as convention refugees under the definition 
outlined by the United Nations.
<P>
	The United Nations definition of a convention refugee is one 
who, because of a membership in a particular political or social 
group, religion, race or nationality, cannot return to his or her own 
country for fear of serious persecution. The UN estimates that in 
1993 there were over 20 million displaced persons in the world. Of 
these only 60,000 remain genuine refugees. 1994-95 reflects the 
same kind of statistics.
<P>
	The UN reports that 25,000 of the 60,000 who were in need of 
immediate resettlement were settled worldwide. Canada accepted 
25,000 refugees in 1993. Therefore either Canada settled every 
single refugee in the world or the formula for determining the 
status is flawed. I believe it to be the latter.
<P>
	A clear definition has been laid down by the UN. Unfortunately 
the IRB interpretation of that definition has created considerable 
uncertainty regarding the determination of refugee status. The 
average acceptance rate for industrialized countries has 
traditionally hovered around 14 per cent. Canada's acceptance rate 
is presently hovering between 70 per cent and 90 per cent. Clearly 
the definition of refugee has undergone radical expansion in 
Canada.
<P>
	Some may argue the merits of having such a high approval rate. 
However, the ramifications of these practices is far reaching and 
not as noble as one may think. I will address this issue later in my 
speech.
<P>
	The IRB has redefined its mandate and practices outside that of 
its inception and that of any other practice exercised by signatories 
of the UN convention.
<P>
	There must be a clear formula for refugee determination and it 
must be followed in all cases. Unless a nation has proven itself to 
be a systematic violator of the terms of the UN treaty, then that 
nation should be considered a safe third country for the purposes of 
refugee determination.
<P>
	Currently the majority of cases heard by the IRB involve inland 
claimants, those people who enter Canada and seek refugee status. 
Many of these people have paid their way to Canada and only seek 
refugee status because of Canada's liberal practices. Canada 
operates under the legal fiction that there are no safe third 
countries. As such, virtually all migrants regardless of their 
previous country of residence, are granted refugee hearings on 
request. I can point to the United States, England, Germany and 
even Israel, that according to Canada, are refugee producing 
nations.
<P>
	I believe it is entirely appropriate and does not contravene the 
decision to deny claimants refugee hearings who come from safe 
third countries. This is in accordance with the UN definition. This 
opinion is shared by Canadians but not by the Immigration and 
Refugee Board.
<P>
	The practices of the IRB have caused two streams of 
immigration into Canada; those who qualify as immigrants and 
those who slip through as refugees. There are two losers in this 
scenario: the legitimate refugee who is not granted access to 
Canada and the taxpayer who is forced to support huge bills which 
result from appeals, legal aid and social assistance. Claimants that 
do not have a legitimate claim to seek asylum in Canada carry a 
huge price tag.
<P>
	The average cost to the taxpayer per claimant in terms of legal 
aid, court time and social assistance is between $30,000 and 
$60,000, multiplied by 25,000 refugee claimants accepted 
annually, the bill is well over $1 billion. This amount comes close 
to matching the total budget of the United Nations High 
Commission for Refugees. With that budget the UNHRC manages 
to care for, resettle and repatriate five million displaced persons a 
year.
<P>
<B>(1115 )</B>
<P>
	In other words, Canada spends the same amount of money on a 
few thousand cases as the UN does on five million. There is 
definitely a problem. The primary goal of Canada's refugee system 
is to provide humanitarian relief. Therefore, a reduced emphasis on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2641"> 2641 </A></B>
<P>
inland  processing is needed in order to focus a greater reliance on 
overseas selection.
<P>
	Overseas claimants are confined to refugee camps surrounded by 
barbed wire and armed soldiers. These people have been denied the 
most basic of human needs, yet their plight is forsaken by those 
who abuse the Canadian refugee system.
<P>
	In addition to the humanitarian gains inherent in this approach, 
costs to the taxpayer would be substantially reduced. Contrary to 
the exorbitant costs attributed to inland claimants, the cost of 
resettling overseas claimants averages between $2,500 to $3,000 
per claim. This is fair, it is ethical and it is what the IRB was 
established to do, help those most in need.
<P>
	We may ask ourselves why dismantle the IRB, why not just 
change its mandate? I do not believe it is that simple. The IRB is a 
hotbed for political patronage appointments. Merit is not always a 
factor or a motive. The IRB is unresponsive to the interests of 
Canadians and has become a representative of special interests 
from the immigration industry perpetuating a system which drains 
public moneys for its own gain; the more the merrier as long as the 
taxpayer is paying. This is accomplished by broadening the 
definition of refugees beyond either what the people of Canada or 
the United Nations for that matter have ever proposed.
<P>
	In many instances IRB members have been confused between 
the terms of persecution and prosecution by allowing fugitives, 
terrorists, outlaws and political dissidents into Canada under the 
guise of refugees. Some of these undesirables are believed to be 
channelled through Canadian social assistance funds back to the 
political regimes which perpetuate violence, genocide and drugs, 
not the element which tugs at the heart strings of generous 
Canadians. I believe Canadians have been duped into believing 
otherwise.
<P>
	Under current guidelines refugee hearings conducted by the IRB 
are to be non-confrontational. In other words, board members and 
staff must take pains to avoid engaging in questioning, introducing 
evidence or employing a tone that would suggest to the claimant 
the onus of providing proof of legitimacy lies with them.
<P>
	It is a privilege to be granted access to the best country in the 
world. There needs to be a system of determining refugees which is 
thorough, efficient, cost effective and fair. The IRB is not, hence 
the fact that it must be dismantled.
<P>
	The House may ask what will serve in its place. I am glad that 
question was asked because no responsible piece of legislation 
should be presented unless it is well researched and includes a plan 
of implementation. I assure the House this motion includes both.
<P>
	I am proposing the IRB be entirely dismantled and replaced by a 
body of well trained immigration officers who have the ability 
individually to determine refugee  claims. These officers would 
receive intensive training in refugee acceptance guidelines. This 
measure would establish government policies and procedures 
which would need to be followed in each and every case.
<P>
	The performance of these officers would be scrutinized and 
regularly reviewed by departmental officials under the jurisdiction 
of the deputy minister of immigration and citizenship, thereby 
implementing the element of accountability which has been absent 
from the present model.
<P>
	Some may argue replacing the IRB with a body of trained 
immigration officials directly accountable to the deputy minister 
will lead to political intervention in the determination process. 
There could be a valid argument here. However, Reform proposes 
that members of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees monitor refugee acceptance guidelines in Canada and act 
as a check and balance on the process.
<P>
	Our mandate to accept and resettle convention refugees is 
obligatory as signatories of the treaty. The UNHCR would be able 
to inform the minister and Canadians of questionable trends in 
refugee processing.
<P>
<B>(1120 )</B>
<P>
	This intervention would end the pandering of the immigration 
industry interest which is so prevalent thus far. Immigration 
officers would be empowered to investigate and question the 
legitimacy of all claimants in the interest of Canadians. The 
decision of verifying and accepting a claim would be rendered by 
individual hearing officers rather than by an IRB member, a 
patronage appointment.
<P>
	This method of intervention would ensure full disclosure of 
information, including that which is incriminating. Why should we 
provide asylum to those who have committed crimes in other 
lands? I know the Liberals prefer to see that, as they have often 
expressed, but unfortunately most Canadians do not agree with 
that. There are far too many needy claimants in the world to take 
risks on those with chequered pasts.
<P>
	By empowering our immigration officials with fact finding 
abilities there is a greater chance of weeding out those who are not 
deserving of asylum in Canada.
<P>
	The IRB is ineffective in determining refugee claimants as 
described in the UN definition of a convention refugee. The IRB 
has a history of catering to the immigration industry, lining the 
pockets of immigration lawyers, advocacy groups and 
organizations with hard earned taxpayer dollars.
<P>
	The IRB has broadened the Canadian definition of a refugee to 
the point that anyone entering Canada has a nine out of ten shot at 
refugee status. Of all who reach Canada, only 1 per cent are ever 
deported. This is a joke that undermines the immigration and 
refugee system in the eyes of Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2642"> 2642 </A></B>
<P>
	The IRB has repeatedly cost the Canadian taxpayer, the board 
itself, $80 million a year. That is a disgusting display of partisan 
patronage which must stop now.
<P>
	One would think the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
would embrace a plan such as this. It would restore integrity and 
accountability to a portfolio which is severely lacking. It would 
demonstrate to the Canadian public that she cares about the 
situation and responsible with their hard earned tax dollars. It 
would portray her as a minister concerned with the safety of 
Canadians, dedicated to Canada's humanitarian obligations.
<P>
	There is only one problem. She would have to fire all her friends 
and those of the previous minister, which I do not think would 
happen. That is a serious obstacle for this minister and the entire 
Liberal Party. The only jobs, jobs, jobs they care about are 
patronage jobs.
<P>
	We on this side of the House see things a whole lot differently. 
We want to take the immigration system and make it effective, 
accountable and ethical. We want governments to implement 
programs which serve Canadians without the added expense of 
patronage jobs. We want the refugee determination process to be 
conducted by well trained, non-partisan immigration officials. This 
is not a Christmas wish list. This is the bare minimum which is to 
be expected from a responsible government.
<P>
	Our plan would result in the number of persons accepted as 
convention refugees through the inland process being be sharply 
reduced.
<P>
	I am bringing forward a motion which is in the best interest of 
Canadians by implementing a more effective system of refugee 
determination without the pomp and circumstance of bloated 
patronage appointments and the pandering to special interest 
demands.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak to Motion No. 120 by the hon. 
member for Calgary Northeast advocating the elimination of the 
Immigration and Refugee Board.
<P>
	Let us examine that which is to be destroyed by this motion. The 
IRB, an independent administration tribunal, was to identify those 
who need our protection as convention refugees.
<P>
	In 1989 the IRB was established so that refugee claimants would 
have the right to a hearing in order to explain their claim 
personally. This resulted following a supreme court decision which 
indicated the claimants had a right to an oral hearing when 
questions of credibility were at stake. As well, the IRB was formed 
in order to respond to charges that the former system was not 
impartial. A return to the former system would only lead to the 
same criticism and legal challenges which plagued it.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	The IRB is comprised of three divisions. The refugee division of 
the IRB deals exclusively with claims to convention refugee status. 
Before the division comes into the picture, a senior immigration 
officer of Citizenship and Immigration Canada determines whether 
a claimant is eligible to claim convention refugee status. If eligible, 
claimants are referred to the IRB for determination. Claims are 
usually heard by a two member panel, although in a number of 
situations decisions can be made by a single member.
<P>
	The IRB also plays the key role in adjudicating all immigration 
inquiries. This is handled by the adjudication division of the IRB 
which is mandated to conduct immigration inquiries and detention 
reviews. Inquiries are held at the request of department officials to 
determine whether persons are to be admitted to or removed from 
Canada.
<P>
	The appeal division of the IRB is in charge of handling appeals 
by Canadians citizens or permanent resident sponsors in cases 
where the department officials have rejected an application for 
permanent residence made by a close family member.
<P>
	It also handles appeals for removal orders issued by the board's 
adjudication division or department officials against permanent 
residents, visa holders or convention refugee claimants who have 
been convicted of a serious crime in Canada, who have made a 
material misrepresentation on their application for permanent 
residence, or who have not complied with the terms and conditions 
of their landings.
<P>
	As well, the appeal division handles appeals by the Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration against decisions of the board's 
adjudication division. The minister may reject or admit the subject 
of an immigration inquiry.
<P>
	As everyone can see from this description, the IRB performs an 
extremely important and complex function. Transferring the IRB's 
function to the department would not be a small feat. It would be 
expensive and would not add anything positive. Most important, it 
would seriously compromise the impartiality of the refugee 
determination process.
<P>
	We must do everything possible to avoid a perception that 
refugee determining officers are seen as simply doing the will of 
the government of the day. Impartiality is imperative. The 
independence of the IRB ensures the principles of our charter of 
rights and freedoms are preserved.
<P>
	Our charter provides that everyone has the right to life, liberty 
and security of the person, and the right not to be deprived thereof 
except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.
<P>
	Refugee status determination requires particular skills and 
expertise. It requires personnel who have knowledge  and 
understand-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2643"> 2643 </A></B>
<P>
ing of the refugee experience. Departmental officials could be 
trained to do the job of IRB members, but we must keep in mind 
current members were selected because they already had many of 
the qualities necessary for the job.
<P>
	As such, there would in essence be no sense in moving these 
positions to the department. Moreover, regardless of whether the 
IRB were dismantled, the qualities required of refugee decision 
makers would not change one bit. The bottom line is that 
transferring the functions of the IRB to the department would mean 
significant and unnecessary expenditures and would also 
compromise the impartial nature of the refugee determination 
process which the IRB performs so effectively. This latter point is 
crucial. It is the reason I must reject the hon. member's motion.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	It is important to be aware that the previous Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration recently introduced changes to the 
IRB. This includes downsizing the IRB from 175 members to 112 
for a cost saving of $6 million. Also, an independent panel will be 
set up to choose new IRB members and reappoint current ones. The 
selection process prior to this change was previously the 
responsibility of the minister.
<P>
	This is evidence that the IRB is continually reacting to a 
changing environment and is evolving. The need to evolve however 
does not imply that we should dispose of the entire system. If there 
is a problem, we fix it. We make changes. We do not mindlessly 
destroy what is already created and in place.
<P>
	To destroy and dismantle will not solve anything. It will not 
accomplish a thing. This government has worked hard ever since 
its inception to make sure that Canada's refugee determination 
system is fair, to be certain that it is affordable and that it is also 
sustainable. The changes that have already been made to the IRB 
are a clear example of this. We have an excellent refugee program 
that will only continue to improve.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise today to speak to Motion M-120 tabled by the hon. member 
for Calgary Northeast, who wants the Immigration and Refugee 
Board or IRB to be dismantled.
<P>
	This motion has already been debated on December 14. The hon. 
member wants IRB functions to be subsumed under the 
Department of Citizenship and Immigration.
<P>
	He put forward several reasons to justify his motion, and I agree 
with some of them because they are quite valid. He wants to end 
patronage, partisan appointments and the renewal of 
commissioners' mandate. He wants to end political patronage, the 
tradition of rewarding election campaign friends and supporters by 
appointing  them to highly paid, prestigious positions, like that 
of IRB commissioner.
<P>
	However, I totally disagree with the hon. member's opinion that 
the board should be dismantled. Although I recognize that there are 
indeed some operational problems, I think the IRB is a valuable 
organization that must be preserved.
<P>
	The IRB was created in 1989 following a 1985 Supreme Court 
ruling on the Singh case. The ruling stipulated that refugees and 
asylum seekers too are protected by the Canadian Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms and entitled to a hearing in accordance with the 
standards of fundamental justice.
<P>
	The Supreme Court ruled that the charter of rights and freedoms 
must be respected in the refugee determination and admission 
process.
<P>
	This process must also take place before an impartial 
organization, an independent tribunal, as is the case with the IRB.
<P>
	The IRB is the largest independent quasi-judicial tribunal in 
Canada. It was established by Parliament to rule on refugee claims 
and immigration appeals.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	Since 1993, it is also responsible for the arbitration function as it 
relates to immigration inquiries and the review of the grounds for 
detention. The IRB administers a budget of approximately $77 
million per year and, as of May 1, had 178 board members, whose 
wages range from $73,400 to $142,400. These are well-paid jobs, 
board members earning $90,000 a year on average.
<P>
	There is a serious problem, which has been raised by the hon. 
member for Calgary Northeast, with appointment and 
reappointment of members. The Standing Committee on 
Citizenship and Immigration periodically reviews some of these 
appointments, and we have noticed that many are politically 
motivated. Sometimes, those selected lack the necessary expertise. 
Never having worked with immigrant or refugee serving 
organizations, they do not always have the skills required to carry 
out their duties.
<P>
	The board has heard the testimonies of two former board 
members, who condemned the incompetence of some board 
members. There is even one board member who was disbarred as a 
lawyer only to be later appointed to the board by this Liberal 
government.
<P>
	The government told us it wanted to improve the board member 
selection process. An advisory committee, the Gordon Fairweather 
committee, after the name of its chairman, was established. This is 
some obscure committee, whose operations we know nothing 
about. For instance, we do not know on what basis the board 
members are selected, whether or not interviews are conducted and 
if appraisals are taken into account. The  role played by the IRB in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2644"> 2644 </A></B>
<P>
appointing and reappointing members when their terms of office 
expire is not known.
<P>
	The official opposition, and the hon. member for Bourassa in 
particular, have asked that the chairman of this committee appear 
before the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration 
along with an IRB representative to explain to us what procedure is 
used to select and appoint board members. Unfortunately, our 
request was denied by the Liberal majority on the committee.
<P>
	We Bloc members oppose Motion M-120, even though we agree 
with some of the points raised by the hon. member for Calgary 
Northeast. We do not think that the solution is to dismantle the 
IRB, but to bring about major changes to this paralegal body. 
Transferring the IRB's functions to public servants is not the 
solution, because the minister and the government display 
partisanship when appointing the deputy minister or senior 
officials to whom these public servants are accountable.
<P>
	In the past, when public servants were responsible for the 
refugee status determination process, the decision was sometimes 
made in secret. There was no obligation to hear those who were 
seeking asylum. This is why the Supreme Court ruled that a 
paralegal body was required to make decisions on such requests.
<P>
	Moreover, I cannot agree with a motion from a party that has 
shown no interest in the cause of refugees. This motion only seeks 
to force Canada to drastically reduce the number of refugees 
currently allowed into the country. The Reform Party has shown a 
great deal of hostility towards immigrants and refugees, while also 
recently making discriminatory comments towards homosexuals 
and blacks. It also displays some animosity towards women and 
minorities. Therefore, we cannot support this motion.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	There are problems with the IRB. One of the most important 
ones is, in our opinion, the fact that it takes much too long to hear 
claims, particularly in the case of an appeal. The IRB must improve 
its productivity, and its members must make better and more 
consistent decisions.
<P>
	There are many problems in the IRB office in Montreal. Last 
week, a board member was arrested, and charged with making 
death threats to an IRB hearing officer. He was charged with 
intercepting private conversations, having a restricted weapon in 
his possession, harassing and of making harassing phone calls. 
These are serious charges. As things stand, the board member has 
not been suspended, even if his case is already before a court.
<P>
	Incidents such as these do undermine the credibility of the IRB. 
This is why I am asking the minister and the chair of the IRB to 
react and to suspend this board  member until a final decision has 
been reached in this case.
<P>
	I would like to point out another problem with the IRB. I was 
told that the IRB wants to privatize its documentation, information 
and research service. This is an important service that provides 
board members with the information they need about the asylum 
seeker and his or her home country. I have even heard that a Liberal 
member is involved in these efforts to privatize the documentation 
service of the IRB. I do not think that would be a good idea. I think 
we should reassure the employees who are afraid of losing their 
jobs.
<P>
	The situation worldwide is alarming: the number of refugees is 
still on the rise. According to the High Commissioner for Refugees, 
there are 27 million refugees, and 80 p. 100 of them are women and 
children. Today's newspapers reported a very serious problem in 
Liberia, an African country thousands of refugees are trying to flee. 
I would like Canada to provide them with humanitarian assistance 
and to welcome a number of these refugees here.
<P>
	Let me say in conclusion that we will vote against this motion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak on behalf of my 
colleague's private member's motion to get rid of the Immigration 
and Refugee Board. I support him 100 per cent.
<P>
	I have heard from former members as well as those who are 
presently sitting on the IRB. They are very concerned about the 
attitude, the prevailing culture as they call it, within the 
Immigration and Refugee Board. There are individuals who feel 
that the prevailing attitude or culture of the board is very biased, 
one sided and certainly is not balanced. They are very concerned 
because they see this attitude as being one of supporting the 
advocacy groups and the refugees over and above any 
consideration for Canada and for the safety of Canadian society. 
This concerns me.
<P>
	The board is a quasi-judicial body which operates at arm's length 
from the government. There does not seem to be any 
accountability. I appreciate that somebody has to be there to be 
concerned about the refugee and immigration applicants who 
appear before the board, however I feel there are other options. 
There are other options and opportunities within the Canadian 
system for their concerns to be addressed. My colleague has given 
his concept of what he thinks the alternatives can be.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	I would suggest that having a government department with 
individuals who have the knowledge and training to deal with this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2645"> 2645 </A></B>
<P>
is probably the preferable way of dealing with it because they are 
accountable. If it can be shown  they are not doing their job or that 
there is bias or a lack of consideration for any of the different 
parties, they can be held accountable and they can be removed from 
their job.
<P>
	The members of the IRB are not treated in the same way. They 
are removed from any accountability. When they make decisions 
that are not in Canada's best interests, nothing really can be done. 
Making people accountable for their decisions is a very important 
consideration.
<P>
	Another reason departmental representatives are in a better 
position or should be allowed that jurisdiction is that decisions 
would be done in a timely manner. It is not fair for any applicant to 
have to wait four or five years to know whether or not they are 
going to be allowed to stay in their country of choice. It is not fair 
to the Canadian public nor to the applicants themselves to be held 
in the situation of not knowing where they belong.
<P>
	I have talked to many applicants who have gone through a very 
long and drawn out process to try to get some kind of 
determination. It is very difficult for them when they have 
established roots in a new home in Canada to be told four or five 
years later that they cannot stay.
<P>
	I am concerned with what is happening to the Immigration and 
Refugee Board in that its decisions are also bringing disrepute to 
Canada's whole immigration system. I can cite a number of cases 
of where its decisions have been contrary to public opinion and the 
opinion of immigration officers. There are decisions where the 
immigration officers have appealed the IRB decision because they 
felt so strongly about it. A number of them have happened within 
the last year or two.
<P>
	One that strikes me as being totally uncalled for is a decision for 
Jhatoo to remain in our country. Jhatoo has a fairly lengthy 
criminal history and ended up once again committing a serious 
crime. He beat to death with a baseball bat a mother of six children. 
He did it for money. The IRB determined that he could be 
rehabilitated even though he had a long criminal history and he had 
murdered a mother of six children. He was put out on parole. The 
decision was made that while he was on parole he could remain in 
Canada on the condition that he not associate with other criminals. 
When the IRB decision came down his parole had already been 
revoked and he was in jail associating with criminals. This did not 
seem to concern the IRB.
<P>
	There is another case of an applicant who had been ordered 
deported, whose deportation order had been stayed by the IRB and 
then had been appealed and overturned. Although that individual 
had a charge of manslaughter, a charge for a sexual offence against 
a 13 year old, and charges of aggravated assault, he was allowed to 
stay in Canada. As a result there is one woman who is dead and a 13 
year old girl who was shot and  badly wounded before he committed 
suicide. There is a price to pay for decisions such as these.
<P>
	When somebody thinks that the department officials have not 
given a good decision or that their deportation order is unjustified, 
there are the courts of the land to deal with those cases. There is 
nothing that denies them the ability to appear before the courts in 
those cases.
<P>
<B>(1150 )</B>
<P>
	We have made it so easy for individuals to stretch the process, to 
stretch the courtesy and the kindness of our country to the point 
where our acceptance rate is nigh on 75 per cent. Although as a 
country we are compassionate and we want to open our doors, it is 
a question of making sure that those most in need, the genuine 
refugees who are in camps and do not have the means to relocate in 
another country, are the people we look after, not those individuals 
who have the financial resources to reach the North American 
continent and to make their claim from here.
<P>
	Some comments have been brought to my attention from the 
Rwandan community here in Canada, the Tamil community here in 
Canada, the Hong Kong community here in Canada, and the Sikh 
community here in Canada. They are concerned about the decisions 
which are being made by the IRB. They are concerned about the 
representation in the IRB hearings which they see as very one sided 
and very biased. They ask: ``How is it possible that this is 
happening? We are the victims. We are being victimized in Canada 
by the people the IRB is allowing to come in. Why is somebody not 
protecting us in Canada from that which we left in our home 
countries?'' I cannot answer them because I do not know why we 
are allowing that to happen.
<P>
	The situation we find ourselves in was brought to my attention 
by somebody within the community. This person is concerned that 
in 1994 there were 68 Chileans who made claims to the board in 
Montreal. In February 1995 Canada removed the visitor's visa 
regulation for Chileans. In 1995 Montreal had 1,483 applicants for 
refugee status. That is a jump from 68 claimants to 1,483 claimants 
in one year.
<P>
	One has to ask why this happens. Is it for legitimate reasons or is 
it because Canada has a reputation for having such a weak, soft 
system that it makes it easy for people to take advantage of us? In 
the interests of Canadians, in the interests of the integrity of our 
immigration system it is very important that Canada start looking 
at organizations and boards like the IRB to determine whether they 
have been successful in maintaining the status and the stature of 
Canada in the international community. If they have not, then this 
country should be looking for other alternatives. I would suggest 
that now is not soon enough.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2646"> 2646 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, to characterize 
a system as being biased against the safety of Canadians is not 
only not fair, but it is not just.
<P>
	Over 50 years this country has opened its doors to thousands and 
thousands of refugees. This is something I am sure everyone is 
proud of. There are individuals in this House right now who know 
firsthand the hardships and perils refugee claimants have to face, 
the persecution, the sorrow and the fear.
<P>
	For the rest of us it may sometimes be difficult to understand or 
comprehend the refugee experience. People in Canada do not have 
to worry about soldiers coming to their doors in the middle of the 
night to take them or their families away. We do not have to worry 
about being tortured or killed for our political beliefs. We do not 
have to worry about suddenly losing our homes and possessions 
because of war. We must never forget that many others do.
<P>
	There are places in the world where speaking one's mind can get 
one thrown into a cell without a trial or a sentence, or worse. We 
live in a time when terms like ethnic cleansing and genocide have 
become part of the daily vernacular. I am proud to say that in 
Canada we have chosen to confront these issues head on. It has 
long been recognized both here and abroad that Canadians care and 
we take our responsibilities as good citizens of the world very 
seriously.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	That is why we accept the international obligations we took on 
when we signed the 1951 Geneva convention relating to the status 
of refugees and the 1967 protocol. By signing those agreements we 
promised to protect those in need, to open our arms and hearts to 
victims of oppression and misery.
<P>
	A key element of the strategy to deal with refugees was the 
creation of the Immigration and Refugee Board in 1989. The IRB, 
on behalf of Canadians, reflects our commitment to promote a 
peaceful and humanitarian response to global issues of conflict, 
mass migration and human rights. The board's goals and 
challenges have remained constant: to identify those in need of 
Canada's protection and to adjudicate fairly and efficiently all 
immigration appeals, inquiries and detention reviews.
<P>
	There have been times when the IRB has met all of these goals 
and challenges. However, we have had problems. There have been 
times when the IRB's judgment has been questioned. There have 
been times when the integrity of the system has been placed in 
doubt. However this does not mean we should scrap the whole 
thing. This type of haphazard tearing down is inefficient and 
uncalled for. Characterizing the system by using a few criminal 
sensationalistic cases is irresponsible.
<P>
	In 1985 the supreme court ruled that refugee claimants are 
entitled to a hearing on the merits of their claim in accordance with 
the charter right to fundamental justice. In the Singh case the court 
pointed out that fundamental justice required that the claimants had 
a right to an oral hearing before the decision maker where 
questions of credibility were at stake. The opportunity to be heard 
is only one element of fundamental justice. The decision maker 
must also be unbiased and impartial. There is a requirement not 
only for justice to be done but for justice to be seen to be done.
<P>
	We have a board of professionals who are well trained to deal 
with the intricacies and complexities of refugee cases. Refugee 
status determination has been described as one of the most difficult 
forms of adjudication. It is emotionally demanding and requires a 
commitment to justice and fairness. Board members are chosen 
because they have the qualities deemed necessary to carry out this 
important and often heart rending work. They bring with them 
different perspectives and knowledge of the international 
community.
<P>
	The board's record of success far outweighs the few instances of 
problems. Last year alone the board heard over 20,000 claims. 
Unfortunately when dealing with that many people inevitably a few 
people may slip through the cracks. A criminal few have cast some 
serious aspersions on a good system. That is why the government 
recently took action to protect the integrity of our system. I am 
talking about the passage of Bill C-44 which hon. members 
opposite know well.
<P>
	Bill C-44 is an enforcement tool which is tough on serious 
criminals who would abuse our nation's goodwill and hospitality. It 
stops serious dangerous criminals from claiming refugee status 
simply to delay their removal from Canada. It also allows our 
government to stop a refugee hearing after the hearing has begun if 
it suddenly receives new information about a claimant's criminal 
dealings.
<P>
	Before the passage of Bill C-44, we would not stop the process 
once it started. Likewise, Bill C-44 takes away the right of serious 
criminals to appeal removal orders to the immigration appeal 
division of the IRB. The withdrawal of appeal rights will only 
occur in the most serious cases involving real danger to the public.
<P>
	We have done a great deal to address the concerns that hon. 
members across the way are talking about. Perhaps it should be 
noted right now that improvements to the board are not always 
legislated in the House. In order to maintain its relevance and 
efficiency, the board continually assesses its performance and 
examines ways to improve. The IRB has willingly undertaken an 
ongoing process of critical self-examination of policies, practices 
and procedures.
<P>
	In recent years the board itself has concentrated on developing 
and identifying best practices. Another example of this positive 
development was the introduction of guidelines in examining 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2647"> 2647 </A></B>
<P>
claims from women refugees fearing gender related persecution. 
Canada was the first country in the world to undertake such an 
initiative. This reinforces our image as a world leader in upholding 
the rights of women.
<P>
	It is a system which is continually evolving and developing. It is 
a system which builds on its successes and learns from its mistakes. 
Countries such as the U.S., which has been admonished by the UN 
a number of times for its lack of sensitivity and understanding in its 
dealings with refugees, are not the kinds of countries I would like 
to compare Canada with.
<P>
	We have a system in place which is at arm's length from the 
government, is professional and is doing a good job. We need to 
improve it, but scrapping it is like sticking our heads in the sand.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Perhaps we could call it 12.03 p.m. rather 
than having someone speak for three minutes.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

	The House resumed from May 10, 1996 consideration of Bill 
C-12, an act respecting employment insurance in Canada, as 
reported (with amendments) from the committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing, NDP)</B> 
moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 75</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-12 be amended by deleting Clause 63.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.)</B> moved:

<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 76</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-12, in Clause 63, be amended by</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>a</I>) replacing line 19, on page 60, with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``63.(1) Subject to subsection (2), the Commission may, with the approv-'';

the Commission in the province, the Commission shall enter into such an 
agreement forthwith.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are 
getting near the end of this stage which unfortunately, just as all 
other stages of consideration of this bill, has been cut short by the 
government. First of all, this bill did not follow the normal 
procedure since it  was referred to committee before second 
reading, where the official opposition usally has the opportunity to 
talk about the principles of a bill. And now, at report stage in the 
House, the government has once again decided to limit debate.
<P>
	I think the government does not want to give us the opportunity 
to tell the truth about this reform in the House of Commons 
because it is afraid that, if people learn the truth, there will be even 
more pressure on the government.
<P>
	After all these demonstrations in areas where there had not been 
any in a long time, we had further proof of the people's 
dissatisfaction in the 40,000 cards Quebecers sent to the Leader of 
the Official Opposition so he could give them to the Minister of 
Human Resources Development, who was not there to receive 
them. But the cards are there.
<P>
	If people are so much opposed to this bill, it is because it changes 
dramatically the conditions of the unemployment insurance 
program, which is the only protection available to ordinary people, 
to those who are not rich, to those who do not have lifetime job 
security, and that includes a lot of people.
<P>
	The only people who will be less affected by this bill are those 
who already have a steady job, who already work 35 hours a week 
or more. But even these people will be affected by the level of 
maximum benefits and by the reduction of the benefit period to 45 
weeks. Even they will be affected, because their sons, wives, 
friends, and people from their areas will be affected, because 
economically, as well as socially, this bill is a bad bill.
<P>
	I would say it is a bad bill for Canada as well. And you might 
look at me and consider it ironic, coming from a member of the 
Bloc Quebecois. Yes, Mr. Speaker, but on this issue, as on so many 
others, the official opposition has fulfilled its function because, 
when we are here, we are defending not just Quebec's interests in 
this Parliament, but also the interests of Quebecers, which are just 
as affected as Canadians in Atlantic Canada or anywhere else in 
Canada by this UI reform.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	This reform has an impact on the economy and on Canada. Why? 
Because since the beginning, UI was, in my view, a form of transfer 
from the richer regions, those where work is the most plentiful, to 
the poorer regions, where it is harder to find a decent-paying job.
<P>
	But the purpose of this bill, and it is there for anyone who reads 
the documents put out by the department, is to reduce equalization 
payments. People in the regions quite rightly protested. They were 
being targeted. But they are not the only ones targeted, far from it.
<P>
	In addition to tightening up eligibility requirements, as was 
mentioned, in addition to reducing benefits, in addition to slashing 
the level of benefits for those without  stable jobs, this bill has the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2648"> 2648 </A></B>
<P>
detestable feature of increasing the arbitrary and discretionary 
power of the commission, which has dwindled to a shadow of its 
former self, because, to all intents and purposes, the department 
takes over what used to be the commission's role. Employees are 
now employees of the department. So, there is more arbitrary 
power, and definitely more punitive measures.
<P>
	As proof, I offer the amendments presented by the government, 
because it was the only one able to present any, on all the 
provisions involving expenditures and revenues. These 
amendments solve very few problems for very few people and, in 
themselves, will not offset the department's intended cuts. Those 
cuts will be replaced with additional sanctions.
<P>
	It is important to note that there is a very low level of 
unemployment insurance fraud, based on what we know about the 
incidence of fraud in various public programs. It is important to 
point out that, of the nearly $14 billion paid out in benefits, cases 
involving fraud accounted for $94 million this past year, or far less 
than 1 per cent. The number of individuals found guilty of fraud is 
also far lower than that figure.
<P>
	I have heard from so many lawyers working with people who 
have been having horrendous problems with UI. Moreover, 
numerous rulings by both the umpire and the federal appeal court 
have repeatedly shown that people are very much at a disadvantage 
when it comes to unemployment insurance. If they do win their 
case, all that they obtain as a judgment is that the commission will 
review its decision, so many people do not even protest, because 
they cannot afford to.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	Something we fear will happen, and it will if the government 
continues along this path, is that there will be more work done 
under the table, more arrangements between employers and 
employees to get around this legislation.
<P>
	The government still has time, there is no urgency. The purpose 
of our proposed amendment is to encourage the government to take 
the necessary time for proper consultations aimed at true reform. 
There is no rush to precipitate regions into very high 
unemployment levels, no rush to hurl those with no security except 
unemployment insurance into far greater poverty.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak in support of 
the employment insurance legislation before the House.
<P>
	The bill is key to our government's commitment to the reform of 
the social security system. As Secretary of State for the Status of 
Women and as a B.C. MP, I am pleased to say fairness and 
inclusiveness are hallmarks of  the bill. It retools the outdated 
Unemployment Insurance Act of 1971 for our times.
<P>
	In the 1990s structural unemployment created a new problem 
that the old UI system had not been designed to address. Through 
no fault of their own, workers were being laid off and found it 
difficult to get permanent work. There are many reasons for this, 
not the least of which is the advent of a new era of technological 
and information based industries.
<P>
	The end result was that UI, which was meant to assist workers 
through temporary short term job displacement, was ill equipped to 
respond to the frequent recurrent, and in some cases permanent, job 
loss characteristic of structural unemployment.
<P>
	The only way to deal with structural unemployment, as the rest 
of the industrial world is beginning to find out, is to become 
relevant to the new industrial reality. To do this means retraining 
and providing workers with the tools and skills for the new world 
of work. Canadians want to work, to be independent economically 
and to provide the infrastructure for Canada's competitiveness in 
the global economy.
<P>
	This bill creates a new and modern employment insurance 
system for Canadians who agree we need to realign our social 
programs and who want these changes made with fairness and with 
flexibility, with a human face.
<P>
	Canadians have had a direct hand in shaping this reform and the 
result is an insurance plan that focuses on employment, training 
and entrepreneurship, not unemployment. This new system will 
help more Canadians prepare for, find and keep work in the new 
economy, and goes so far as to create jobs.
<P>
	One of the most significant features of this reform is that while 
96 per cent of current UI recipients will still be eligible, 500,000 
new claimants will be able to receive benefits, a majority of whom 
are women and youth.
<P>
	The new bill also recognizes the regional diversity of the 
country. For the first time, fewer hours will be required to qualify 
in high unemployment areas such as northern B.C. and the 
maritimes. The bill recognizes for the first time the inherent 
differences in the work patterns of men and women and seeks to 
remedy them.
<P>
	The evolution of women's aspiration for equality has created a 
different dynamic in the workforce. Today women make up 45 per 
cent of the paid workforce.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Women have become such a force in the labour market in the 
past 25 years that addressing issues of interest to women means 
addressing the numerous characteristics of the new economy, 
issues such as nontraditional work, conflicts between job and 
family responsibilities, and various models for entering the work 
force.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2649"> 2649 </A></B>
<P>
	Women tend to work fewer hours than men and to earn less. 
They are more likely to be in nontraditional jobs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The new EI recognizes the different realities of women and men 
because it is the first major federal initiative designed with the 
benefit of formal gender analysis. I point out how this has been 
reflected in Bill C-12.
<P>
	One of the major strengths of this legislation is the move from 
weeks of work to hours of work as the basis of the plan. In today's 
fluid job market the week is no longer the best measure of labour 
force participation. The hour is a more accurate measure of work 
effort since it will acknowledge the efforts of all part time workers 
who put in under 15 hours of work a week, often doing so in more 
than one job, and who were not allowed to participate in the 
benefits other workers enjoyed. Now premiums are paid from the 
first hour worked. Every hour counts toward a claim.
<P>
	For the first time women may be able to qualify for maternity, 
parental and other special benefits they were previously ineligible 
for. Almost 70 per cent of part time workers are women. This 
change means 500,000 more Canadians will have their work 
insured for the first time. Concerns have been raised that if women 
in this position cannot get more hours of work they will lose their 
claim to maternity or parental benefits.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	Gender based analysis showed that at most 2 per cent of current 
maternity claimants would need to work longer to qualify for these 
special benefits but that they will get them. Also, now that every 
hour counts, employers will have less reason to limit the hours of 
their part time workers as they did in the past. Many Canadians 
who hold down multiple jobs will be eligible for EI for the very 
first time.
<P>
	Another group of workers who will benefit under the new system 
are seasonal workers, 38 per cent of whom comprise the B.C. 
workforce. These people working in logging, mining, fisheries, 
tourism and construction. They often have a gap in the off season 
which breaks up their continuous weeks of work criteria. Now, not 
only will they carry over for up to a 26 week gap, but the hour 
system will increase their eligibility by recognizing the intensity of 
their work over the on season.
<P>
	Bill C-12 will help low income Canadians. Some 350,000 
Canadians with family incomes of less than $26,000 a year will be 
eligible for the family income supplement. Two-thirds of these are 
women who will receive a top up for up to 13 per cent of their 
benefit. They will be able to keep a foot in the job market door by 
supplementing their benefits by $50 or 25 per cent of their weekly 
benefits, whichever is higher.
<P>
	About 1.3 million low income Canadians will now have their EI 
premiums refunded, including almost 700,000 women and about 
300,000 youth.
<P>
	The new EI plan is a pro-employment plan where benefits will 
be balanced by five active employment initiatives designed to help 
unemployed Canadians find their place in the labour force. Wage 
subsidies will give employers an incentive to hire people in 
targeted groups who face barriers to employment. Many of these 
beneficiaries will be women and youth.
<P>
	An innovative new benefit, targeted earning supplements, will 
top up the income of eligible claimants who take a low earning job.
<P>
	Self-employment assistance has already helped more than 
34,000 Canadians to start their own businesses. This is especially 
exciting for women who now make up one in every three 
entrepreneurs. Skills, loans and grants support individual initiative 
and commitment.
<P>
	Access to these benefits has been broadened to include more 
Canadians. Anyone who received insurance benefits in the 
previous three years and anyone who has claimed maternity, 
parental or adoptive benefits in the past five years, will now be 
included.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This new system is both economically and socially responsible. 
It is proactive and balanced.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It will bridge the difficult transition in a world that is moving out 
of one industrial era into another, where the status quo no longer 
works, where a plan designed to meet the needs of a boom 
generation has become irrelevant.
<P>
	Change is always difficult at best. How to change in ways that 
moves us forward competitively into the new world reality is what 
the EI bill proposes. It reinforces the value of work and our belief 
as Canadians that we can create prosperity and security in the new 
millennium. I urge the House to pass this bill and to help Canada 
accept the challenges and benefits that the 21st century offers.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to intervene once again on Bill C-12. I do not understand 
how the secretary of state can boast that this is a bill for women. I 
do not believe it for a minute.
<P>
	I do not know whether the secretary of state heard or read the 
same news as us, but it is a fact that no more than two weeks ago a 
press conference was held here by a number of women's groups. 
They included NAC, the Fédération des femmes du Québec and a 
number of other groups that criticized this bill, because it is bad for 
women.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2650"> 2650 </A></B>
<P>
	Why is it bad for women? Because it will penalize part time 
women workers, and not only women but young people. The 
secretary of state for the status of women said that 77 per cent 
of women worked in part time jobs. How is it she is alone in 
saying so-because she represents the Liberal government, which 
supports the bill-when women are criticizing this bill, which will 
penalize part time workers?
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	The government is boasting that UI benefits are counted and paid 
as of the first hour worked, but these women, who work less than 
15 hours, will not qualify, as we know very well. A lot of women 
work part time and less than 15 hours a week. What is going to 
happen? These women will not qualify for unemployment 
insurance benefits.
<P>
	I am not the only one saying so, and my colleagues in the Bloc 
are not the only ones saying so. Women's groups in Canada and in 
Quebec, and not just Quebec, are saying so. It is not simply for 
partisan reasons we are speaking to this issue, a lot of people 
outside the Bloc have criticized it.
<P>
	I do not know whether the secretary of state watched the news on 
the weekend, but as late as yesterday, on Mother's Day, a press 
conference was held in Montreal where unions and Françoise 
David, representing the Fédération des femmes du Québec, 
criticized this bill on behalf of women because it is no good.
<P>
	I very much regretted the absence of the Advisory Council on the 
Status of Women. It could have taken the government to task and 
could have expressed its opinion on this unfortunate bill, which 
hurts women. The government deplores poverty among women, 
but what is it doing with this bill? It is going to increase poverty 
among women, because women will not be able to qualify.
<P>
	Also, the secretary of state is boasting that it will be a good piece 
of legislation for women, and that pregnant women will be entitled 
to more UI benefits. I wonder how the government intends to help 
women when, in the case of pregnant women, they will need 716 
hours of work to qualify for UI benefits.
<P>
	A number of people will be affected by this bill, especially 
seasonal workers. I assume women too have seasonal jobs. For 
instance, women in the tourism sector, or fisheries; this is seasonal 
work. Will these women be penalized because they do not hold full 
time jobs, either by choice or because they have children at home 
and cannot work full time? Yes, they are going to be penalized.
<P>
	I will say it again, I do not understand why this government is 
insisting on passing this bill, which will be bad for women. It 
should go back to the drawing board and review this bill.
<P>
	When the Liberals were in the opposition, they criticized certain 
aspects of this legislation, they criticized the Conservative Party. 
They said it was on the wrong track, and was going to penalize 
people. Everything we are saying now was said then by the 
Liberals. Why? Because they were in the opposition.
<P>
	Now they are in power and they do not have the courage to go 
ahead with what they criticized in the past. Today, I am criticizing 
them for it. I am criticizing the lack of realism on the part of this 
government with regard to unemployment.
<P>
	We all know that times are tough in terms of employment. 
People are without a job through no choice of their own. This 
weekend, we learned in the news that hotels Le Méridien and 
Auberge des Gouverneurs are facing financial difficulties. What 
does that mean? It means the employees of those hotels will soon 
be unemployed. This is disturbing.
<P>
	The unemployment insurance fund is going very well; there is a 
$5 billion surplus in the fund. Five billion dollars! Instead of 
helping these people make it between two jobs, they are reducing 
the number of benefit weeks and making criteria more exacting.
<P>
	The secretary of state for status of women said earlier that the 
employment insurance program, which is no longer called the 
unemployment insurance program, will not necessarily deal with 
unemployment, but instead will give grants so that people can 
receive training and return to work.
<P>
	This is another case of duplication and overlapping, and I regret 
this way they have of interfering in areas already under Quebec's 
jurisdiction. Instead of sending the money and budgets necessary 
for the implementation of a real employment policy in Quebec, 
instead of helping workers and facilitating their training, they keep 
$5 billion and adopt a piecemeal approach to solve the 
unemployment problem which is still prevailing in Quebec and in 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	Several groups testified before us and are shocked to see the 
government's lack of compassion for the precarious circumstances 
of some people who find themselves on unemployment insurance 
through no fault of their own. So, it is no longer an unemployment 
insurance.
<P>
	As I was saying recently in a speech, it is no longer an insurance 
that makes sure people will have a minimum of money to provide 
for their needs when they lose their job. If 77 per cent of women 
work in part time jobs, they will be doubly penalized by this bill.
<P>
	They will be penalized because they will no longer have a job 
and they know very well that these are very precarious jobs. There 
is no continuity in part time employment. They will have a hard 
time finding another  job. This will mean these women, men and 
young people will go on welfare. You know, going on welfare is a 
vicious circle. What does it mean for these people? It means 
moving further away from the possibility of finding another job.
<P>

<P>

<P>
	When the government was in opposition, it was against 
discriminatory measures targeting the unemployed. It should 
reconsider because it will have to pay the price.
<P>
	As we have seen, the people of Quebec and of Canada are against 
this bill that does not provide unemployment insurance in case of 
job loss. The government will penalize people over the number of 
benefit weeks and will raise the criteria, so that the unemployed 
will no longer receive the assistance they expect.
<P>
	Yet, these people have paid their premiums. I too am paying 
premiums and I hope I will not have to rely on the UI system some 
day. But these people have paid so that other people, perhaps even 
themselves, can receive UI benefits some day. It is not by 
penalizing them, by increasing the hours of work required that the 
government will solve the problem.
<P>
	Moreover, they take the money from the pockets of people who 
will never qualify for unemployment insurance because they did 
not accumulate the 700 to 910 hours of work per year required to be 
eligible for UI benefits.
<P>
	Meanwhile, as I said before, the government is keeping $5 
billion in its own pockets. But that is not all. It is only for this year. 
What will happen with next year's surpluses? This government is 
responsible for social cohesion. Only the future will reveal the 
impact of today's unemployment, and the government will be 
responsible.

36, I am seeking to apply it to other motions. In fact, I withdraw 
that. There is seemingly no other application. I am just considering 
whether Motion No. 215 is identical. I believe, Mr. Speaker, you 
would find unanimous consent to apply the vote on Motion No. 36 
to Motion No. 215 which is the first item on the last page of our 
informal list.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">*  *  * </H4>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="AGREEMENTONINTERNALTRADEIMPLEMENTATIONACT">AGREEMENT ON INTERNAL TRADE 
IMPLEMENTATION ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from April 22 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-19, an act to implement the agreement on internal trade, 
be read the third time and passed.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak at third reading of Bill C-19, an act regarding the 
implementation of the agreement on internal trade.
<P>
	In my address today I will describe to the House the impact of 
trade barriers on the economy and what effect these barriers have 
on real Canadians and their families. I will critique the agreement, 
its merits, its shortcomings, and I will conclude by pointing out 
how this agreement must be changed in order to be of real benefit 
to Canadians.
<P>
	Interprovincial trade barriers cost Canadians jobs and money. 
Studies produced by the Canadian Manufacturers' Association, the 
Fraser Institute, the C.D. Howe Institute and others estimate 
interprovincial trade barriers cost Canadian businesses between $6 
billion and $10 billion a year.
<P>
	According to information published by the Fraser Institute in its 
book <I>Provincial Trade Wars: Why the Blockade Must End</I>, if 
Canadian firms were enabled to operate freely across the country, 
average Canadian household incomes would rise by as much 
$3,500 a year. While conservative estimates place this figure lower, 
the point still remains these barriers cost Canadians jobs and 
money.
<P>
	Removing barriers to internal trade is an issue which is so 
important to me and the leader of the Reform Party that we have 
created a new critic area to address this important issue. We will 
fight for Canadians so they can have their jobs and we will fight for 
Canadian business so they can deduct their business with the least 
government and systemic interference possible. This issue is 
second only to debt reduction in terms of issues which must be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2699"> 2699 </A></B>
<P>
dealt with to get Canadians back to work and to stop the 20 years of 
fall in workers' take home pay.
<P>
	What is the magnitude of the internal trade barriers in Canada? 
The Canadian Manufacturers' Association estimates there are at 
least 500 trade barriers currently between provinces. It is not 
known exactly how much larger our internal trade market would be 
if goods and services could flow freely back and forth across the 
country, but clearly Canadian business would regain a portion of 
those markets currently lost to foreign countries and foreign 
companies.
<P>
	I have not found a serious estimate of the number of jobs for 
Canadians this would translate into, but it would be tens of 
thousands, most likely hundreds of thousands.
<P>
	A comparison of Canadian international trade and 
interprovincial trade in goods and services shows international 
trade to be about $160 billion per year and interprovincial trade 
about $146 billion a year. This comparison illustrates our 
interprovincial trade is only about $14 billion less than our total 
international trade.
<P>
	Why then does the Prime Minister and his government not put 
the time and effort into this trade problem they do into international 
trade? Travelling the world may see more glamorous but does it 
produce jobs? Removing barriers to internal trade certainly will. 
According to Stephen Van Houten, president of the Canadian 
Manufacturers' Association, provincial trade barriers have resulted 
in lost sales, lost investments and lost jobs.
<P>
	How do these barriers stagnate growth and limit job creation? 
One might think these measures are intended to ensure growth and 
prosperity within a province. That is the intent, but the opposite is 
what happens. While these artificial perimeters protect the 
microcosm from outside competition, they are shifting the growth 
of domestic industry and establishing protective markets which 
lead to higher consumer costs. According to the Consumers 
Association of Canada, some provinces pay up to 10 per cent more 
for local products because of internal trade barriers.
<P>
	Catherine Swift, president of the Canadian Federation of 
Independent Business, describes the current trade in goods and 
services: ``A totally uncompetitive situation which means 
consumers pay more or pay through the nose. People are forced to 
pay what bloated utilities like Ontario Hydro choose to charge 
rather than what is the best price in the domestic market''.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	I believe I have established that interprovincial trade barriers are 
costing Canadians jobs and money. What do the Liberals have to 
say about this issue? The answer is quite a bit. The problem is that 
so far talk has led to little action. The Liberal government has 
repeatedly recognized that barriers to internal trade cost Canadians  
jobs and money, but it has not done anything substantial to rectify 
the problem.
<P>
	The government made promises in the red book on this issue, 
promises in both throne speeches on the issue, and recognized the 
harm of internal trade barriers in the finance committee's 
prebudget consultation report, but to date little has been done.
<P>
	I remind the Liberal government of some of its own words in 
relation to internal trade. Page 22 of the infamous red book, the 
book of broken promises, states: ``A Liberal government will be 
committed to the elimination of interprovincial trade barriers 
within Canada and will address this issue urgently''.
<P>
	Neville Nankivell writes in his <I>Financial Post</I> article on 
February 18: ``The legislation on freer domestic trade was 
supposed to have high priority for the Liberal government's 
economic policy. It had cleared the committee stage and was 
backed with some amendments, but passage was sidetracked in 
December by the need to push through the Prime Minister's 
controversial unity package''.
<P>
	It is obvious the government is more concerned with 
perpetuating Quebec appeasement than it is about improving 
economic conditions for all Canadians, including Quebecers, 
Quebecers who are looking for jobs.
<P>
	In the throne speech of 1994 the Liberals promised to reduce 
overlap and duplication between provinces and the federal 
government and to work with the provinces to eliminate internal 
trade barriers.
<P>
	Before the federal government brought down the budget this 
year, the finance committee urged the government to take action on 
interprovincial trade barriers in its prebudget consultation report. 
The committee report described the current interprovincial trade 
situation in Canada as very much balkanized.
<P>
	The report went on to state that in some cases it easier to do 
businesses in other provinces by going through a U.S. corporation 
that can use the provisions of the North American Free Trade 
Agreement than by doing business directly.
<P>
	Within the same report the committee urged government to 
continue to seek further action with provinces on reducing 
interprovincial trade barriers: ``Trade within Canada must be 
placed on an equal footing with Canada-U.S. trade in terms of the 
free flow of goods and services. We can no longer afford the 
extravagance of favouring foreign competition over trade among 
Canadians and discriminating against fellow Canadians''.
<P>
	It is shameful that our governments, both federal and provincial, 
have forced Canadian companies to fight an uphill battle against 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2700"> 2700 </A></B>
<P>
their foreign counterparts. We  should be ensuring more than just 
an equal footing with the United States and other countries.
<P>
	If barriers to interprovincial trade were eliminated we would be 
doing more than placing Canadian companies on an equal footing 
internationally. We would be giving them the competitive 
advantage they want and deserve. Unfortunately neither the federal 
nor the provincial governments seem prepared to work with 
Canadians to reduce trade barriers.
<P>
	The agreement on internal trade is the product of executive 
decision making. Twelve cabinet ministers from the respective 
provinces and territories along with the federal Minister of Industry 
hammered out a deal they could all live with, but what about 
business?
<P>
	The Canada West Foundation released a paper in June, 1994 
entitled ``Internal Trade and Economic Co-operation: Down to the 
Wire on an Internal Trade Agreement''. This paper addresses 
provincial interests and attitudes prior to the agreement 
negotiations.
<P>
<B>(1330 )</B>
<P>
	Before the agreement was put in place, the Saskatchewan 
government stated: ``Despite certain irritants, most interprovincial 
trade moves freely now. Canada's economic union works well for 
the most part. Our real economic problems in Canada do not come 
from the current structure of our internal market''.
<P>
	This statement clearly contradicts the concerns of independent 
Saskatchewan business which was surveyed by the Canadian 
Federation of Independent Business and published in its June 1994 
paper entitled ``Barriers to Growth''.
<P>
	In Saskatchewan, 93 per cent of respondents were in favour of 
the removal of trade barriers. Of the respondents who were affected 
by trade barriers, over 60 per cent were affected negatively, the key 
problem areas being provincial regulations and federal subsidies. 
Both resulted in higher costs and restricted growth. How can the 
business community feel assured that its interests are being 
addressed when there is such a lack of understanding by provincial 
governments?
<P>
	What should the government do to bring down the barriers to 
trade and rectify the situation that Canadians currently face? It 
could start by acknowledging that previous Liberal and 
Conservative governments had an obligation to all Canadians 
under the British North America Act to ensure that trade barriers 
were never established in the first place.
<P>
	The British North America Act, 1867 clearly states under section 
121 that all articles of growth, produce or manufacture of any one 
of the provinces shall, from and after the union be admitted free 
into each of the provinces. Section 91(2) states that the legislative 
authority of Parliament extends to the regulation of trade and 
commerce. The people of Canada have paid a serious price for 
government inaction and the abdication of responsibility in this 
area.
<P>
	I will take some time now to speak about certain parts of the 
internal agreement on trade that this bill implements. The 
agreement on internal trade is designed in principle to break down 
barriers in order to establish internal free trade. In an attempt to be 
all things to all provinces, impediments to this objective have been 
erected. One such impediment is article 404 regarding legitimate 
objectives.
<P>
	A legitimate objective is an exemption from the agreement 
regarding (a) public security and safety; (b), public order; (c) 
protection of human, animal or plant life or health; (d) protection 
of the environment; (e) consumer protection; (f) protection of 
health, safety and well-being of workers; and (g) affirmative action 
programs for disadvantaged groups.
<P>
	What does it mean? It means that any province can use the above 
stated criteria as a means of establishing the protection of its 
domestic sectors from competition where it can be demonstrated 
that (a) the purpose of the measure is to achieve a legitimate 
objective; (b) the measure does not operate to impair unduly access 
to persons, goods, services or investment of a party that meet the 
legitimate objectives; (c) the measure is not more trade restrictive 
than necessary to achieve that legitimate objective; and (d) the 
measure does not create a disguised reduction on trade.
<P>
	When that is put together and one thinks about the legitimate 
objectives that are allowed, one can clearly see that provincial 
governments can protect pretty well whatever they want under this 
legislation. For all intents and purposes, these provisions can be 
used in nearly every sector involved in interprovincial trade. How 
is this going to break down barriers? The answer is that it will not.
<P>
	It reminds me of the Ukrainian matrioska dolls. Every time one 
is opened, there is another one. It is a very frustrating process 
getting to the prize.
<P>
	At a recent round table discussion hosted by the Certified 
General Accountants of Canada, I asked senior government 
officials involved in this agreement if they could identify a trade 
barrier that could not be considered a legitimate objective. They 
were unable to identify a clear example of a trade barrier that could 
not be at least considered as a legitimate objective. This spells out 
to me that there are very few instances where establishing a 
legitimate objective exemption is not possible.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	It is obvious from the ample access to exemptions that disputes 
between parties are bound to arise. Included in each sector is a 
series of procedures intended to resolve disputes between the 
parties, except in the following sectors: energy, agriculture and the 
``MASH'' sector,  which is made up of municipalities, academic 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2701"> 2701 </A></B>
<P>
institutions, schools and hospitals. These areas of exclusion are 
another story for another time.
<P>
	When a dispute arises, the parties are to enter into consultations 
in order to attempt to rectify the problem. If that is not successful, 
then the parties apply for a request for consultations between 
governments. At this level any party who has a vested interest in 
the outcome of the consultations is able to participate.
<P>
	If that procedure is unsuccessful, then the issue is brought to the 
committee. That body is comprised of ministers from the 13 
signing governments that were responsible for drawing up this 
agreement. If the procedure is unsuccessful, then the parties may 
submit a written request for a panel of experts to preside over their 
dispute. The panel is comprised of five individuals chosen from a 
roster of 65 experts: that is, five appointed panellists from each 
government body. From this roster each party shall select two 
panellists who shall, in turn, elect the chair.
<P>
	Will this dispute settlement mechanism work? We do not know. 
According to Stephen Van Houten, president of the Canadian 
Manufacturers' Association, the agreement on internal trade is 
highly bureaucratic. There is no binding enforcement measure. 
There is little chance of a successful outcome for aggrieved 
businesses. There are no awards for damages. There is no right of 
action without the consent of the attorney general. Decisions to 
withhold consent need to be explained or reviewed. In short, there 
is no effective dispute settlement mechanism.
<P>
	The dispute settlement mechanism consists of two avenues of 
recourse: a government to government resolution process and the 
individual to government process. The second process is a positive 
addition which needs to be enhanced in order to heighten the access 
of individuals to the panel.
<P>
	Currently individuals are required to be represented by their 
respective party. This constitutes either a provincial government or 
the federal government, depending on the jurisdiction in question. 
The individual must be able to convince that government to take up 
the cause for them. It seems to me that most Canadians do not feel 
comfortable in relying on a government bureaucracy to go to bat 
for them.
<P>
	To summarize the dispute settlement mechanism, the emphasis 
of this form of settlement is on consultation and mediation between 
governments. If this consultation fails, the disputing parties are to 
resort to an ad hoc panel of appointed experts. There is no binding 
enforcement of the process through the awarding of damages, an 
injunction or some other form of penalty. The mechanism does, 
however, provide for private parties to launch a complaint against 
governments and for public consumption of panel proceedings.
<P>
	The decisions of these panels are not binding. They serve as 
recommendations. The only means of enforcement available under 
the agreement is through public humiliation and public pressure. If 
the party refuses to comply with the panel recommendation their 
non-compliance is made public by the internal trade secretariat. 
This remains on the committee agenda for the period of one year. If 
at the end of that year the party has yet to comply, retaliatory action 
may be pursued.
<P>
	Will this dispute settlement mechanism process work? I say that 
we should give it a chance. We should give it a try. However, it 
seems highly unlikely because retaliation will often cost less than 
the actions in question.
<P>
	For the reasons I have addressed today and for the many others 
which I do not have time to address, I cannot support Bill C-19. 
The bill implements the agreement on internal trade which is 
flawed and incomplete. The government says it will fix the 
legislation in the future. The lack of action is costing Canadians 
now. The government often preaches that it is interested in 
Canadians having jobs, yet it refuses to act quickly to fix a problem 
which can be fixed if the proper commitment is there.
<P>
<B>(1340 )</B>
<P>
	This agreement does not fulfil the need. It serves as an ideal or a 
goal which may some day be attained. The energy, the MASH, and 
agriculture sectors of the agreement have yet to be dealt with at all. 
The list of provincial exemptions is growing by leaps and bounds. 
The 13 governments need to get together again to construct an 
agreement which eliminates unreasonable protections for each of 
the governments' special interests.
<P>
	I have described to the House the important role internal trade 
plays in the lives of Canadians. I have described a few of the 
shortcomings of this agreement: its lack of enforceability, 
credibility and accessibility. I have explained how to bring about 
change to make the agreement effective and accountable.
<P>
	The agreement falls short of its objective. We have been 
encouraged to support the bill as a step in the right direction. We 
have been promised that the best is yet to come. This may be true. 
For the sake of Canadian jobs and business, I hope that it is. 
Unfortunately, the Liberal government has fallen short on its 
promises before. The fact that it has missed numerous deadlines set 
out in this agreement speaks for itself.
<P>
	I want internal trade barriers removed. Canadian business wants 
internal trade barriers removed. Canadians looking for jobs want 
these barriers removed. This government and provincial 
governments say that they want internal trade barriers removed. 
Therefore, I say to the Liberal government: Do it and do it now.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with great pleasure that I join my colleagues today in speaking to 
Bill C-19, an act to implement the agreement on internal trade in 
Canada.
<P>
	I am proud to participate in this debate, as this is a very 
important legislation, however arid and technical it may be. The 
bill affirms the principle, with which we agree, that internal trade 
should be liberalized as much as possible and that any kind of tariff 
barrier that exists should be removed as much as possible.
<P>
	I must say that it was about time that Canada, as a political and 
economical entity, and that Canadians come to an agreement 
because it was becoming increasing obvious that Canada was 
getting along better with its neighbours than with its own 
provinces. Canada successfully negotiated a free trade agreement 
with the U.S. and, later, NAFTA, while it was having a great deal of 
trouble coming to an agreement on interprovincial tariff barriers.
<P>
	We agree with the principle of the bill. Especially since, as you 
probably recall, there was a huge irritant in that clause 9 used to 
give the federal government enormous powers that it had more or 
less assumed. Without consulting anybody, at a meeting held in 
western Canada, the federal government announced its intention to 
make all legitimate efforts to persuade a province whose attitude is 
deemed less co-operative than that of another.
<P>
	At the time, under clause 9, the government had given itself 
sweeping, excessive, disproportionate powers. As you probably 
recall, this prompted the then premier of Quebec, Jacques Parizeau, 
to describe this clause in particular and the bill as a whole, since it 
all hinged on clause 9, as ``trade war measures taken by Canada 
against Quebec's government in particular''.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	Mr. Paillé, the then Quebec Minister of Industry, Commerce and 
Technology, made the appropriate representations to his federal 
counterpart, asking him to exercise moderation and see to it that 
clause 9 and federal powers in this area be cut down to reasonable 
proportions instead of being so ridiculously excessive. If I am not 
mistaken, that is how the Quebec minister described the attitude of 
the federal government, which was taking advantage of the 
situation to increase its powers.
<P>
	As for us, we condemned as strongly as possible, both in the 
industry committee-of which I was then vice-chairman-and here 
in this House, the federal government's tendency to give itself 
inordinate powers. I do not want to brag but we succeeded at the 
time in talking some sense into the government and making it 
understand that the extent and ambiguous nature of the powers it 
was giving itself did not meet a real need and  were out of line with 
what Canadians then expected in this matter.
<P>
	We now have a clause 9 in which federal powers are more 
restricted, more reasonable, and in which all the parties, including 
the Quebec government, agree that an arbitrator is indeed needed in 
this area, thus giving the federal government some legitimate, 
consistent powers.
<P>
	Even if we agree with the bill in its present form, there are still 
two provisions that we are deploring but which have been 
maintained despite the representations made and the amendments 
put forward by the official opposition.
<P>
	The first of the two provisions we deplore is, again, clause 9, 
which provides that ``pursuant to Article 1710 of the Agreement, 
the Governor in Council-that is to say, the cabinet-may, by 
order'' and so on. This means that, in any tense situation or dispute 
between any two parties in Canada, the cabinet gives itself the right 
to settle the matter by issuing a direct order without going through 
the House. On the sly.
<P>
	We would have liked-we even moved an amendment to this 
end, but it was unfortunately rejected by the government-the 
representatives of the 10 provinces and 2 territories in Canada that 
signed the agreement who sit in the House of Commons to be able 
to participate in the debate, either on behalf of the defendant or on 
behalf of the plaintiff, to publicly present the arguments of each 
party in the public interest and for historical purposes so that, at the 
end of the day, there is a debate before the federal government can 
come down with a sledgehammer or with sanctions, as it is now 
entitled to do.
<P>
	We would have liked a debate to be held so that the elected 
representatives of the two parties involved-let us imagine, for 
example, that there is a dispute between Alberta and British 
Columbia-who sit in the House of Commons at the same time can 
participate in the debate and perhaps have some influence or 
ultimately put forward proposals. The dispute could then be settled 
in the best way possible and not by order, not on the sly, not in an 
arbitrary manner, as suggested by the current formula favoured by 
the government in this very important matter.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	It must be understood that we are talking about a recourse 
against an injuring party. Traditionally, there has been a manpower 
mobility problem here, at the Quebec-Ottawa border, since workers 
from one side of the river could not work on the other side, and vice 
versa. These are sensitive issues.
<P>
	The more discussions there are, the greater the chances of 
finding the most appropriate solution. Resorting to orders in 
council and acting on the sly or arbitrarily will certainly not 
improve the chances of finding the fairest possible solution.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2703"> 2703 </A></B>
<P>
	We generally support the bill, but we are also disappointed with 
clause 19, the wording of which is very expeditious. It reads as 
follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>19. Part III of the Motor Vehicle Transport Act, 1987 is repealed.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This may be a short sentence, but it has enormous consequences 
for a group of Quebec workers who made a lot of representations. 
These workers appeared before the industry committee to give their 
point of view. They also contacted the offices of the transport and 
industry ministers. Unfortunately, their efforts were in vain. I am 
referring to Quebec's bulk hauling truckers.
<P>
	After a long struggle, they managed to get a law finally passed in 
Quebec to regulate bulk transport. The province did a good job and 
things have been going smoothly in that industry for many years 
now. This is quite an improvement given the heated confrontations 
that took place before, including in the streets of Quebec City at 
one time, to develop public awareness regarding the issue of bulk 
transportation.
<P>
	With the repeal of Part III of the Motor Vehicle Transport Act of 
1987, there will now be two jurisdictions in the same sector of 
economic activity. Currently, bulk transport permits are issued by 
the Government of Quebec and conditions are quite strict. This is 
why things are now quiet in that sector.
<P>
	Part III of the Motor Vehicle Transport Act, 1987 being repealed, 
Quebec will now have another type of permit coming out of the 
woodwork. In other words, some people will have a federal bulk 
hauling permit without being subject to Quebec regulations.
<P>
	What is worrying some people, and justifiably so, is that there 
will be two types of shipper, with two types of permit, federal or 
Quebec. For your information, the Quebec permit is subject to very 
stringent regulations, and it has been eminently satisfactory to 
everyone since its inauguration several years ago. It suits truckers 
because it has restored tranquility, whereas from now on there can 
be people who are federally licensed and not subject to Quebec 
regulations. There is a huge risk of anarchy, because truckers 
subject to the Quebec regulations will be competing with others 
who are not.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	We have, however-the trucking companies even more than 
ourselves-tried to make the government, the industry and 
transport ministers, see reason on this. The Minister of Health was 
not involved in this debate unfortunately. He would no doubt have 
understood the situation, judging by the openmindedness we have 
seen in him.
<P>
	Unfortunately, we had to settle for dealing with the industry 
minister, the same one as today, as well as with the former Minister 
of Transport. These negotiations were fruitless and the bulk haulers 
will now have to live with this legislation, which-and we are only 
too pleased  to repeat this again and again-will jeopardize the 
peace there has been until now in this sector.
<P>
	There is a risk of anarchy, because there will be two types of 
operator: the ones subject to the unstructured and unregulated 
federal law and the ones with a permit from the Government of 
Quebec and covered by Quebec regulations, which to date have 
proven their worth. It most unfortunate once again that the 
government was not more open to representations from the official 
opposition on this.
<P>
	We support this bill, because we sovereignists feel it confirms 
the existence of and acknowledges the need for good economic 
relations and the future need for a partnership between the 
economic entities of Quebec and Canada, after sovereignty is 
achieved.
<P>
	The ties are so close, on this continent, between the economies 
of Quebec and Canada that it would make no sense not to equip 
ourselves to recognize the importance of these ties, first, and to 
make our economies competitive with the foreign economies we 
trade with and the strong economies challenging us, second.
<P>
	If I may, Mr. Speaker, I will continue later on. I will try to show 
the superficiality of this coast to coast agreement. It does not take 
long once you have to consider the interest of this entire economic 
territory for you to run out of breath and it leads to policies like the 
one just proposed by the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans on the 
fee structure of coast guard services. With this policy, there is no 
hesitation dividing Canada into three and setting fees arbitrarily 
without basis or consultation of the parties involved.

that the government has known for years about this problem-the

<P>
	We must understand that we have had 15 years of declining 
mineral reserves from 1980 to 1994. The recent slight increase in 
investments results almost entirely from only two discoveries: 
diamonds in the Northwest Territories and nickel in Labrador.
<P>
	Canada has the geology. We have reliable land tenure. But we do 
not have a simple, clear and timely system of government

	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, since this 
is national mines week, it is important to stress the economic, 
cultural and social contribution of this industry for several regions 
of Canada.
<P>
	For example, the mining sector shaped the development of 
several Quebec regions, particularly in the north, where I lived for 
a number of years. To this day, the mining industry remains a major 
economic development tool. Year in year out, mining shipments 
total between $2.5 and $3 billion. The mining industry is also a 
major employer, including in rural areas.
<P>
	To be sure, the challenge for this sector is to turn to high 
technology and thus contribute-

<P>
	Mr. Carteri's students rarely go home from the Canada-wide

competitions like these not only widen the students' academic 
horizons but also expose them to the corporate world through 
business scholarships.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B>Mr. 
Speaker, there is no minister present and the Prime Minister is not 
here, how are we supposed to have a question period in this House?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleague, we do not generally make 
reference to hon. members' presence or absence.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime 
Minister and concerns the federal government's plan to prevent 
Quebecers from having a democratic say in their future.
<P>
	My question is, therefore, for the Prime Minister, or one of the 
other referendizers, although I see none of them around either. So I 
will ask somebody to answer for them because Quebecers are 
waiting for a government answer.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier: </B>I trust that they will heed what the Prime 
Minister wrote in his book entitled <I>In the Lion's Den</I>. In it, the 
Prime Minister of Canada wrote that if they lost, they would 
respect Quebecers' wish and accept separation. That is what the 
Prime Minister of Canada wrote.
<P>
	My question then-
<P>

	<B>Ms. Fry:</B> Get to the question.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Picard:</B> They do not like to hear that, do they?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier: </B>No, they do not like to hear that, Mr. Speaker, 
the-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would ask the Leader of the Opposition to please 
get to his question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	Having stated he would respect Quebecers' wishes and accept 
separation, could the Prime Minister or somebody else on his 
behalf explain whether, having jumped into bed with Guy Bertrand 
to deny Quebecers' right to decide their own future, he is not now 
denying what he himself wrote not that long ago?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, first of all, we do recognize the 
right of the people of Quebec to express themselves democratically 
in a referendum. We deeply respect that right. But the Quebec 
attorney general has said something more. In the Bertrand case, the 
Quebec attorney general said that the Constitution and the courts 
had nothing to do with the process of Quebec's achieving 
independence.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	We believe in the rule of law in Canada. As the attorney general 
of Canada, it is my responsibility to take part in the Bertrand case, 
not in order to back Mr. Bertrand, but in order to respond to the 
position taken by the attorney general of Quebec against the rule of 
law in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government's action must be interpreted as a 
challenge to Quebecers' right to decide their future themselves. 
The government is trying to subordinate this right of Quebecers to 
a decision by the courts.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister realize that, with this action and by 
trying to join forces with Guy Bertrand, not only is he launching a 
direct attack on sovereignist Quebecers, that is obvious, he is 
attacking all of Quebec including his former partners on the no side 
in the latest referendum?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, those who know our position know 
this is not true. As I said, we recognize the right of the people of 
Quebec to express themselves in a referendum. It is another matter 
entirely, however, when the attorney general of Quebec says the 
Constitution may be nullified by popular vote. It is not true, and I 
cannot, as attorney general of Canada, stand on the sidelines in the 
light of the position of the attorney general of Quebec.
<P>
	So, we decided to get involved in the matter, not to support Mr. 
Bertrand, but to support the rule of law. We have had the 
opportunity since last August to become involved in Mr. Bertrand's 
case and we decided not to. It is not our intention to support Mr. 
Bertrand; we are there only to support the rule of law and the 
Constitution of Canada for all Canadians, including Quebecers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Justice is knocking himself into a cocked 
hat in an effort to prove he is not supporting Guy Bertrand, but 
everyone in Quebec knows, everyone in Canada knows, that the 
federal government is joining forces with Guy Bertrand to please 
the rest of Canada.
<P>
	Since he is so good at explanations, perhaps he would explain 
why the Prime Minister told Quebecers, before the latest 
referendum, that a yes would mean an irreversible outcome, when 
he had planned at that point a legal challenge to the right of 
Quebecers to decide their future? Perhaps he could explain.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, you have to look at the facts. The 
facts are that we did not get involved in Mr. Bertrand's case to 
support Mr. Bertrand. We have had the opportunity to become 
involved since last August.
<P>
	It was only once the attorney general of Quebec said, a few 
weeks ago, that the Constitution did not apply to Quebec's move to 
independence that we decided it was necessary to become involved 
on behalf of Canadians and the rule of law.
<P>
	The hon. Leader of the Opposition can say what he said today, 
but it is not right. The facts are clear. We decided to take part in this 
matter only in response to the position taken by the attorney 
general of Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, at the time of the last referendum campaign, the Prime 
Minister told Quebecers, so that they would vote no, that their 
decision was irreversible and that he would respect their decision. 
Now, six months later, he is launching his government into a court 
challenge to deny Quebecers the right to decide on their future 
democratically.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister 
admit that the strategy he has adopted is one of confrontation, the 
sole purpose of which is to provoke the people of Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the 
federal government recognizes clearly that referendums are a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2709"> 2709 </A></B>
<P>
means for the public to express its opinion, and there is no doubt 
that democratic means  such as referendums are open to Quebec, as 
they are open to Canada.
<P>
	It is also clear that the Constitution of a country is not and cannot 
be amended through a referendum in just one part of a country, and 
that constitutional law and the internal law of a country are the laws 
that govern popular decisions and that allow constitutions to be 
changed. In this case, the Constitution and internal law indicate 
what means we may take to change the Constitution.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would remind the minister that Quebec never signed the 
1982 Constitution and its amending formula.
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister offer any justification for his 
constitutional about-face other than that he has now decided to 
implement Plan B, a hard line approach with Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, our 
goal has always been to reconcile Quebecers of all stripes with the 
rest of Canada, and to pass legislation and implement policies that 
will allow us to improve the well being of Quebecers and 
Canadians alike.
<P>
	As a Quebecer, I must say that it is clear-
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> We will show you 
the Verdun tape, we have it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Massé:</B> I see that the Bloc Quebecois is reduced to negative 
slurs. Unfortunately, I must point out that when they say we are 
getting into bed with Mr. Bertrand, they are insulting one of their 
own former colleagues who saw clearly that PQ doctrine did not 
correspond to the needs of Quebecers. This is what makes us 
federalists, and Mr. Bertrand very clearly realized that the Bloc 
Quebecois's goals and policies run counter to the interests of 
Quebecers.

	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Justice. It relates to the government's 
decision to intervene in the Bertrand case.
<P>
	I think it is important that the minister has recognized the 
importance of defending the rule of law, without which the 
democratic process has no meaning.
<P>
	To clarify fully the government's position, is it the position of 
the Government of Canada that any change to the constitutional 
status of a province would have to be done legally and would 
require under the amending formula the consent of all provinces?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is our position that any change in 
the make-up of the country would have to be done legally. As to the 
precise mechanics or dynamics, that is a matter of discussion even 
among academic and constitutional experts. I do not think it is 
possible to be categorical in saying exactly what protocol is 
required.
<P>
	However, it is terribly important to emphasize, as is implicit in 
the hon. member's question, that democracy and the exercise of 
democratic freedoms go hand in hand with the rule of law. It is 
possible to exercise democratic freedoms only when the rule of law 
is firmly in place.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	No one should think that mere adherence to the rule of law 
means change cannot take place. Change can happen effectively in 
a stable and orderly way only when the rule of law prevails, which 
is the approach we have taken to this issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that 
was a question I first asked the government on October 17, 1994. 
The government declined at the time to answer it, saying it was 
strictly hypothetical. It is good we are now answering it but I wish 
the government had more precise answers to the specifics on this 
issue.
<P>
	My supplementary question is also from that date. The hon. 
member for Vancouver Quadra has written that the federal 
government today retains its full constitutional options to allow or 
not to allow a referendum vote, to control the content wording of 
any referendum question, to control the actual timing of any vote 
and to launch its own pre-emptive nationwide referendum legally 
superseding any Quebec vote.
<P>
	Do these statements reflect the position or the constitutional 
thinking of the Government of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if I understand the hon. member's 
question, it is the right of any provincial government to test the 
popular will of the population by putting a question in a 
consultation process through a referendum.
<P>
	I think what is brought into sharp focus by the position taken by 
the attorney general of Quebec in the Bertrand litigation is the 
effect of such a consultative vote. It was implicitly said by the 
Quebec attorney general in the Bertrand litigation that should such 
a referendum, if it results in a positive vote, can supplant or replace 
the Constitution and the rule of law so that they have no application 
to the consequences.
<P>
	To that we take direct and substantial opposition. We have 
involved ourselves in the litigation for the purpose of responding to 
that position as expressed by the attorney general of Quebec.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2710"> 2710 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Once again, Mr. 
Speaker, we support the intervention in this case, but I think it 
is fair to point out that we expect it would be done and will be 
done in a broader policy framework on all of these questions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	On a supplementary, Mr. Speaker, the fear in Quebec is that the 
federal government would use the rule of law to deny the political 
and democratic will.
<P>
	Will the minister confirm unequivocally that the political will of 
Quebecers, as expressed legally and democratically, will be 
respected and that the federal government will negotiate in good 
faith?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board </B><B>and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> It is obvious, Mr. 
Speaker, that the federal government respects any wishes clearly 
expressed by the people.
<P>
	It is also obvious that two referendums were held on the issue of 
Quebec's separation. Each time, the people of Quebec clearly 
indicated they did not want to separate.
<P>
	If the idea is to get a definitive answer, I cannot help but wonder 
why the no vote does not constitute a definitive answer. Why does 
the Bloc Quebecois not accept the will very clearly expressed by 
Quebecers? They should stop fostering political uncertainty in 
Quebec, promoting unemployment across the province and causing 
problems to all Quebecers on something on which they have 
expressed their will twice already, both times voting no.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the President of the Treasury Board talks about 
reconciling Quebecers and Canadians, but he should be concerned 
about reconciling federalists. Indeed, Daniel Johnson, the leader of 
the no side in Quebec, does not agree with the federal government. 
He recognizes the right of the people of Quebec to determine their 
own future. The federal government must be really desperate to 
make an ally of Guy Bertrand.
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
	I want to ask the President of the Treasury Board, who said that 
the people of Quebec-those are the words he used-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe: </B>You can bet the Prime Minister will have another 
version tomorrow.
<P>
	He said: ``You have to right to express yourselves, you have the 
right to say what you want to be, you have the right to say that 
Quebec must become a sovereign country, but you must first ask 
for the permission of the rest of Canada''. Is this what he is saying? 
I remind him  that when Newfoundland joined the Confederation, it 
never asked Quebecers whether they agreed or not with that 
decision.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
there is a people of Quebec like there is an Abenaki people, a Cree 
people and an Inuit people. I hope Quebecers will not deny the 
existence of the Abenaki or Inuit people.
<P>
	The will of the public must clearly be subject to the laws of a 
national assembly and to a constitution. When there is a 
constitution in a country, the first democratic duty of citizens it to 
comply with the law that dictates the major policies in their 
country. This is what I am asking the Bloc Quebecois to do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would point out to the minister that the first province to 
recognize the aboriginal nations was Quebec, on March 20, 1885, 
well before Ottawa.
<P>
	The minister can try all he likes to justify himself, but the 
government's argument does not wash. This minister is part of a 
government that has lost the trust not just of Canadians, but also of 
Quebecers, because of its performance with the GST, its bizarre 
attitude with the army and its minister, its broken promises on 
discrimination, and the hopeless state of constitutional affairs.
<P>
	Let the minister admit that the sole purpose of this strategy is to 
revamp the government's image in English Canada, because it 
needs it and, as usual, to do so under the leadership of the Prime 
Minister. This is a man who is accustomed to renewing his image at 
Quebec's expense, as he has done throughout his political career.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
clearly, the Bloc Quebecois thinks that insults are their best 
argument today. In fact, it is their best argument, because if they 
are saying that they have recognized the peoples living in Quebec, 
such as the native peoples, then why do the native peoples not have 
the right, through a referendum as they are saying, to become 
sovereign themselves?
<P>
	We can see only too well that their arguments make no sense and 
that it is therefore necessary to have a law setting out citizens' 
rights and the manner in which they may be expressed.

	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the results 
of a recent plebiscite in Alberta demonstrate that grain farmers 
want to have the choice to market their grain outside the Canadian 
Wheat Board.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2711"> 2711 </A></B>
<P>
	In response, Alberta's minister of agriculture has presented the 
idea of buying grain from farmers for $1 per load in Alberta and 
selling it to farmers for $1 per load in the United States. This 
proposal is meant to get around the roadblock thrown in the way 
by the Canadian Wheat Board. This would in effect allow farmers 
the choice they voted for in the Alberta plebiscite.
<P>
	Will the minister of agriculture move quickly and allow Alberta 
farmers the choice they demanded in the plebiscite?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleague for the question.
<P>
	The export of Canadian grain still remains a federal legislative 
responsibility. It is not proper for a province to take on unilaterally 
a decision which would affect grain farmers right across the 
prairies, which would affect their livelihood.
<P>
	Over the last several weeks the panel we have set up looking at 
the grain question has had opportunity listen to the concerns of 
every province, including Alberta, and to the problems of all the 
producers. It is coming out with a report in June.
<P>
	We will look at the report. We are certainly concerned about the 
whole issue of grain across the country.
<P>
<B>(1440 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, you have to 
wonder if anybody on that side of the House has a clue as to what is 
going on in western Canada. Study, study, study and still no answer.
<P>
	Alberta farmers have already spoken on this issue. The 
minister's refusal to act is costing farmers about $2 a bushel at a 
time when they desperately need money to plant their crops. Why 
will this minister not act for a change? Farmers need the money 
now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is very clear 
that the minister has acted. He put together a panel to study the 
grain issues in this country and he is making certain that every 
voice is heard. He is making certain that this grain panel has the 
opportunity to report back to the government before action is taken.
<P>
	It is proper when a panel or a group is put in place to give it time 
for its consultations and to listen to its recommendations.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	On October 24 in the Verdun auditorium, the Prime Minister 
stated that he agreed with the Quebec people's  desire for change. 
He went on to say, and I quote: ``I supported that position in the 
past, I support it today, and I will support it in the future, whatever 
the circumstance''.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister reconcile his smooth talk on the eve 
of the referendum with his current attempt to deprive the Quebec 
people of their fundamental right to decide their own future?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
again, it is not a matter of depriving the Quebec people of their 
fundamental right to decide their own future.
<P>
	What is essential in this desire for change is that governments, 
whether it is the Government of Canada or the provincial 
governments, put in place policies that are more in line with the 
needs and expectations of their people.
<P>
	If you look at our government's throne speech, you will see that 
we indicated our intention to effect the changes needed either in the 
economic union or in the social union to better meet the needs of 
Canadians. That is what a good government does and that is what 
we did in the past and will continue to do in the future.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the past is any indication of the future, what awaits 
Quebecers in the future is an unemployment rate even higher than 
today.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister admit that the reason for his about-face 
is his fear of losing the next referendum? Now that they know they 
almost lost it, they are really afraid of losing the next one.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
again, what is at issue in this case is which government policies 
will help Canadians, including Quebecers, better deal with the 
problems of tomorrow. That is what people are afraid of. Yes, the 
matter of the referendum does increase uncertainty in Quebec, 
reduce investment and aggravate unemployment, and that is what 
people are afraid of.
<P>
	As those who conduct door-to-door polls in the Montreal ridings 
realize, people know that the option advocated by the Bloc 
Quebecois and the Parti Quebecois reduces the number of jobs, 
reduces investment in Quebec, reduces their income, and that is 
what they are afraid of. What they want is good government and 
not the uncertainty of a referendum.

<P>
	He knows if land claims go the way of the Nisga'a deal, then 50 
per cent of the fish catch will go to native only fisheries. Will the

by buying licences from those who exit the fishery and essentially 
give the salmon a better chance.

believe that he is in cahoots with B.C. Premier Clark on this issue.
<P>
	The premier is prepared to give away one-half of the catch. The 
minister is prepared to reduce the fleet by one-half. The ratio of 
boats to fish will not change.
<P>
	Will the minister come clean and admit that the real agenda of 
the government is to transfer the right to catch fish from one group 
to another?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am delighted that the hon. member is under the 
impression that Mr. Clark is helping me with this plan.
<P>
	I am delighted to move forward. If Mr. Clark is happy to help me 
with support in one area, fish habitat, because protecting fish 
habitat against damage caused by logging, mining, highway 
construction and urban development are certainly areas where I 
could do with some help.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for raising the subject. I look forward to 
any help that Premier Clark can give me on this plan.

	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister, wherever he may be, wherever 
he may be hiding.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The question please, dear colleague.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne:</B> Mr. Speaker, here is my question. Is the Prime 
Minister aware that, by jumping into bed with Guy Bertrand, he is 
directly in opposition to the person who was the head of the Quebec 
no side during the referendum?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Prime Minister, 
who is in Quebec, I would like to say first of all that our 
participation in the case before the courts in Quebec City this week 
is not to support Mr. Bertrand, but to support the rule of law.
<P>
	I think it is very important to emphasize that the rule of law is 
what gives stability to the country, Quebec included, for the people 
of Quebec. Democracy and the rule of law are directly linked. I 
think this is very important, and that is why we are involved in this 
case before the courts.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, where 
is the government headed with its strategy, a strategy which denies 
democracy, while at the same time going up against its former 
Quebec allies on the no side?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, they talk of democracy. A 
referendum can be held in order to determine the opinion of the 
population. That is democracy.
<P>
	But it is not democratic to say, once such a consultative 
referendum has been held, that the Constitution as a whole, the rule 
of law in this country, have been removed or nullified. That is not 
democracy. It is antidemocratic to say such a thing, and we are 
before the courts in Quebec City this week simply in order to 
support the principle that, above all, in Canada we have the rule of 
law, which applies for the good of all Canadians.

	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the

Speaker, earlier today the member of Parliament for Ottawa Centre 
and five other citizens of Canada filed with the director of 
investigations and research a request, pursuant to section 9 of the 
Competition Act, for an inquiry into gas pricing in Canada.
<P>
	Today the director has initiated a formal inquiry, pursuant to 
section 10 of the act in response to the section 9 request.
<P>
	The member for Ottawa Centre and other members who have 
raised this issue deserve credit for taking some initiative in this and 
for filing the appropriate request for an inquiry. The director will 
investigate. If he finds evidence he will act accordingly.
<P>
	I point out to the House that as recently as this January he was 
successful in obtaining a conviction under the Competition Act and 
a fine of $50,000 was levied against Mr. Gas here in Ottawa for the

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
apparently the Department of Fisheries and Oceans is setting its 
nets to catch another $14 million a year by taxing boats across the 
country, including recreational boats. This will apply to previously 
untaxed vessels such as small motor boats, sailboats and even 
rowboats.
<P>
	I am not sure if the tax will be so much an oar, so much a seat or 
so much a mile. Regardless, my question is about the $14 million. 
Is this supposed to address a safety issue? Is it merely a pain in the 
oar, or is this just another tax grab?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this is a serious matter. In Ontario alone, there were 
four deaths involved in recreational boating this past weekend.
<P>
	The idea of recreational boating fees is based on marine safety. 
The industry has suggested that government may want to help by 
making sure that those who go on the water, whether in a small boat 
or a large boat, are first trained in safety and have the qualifications  
and the training courses that are necessary to ensure that the loss of 
life, be it on salt water or freshwater, is kept to a minimum. We 
hope to be able to contribute in that area.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
safety is a big issue but obviously taxes are also a big issue.
<P>
	In the March throne speech, the government was very clear that 
there would be no new taxes. Since then we have had tax increases 
on fishermen, tax increases on cassette decks, tax increases on 
retirement and now a new tax on rowboats.
<P>
	The throne speech said one thing, the government is doing 
another. Is this broken promise another act of God or are we merely 
heading into uncharted waters looking for more tax revenue?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am sure the hon. member is not suggesting that he is 
not in favour of more marine safety. Is he suggesting that the 
taxpayer should pay it?
<P>
	We are using a policy which has been used before by this 
government, and which I am sure they have used in their budget 
suggestions: services that are provided to the public should not be 
paid for by the taxpayer but by those who use the service. That is 
the principle at issue here.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	Last week, barely five hours after the minister was questioned 
about the dubious arrest of Corporal Purnelle, seven charges were 
laid against the latter, because he allegedly defied the orders of a 
superior who wanted to prevent him from giving evidence before 
the Somalia commission.
<P>
	How does the minister justify the fact that, five hours after he 
stated in this House that no member of the army was or would be 
prevented from giving information to the commission of inquiry, 
seven charges were laid against this corporal, who had the courage 
to defy the order of his superiors and give evidence before the 
commission?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the answer I 
gave the hon. member for Charlesbourg last Wednesday and the 
answers of my parliamentary secretary on Friday are exactly the 
case.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2714"> 2714 </A></B>
<P>
	There is no incompatibility with coming forward, giving 
evidence to the commission and also obeying the rules and 
regulations of the Canadian Armed Forces. There is no 
incompatibility. I am surprised the hon. member is continuing to 
raise this question.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
think the minister and the parliamentary secretary are hiding 
behind the supposed military discipline, but this does not satisfy 
the people. I think the minister has no choice but to withdraw the 
charges against Corporal Purnelle.
<P>
	Otherwise, the minister will be telling other military personnel 
that they will be court-martialled if they co-operate with the 
commission to shed light on events in Somalia.
<P>
	Is this the message the minister wishes to send?
<P>
<B>(1455 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there are two 
messages to members of the Canadian Armed Forces. First, all of 
them, if they have evidence germane to the inquiry, are expected to 
come forward. The second is that as a member of the armed forces 
they are obligated to follow the rules and procedures of the 
National Defence Act. That is a condition of their service. There is 
no incompatibility between the two.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to follow up on the question of the hon. member for 
Charlesbourg.
<P>
	The Minister of National Defence instructed soldiers to bring 
forward any relevant evidence to the Somalia inquiry, promising 
there would be no reprisals. Corporal Michel Purnelle finds that 
hard to believe. He tried to appear before the commission but was 
arrested even after the commission had told military authorities it 
wanted to see him.
<P>
	Why is the minister, contrary to his assurances, permitting his 
department to intimidate witnesses?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was expecting 
to get this kind of question from the hon. member for 
Charlesbourg, but to get it from the hon. member for 
Saanich-Gulf Islands, a former colonel in the armed forces, who 
knows full well everything that should be known about the military 
justice system, is to me quite disheartening.
<P>
	The fact is there is a military justice system. People are obliged 
to follow the rules. They are also obliged to come forward to give 
evidence to the inquiry. There is no incompatibility here.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
at this moment the military justice system is under a bit of a cloud 
and I think the minister should simply reassure us.
<P>
	In a letter to the commission, Corporal Purnelle said that he felt 
vulnerable to abuse of power and was even fearful of physical 
violence because he had come forward. The minister must send a 
clear signal to his department about openness.
<P>
	To prove that he will tolerate no interference with this public 
inquiry, will he ensure that Corporal Purnelle's future career is not 
adversely affected by having come forward? What will he do to 
ensure that military authorities do not again hinder or intimidate 
potential witnesses?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have stated in 
the House before that no one would suffer any reprisals for coming 
forward to the commission. That message has been sent loud and 
clear.
<P>
	The hon. member asked for a clear message. What could be 
clearer than the Minister of National Defence publicly stating in 
the House of Commons that all members of the armed forces have 
an obligation to come forward and that there will be no reprisals?
<P>
	However, the minister cannot and will not interfere in the 
judicial process which is taking place.

<P>
	Could the minister indicate if the demonstration project will be

Development.
<P>
	He will know that while in opposition he and his Liberal 
colleagues opposed Conservative cuts to UI that were not as deep 
as those they are pushing through the House today. Indeed, the 
minister's predecessor said the Tory cuts made Margaret Thatcher 
look like Mother Theresa by comparison.
<P>
	As the red book committed the Liberals to restore public trust 
and confidence in government, would the minister tell the House 
how public trust and confidence in government can possibly be 
restored with such an about-face on UI?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what is important to recognize 
in all of this, and I am sure the hon. member is aware of it, is that 
we have gone through two years of discussions and consultations 
across the country on the reforms to the employment insurance 
program. I do not think very many pieces of legislation in the 
history of this place have been subjected to the same kind of 
scrutiny.
<P>

been very positive from the exercise has been the tremendous

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="AGREEMENTONINTERNALTRADEIMPLEMENTATIONACT">AGREEMENT ON INTERNAL TRADE 
IMPLEMENTATION ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-19, 
an act to implement the agreement on internal trade, be read the 
third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
conclude by repeating the remarks I was making concerning the 
establishment of a coast guard fee structure.
<P>
	Before the ink has even dried on this internal trade agreement, 
supposedly designed to stimulate commercial activity, hence 
strengthening economic and trade ties between various parts of 
Canada, a fee structure is imposed by the coast guard for services 
provided by ships operating in Canadian waters, which will only 
create division at a time when efforts are made to effect economic 
unification once and for all. As a result, three main regions will be 
created-the western region, the central region and the 
maritimes-with three completely different tariffs. This in itself 
flies in the face of the political will expressed at the time the 
agreement was signed.
<P>
	This goes to show how difficult it is to run this country-it is a 
virtually impossible task-and the lack of a cooperative spirit.
<P>
	In conclusion, one can say without fear of being mistaken that 
the federal government is dealing a blow to Quebec, to the people 
living along the St. Lawrence, to all the ports along the St. 
Lawrence, where 85 per cent of Quebecers live, without consulting 
even the most influential of stakeholders, who come from the City 
of Montreal, for example, from the entire urban community in both 
Montreal and Quebec City, who made representations again last 
week, in addition to the private users who came to testify and the 
representatives of aluminum plants and logging operations.
<P>
	They told the government: ``Do not impede our ability to 
compete with foreigners''. The government retreated into silence 
and arbitrary measures. They continued in that direction, deciding 
last Thursday to impose the first stage in the new fee schedule, $20  
million, and in the process sacrificing the political will that was 
supposed to exist in this agreement.
<P>
	In spite of the fact that there was no real consultation, and this 
was strongly criticized, the minister is relying on a study called 
IBI, which is in fact a survey. This study was condemned by all 
those who appeared before the committee. Of 49 witnesses, 37 
asked for a moratorium, so that the situation can be examined to 
find out once and for all the economic impact of this measure on 
users and to make a true description of services provided to users, 
given that the government wants to tax them. Make no mistake 
about it: this is a tax. It must also be demonstrated that the Coast 
Guard did undergo a self-imposed streamlining exercise, as it 
claims to have done, given that the majority of the witnesses doubt 
that this is the case.
<P>
	In conclusion, signing this agreement and imposing this new fee 
structure both confirm, yet again, this government's lack of vision.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Lincoln, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
speak on Bill C-19, an act to implement the agreement on internal 
trade.
<P>
	With all the issues we are faced with today, we may sometimes 
lose sight of how important trade is to Canada. From its very 
beginnings Canada has been a trading nation. It is the lifeblood of 
the country. The well-being of all Canadians depends on our ability 
to create and profit from competitive trading environments at home 
and abroad.
<P>
	In the international arena we have been successful in negotiating 
and participating in a number of multilateral trading agreements. 
We are a founding partner in the North American Free Trade 
Agreement which has opened up our trading with the U.S. and 
Mexico.
<P>
	Canada is a member of other trade organizations such as the 
WTO and GATT. We understand the need for formal agreements to 
set out rules that ensure fair trade between nations and that allow 
redress when a country fails to live up to the obligations it has 
accepted.
<P>
	While we have long accepted the need to have rules of order and 
to have mechanisms to settle trade disputes on the international 
front, until recently we did not come to grips with the need to 
establish a framework to govern trade between provinces and 
territories within Canada.
<P>
	We have that framework now in the agreement on internal trade. 
This bill, by making necessary and appropriate legislative changes 
within the federal jurisdiction, will enable the federal government 
to meet its obligations under the agreement and do its part to ensure 
the agreement is fully implemented.
<P>
	The agreement on internal trade was signed by the Prime 
Minister and all other first ministers in July 1994.  The agreement 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2718"> 2718 </A></B>
<P>
is a made in Canada agreement to govern trade between provinces 
and territories and to open the domestic market to the freer flow of 
goods, services, people and capital.
<P>
	The agreement provides a comprehensive set of rules that 
requires the reduction of existing ones and which prohibits the 
erection of new trade barriers. The agreement also sets out specific 
obligations in ten economic sectors.
<P>
	It makes undertakings to streamline and harmonize regulations 
and standards between provinces and territories and has put in 
place a formal mechanism to resolve domestic trade disputes.
<P>
	One of the most important points is that the agreement on 
internal trade, which Bill C-19 implements at the federal level, 
contains a formal commitment from all its parties, that is, from all 
10 provinces and the territories as well as the federal government.
<P>
	The commitment is to continue the process of trade 
liberalization within Canada within the framework of the 
agreement.
<P>
	The need for this agreement has been well documented. We are 
all aware of examples of restricted trade practices or regulations 
which discriminate against certain businesses and labour groups.
<P>
	These measures range from outright restrictions to bidding on 
government contracts to regulations affecting the mobility of 
labour or professionals between provinces, to differing standards 
for food or beverage products from one jurisdiction to the other.
<P>
	We need to reduce these barriers through interprovincial trade in 
goods and services and to remove restrictions on the movement of 
people and capital within the domestic marketplace. The problems 
the agreement on internal trade is designed to address were built up 
over a long period.
<P>
	Since Confederation there has developed in Canada a tangle of 
measures both well intentioned and deliberately protectionist 
which have prohibited interprovincial trade and restricted the free 
flow of persons, goods and services and capital between provinces.
<P>
	Our government and all governments in Canada have come 
under strong pressures from the business community to change the 
scenario and to deal with the problems associated with internal 
barriers to trade and with the conflicting regulations on cross 
border flows of people and capital.
<P>
	We have had representations from many leading business groups 
such as the Chamber of Commerce, the Canadian Federation of 
Independent Business, the Canadian Construction Association and 
the Canadian Manufacturers' Association, to name a few.
<P>
	It is important to point out this is not just big business speaking 
out. Small and medium size enterprises also feel  the negative 
consequences of barriers to trade between provinces and territories. 
The criticism and pressure is not just that of isolated interest 
groups; it has come for sound economic reasons.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	These barriers put Canadians and Canadian businesses at a 
comparative disadvantage by restricting the size of the domestic 
marketplace, the ability to develop competitive skills as well as 
abilities that allow Canadian businesses to compete globally.
<P>
	In a time of increasing global competition and more open 
markets in other parts of the world this can have the additional 
negative impact of putting Canadian businesses at a disadvantage 
to international competitors even in our own marketplace. It is no 
wonder that a recent survey by the Canadian Chamber of 
Commerce found that 67 per cent of Canadian businesses thought 
governments were not moving fast enough to eliminate internal 
trade barriers and impediments.
<P>
	There is a cost to labour and to consumers. Overall it has been 
estimated that barriers to trade within Canada cost Canadians in the 
order of $7 billion annually in direct jobs and income loss. This 
problem has a direct impact on all parts of Canada and on all 
elements of society.
<P>
	Governments have become the subject of pressure from the 
internal market issue. The reason is that it is quite simply wrong for 
any Canadian government for whatever local politically expedient 
reason to discriminate against Canadians because of where they 
live or work, because of where they learned or developed their 
skills and first had them recognized, because of where they bank or 
do business or because of where they sell or manufacture their 
goods and services.
<P>
	The economic cost to Canada is high. Internal barriers and 
impediments tear at our national fabric. It is a cause for which 
governments must bear responsibility. We in the House can do 
something to help correct the situation by passing this bill. Internal 
trade is not just a federal government issue. It ranks high on the 
agenda of all of the provinces.
<P>
	When the provincial and territorial leaders met at the annual 
premiers conference in St. John's, Newfoundland they renewed 
their commitment to the objective of reducing barriers to the free 
movement of persons, goods, services and investment in Canada. 
This agreement belongs to all of its parties. Its implementation is 
the responsibility of all of its parties, not just that of the federal 
government.
<P>
	In order to address some misunderstandings of parts of the bill 
and to make manifest the intentions of the government, the 
Minister of Industry introduced amendments that made clear the 
exact scope for federal action under the agreement's dispute 
settlement procedures.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2719"> 2719 </A></B>
<P>
	The legislation before us now is the result of a long process 
of negotiation and consultation that has involved Canadians of 
different political persuasions and with different regional 
perspectives. Even with these different perspectives and priorities 
the result has been agreement on the basic rules and framework 
for ongoing intergovernmental co-operation on domestic trade and 
other economic issues. The agreement on internal trade has give 
us that framework. Bill C-19 meets the obligations of the federal 
government to implement that agreement.
<P>
	We must turn the page on what divides us and work toward 
economic solutions for Canadians. Together we can better meet the 
challenges and bring changes that are necessary. That is why this 
bill is important to all Canadians. That is why I support passage of 
this legislation through the House.
