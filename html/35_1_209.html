suggested to the House that we wait until we hear from the 
minister who was involved. Today the Minister of Health is with 
us and I have been informed that she has asked to make a 
statement.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to respond to a question of privilege which 
has been put before the House by the hon. member for Saint 
John.
<P>
	The question concerns the inclusion of a photograph of the 
hon. member in a report released by Health Canada on May 19 of 
this year. The motion is serious and it is important that the 
House be apprised of the facts involved. According to the 
information provided to me by my officials, after looking into 
the matter, they are as follows.
<P>
	The report contained the findings of an independent panel of 
experts which had been commissioned by Health Canada to 
assess the possible impacts of plain and generic packaging of 
tobacco products. I want to emphasize the independence of this 
panel. It was given the authority and responsibility to produce 
an objective and unbiased assessment of the issue. The research 
conducted by the expert panel included a visual image 
experiment. It was in this context that a photograph of the hon. 
member appeared.
<P>
	A private company was contracted by the panel to provide test 
pictures for this study. The company has advised that the method 
by which the photograph of the hon. member was selected is 
widely used in consumer image research and that it is not 
common practice to use release forms.
<P>
	In this instance images from a variety of public sources, 
including libraries, magazines, stock image inventories and 
images in the public domain were compiled by a student on work 
placement with the firm.  These images were then sorted and 
filed according to certain criteria which had been established by 
the panel. Final selections were made by the panel after it had 
reviewed all of the images.
<P>
	The company has confirmed that numerous images were seen 
throughout the sourcing and selection process by all members of 
the project team but that at no time did anyone recognize one of 
the photographs as being the member for Saint John.
<P>
	There are other points which I believe should be brought to 
the attention of the House. These pertain to several statements 
made by the hon. member when she rose on this question of 
privilege.
<P>
<B>(1010 ) </B>
<P>
	The first concerns the language used in the report to describe 
the photograph of the hon. member. The only description of that 
photograph is the one on page 91 of the report. Members will 
find that it does not correspond to the description that the hon. 
member has attributed to the report in her motion.
<P>
	The second concerns the suggestion that this incident is 
similar to a 1985 question of privilege which the hon. member 
cited in her motion. It is important that the House be aware that 
unlike the situation in 1985, the hon. member in this case is not 
identified in the expert panel report by name as a member of 
Parliament or in any other manner.
<P>
	The hon. member has asked for a public apology. I can inform 
the House that apologies were conveyed by all concerned 
without delay. I spoke to the hon. member and wrote to her 
within hours following the release of the expert panel report. I 
repeat today the regret that I expressed at that time.
<P>
	The company that provided the photograph in question issued 
a public apology as did the expert panel. Canadians were 
advised of these actions through a statement issued by my 
department to the news media that same day.
<P>
	The hon. member has also asked for an explanation of the 
events that accounted for the use of her photograph in the expert 
panel report. That explanation, which I have related here this 
morning, was provided in a letter to the hon. member which I am 
tabling today for the information of the House.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I thank the hon. Minister of Health 
for giving us the information. This circumstance carries quite 
a few ramifications for all sitting members of Parliament. As 
was suggested by the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands, 
I would like some time to review both the statements of the hon. 
member for Saint John and the hon. Minister of Health.
<P>
	After my deliberations, I will return to the House with a 
decision. I thank all members for their interventions.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemn the government's legislative agenda, which makes 
clear its intention to usurp provincial areas of jurisdiction and construct an

	He said: Madam Speaker, on this opposition day, the Bloc 
Quebecois is presenting the following motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemn the government's legislative agenda, which makes 
clear its intention to usurp provincial areas of jurisdiction and construct an 
entirely centralized state, as can be seen from Bills C-76, C-88, C-46 and C-91, 
all designed to take substantial powers away from Quebec and transfer them to 
the federal government.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	With this motion, the Bloc Quebecois, the official opposition, 
is seeking to denounce the extremely centralizing offensive 
launched by the present federal government. It also wants to 
show that the ultimate goal of the federal Liberals is to establish 
a de facto unitarian state in Canada. We have seen with recent 
federal pieces of legislation dealing more specifically with 
regional economic development, such as Bill C-46 on 
establishing the Department of Industry, Bill C-88 on 
interprovincial trade, Bill C-91 on redefining the Federal 
Business Development Bank, and Bill C-76 regarding certain 
dispositions concerning transfer payments to the provinces, the 
increasingly centralizing approach of the present federal 
government.
<P>
	This motion, which I present this morning on behalf of the 
Bloc Quebecois, is a warning to provincial governments to 
beware of the interference of the federal government with regard 
to regional economic development. I urge them to be vigilent 
and not to let some of their powers slip away as their provincial 
autonomy is put on the back burner because of the upcoming 
referendum in Quebec.
<P>
	Even though every single piece of legislation being presented 
by the federal government in the area of regional economic 
development has an impact on the political autonomy of all, this 
morning, I want to address my comments more specifically to 
my fellow Quebecers. Because they deny the specificity of 
Quebec, and the need for Quebec to have its own tools of 
development, it is in Quebec that federal centralizing measures 
hurt the most.
<P>
	One of the effects of the Constitution Act, 1982, the ``Canada 
Bill'', was to establish provincial equality where all provinces 
would be on the same level. It created a sort of egalitarianism 
which denied the Canadian duality and the very existence of the 
Quebec nation. It is on this kind of egalitarianism that they will 
base today's Canadian nationalism. Towards the end of the 
sixties, Pierre Elliott Trudeau came to power with a nationalistic 
vision that he would not give up in spite of repeated 
interventions. The establishment and development of a more 
unified Canadian economy had to be based on the rationalization 
of government operations and on the concentration of powers.
<P>
	In June 1978, in a context of unilateral patriation of the 
constitution, the federal government published a meaty 
declaration by Pierre Trudeau under the title <I>A Time for Action</I>. 
In fact, it was a very elaborate constitutional reform project. 
One can see from that declaration that, even though the 
Canadian people is the result of sociological and historical 
diversity and comprises the first nations, who have legitimate 
rights we must respect, two large linguistic groups and 
numerous cultural communities, the constitutional approach of 
the federal Liberals is essentially based on the primacy of 
citizens and individual freedoms.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13090"> 13090 </A></B>
<P>
	Therefore, and I am quoting part of that published 
declaration: ``The unity of Canada must transcend the 
identification Canadians have with provinces, regions and 
linguistic or other differences. -Each must feel that Canada, 
and the federal Parliament and government acting on his or her 
behalf, are the best guarantors of the security''.
<P>
	As member of the Bloc Quebecois, the official opposition, I 
say to my fellow Quebecers that such a declaration, such a 
statement of intent, threatens considerably the existence of the 
Quebec state and the Quebec nation and threatens also the 
economic development tools we want to give ourselves.
<P>
	The referendum failure of May 20, 1980, the failure of the PQ 
government's proposal, changed the circumstances. The federal 
government now enters into negotiations by taking the 
offensive; it starts by reminding us that decentralization is not a 
solution to Canada's problems and states that the Canadian 
federation sorely needs the federal government to ensure a 
strong economic management.
<P>
	The Canada Act, or Constitution Act of 1982, includes in the 
famous Charter of Rights and Freedoms, a formal amendment 
limiting the capacity of provincial governments to obstruct 
economic mobility and therefore extending federal jurisdictions 
to all essential matters necessary to preserve the economic 
union. The goal is to put an end to the many provincial 
initiatives which impede the mobility of production factors; in 
other words, Ottawa is trying to marginalise the provincial 
level.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	We find the same objective in the federal position on all the 
important questions relating to areas of shared jurisdiction.
<P>
	For example, Bill C-88, an act to implement the agreement on 
internal trade, signed by the provinces last summer and 
denounced by the official opposition, is a direct result of this 
highly centralizing outlook of the Canadian government, started 
by the federal Liberals. Bill C-88 gives the federal government 
powers which were never considered at the time the agreement 
was negotiated or signed, and embodies the extremely 
centralizing position of the federal Liberal government.
<P>
	Indeed, clause 9 of the bill goes way beyond the spirit of the 
agreement signed last summer. It reads as follows: ``For the 
purpose of suspending benefits or imposing retaliatory 
measures of equivalent effect against the province pursuant to 
Article 1710 of the Agreement, the Governor in Council may, by 
order, do any one or more of the following-'' What we are 
talking about, here, is an order in council. This is no laughing 
matter. Orders in council, or decrees, are generally the means 
used by totalitarian governments. What this clause says is that 
the Liberal government wants to govern by decree. Are we faced 
with the prospect of a Liberal dictatorship?
<P>
	Similarly, the text of clause 9 means that, if ever a party is 
recognized at fault pursuant to article 1710 of the 
agreement-and I would like to remind you, Madam Speaker, 
that article 1710 deals with retaliatory measures-the aggrieved 
party can take retaliatory measures against the other party which 
does not conform to the agreement.
<P>
	Now, the federal government, no matter whether it is part of 
the dispute or not, is taking it upon itself to impose retaliatory 
measures on all provinces, without distinction. As regards this 
bill, the federal government shows its intention of setting itself 
up, in the area of interprovincial trade, as both judge and party, 
of establishing, within this agreement, an enforcement power 
that would take the form of an order in council, which it alone 
can invoke, and of extending the application of federal laws to 
the provinces, as is mentioned in paragraph <I>(c)</I> of clause 9.
<P>
	Therefore, Madam Speaker, the fact that the government 
intends to govern by order in council and act as if it were in 
charge of interprovincial trade goes far beyond the spirit of the 
agreement that was reached by the provinces, last summer.
<P>
	The government is assuming too much retaliatory power 
through this clause. Indeed, it is assuming excessive power to 
take measures against all the residents of a province. Obviously, 
clause 9 of Bill C-88 does not go in the same direction as the 
current tendencies in international trade. This is all the more 
relevant since economic development is based on competitive 
development, which seeks to take advantage of the quality of the 
workforce, the infrastructure, and the savings associated with 
conglomeration and urbanization.
<P>
	It must be remembered that those levers come under 
provincial jurisdiction, since health, education, and land use 
planning come under provincial jurisdiction. By setting itself up 
as an arbitrator in international trade, under the Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms, and therefore Bill C-88, the federal 
government is impeding the development and the autonomy of 
provinces.
<P>
	The spirit of the unitary state, of centralizing federalism 
opposed to provincial identity, thus directly impeding directly 
the development of the people of Quebec, can also be found in 
Bill C-46. This enabling bill for the Department of Industry 
adds to duplication and overlap in Quebec, and deprives the 
state of Quebec of exclusive authority over regional economic 
development.
<P>
	Along these very centralizing lines, clause 8 of the bill 
specifies that the Minister of Industry of Canada, a minister 
from Ontario, is responsible for regional development in 
Ontario and in Quebec. This bill confirms the existence of 
overlap in regional development, by confirming the 
interventionism of the federal department of industry in an area 
over which Quebec has long claimed jurisdiction.
<P>
	Quebecers have a very different way of looking at their 
regional economic development needs. Decentralization  of 
budgetary envelopes and powers proposed by the Parti 
Quebecois is the answer that outlying regions in Quebec have 
long 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13091"> 13091 </A></B>
<P>
been waiting for in order to take charge of their own interests. 
This is a democratic vision of regional development which has 
nothing in common with the centralizing vision of the liberal 
government in Ottawa.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	Quebec does not want to see the development of its 16 
administrative regions based on an exclusively industrial vision 
controlled by the federal department of industry. Regional 
development forms the basis of a social covenant which rests on 
an understanding of all the needs of the various milieux which 
only regional stakeholders can understand well.
<P>
	I say to my Quebec compatriots that in the context of the 
referendum where they will have to decide on the political 
autonomy of Quebec, a negative answer to the proposal of the 
Quebec government team would mean accepting the 
centralizing federalism defined by Pierre Elliott Trudeau, and 
the end of the people of Quebec.
<P>
	Bill C-91 is another example of denial of the existence of the 
Quebec State. With this bill, the government seeks to rationalize 
and modernize the Federal Business Development Bank, words 
undoubtedly well suited to the market realities of the end of this 
century, but that fool no one as to the primary objective of the 
federal government, that is to interfere even more in matters of 
regional development in Quebec while increasing its 
involvement in the main mechanisms of economic development 
in Quebec.
<P>
	There is such a thing as a Quebec state. It is trying to create its 
own development instruments, despite the federal government's 
intrusive presence in economic development issues. The FBDB 
remains a parallel structure, an unacceptable example of 
administrative duplication. Several structures and programs 
addressing the needs of small business are already in existence 
in Quebec.
<P>
	The Société de développement industriel is an example, 
though it was not used efficiently under the Liberal government 
of Premier Robert Bourassa. Programs like production 
assistance, with a contribution reaching up to 35 per cent of 
capital expenditures for a minimum investment of $100,000, 
and the Reprise de la PME program, which offers loan 
guarantees covering up to 80 per cent of a financial institution's 
net loss, are tangible illustrations of the Quebec State's 
involvement in assistance to small business.
<P>
	Let us not forget the solidarity funds: the Fonds d'aide aux 
entreprises, which is managed by the regional development 
councils; the Fonds décentralisé de création d'emplois, 
managed by the Secrétariat au développement des régions; and 
Innovation (PME), managed by the ministry of industry, 
commerce, science and technology. All these attest as well that a 
very well balanced assistance structure exists already for small 
business in Quebec.
<P>
	In his last budget, the Minister of Finance of the Quebec State, 
Jean Campeau, claimed he would maximize the use of venture 
capital by increasing the number of regional funds and creating 
the Fonds de solidarité de la CSN. Among such regional funds, I 
want to mention SOLIDE, a venture capital fund created under a 
program called SOLIDEQ, the purpose of which is to promote 
local development. The SOLIDEQ program was created jointly 
by the Fonds de solidarité du Québec and the Union des 
municipalités régionales de comté du Québec.
<P>
	I cannot help mentioning the Caisses populaires Desjardins, 
that play an important role in the funding of small business by 
granting loans at the local community level. A network of 1,232 
caisses populaires everywhere, throughout Quebec, provides 
almost a quarter of all business loans in Quebec.
<P>
	So, this is what centralizing federalism is all about: parallel 
structures at outrageous costs that are directly responsible for 
the Canadian deficit. Centralizing federalism is responsible for 
the bankruptcy of the country.
<P>
	Furthermore, clause 20 of the bill allows the Federal Business 
Development Bank to conclude agreements directly with 
individuals or organizations. This means that the FBDB could 
conclude agreements, among other things, with the Conseils 
régionaux de développement, as the Federal Office of Regional 
Development wants. However, in Quebec, the Act respecting the 
Ministère du Conseil exécutif forbids organizations operating 
under provincial legislation to conclude agreements with the 
federal government without the minister's consent.
<P>
	Once again, the federal government is ignoring the Quebec 
government's existence and is shamelessly giving itself the 
power to act without consulting Quebec.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to conclude by reminding the House of 
some of the elements of Bill C-76 that represent extremely 
centralizing and anti-Quebec measures. Bill C-76, which deals 
with the implementation of certain provisions of the federal 
1995-96 budget, goes way beyond the scope of that fiscal year.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	Indeed, clause 48, without prior negotiation with the 
provinces, will result in a shortfall of $2.5 billion, with $650 
million in Quebec alone. Moreover, the implementation of the 
Canada health and social transfer will mean a shortfall of $4.5 
billion in 1997-98 for the provinces.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois, the official opposition, is also opposing 
this bill because it establishes a mechanism whereby the federal 
government, despite the fact that it does not have any 
constitutional jurisdiction over social programs, will be able to 
further interfere in these areas and impose national standards on 
Quebec.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13092"> 13092 </A></B>
<P>
	Bill C-76 maintains national health care standards while 
taking away all transfer payments and introduces new standards 
in social assistance and postsecondary education. If the 
provinces do not meet these standards, their funds will be cut 
off by Bill C-76.
<P>
	This arrogant kind of federalism does not decentralize powers 
in any way, as these national standards will limit the autonomy 
of the provinces in their own areas of jurisdiction. In addition, 
Quebec's distinct society will not recognize itself in the new 
national standards implemented from coast to coast in a sector 
as important to its cultural identity as education.
<P>
	In fact, many observers and analysts have confirmed that Bill 
C-76 relegates the provinces to a purely advisory role and does 
not give them a veto on the introduction of new national 
standards in their own areas of jurisdiction. For example, in an 
editorial published in Le Devoir, Lise Bissonnette says this: 
``Bill C-76 treats postsecondary education as a social program 
and allows Ottawa to apply national standards in this and other 
sectors. The most that the provinces, whose jurisdiction over 
education is very clearly stated in the Canadian Constitution, 
can expect is to be consulted''.
<P>
	For her part, Chantal Hébert wrote in the March 31 edition of 
<I>La Presse</I>: ``In the bill it tabled in the Commons to implement its 
February budget, the federal government opens the door to the 
unilateral introduction of new national standards in sectors such 
as postsecondary education, child care, etc-. In fact, Bill C-76 
gives the provinces a purely advisory role in this exercise.-No 
provision of this bill requires prior provincial consent for the 
introduction of national standards for social programs''.
<P>
	In closing, I say to my fellow Quebecers that voting Yes to 
Quebec sovereignty would end federal interference in Quebec's 
areas of jurisdiction and lead to real savings by eliminating 
duplication and overlap.
<P>
	Voting Yes to Quebec sovereignty would allow Quebec to 
develop job creation, manpower training, education, health and 
welfare policies in line with its needs and priorities.
<P>
	Voting to Quebec sovereignty would also ensure that Quebec 
will no longer be vulnerable to federal low blows such as the 
patriation of the constitution in 1982 without Quebec's consent, 
and the federal government's unilateral cuts to transfer 
payments. In short, whatever the hon. member for 
Brome-Missisquoi may say, Quebec says Yes to sovereignty, 
to maturity, to trust, to openness, and to the pride of the people 
we already are.	
<P>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Secretary of State (Parliamentary 
Affairs) and Deputy Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to 
participate in this the official opposition's last opposition day

forward by the hon. member for Richmond-Wolfe gives me 
and some of my colleagues an opportunity to dispel  
misconceptions voiced by our colleagues opposite on several 
major issues involving the Government of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	I hope that the first group of ten Bloc members whom the 
Leader of the Opposition intends to send every week, starting 
this month, to spread the good word on the referendum are here 
today. They will have a better idea of what the federal 
government's intentions really are regarding each and every one 
of the bills mentioned in the motion put forward by the hon. 
member for Richmond-Wolfe.
<P>
	Before getting on to these bills, I would like to comment on 
the part of the motion that reads ``an entirely centralized state''. 
It seems to me that this is going too far. I have known for a long 
time that the supporters of separation had a propensity for verbal 
inflation, but from what I can see today, they are more 
bombastic than ever. An entirely centralized state, they say. In 
fact, it is just the contrary, and the figures speak for themselves. 
Every study on the subject will tell you that Canada is one of the 
most decentralized countries in the world.
<P>
	Compared to OECD countries, Canada is a federated country 
where the central government is the most diffused among all the 
public administrations. This means that, compared to the U.S., 
Germany, Switzerland, France or the United Kingdom, the 
Canadian government's share of revenues and expenditures is 
lower than that of the provinces and municipalities. In fact, the 
Government of Canada collects less than half of the overall 
public sector revenues.
<P>
	In almost all other federated OECD countries, the central 
government gets more than half of these revenues. As for 
expenditures, in Canada, they are 3.5 times higher at the 
provincial and municipal level than at the federal level. How can 
a level of government that spends less than the other levels be 
described as centralizing? We must realize that decentralization 
has been going on for some time already in Canada.
<P>
	Since the 1960s, a series of agreements have been entered into 
by the governments of Canada and Quebec, promoting 
decentralization. Successive immigration agreements have 
enabled Quebec to select who can immigrate to the province and 
to put in place its own immigration and host programs, all the 
while collecting substantial financial compensation from the 
Government of Canada.
<P>
	At the international level, Quebec can deal directly with 
France and Belgium under Canada-Quebec framework 
agreements. There is also an agreement giving Quebec the status 
required to participate in the Francophonie Summit. In Quebec, 
the provincial government collects GST for the federal govern-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13093"> 13093 </A></B>
<P>
ment, thereby eliminating costly overlaps and duplications in 
federal and provincial tax collection.
<P>
	Since the mid 1960s, opting out agreements have allowed 
Quebec to withdraw from a number of federal-provincial 
programs and to assume the related administrative and financial 
authorities. In 1992-93, the federal government paid more than 
$2 billion to the Quebec government under these opting out 
agreements.
<P>
	No, Madam Speaker, Canada is not an overly centralized 
state, as members opposite would have us believe. Canada takes 
the necessary steps to meet the challenges it faces, which is 
precisely the object of the bills mentioned in the motion. For 
example, let us take Bill C-91. The sole purpose of this bill is to 
give more flexibility to the Business Development Bank of 
Canada, formerly known as the Federal Business Development 
Bank.
<P>
	The changes proposed to the bank's mandate will not usurp 
provincial powers, far from it.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	The primary purpose of these changes is to improve services 
to the bank's clients, small and mid size businesses, so that they 
are better equipped to develop and create jobs.
<P>
	The official opposition is wrong if it considers this bill as a 
trick that the federal government is using to invade provincial 
jurisdictions. The Canadian government uses no tricks, others 
can do that. And the polls show how little success they are 
having.
<P>
	The motion also mentions Bill C-88, an act to implement the 
Agreement on Internal Trade, which was concluded, in July 
1994, by the Prime Minister and provincial first ministers. That 
agreement is an example of how efficient Canadian federalism 
is. It will promote interprovincial trade liberalization, as well as 
economic growth and job creation.
<P>
	Those who support separatism are constantly telling us that 
they are free traders and that they support access to new 
markets, as well as the free movement of goods, services and 
labour. Consequently, I do not understand their objections when 
the federal and provincial governments agree to liberalize 
internal trade. Come to think of it, I do understand their reaction 
very well: the official opposition has no interest in admitting 
that Canadian federalism works well. This is why it opposes this 
legislation so strongly.
<P>
	People are not stupid. It is obvious that the Bloc Quebecois is 
firmly opposed to a Canada-wide economic association. 
Quebecers will know what to expect when the details of the 
offers are made public. Clearly, the official opposition's 
campaign to promote economic association is nothing but 
another ploy or mirage to try to fool Quebecers.
<P>
	The official opposition also denounces Bill C-46. This is 
rather surprising since, on September 26, at second reading, the 
hon. member for Trois-Rivières had this to say about that 
legislation: ``Bill C-46 is aimed at maintaining the status quo, 
making the minor amendments that are needed, but not 
substantial''. Yet, today, the official opposition is launching an 
all-out attack against this bill. True, this is not the first time that 
the Bloc has changed its mind.
<P>
	Bill C-46 seeks to establish the new federal Department of 
Industry. It merges four departments into a single one which will 
be better equipped to implement three priorities. Let me read 
you the three priorities of the new department.
<P>
	The first one is to create better conditions to do business. This 
means doing everything possible to allow businesses and 
workers to concentrate on job creation.
<P>
	The second priority is to stimulate trade. This means using 
new ways, inspired by Team Canada, to take advantage of 
foreign market opportunities, and to help Canadian businesses 
access these markets.
<P>
	The third priority is to create an efficient infrastructure. This 
means ensuring that Canada has transport, telecommunications 
and information networks which will enable businesses to be 
efficient in a modern economy.
<P>
	You will agree, Madam Speaker, that these priorities meet the 
true concerns of Canadians, including Quebecers. However, the 
official opposition is not pleased with these priorities. The Bloc 
Quebecois tries to block every initiative designed to help boost 
the economy and create jobs. Such an attitude is unacceptable, 
considering that so many Quebecers are out of work.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	Official opposition members keep saying they are here to 
defend the best interests of Quebecers. These interests require 
that the opposition play a constructive role and support the 
federal government in its efforts to boost the economy and 
enhance job creation. Quebecers understand, increasingly, that 
the interests the official opposition is defending are not theirs. 
Finally, the official opposition is also opposed to Bill C-76.
<P>
	In this regard, one need hardly be surprised that the advocates 
of separation are opposed to last February's federal budget. Our 
budget shows that Canadian federalism works and, what is 
more, is working well. This budget mentioned only two 
conditions to be met: compliance with the five principles of the 
health care insurance plan, and prohibition of the residence 
requirement as a criterion for eligibility to social assistance. 
Seventy-seven per cent of Quebecers believe the principles 
underlying the Canada Health Act are very important. In every 
other social program, provinces will agree by mutual consent on 
shared principles and goals.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13094"> 13094 </A></B>
<P>
	Unless the definition has been changed, ``mutual consent'' 
does not mean imposition of national standards; ``mutual 
consent'' means just that, that is that the parties involved will 
have to give their consent. This shows once again that the 
federal government wants to give the provinces a wider 
flexibility.
<P>
	This is about flexibility, decentralization and co-operation; 
not about centralization as advocates of separation are fond of 
suggesting.
<P>
	What deserves condemnation is not the pieces of legislation 
mentioned in the motion, but the official opposition's attitude. 
Earlier, we heard them, they are already talking about voting 
yes. The referendum campaign has not even been launched yet. 
The Parti Quebecois did not even have the courage to hold a 
referendum in its first eight months in office.
<P>
	Obsessed as it is with the referendum question, the official 
opposition alters facts, indulges in grandstanding and tries to 
depict to Quebecers a Canada that does not exist. I know 
Quebecers. I know they expect their governments to put their 
financial houses in order, to boost the economy, and do their 
utmost to enhance job creation. Since the election, that is what 
our government has been trying to do.
<P>
	The budget that was tabled in February reduced federal 
spending by 7.3 per cent, a first in our history.
<P>
	It was a difficult decision, and we did not make it with a light 
heart. But we had to do it, for the sake of the future of young 
Canadians.
<P>
	We know jobs are important for all Canadians. That is why we 
launched the infrastructure program, which created nearly 
20,000 jobs in Quebec alone.
<P>
	Trade missions under the leadership of the Prime Minister in 
Asia and Latin America have resulted in contracts adding up to 
almost $10 billion. We know that Quebecers and all Canadians 
want to feel safe in their cities and towns. The gun control bill 
will contribute to making communities safer.
<P>
	That is what we mean when we talk about good government, 
and that is what Canadians want. That is what Quebecers want, 
too.
<P>
	I repeat that what should be condemned is not the bills 
mentioned in the motion, but the motion itself.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I was very surprised to hear the hon. secretary 
of state for Parliamentary Affairs say, especially at the 
beginning of his speech, that when the Bloc members go visit the 
people in their ridings, they are not performing their duties as 
members of Parliament. I want him to tell me that I was not 
carrying out my duties as a member of Parliament when I met 
some fifteen senior citizens of Trois-Rivières to talk about the 
upcoming old age pension reform and listened to their concerns 
that the federal government would cut their old age pension as it 
did with the unemployment insurance benefits.
<P>
	I think we are acting very properly when we get together with 
our constituents. This does not stop us from taking the 
opportunity to talk about the real solutions to these problems 
that would give the province of Quebec more control over its 
own development.
<P>
	When we meet with people who complain about the 
unemployment situation and tell us that 40 per cent of all new 
welfare recipients end up on the welfare roll because of the new 
restrictions put on UI benefits by this new government, which is 
more Conservative than Liberal, are we not performing our 
duties as members of Parliament?
<P>
	When the federal government decides to cut all research and 
development in sheep production, a promising new industry 
which is quickly expanding in Quebec and in Canada, and we are 
asked by the people: ``Who took that decision, what is going on 
in Ottawa? What is wrong with them? Do they have their heads 
in the clouds? They are cutting R and D'', are we not performing 
our duties as members of Parliament? I think the member for 
Saint-Léonard should reconsider his position on this issue.
<P>
	On the other hand, given the centralization efforts of the 
current government, Quebecers will obviously have a very clear 
choice to make. This is the most positive aspect of the federal 
efforts. Everything is quite clear. When they talk about national 
standards and their willingness to interfere in the day care sector 
and impose national standards so that Alberta and Quebec are 
both treated the same way, we realize that their initiative does 
not make any sense and is doomed from the start.
<P>
	It does not make sense for the federal government, which has 
no authority in education, to create a human resources 
investment fund and, by a devious device, intervene in the area 
of education instead of reducing unemployment insurance 
premiums, because less money is needed to finance the 
unemployment insurance fund, and giving the difference back to 
the people who do finance the fund. The unemployment 
insurance scheme is not there as an excuse to create an education 
department. It is there to provide benefits to workers between 
jobs. Is this not an intrusion of the federal government where it 
has no business?
<P>
	There is also the agreement on internal trade. Let us talk about 
it. This agreement was signed by all provinces and the federal 
government. It is designed to ensure that internal trade is at least 
the equivalent of what we have with NAFTA in external trade. 
But the federal government tables a bill with the insidious 
provision that it will be able to rap the provinces on the knuckles 
if it does not like a decision, if a province does not measure up. It 
is acting as both judge and jury.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13095"> 13095 </A></B>
<P>
	Is that not the return of the steamroller style we first saw in 
the Trudeau years? Is not the present Liberal government acting 
as the servant of federal bureaucracy, which is systematically 
denounced by Canadians as a whole? Everybody in Canada, 
sovereignists as well as federalists, is fed up with the fact that 
the federal bureaucratic machine dictates how things should be 
done, and what Canadians and Quebecers should think. This is 
why the official opposition is perfectly justified in rising up 
against it.
<P>
	When we know that there are 800,000 welfare recipients in 
Quebec and 1,200,000 in Ontario, it means that it is not only the 
fault of the government of Quebec, which has been in power for 
less than a year. When we see that there are 800,000 welfare 
recipients in Quebec and 1,200,000 in Ontario, does that show 
that the Canadian system is working? Are the interventions of 
the federal government producing good results? I believe the 
member has to recite an act of contrition and reconsider his 
position.
<P>
	As I was saying at the beginning of my speech, my question 
will be on this subject.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	In that case, what choice remains to Quebecers but to side 
with those who want change, those who really want Quebec to be 
the master of its development? We are talking about the Bloc 
Quebecois, the Parti Quebecois, and possibly the Action 
démocratique du Québec party, all of whom want Quebec to be 
in charge of its own development.
<P>
	Should not the member for Saint-Léonard try to convince his 
government to reconsider its positions and to backtrack on this 
decentralization project which will only lead to more results like 
Canada's present debt, an absolutely negative result of the 
Canadian federal system?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to tell the hon. 
member that I agree with him on one point only. I agree with him 
when he says that he represents change. The members opposite 
have changed their minds back and forth so many times that 
even the Premier of Quebec, their ally, said that he was getting a 
stiff neck. They are trying to get out of this situation but they 
cannot because they are already in too deep.
<P>
	All the polls show that Quebecers want to stay within Canada. 
But the separatists-and they refuse to be called by their true 
name-want people to believe that after they separate from the 
rest of Canada, they will have a political and economic 
association and that things will not be much different than they 
are now.
<P>
	The member could at least stay put and listen to what I have to 
say. The choice is his, but if he does not stay, it means that he 
does not care to hear the answers to his own questions.
<P>
	If separation really is the way to go, if it would solve all of 
Quebec's economic and social problems as the member was 
saying, why then do they have to have this change of direction 
after months of reflection and say that they will have a political 
and economic association? Because they need a winning 
question.
<P>
	They have to play with words, to get around the problem to try 
and confuse people with their separatist option. There are not 
four or five questions, there is only one: Do Quebecers want to 
separate from the rest of Canada, yes or no? A bit earlier, the 
member for Richmond-Wolfe who asked his fellow Quebecers 
to vote yes. Why should they do so? For more pie in the sky? 
Another stiff neck? That is the question.
<P>
	Today, for example, the opposition is telling us that we want 
to impose national standards. The budget was very clear on that. 
It said that there had to be mutual consent. The bill was clear. 
Furthermore, to make sure that it was really clear, that it said 
what the Minister of Finance and the government meant, we 
proposed amendments to specify that there would be agreements 
and mutual consent. Mutual consent means that the two parties 
agree. This is what we will aim for in our negotiations with the 
provinces.
<P>
	If, instead of always complaining that Canada does not work, 
those who are in favour of separation were ready to co-operate 
with the other provinces and the federal government, we could 
solve many problems. For example, last year, in July, a free 
trade agreement was signed. The separatists want free trade with 
the United States and Mexico, but they are against free trade 
within Canada.
<P>
	We introduced a bill to implement the free trade agreement 
signed by the Prime Minister and all the provinces but again, 
they oppose it. They say that the federal government wants to 
overstep its jurisdiction. Again, we took precautions, we 
checked the legislation.
<P>
	The other day, in this House, we announced that there would 
be clarifications. The federal government does not for one 
moment intend to usurp the provinces' powers. What do we 
want? We only want to make the Canadian federation work.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry to interrupt 
the hon. secretary of state, but his time is up. I take the 
opportunity to remind you all that we should never mention the 
absence of an hon. member from his seat.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to say a few words in this 
debate as once again the citizens of Canada are treated to this 
family squabble.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13096"> 13096 </A></B>
<P>
	It is difficult from time to time as a member of the Reform 
Party to be in agreement with the members of the Liberal Party 
but there are some things which do tend to draw us together.
<P>
	Something about today's debate and today's motion by the 
Bloc is embarrassing to me as a member of the House and as a 
Canadian. If I were a resident of Quebec, whether I were a 
separatist or not I would be embarrassed about it. If I were a 
separatist I would be doubly embarrassed by this motion and by 
the attitude of the Bloc in the House and what it has been doing 
in recent months.
<P>
	It is my opinion that Bloc members over the last few months 
are becoming less and less a force in Parliament. They seem to 
have marginalized themselves. When the House started they 
came and by and large the media were their lapdogs. The media 
loved the Bloc. It created clash and conflict all the time and it 
had a free ride from the media outside of Quebec. I do not know 
about the Quebec media but the English media looked at Bloc 
members and thought they were people who really had it 
together.
<P>
	Quite a number of Bloc members are competent and capable. 
Unfortunately when they get together some group dynamic takes 
over. It must be something they drink which causes them all of a 
sudden to become introspective, afraid, frightened, isolationist; 
everything they would not want to be, they become.
<P>
	Here we are debating a motion, the essence of which is to put a 
wall up around Quebec with a one way check valve in the wall: 
send money in but do not let anything else out and then they can 
take care of themselves. How can a group of people presume 
they will take their province into separation and they can stand 
on their own as a separate nation, when every time they open 
their mouths they are afraid to stand alone as a separate 
province? It does not make any sense. There is a huge 
contradiction.
<P>
	There is a difference between constructive opposition and 
obstructionism. It is single minded. I cannot find a word for it 
right now but I am sure one will spring to mind to describe the 
incessant day in, day out attitude of the Bloc. Tribalism would 
be the word. The attitude in committee and the attitude in the 
House is not what can they do to make their province better, 
thereby making the country as a whole better; the attitude is 
consistently what is in it for them and how can they benefit to 
make sure they do not get screwed by the rest of Canadians who 
get up every morning and have one overriding thought which is 
how can they stick it to Quebec.
<P>
	Nothing could be further from the truth. Canadians from coast 
to coast have treated Quebec with kid gloves for at least all of 
my adult life. My adult life has been spent asking: How do we 
make Quebec feel at home in Canada? What can we do to make 
Quebec and the people who live in Quebec happy as Canadians? 
For the last 30  years or so we have tried to buy their affection 
and has that worked? I think not.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	Let me give an illustration. For those who may have just tuned 
in today is an opposition day, a supply motion. This means the 
opposition gets to determine what we are to debate in the House 
today.
<P>
	Keep in mind that 52 Canadians are being held hostage, 
including Quebecers, in Bosnia. Bear in mind our country is into 
the hole $120 million a day. What do we do? We debate this 
motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemn the government's legislative agenda, which makes 
clear its intention to usurp provincial jurisdictions and construct an entirely 
centralized state, as can be seen from Bills C-76, C-88, C-46 and C-91.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The opposition presumes all these bills are designed to take 
substantial powers away from Quebec and transfer them to the 
federal government. What about the rest of the country, the rest 
of the provinces? There is nothing in any of these that say these 
bills are specific to Quebec. This is legislation the government 
brings down for the country. We may not like it but it has a 
majority and we have to deal with that.
<P>
	As the loyal opposition and the third party we have to do what 
we can to make it better legislation and where possible derail 
legislation which is in our opinion not worthy of support. It is 
not my role as a member representing an Alberta constituency to 
get up every morning, come to the House and ask how I can look 
after Alberta.
<P>
	I am a federal member of Parliament representing a federal 
constituency in Alberta. My primary responsibility is our 
country, not just Edmonton Southwest. I have to be concerned 
about every Canadian, not just Albertans, not just people who 
live in Edmonton. If I am not prepared to do that, why am I 
sitting here?
<P>
	The Reform Party's bias is to radically decentralize Canada 
and we share with our colleagues from the Bloc the notion that it 
is imperative to reduce the overlap we acknowledge exists in 
many areas in the country. Why do we need a federal 
environment department, a provincial environment department 
and a municipal environment department?
<P>
	Every time we turn around there is overlap. We have more 
public servants per capita, per square inch than most countries. 
We share that with our friends from the Bloc. We need to 
decentralize. We share with our colleagues from the Bloc ideas 
about decentralizing authority and responsibility to make 
authority and responsibility to devolve that closest to the people 
who are being served.
<P>
	We would like to see a radically changed federal government, 
much smaller, much less intrusive in the lives of Canadians, 
with provinces having far more responsibility as would be 
necessary to make our country work better. That does not mean 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13097"> 13097 </A></B>
<P>
the federal government  does not have a role in national affairs. 
If we are to be a country we need certain uniform things from 
coast to coast.
<P>
	All of these bills whether we like it or not speak to those ideas. 
Bill C-76 is the budget implementation act. What the Bloc was 
complaining, whining, moaning and dripping about in the 
budget implementation act is that it has a clause whereby 
transfers to the provinces will be block transfers.
<P>
	This means that instead of transferring specific moneys to 
education, health and other areas along with the Canada 
assistance plan, these moneys will be transferred in block, 
allowing the provinces to do with that money as they will. That 
makes sense to me. That sounds like decentralization to me. 
How is it that the Bloc can possibly construe that to be some sort 
of centralizing plan? What the Bloc did not say is there is a 
possibility the people of Quebec will have to be a little more 
careful in how they spend their money because they will get less 
money.
<P>
	Our country is into the hole $120 million a day. Every single 
Canadian will be in debt. Our deficit per individual Canadian is 
$1,375 just for this year. Our total per person debt in Canada is 
$19,000. For a family of four it is $76,000. That is our federal 
debt. Forget the provincial debt, of which Quebec has a ton, that 
is just our federal debt. There is going to be less money to 
transfer to the provinces and I think the Bloc is a little upset over 
that.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	Let me give an illustration of some of the inequities that exist 
in our country. Under the Canada assistance plan, if someone 
happens to be on welfare, collecting benefits from the province, 
and lives in Ontario, Alberta or British Columbia, the federal 
government kicks in 29 cents of every dollar that is paid out. 
However, if that person lives in Quebec or one of the other 
provinces considered to be a have not province, the federal 
government kicks in 50 cents of every dollar.
<P>
	Because it is in a block transfer, if Quebec is going to continue 
to pay benefits the way it has been, then it is going to have to 
take that money from somewhere else. Why on earth should 
Alberta residents pay taxes via equalization payments that go to 
Quebec so that seniors in Quebec do not have to pay for 
prescription drugs? Those who live in Alberta have to pay for 
prescription drugs. Quebec is considered a have not province 
and we subsidize it. Over the last 30 years or so Quebec has 
benefited to the tune of $100 billion from equalization 
payments. Why is it that the rest of the country should put up 
with that?
<P>
	I want to make it clear that as a person, I kind of like the hon. 
member for Richmond-Wolfe who led this debate. But I sure 
get fed up with him every time he starts to pontificate in the 
House about how hard done by the people in Quebec are. I 
thought his comments this morning were pathetic. I wondered 
how, representing  isolationism thoughts like that, Quebecers 
could possibly have any confidence in that group to run their 
affairs in an independent Quebec. They would spend the first 20 
years of independence building a wall around Quebec.
<P>
	We know that Quebec benefits tremendously from 
interprovincial trade which is what Bill C-88 is all about, which 
they do not like. Bill C-88 was a bill to reduce the 
interprovincial trade barriers within Canada. The Reform Party 
objected to the bill because it did not go far enough. We felt the 
government should have used its powers to force the provinces 
to bring down the trade barriers. It is in our common best 
interests to develop a critical mass that will allow us to be 
competitive on a worldwide basis.
<P>
	People will recall that when we entered into free trade with 
the United States we got whipped in those first few years. Why 
did we get whipped? Because we had a high dollar, high interest 
rates and we had these interprovincial trade barriers all across 
the country so that our industries that were protected were not 
capable of competing in the world markets.
<P>
	We would have to be brain dead, and I think we were, to enter 
into an agreement to have free trade with the strongest trading 
nation in the world without having free trade within Canada to 
start with. How could we be so stupid-I hate to say not to put 
bullets in our gun because with Bill C-68 we are not going to 
have any-as to go hunting and have our guns loaded with 
blanks?
<P>
<B>(1120 ) </B>
<P>
	We have a high dollar, high interest rates and we have these 
interprovincial trade barriers. The federal government is 
carrying out its rightful duty and responsibility by saying to the 
provinces that we are going to get rid of these interprovincial 
trade barriers so we can compete.
<P>
	I have notes somewhere on just how important trade is to the 
Canadians of Quebec, to the people of Quebec whether they are 
independent or not. Let me make it clear. The last thing in the 
world I want is the people of Quebec to be independent. If by 
some quirk of fate they are dumb enough to follow the Bloc and 
go down that road, this is what they had better keep in mind.
<P>
	Quebec exported more to Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in 
1989 than to any country in Europe, including France. It sold as 
much to Ontario as it did to the United States. The rest of Canada 
exported more to Quebec than to the European Union and Japan 
combined.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13098"> 13098 </A></B>
<P>
	In Quebec 470,000 jobs were directly and indirectly 
attributable to interprovincial exports in 1989. Quebec was the 
only province other than Ontario that registered a surplus in 
interprovincial trade. Let me repeat that Quebec was the only 
province other than Ontario to register a surplus in 
interprovincial trade.
<P>
	Quebec had a deficit of interprovincial trade with Ontario of 
about $3 billion but it had an overall surplus of, I think, about 
$1.3 billion because it traded with other provinces. And 
members of the Bloc representing the people of Quebec say: 
``We want to put up barriers; we do not want free trade within 
our own country''. Well, I can say that an independent Quebec 
will be on its knees at the door of Canada asking please could it 
have free trade because it must have it. How is it that the Bloc 
members can stand here today and say they do not want it?
<P>
	Bill C-91 concerns the Federal Business Development Bank. 
We have some serious reservations about continuing the Federal 
Business Development Bank. Our perspective is we do not think 
the federal government has any business setting up a crown 
corporation to compete with private business. That is the 
essence of what will happen. We are going to have a renewed 
Federal Business Development Bank which will be competing 
with the existing banks in Canada. I do not think we should do it. 
We should force private enterprise to do what it must.
<P>
	Bloc members have a perspective that is different from ours 
and I think they are far more dependent upon government for 
everything in life. I think it is fair to characterize members of 
the Bloc as living in a kind of socialist dream world. They would 
love to see societal responsibility for everything and personal 
responsibility for very little, but that is fair. It is a difference of 
opinion.
<P>
	We have a difference of opinion over this. We are saying we 
should not have a renewed bank because we do not want to 
compete with the private sector. The Bloc perspective is that 
somehow a renewed bank is going to compete with existing 
agencies in Quebec.
<P>
	Why does the Bloc not ask how to go about melding existing 
agencies in Quebec? It is not as though the people who work for 
the Federal Business Development Bank came from Mars. 
Those people came from Quebec. The president of the FBDB, 
Francois Beaudoin, is in Montreal. So combine FEDNOR and 
reduce the overlap and the costs of providing these services to 
Canadians. Do not just stand in the road saying that this or that 
cannot be done. Be constructive.
<P>
	The final one was Bill C-46, the reorganization of the 
Department of Industry. What can I say? That is basically a 
housekeeping bill. We objected to it because our role is to 
oppose, but it is going to be done.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	I think this illustrates the fact that the House will work if we 
work together constructively. I would ask members of the Bloc 
to please bear that in mind in future debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
have listened to the member's analysis of my colleague's 
remarks. I must tell you that it is difficult to know what he 
thinks. First, he criticized everything that the Bloc has said or 
done since its arrival in the House of Commons. Then he told us 
he agreed with everything we are doing. Where does he really 
stand? It is certainly not evident; it is difficult to follow him.
<P>
	The bulk of his speech was about decentralization, something 
he shares our views on. For years now, we in Quebec have been 
asking, without success, for decentralization of powers to the 
provinces in order to meet the challenge of eventual 
globalization of markets.
<P>
	The debt was mentioned. It is centralization that has brought 
us this $500 billion debt, which may well wipe out all the social 
programs and be passed on to future generations. In particular, 
he spoke about the advantages to Quebec of east-west trade. But 
he neglected to mention that we have spent millions over the last 
127 years to develop this trade. This might allow an independent 
Quebec to look in the direction of other large markets of interest 
to us, north-south markets.
<P>
	He also spoke about the problems we are experiencing that we 
have been unable to resolve within the existing system. I would 
like to mention a few to him. If we are speaking about structural 
problems, there are fundamental problems to which solutions 
have never been found under the constitution. First, the 
interference of the federal government in provincial areas of 
responsibility; second, the distinct society; third, the autonomy 
of the First Nations; fourth the absence of affinity between 
eastern and western Canadians, the well-know alienation of the 
west, which has always viewed itself as the frontier; the federal 
government's right to fund megaprojects without the agreement 
of the provinces, which has resulted in a debt of $500 billion and 
the unemployment we are now experiencing; economic recovery 
and job creation; and finally, the challenge of tomorrow, which 
is the globalization of markets.
<P>
	Yet, if I take the period between 1968 and 1993, there were 
two great leaders, with two different approaches-Trudeau from 
1968 to 1984, and Mulroney from 1984 to 1993. One was 
pushing a dominant central government, one strong nation while 
the other-in all fairness, Mr. Mulroney cannot be faulted for 
trying-proposed decentralization simply in an effort to get this 
great country going again.
<P>
	We all know the results: the Meech Lake fiasco and the failure 
of the Charlottetown accord, despite the fact that English 
Canada spent $13 million promoting this accord compared to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13099"> 13099 </A></B>
<P>
some $800,000 spent on the Yes  campaign. Furthermore, in the 
election following these events, the Conservative Party was 
wiped off the map.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	There is no denying that something is happening. We are 
heading straight for a black hole, and we have proof that strong 
federalism is steering us towards it, while 
decentralization-well, everybody is in favour of it but no one 
wants to make the first move. And that is simply what Quebec 
wants to do. Quebec wants to take its matters into its own hands 
and simply show the rest of Canada that it is time to make a 
move, because we are on the brink of falling into the black hole.
<P>
	My question for the hon. member is about the globalization of 
markets. Be it in the industrial sector or the public sector, it has 
been proven that the only survivors will be small units capable 
of charting their own course, reorganizing their operations and 
meeting market demand. Does he think that the road to success 
is through decentralization, which has yet to have been seen 
here, or through following the status quo?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Madam Speaker, in response to some of the 
questions put forward by my hon. colleague I want to make it 
clear that I do not agree with everything the Bloc is doing. As a 
matter of fact, I do not agree with a lot of what the Bloc is doing. 
But I do agree wholeheartedly with one of the things the Bloc 
stands for, and that is the notion of a radically decentralized 
Canada.
<P>
	It drives me crazy that while I would be looking at it from the 
perspective that it would be better for Canada, when the Bloc 
members speak they say it would be better for Quebec. They are 
here representing the federal Parliament. I know it is a 
contradiction, since they represent the Bloc. However, their role 
as the official opposition is to make Canada work better. As long 
as they are here, quite willing to collect their pensions from 
Canada, they should start thinking in terms of what is right for 
Canada. If they want to leave, leave. But they should be leaving 
a stronger Canada, not a weaker one because of their actions in 
the House.
<P>
	As far as transferring responsibility to the provinces, the Bloc 
has made a good point; it is quite right. The federal government 
has cut the amount of money being transferred via block 
transfers while at the same time not allowing the provinces to 
raise additional money to pay for standards the federal 
government is maintaining. The federal government cannot on 
one hand say that it is going to transfer responsibility to the 
provinces and then say the provinces have to run things exactly 
as the federal government tells them. There must be more 
latitude. We concur with the Bloc in that constructive sentiment.
<P>
	The other major point my colleague from the Bloc mentioned 
was that Canada is set up on a trading basis of east and west, 
while the natural trade routes are north and south. He is 
absolutely right. It has cost people in western Canada an 
absolute fortune over the years.
<P>
	Why is it that in Montana you could buy a piece of farm 
equipment manufactured in Toronto for less than you could buy 
the same piece of equipment in Alberta? Because of these tariff 
barriers. Why is it that for years all Canadians were paying twice 
as much for textiles as we should have in order to protect the 
textile industry in Quebec, thus allowing it to become 
non-competitive on a world basis?
<P>
	The member is right. We have had these trade barriers, which 
have created an artificial economy east-west when the natural 
one is north-south. Imagine how much stronger they would be in 
the maritimes if they were dealing north-south with Boston and 
the New England states.
<P>
	The member talked about looking at new markets. What on 
earth prevents the people of Quebec from getting new markets to 
the south today? Is there anybody saying to people in Quebec 
that they cannot trade with the United States? Of course not. We 
are trying as hard as we can as a nation-and the people in 
Quebec-to export.
<P>
<B>(1135 ) </B>
<P>
	Quebec has been extremely efficient in managing exports to 
the United States. I am not quite sure, but I think that over recent 
years Quebec has had something like a 3 per cent increase in its 
exports to the United States, more than the Canadian average. 
There is nothing to prevent Quebec from exporting as much as it 
wants south right now. It does not have to throw the baby out 
with the bath water.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to take part in the debate on this opposition day, a 
debate that concerns the following motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemn the government's legislative agenda, which makes 
clear its intention to usurp provincial jurisdictions and construct an entirely 
centralized state, as can be seen from Bills C-76, C-88, C-46 and C-91, all 
designed to take substantial powers away from Quebec and transfer them to the 
federal government.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I also welcome this opportunity to take part in this debate 
because as the industry critic, I was involved in the drafting of 
this motion. In fact, we have four bills, three introduced directly 
by the Minister of Industry, that have certain implications which 
are very disturbing, both for Quebec and the other provinces. I 
hope that my colleagues, especially those in the Reform Party, 
will realize that what is happening here in Ottawa not only 
violates the legitimate aspirations of the people of Quebec but 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13100"> 13100 </A></B>
<P>
also the legitimate aspirations of Canadian provinces that 
support decentralized government.
<P>
	What makes this so disturbing is that this government acts so 
discreetly it is almost self-effacing. No fuss, no boasting, but 
meanwhile, it is carefully and almost secretly centralizing the 
powers of the Canadian federation here in Ottawa as no other 
government has done before in this country's history.
<P>
	I will try to explain this process, starting with Bill C-46, 
which comes first both numerically and chronologically and 
which last fall, took a number of departments, including 
Communications, Consumer and Corporate Affairs, and 
amalgamated these to establish the Department of Industry, as it 
is known today. So far, so good, except that the Federal Office of 
Regional Development (Quebec) was maintained. When I say 
maintained, we should realize that for some time there were 
rumours that the office would be dropped.
<P>
	In view of the deplorable and indeed disastrous state of 
Canada's public finances, the federal government, as you know, 
had to take a long, hard look at the situation and, in the process, 
it seems the very existence of the Federal Office of Regional 
Development (Quebec) was called into question because it 
could no longer provide financial assistance for small 
businesses. At the time, it had found its niche helping high tech 
companies but, because of budgetary cutbacks, all this had to be 
shelved so that the continued existence of FORD was in doubt. 
However, instead of getting rid of FORD, the government 
maintained this empty shell, which has now become a kind of 
conveyor belt, a Trojan horse, the federal government's 
favourite mechanism for getting involved in regional 
development in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	The mission of FORD is being changed. It will serve as a 
consultant to small and mid size high tech businesses, primarily 
in the area of exports. This is all very well, except it is already 
the case in Quebec. And the networking-and since you were at 
the Standing Committee on Industry recently, you know what I 
am talking about-that FORD can do as part of its activities, the 
Quebec Department of Industry and Commerce is already doing 
it. We have already dealt with this concern on the part of high 
tech business and high tech exporting businesses. This ground 
has already been covered. Instead of abolishing the Federal 
Office of Regional Development, it is being kept alive by further 
duplicating mechanisms that already exist in Quebec in the area 
of regional development.
<P>
	Except that it is becoming the preferred vehicle, making 
agreements, as we will see, with the Federal Business 
Development Bank. This will enable the federal government to 
slip in and meddle even more blithely than before in the 
operations and the management of regional development. It will 
do so while ignoring the presence of the Quebec government and 
the regional development apparatus it already has and the 
equality of the Quebec government in the relationship. The 
federal government must remember that if it is going to  
intervene as a government, it must be to provide support and not 
to compete with the provinces. This is what we see in Bill C-46 
with FORD remaining as we know it today in terms of SMB 
adviser-resource persons.
<P>
	I move on now to Bill C-76. Briefly, because the main theme 
must always be taken into account, what is new about Bill C-76, 
which is the bill to implement the budget the Minister of Finance 
tabled a while back, is that it establishes a completely new 
concept, that of the Canada social transfer, which is the budget 
for social and welfare programs. A new concept is therefore in 
use, doubtless to assist in the advancement of the science known 
as the Canada social transfer.
<P>
	According to Bill C-76 implementing the budget, the federal 
government will, over the next three years, reduce by $7 billion 
the public funds it gives to the provinces, which means a $2.5 
billion cut for the Quebec government.
<P>
	Not only are the cuts in question huge, the federal 
government, instead of being apologetic about it and paving the 
way for a true decentralization of powers following its financial 
withdrawal, is interfering more and more in the management of 
health, welfare and social programs and more recently, in 
post-secondary education. Also it announced that it will set 
national standards to which provinces will have to conform to 
avoid being further penalized.
<P>
	It is a new way of interfering into areas of provincial 
jurisdiction. Section 93 of the Canadian constitution provides 
for a distribution of powers and areas of jurisdiction. The areas 
just mentioned-health, post-secondary education, social 
programs and welfare-are all within provincial jurisdiction. 
These areas, which affect Quebecers every day, are crucial to 
Quebec's distinct society in the Canadian federation. They are 
existential.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	The federal government has no right to set national standards 
for Quebec. Furthermore, under clause 37 of Bill C-76, the 
federal government demands that its financial assistance be 
visible, which means that, from now on, the forms used by 
citizens must reflect the fact that the federal government 
contributed to such and such a program.
<P>
	Not only is it withdrawing, not only is it cutting, not only is it 
setting standards, but now it boasts about it and demands to be 
praised by the provinces so that citizens realize that the federal 
government doles out presents. This is the underlying 
philosophy: to show that it is giving presents to the provinces, as 
if it were not with the taxes paid by Canadians and Quebecers, 
and this is the normal state of affairs. As unconstitutional as 
these measures may be, it is normal for the Canadian 
government to be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13101"> 13101 </A></B>
<P>
redistributing money. Still, one should keep in mind that these 
measures are indeed unconstitutional.
<P>
	The position of the official opposition is clear in this regard: it 
demands that the federal government withdraw from provincial 
areas of jurisdiction without any ifs, ands or buts. In other 
words, within the Canadian confederation, the official 
opposition demands that the constitution be abided by, and that 
the withdrawal of the federal government from social programs, 
health care, and education be offset by the transfer of tax points 
so that taxpayers do not end up paying more. It would balance 
out. The federal government would lose one or two per cent in 
taxes to the current province of Quebec, and thus the tax burden 
of citizens would not get heavier.
<P>
	Therefore, we see that, with this second piece of legislation, 
Bill C-76, aimed at implementing the budget, the federal 
government keeps on attacking, and even intensifies its attacks 
against the provinces, especially Quebec, by setting national 
standards in the areas of health care, post-secondary education, 
social programs and welfare.
<P>
	I now come to Bill C-88. Bill C-88 deals with internal trade in 
Canada. It is a matter which was the subject of an interprovincial 
agreement signed last year, on July 1st, by the provinces, the 
federal government, the Yukon and the Northwest Territories, 
and which is to come into force on July 1st, 1995. There is, in 
this agreement, a certain legal vagueness due to the wording of 
article 1710-which is at the heart of the agreement and could 
become the stumbling block-providing for mechanisms to 
settle possible disputes between two provinces, or between the 
federal government and one of the signatories; the least that can 
be said about these mechanisms is that they are somewhat 
lacking in clarity.
<P>
	The reason is that the signatories agreed that any dispute 
settlement mechanism would be based on the good faith of the 
parties and would not, in any case, be of a legal nature. There 
was, on April 10 of this year, less than two months ago, a 
federal-provincial conference of provincial, territorial and 
federal ministers, in Calgary, where, we are told, nothing was 
said about the fact that there were new texts and new ways of 
doing things in the areas of dispute settlement mechanisms.
<P>
	Yet, two or three weeks ago, the federal government came up, 
without any warning, without debate, with Bill C-88 where, in 
clause 9, it imposes or rather assumes powers it never mentioned 
to the parties and for which it was not mandated by said parties.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	I will read clause 9, which will create quite a conflict because 
the federal government really assumes powers although, in the 
spirit of the agreement, it is solely one partner, equal to the other 
signatories. This question is extremely important and was called 
by the Premier of Quebec a ``trade war measure''. He did not 
mince his words. Given the credibility of the Premier of Quebec 
in this area, we can see the importance of what I talking about.
<P>
	Clause 9, which is the main element of Bill C-88, reads as 
follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For the purpose of suspending benefits or imposing retaliatory measures of 
equivalent effect against a province pursuant to Article 1710 of the Agreement, 
the Governor in Council may, by order, do any one or more of the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) suspend rights or privileges granted by the Government of Canada to the 
province under the Agreement or any federal law;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) modify or suspend the application of any federal law with respect to the 
province;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(c) extend the application of any federal law to the province; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(d) take any other measure-and this is important-that the Governor in 
Council considers necessary-what it means is to bring the province in step.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In subclause 9(2), they even make the following precision, 
and I quote: ``In this section, federal law'' means the whole or 
any portion of any Act of Parliament or any regulation order or 
other instrument issued, made or established in the exercise of a 
power conferred by or under an Act of Parliament''.
<P>
	Before the parties gave any kind of authorization, before any 
discussion or joint action, without any mandate, the 
Government of Canada, a legitimately elected government, 
unilaterally, arbitrarily and arrogantly decided to add a 
provision whereby it granted itself the authority to set any 
stubborn province right.
<P>
	Just think what that could mean in the case of Quebec. 
Personally, that is one thing I hope Quebecers will seriously 
think about during the upcoming great consultation. This is the 
type of Canada we will have in the future where there will be 
only one real government, Madam Speaker, and it will be this 
government, arrogant, arbitrary, cut off from the people and 
ignorant of regional interests; the so-called provincial 
governments will become mere regional governments. Imagine 
what irreparable damage will be done to Quebec where we 
firmly believe to be, where we claim to be a distinct society 
within Canada with different habits, thinking patterns and 
background.
<P>
	That clause, as others is typical of this government's way of 
doing things, in Ottawa, capital of Canada, a country soon to be 
centralized, unitarian, accepting no debate or consultation and 
no social debate, a debate which the Canadian population should 
demand, especially westerners. Without any social debate as we 
have in Quebec, a clause like this one could have serious 
consequences. The intent of that clause would certainly have a 
catastrophic impact on Quebec.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13102"> 13102 </A></B>
<P>
	I am coming now to Bill C-91 which deals with the Federal 
Business Development Bank that will soon become the 
Business Development Bank of Canada. There again there was 
no consultation and no joint action. This showed a certain 
disregard for the industry committee of which I am vice-chair 
and which never made such recommendations, on the contrary. 
If there were a recommendation from the parliamentary 
secretary, it was basically to reduce the importance of the bank, 
to make it the bank of Canadian small businesses. It was to scale 
it down. But now, we are going to the other extreme, Madam 
Speaker, with the Business Development Bank of Canada, to 
which the minister gives a new mandate; it will no longer be 
a last resort for small business but rather intervene in programs 
supporting Canadian entrepreneurship.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	Those words, which are neither defined nor specified in the 
legislation, will allow the federal bank, pursuant to clause 21, to 
intervene not only in federal organizations, but also in 
provincial ones and in regional organizations created by the 
Quebec government. That is still basically a way of interfering 
in the daily lives of the people in this country, and of the people 
of Quebec, without any mandate to do so.
<P>
	For those who do not believe what we are saying, I refer to the 
March 30 article in which two well-known Liberals talk about 
the future of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I listened carefully to the speech of the hon. 
member for Trois-Rivières and I would like to ask him a 
question. Are liberals not trying to find solutions to the 
problems of Ontario regarding the financing of small business 
and to generalize the Ontario model by amending the Federal 
Business Development Bank Act?
<P>
	I remember that, in the months following the election, Ontario 
Liberal members on the industry committee were somewhat 
angry and said that banks were not sensitive enough to the needs 
of small business, that the last recession had caused many 
bankruptcies and that ways had to be found to deal with the 
situation.
<P>
	Quebec committee members were less concerned by the 
situation because Quebec had already developed its own tools 
like the Fonds de solidarité des travailleurs de la FTQ-the CSN 
will soon have a similar fund-and the Mouvement des Caisses 
Desjardins. There is also the use made of business support 
centre funds and regional development funds. We already had 
all those resources.
<P>
	I feel that the amendments to the Federal Business 
Development Bank were proposed to please Ontario but they 
will not make funds more easily available to Quebec. We 
already have regional funds available. There are many 
coordination problems between the various funds. Is the change 
of vocation of the Federal Business Development Bank not 
going to make things more complicated and increase delays 
without necessarily  having a positive effect on the access of 
Quebec small business to financing?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rocheleau: </B>Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my 
colleague, the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, for his question. I commend 
his intuition. Indeed, when the Standing Committee on Industry 
started looking into the matter, the problem was centered on the 
issue of funding of small and medium size enterprises. Members 
of Parliament from Ontario made legitimate representations, 
considering the slump caused by the lack of credit, although this 
was never proven.
<P>
	But things went differently afterwards, when the purpose of 
the Federal Business Development Bank was radically changed. 
Previously, the bank's primary purpose and almost only concern 
was assisting small and medium size enterprises, but that is now 
becoming somewhat secondary.
<P>
	I will read the first lines of clause 4 which deals with that 
purpose:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``The purpose of the Bank is to support Canadian entrepreneurship-''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is what subclause 4(1) says. Subclause 4(2) says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``In carrying out its activities, the Bank must give particular consideration to 
the needs of small and medium sized-enterprises.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	So, we see that what was previously a fundamental concern 
for small and medium size enterprises is becoming somewhat 
secondary. The bank will deal as it can with small and medium 
size enterprises having primarily established entrepreneurship 
development programs, as I was saying earlier, which do not 
qualify or have not been defined. Anything is possible with the 
private funds that the bank will have in the future.
<P>
	I would like to give more information on the two 
distinguished Liberals that I was telling you about. They are the 
hon. senator Rivest and Mr. Forget. They said on an open line 
show on the CBC, which is as credible as these two gentlemen: 
``Mr. Rivest having revealed that the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs and President of the Privy Council is 
preparing a major administrative and tax reform for Canada''. 
This is Mr. Rivest speaking, a very good Liberal.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	``Mr. Forget went on to say that he feared a no vote on the 
referendum-this is very important for Quebecers-would lead 
to a loss of control by the government of Quebec on subsequent 
events''. That is, after the referendum. ``This situation would 
create opportunities for initiatives, whether under the 
constitution or not, but which could, at any rate, considerably 
change the rules. It seems to me that, for now, the threat to 
Quebec lies 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13103"> 13103 </A></B>
<P>
much more in this restructuring of the government-a vital 
issue-than in some constitutional matter''.
<P>
	I conclude with these comments, which confirm our 
apprehensions. Here, in this Parliament, as well as in the 
Langevin building, very important events are occurring, but 
they are not being publicized. A country is being built and 
changed without any debate. I think it is outrageous.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome-Missisquoi, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I just heard the hon. member for Trois-Rivières speak 
about the Federal Office of Regional Development in Quebec. I 
would like to remind him that the Office's presence in Quebec 
was requested by the social and economic stakeholders in the 
regions.
<P>
	In my riding, as in most ridings, people have asked for a 
regional economic development policy. A few days ago, we 
heard the Minister of Finance say in the House that he had 
written several times to his provincial counterparts inviting 
them to co-operate on matters related to regional economic 
development. He has received no answer to date. This is an 
important point that we must not forget during our debate.
<P>
	A few weeks ago, a seminar was held in Chicoutimi on the 
future of Quebec and its regions. At the seminar, the Quebec 
government was asked to do something along the same lines as 
the federal government in the area of economic development. I 
think this is important. The federal government is a leader in the 
field of economic development in Quebec, and, through the 
Federal Office, it is responding to people's needs, as Quebec 
should do. It is very important that the federal government 
continue its efforts, but with the provinces' co-operation.
<P>
	Finally, I have a question for the member for Trois-Rivières. 
In his riding, some forty economic development projects have 
been approved by FORD-Q. Would he deprive his constituents 
of the federal government's economic presence in his own 
riding?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Brome-Missisquoi for his very thoughtful question. Sure, we 
do not want to deprive our constituents of the moneys they have 
already paid to the government and that are redistributed in the 
normal way. When one claims to want to develop the economy, 
as the federal government is doing, it is perfectly normal that 
from time to time it takes tax moneys paid by Quebec taxpayers 
to redistribute them in Quebec.
<P>
	There is nothing new here, there is no gift in there, contrary to 
what is hinted at in such a question, as if that money was paid out 
of generosity. However, I am not sure, and there lies the danger, 
that these 40 projects are being developed in harmony with the 
efforts being made at the same time by the Quebec government. 
That is not obvious at all. On the contrary, one is left with the 
impression that there is competition, duplication and 
overlapping of energies.
<P>
	I would like to take the opportunity provided by my 
colleague's question to talk about the Federal Business 
Development Bank and the change in policy it is setting for 
itself or that is being imposed on it by the minister. We seriously 
wonder how, despite all its claims, the new Business 
Development Bank of Canada will be able to meet the need it 
met successfully up till now for very small businesses, because 
52 per cent of the loans made by the FBDB were loans of 
$100,000 or less, which suited the needs of very small 
businesses. Given the new aspirations of the Business 
Development Bank of Canada, it is not that obvious that the 
needs that were met up till now will be met in the future. This is 
not very reassuring, and therefore leads us to question the 
validity of this new mandate.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to participate in 
this debate. I will take this opportunity to set the record straight 
concerning the Canada health and social transfer.
<P>
	Contrary to the propaganda spread by the Bloc Quebecois and 
reflected in the motion before the House, the Canada health and 
social transfer does not take powers away from Quebec and 
transfer them to the federal government. Instead, it gives more 
flexibility to provinces.
<P>
	Thus, the new Canadian social transfer is a big step toward 
more mature federal-provincial fiscal relations.
<P>
	In the last federal budget, the government acted on the request 
made by Canadians that deficits be reduced through structural 
changes.
<P>
	That kind of change is essential if we are to secure Canada's 
economic well-being and protect our social programs. But the 
structural changes we need could not be made without a reform 
of the provincial transfer system.
<P>
	Cash transfers amount today to more than 20 per cent of all 
federal program spending.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The government responded to the need for change with a new 
transfer system that is both more sustainable and more effective, 
the Canada health and social transfer. Currently the federal 
government transfers funds to the provinces for health and 
post-secondary education under established programs financing 
or EPF.
<P>
	Funding for social assistance and social services is provided 
under the Canada assistance plan. Beginning in 1996-97, these 
transfers will be replaced by a single transfer as described in Bill 
C-76 which is before the House. The Canada health and social 
transfer is part of that bill.
<P>
	Unlike the current system, which is based partly on cost 
sharing arrangements, the Canada health and social transfer will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13104"> 13104 </A></B>
<P>
be a block fund like EPF. This means that  amounts transferred 
will no longer be determined by provincial spending decisions 
as under cost sharing.
<P>
	The new system will be more fiscally sustainable. When the 
Canada health and social transfer is fully implemented in 
1997-98, the total of all major transfers to provinces will be 
down by about $4.5 billion from what would have been 
transferred under the existing system.
<P>
	This is significant action but to put it into perspective, the 
reduction will equal about 3 per cent aggregate provincial 
revenues. Furthermore, the Canada health and social transfer is 
not merely more sustainable but also more efficient. It will bring 
real benefits for both levels of government.
<P>
	The Canada health and social transfer continues the evolution 
away from the requirement to obtain federal government 
approval in areas of provincial responsibility, which has been a 
source of entanglement and irritation in federal-provincial 
relations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	From the provinces' point of view, the new system will 
include fewer conditions on the use of transferred money.
<P>
	From now on, there will be no more rules on the kinds of 
expenditures that can be cost-shared and those that cannot.	Provinces will be completely free to use innovative means in the context of social security reform, and they will have more flexibility to set their own priorities.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let me offer some concrete examples of what this greater 
flexibility could entail in practice. There would be no need for 
provinces to submit claims for federal approval and no need to 
draw up lists of provincial laws, welfare agencies and the like. 
This will bring significant administrative savings.
<P>
	The move from CAP cost sharing to block funding will also 
mean that policies and programs could be designed to better 
integrate social, health, education and labour market 
programming.
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
	Further, provinces can use simpler, less intrusive methods of 
establishing eligibility for income support and services such as 
an income test. In this way federal funds will assist a wider 
range of people with disabilities to live independently, based on 
a variety of personal and employment criteria.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A less stringent implementation of needs tests could also help 
provinces make income support and non monetary benefits more 
widely available to low wage earners or people who try to stop 
depending on welfare and to enter the labour market.
<P>
	That way, federal money could be used to support the 
APPORT program in Quebec and other income supplement 
projects geared to low income families and workers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	By moving from the needs test, provinces could also provide 
integrated prevention programming to a broader cross section of 
children and families. For instance, federal funds could support 
community or school nutrition programs which are not currently 
eligible for CAP because they are not needs tested.
<P>
	The flexibility I have just described-the flexibility to spend 
as effectively as possible-paves the way for better design and 
more affordable social programs for Canadians. Each province 
will be able to emphasize the programs and services that work 
best for its own unique circumstances.
<P>
	It is important to emphasize this enhanced flexibility does not 
mean a free for all. The Canadian health and social transfer 
maintains an important federal role in social programs.
<P>
	First, the federal government will continue to provide 
substantial funding to provinces in support of health and other 
social programs. Individual provinces will receive amounts 
ranging from about 20 per cent to about 40 per cent of their total 
revenues.
<P>
	Further, the principles of the Canada Health Act will continue 
to be enforced. Canadians have made it very clear this is 
extremely important to them. Seventy-seven per cent of 
Quebecers believe these new principles are important to them 
also.
<P>
	Also, there will be no change in the principle that provinces 
must provide social assistance without minimum residency 
requirements.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Furthermore, the Minister of Human Resources Development 
will be inviting all provincial governments to work together on 
developing, through mutuel consent, a set of shared principles 
and objectives that could underlie the new Canada health and 
social transfer.
<P>
	The official opposition would like us to believe that this 
whole process is nothing but a plot to underhandedly impose 
new conditions, methods or penalties on the province of Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Frankly, that is absurd. Let me emphasize again the only 
standards contained in the legislation introduced in the Canada 
health and social transfer are the Canada Health Act provisions 
and the social assistance mobility condition. These are not new 
and they have not been changed. Compared to the status quo 
there are fewer legislative social assistance conditions in this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13105"> 13105 </A></B>
<P>
legislation, not more. The legislation provides no legal 
authority to introduce any new conditions, standards or 
penalties. Claims to the contrary are simply wrong.
<P>
	The legislation does contain a statement of the federal 
government's intention to launch the consultative process I have 
described, a process seeking mutual consent on principles and 
objectives.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Nothing new was included in this statement of intention. On 
budget night, on February 27, 1995, the government stated 
clearly that it would be ``inviting all provincial governments to 
work together on developing, through mutual consent, a set of 
shared principles and objectives that could underlie the new 
Canada social transfer''.
<P>
	This is the exact same commitment we included in Bill C-76, 
word for word. What does ``mutual consent'' mean? It means no 
government whatsoever in Canada can be forced to adhere to 
new principles and objectives against its will.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	In other words, only the governments who subscribe freely to 
new objectives and common principles will have to abide by 
them. Nothing is clearer than that and those who claim that we 
are dispensing with mutual consent are being ridiculous.
<P>
	There is another piece of nonsense from the Bloc members 
that I would like to challenge during this debate. Contrary to the 
devious spin being given by the opposition, the bill does not 
allow the federal government to introduce new standards 
through the back door. Quite the contrary. There is absolutely no 
clause in the bill that allows the federal government to introduce 
new criteria or new financial penalties with the Canada social 
transfer. Bill C-76 does not allow us to tack new conditions on 
the Canada social transfer arising from the consultative process 
carried out by the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	Those who say otherwise have misunderstood the bill. They 
do not make a distinction between statutory conditions and 
statements of intent. The principles and objectives eventually 
reached through mutual agreement between governments would 
not necessarily lend themselves to inclusion in a legislative text. 
If, some day in the future, the consenting governments want to 
entrench an agreement in a federal statute, it would be necessary 
to submit a bill to this effect to the Canadian Parliament.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would say that one of the main characteristics 
of the Canada Social Transfer for health care and social 
programs is that it is proof that Canadian federalism is capable 
of evolving. It opens the door to further progress toward a kind a 
federalism that is more mature, more responsive to the concerns 
of Canadians, who want more viable programs, and to the 
concerns of the provinces, who want more flexibility.
<P>
	It proves our commitment to get the government back on the 
right track and to reduce duplication and overlap, which will 
result in administrative savings. And it clearly shows the federal 
government's firm commitment to co-operate with the 
provinces. That commitment involves a consultation process on 
the establishment of a permanent distribution formula for the 
Canada health and social transfer, as well as on a series of issues 
concerning fiscal federalism.
<P>
	I am not at all surprised that the official opposition expresses 
its dissatisfaction about the characteristics of the new program. 
The Canada health and social transfer delivers a fatal blow to the 
separatists' arguments because it proves the vitality and the 
flexibility of the federal system.
<P>
	But the great majority of Canadian men and women strongly 
support this evolution of Canadian fiscal arrangements, as do 
most members in this House. Therefore, I urge all members to 
support this motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I found my Liberal colleague opposite quite eloquent, in his own 
way. He has aptly illustrated the ambiguity and the depth of the 
government's strategy, which is to hide its real motives.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	This is non-transparency incarnate, since it is saying one 
thing and doing another. It claims that this beautiful and 
supposedly united country is in the process of decentralizing, 
while in reality, what is really happening, to use the term used by 
the opposition and several columnists, is that the federal 
government is offloading under the pretext of decentralizing. It 
is decentralizing the fight against the deficit by foisting 
unprecedented cuts on the provinces.
<P>
	This is obvious in Quebec. There is nothing surprising about 
the unfortunate closure of a certain number of hospitals when 
one considers that the government of Quebec has had to deal 
with over one billion in cuts per year, cuts made almost on the 
quiet, without any opportunity for discussion. Fourteen billion 
dollars in cuts over 12 years and now the federal government 
wants to sell us a form of decentralization! And these cuts are 
paired with the introduction of national standards. Next, it will 
boast that it is helping to fund such and such programs. This is 
downright indecent. It should at least have the guts to call a 
spade a spade.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member to once again explain how 
his government can justify this way of operating. It would be so 
simple to just respect section 93 of this country's constitution, 
which says that social matters, including education, fall under 
provincial jurisdiction, and to just divvy up the appropriate tax 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13106"> 13106 </A></B>
<P>
points to the provinces and stay out of other people's business, 
which would be the constitutional way of operating.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Madam Speaker, the opposition member 
confused about three or four very important issues in the same 
speech. Let us take them one at a time.
<P>
	First, the federal government has given the provinces every 
opportunity to design their social programs as they wish. The 
only condition the federal government is putting in Bill C-76 is 
the condition that there is no residency requirement attached to 
social assistance.
<P>
	We think that the provinces will respond very positively and 
will develop some very innovative programming. As I explained 
in my speech on some of the barriers under the Canada 
assistance plan, which has been sort of the cornerstone of the 
Canadian social assistance program and social policy for the last 
30 years, the time has come to change it. We feel very confident 
that the provinces will do the right thing and develop some very 
innovative programming. One of the things I mentioned was the 
school lunch and breakfast programs, which are not facilitated 
under the present arrangements under the Canada assistance 
plan. There will be other opportunities.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	One expression in the text is crucial to this debate, and that is 
``mutual consent''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We use those words very carefully and very purposely to 
indicate to the provinces that we are not about to impose new 
conditions on their social programs and that if a future 
government wishes to do so this would require entirely new 
legislation.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development will be 
approaching the provinces, as is stated in the act. I want to say to 
the House that in my short history as a parliamentarian and my 
longer history as a student of Canadian politics, I cannot 
remember an act that mandates a minister to go out and consult. 
This was not just said in a speech in the House of Commons but 
is in fact part of the legislation.
<P>
	I suspect this is being taken very seriously by the minister 
himself, as he has indicated in the House, and that by mutual 
consent there may be programs emerging and conditions or 
statements. However, this is up to the minister to discuss with 
the provinces. We have simply said that at this time the 
conditions that are stated are those that are in the act.
<P>
	In terms of the responsibility the federal government has for 
closing hospitals, we cannot have it both ways. We cannot ask 
the federal government to sponsor and finance but to leave 
people alone and then second guess whether provinces are 
closing hospitals or cutting back on doctors or cutting back on 
nurses. These are very serious decisions, but they are the 
decisions of the provincial government.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	I will use the example of Alberta, where everybody is up in 
arms about the government closing rural hospitals. They often 
forget that it was the same government that opened those 
hospitals in the first place. The province has the responsibility 
for its construction programs and for the infrastructure it puts 
into health care. If mistakes were made in the past, I do not think 
federal politicians should second guess them. Those things are 
in the provincial domain, the construction of hospitals and the 
delivery of health care.
<P>
	I say this in the context that the cutbacks that will come into 
effect in two years represent 3 per cent of the total provincial 
revenues of Canada.
<P>
	We in the finance committee listened to many groups 
intervening on the question of federal funding for social and 
health policy. We have been most conscious that the amount of 
funds will not be devastating to the poor of the country. We are 
confident that with the two years of warning, one year of no cuts 
and another year of half the cuts, most provinces will have the 
revenue capacity and the tax points and the space needed to 
generate the money to make sure the programs continue, 
particularly those west of Ontario that have a balanced budget. I 
believe seven out of ten are getting close to a balanced budget. 
However, they have to decide on their own which are the best 
ways to finance these programs and what the priorities are.
<P>
	There is no province I can think of that would think of 
abandoning the poor as a priority. I am confident these issues 
will be taken care of.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I would like to ask my colleague, who is undoubtedly an 
honourable man, as a Canadian citizen elected by his 
constituents, whether, when he considers the demands of the 
people of Quebec as embodied by their government, he feels that 
these are the demands of a distinct society within the Canadian 
federation or that these are merely the vengeful demands of a 
province that refuses to conform, and above all, to be treated 
like the other provinces?
<P>
	I would be interested to hear what the hon. member has to say 
about Quebec's historic claims as opposed to the other concept 
that includes all that, where our aim, at least within the 
framework of Canadian Confederation, is to be a distinct society 
in Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13107"> 13107 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Madam Speaker, in the Canada social health 
transfers and in the debate we are having, the words distinct 
society do not appear. I will put that case aside for another 
debate.
<P>
	In the history of federal-provincial relations in the country 
there have been many arguments by many provinces against the 
federal government. Some of those have been conceptual fights 
over the federal-provincial authority and some have been fights 
over money. Depending on the nature of the Quebec government 
at various times it has pursued aggressively some of these 
objectives. In the same fashion, British Columbia took the 
federal government to court over cutbacks in the Canada 
assistance program.
<P>
	The constitutional debate is always on the horizon in Canada, 
but it is not here today and is not central to the debate today. 
What is before the House is an opposition motion debunking the 
cornerstone of the government's approach to resolving the 
problems of the country.
<P>
	We feel we have a very pragmatic and effective way of 
permitting provinces to develop their own social programs. 
There will be programming responses from Quebec, which I am 
sure will be entirely different from programming responses 
elsewhere in the country. This facilitates the development of 
programs that are very responsive to the Quebecois. People in 
other provinces may choose to do things differently. I see this in 
the context of a very wide ranging series of problems we are 
dealing with.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I welcome this opportunity to speak to the 
opposition motion before the House today, and I may recall the 
wording: That this House condemn the government's legislative 
agenda, which makes clear its intention to usurp provincial 
jurisdictions and construct an entirely centralized state, as can 
be seen from Bills C-76 on the Canada Social Transfer, C-88 on 
the Agreement on Internal Trade, C-91 on changing the name 
and mandate of the Federal Business Development Bank and 
C-46, which confirms that the Department of Industry is 
responsible for regional development in Quebec and Ontario.
<P>
	These are legal terms we use in the House, but basically, the 
real question being asked today, and it has already been asked 
this morning by the federalist parties, which demonstrates their 
failure to understand the issues at stake for Quebec, is as 
follows: Why is Quebec again disturbed by this attack by the 
federal government which is intruding in a variety of areas? 
Why is Quebec again being a spoil sport? Since today is the first 
day of June, 1995, I think we should make this show-and-tell 
month.
<P>
	In fact, after the offensive fought during the Trudeau years to 
put in place a system the Liberals now want to resuscitate, we 
had a strategic retreat by the Conservatives when, because of 
nationalist members within the Conservative caucus and 
because it was impossible to get through the bureaucracy at 
Industry Canada, for instance, the government decided in favour 
of what I would call a by-pass operation. It created the Federal 
Office of Regional Development and other regional agencies to 
get around the centralizt bureaucracy and find parallel channels 
for spending federal money in the regions. However, that was 
still at a time when there seemed to be enough money or in any 
case the government was still willing to borrow money, all of 
which helped to run up our current debt.
<P>
	Today, the ``arteries'' are being closed down. There is no more 
blood for the system to pump. Whether we try to preserve the 
Conservative-built bypasses or whether we return to the 
centralizing approach, the system needs oxygen and does not 
meet the objectives. This is what has led us to the present 
situation of 1.2 million welfare cases in Ontario and 800,000 in 
Quebec and a debt that will soon reach $600 billion. I think these 
are the symptoms of the system's failure.
<P>
	We are seeing a repeat of the events of the 1970s. The federal 
government decided it had the solutions to all the problems in 
areas of jurisdiction other than its own. Let us take Bill C-76 
dealing with the Canada social transfer as an example. The 
federal government has decided to intervene in the areas of 
health, social assistance and post-secondary education-all 
areas of provincial jurisdiction. It has decided to establish 
national standards, which take no account of the economic and 
social realities of Canada's regions.
<P>
	Let us look at a few examples. Bursaries and loans, for one. 
The bursary and loan system was changed on the sly so the 
provinces are now forced to comply with the wishes of the 
federal minister in this area. In Quebec, we developed a 
different model, and here Quebec will have to choose between 
complying with federal standards and making the rest of the 
population pay for the constraints established by the federal 
government.
<P>
	One thing I learned as a member of the human resources 
committee on its cross-Canada tour is that there is not one 
Canada and that there is no single solution to the problems 
raised. The approach of setting up national standards, as we have 
seen in health care and other sectors, at a time when the federal 
government is cutting back, leads nowhere, except to 
frustration. This is the reason for today's motion by the 
opposition, which is to make people aware, in June 1995, a few 
months away from the referendum in which Quebecers will 
decide whether they want to leave this madhouse, as René 
Lévesque described this dysfunctional and dead-end system.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13108"> 13108 </A></B>
<P>
	Therefore, Quebecers must do some thinking. At first we had 
thought they would have to decide between the status quo and 
sovereignty. Now, however, it appears that the choice is 
between a degenerating status quo with the federal government 
wanting to intervene even more and sovereignty. It is very clear.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	I understand why people who consider the federal government 
to be the main government in Canada, the one that must apply all 
the rules, have difficulty understanding where the official 
opposition stands on this issue. When one looks at it from 
Quebecers' perspective, it is clear that for Quebecers in general, 
the main government has for a long time been and still is 
Quebec. The government in Ottawa is to a large extent the result 
of a compromise made in 1867.
<P>
	Quebecers cannot accept that this federal government 
systematically interfere in areas such as social programs, 
internal trade and potential loans by the Federal Business 
Development Bank, and give the Department of Industry the 
responsibility for regional development in Quebec and in 
Ontario when one knows very well that this system never 
worked.
<P>
	The Tories had been forced to create parallel agencies to put 
an end to this bureaucracy. Now the Liberals come back to the 
old system which suited Ontario but does not suit Quebec. I have 
nothing against the fact that members of Parliament from 
Ontario protect their interests, but I am against the 
consequences of restoring an old structure which adversely 
affects Quebec and does not offer good prospects.
<P>
	Let us take, for example, the bill to implement the Agreement 
on Internal Trade, Bill C-88. We should keep in mind that this 
bill implements an agreement based on co-operation. Everyone 
in Quebec, Canada and North America realizes how important 
free trade is. It is so important that Quebecers rallied to the 
defence of the FTA, which would never have passed without 
Quebec's massive support. The FTA goes well beyond 
interprovincial trade opportunities.
<P>
	Adjustments were made to reach an acceptable compromise. 
This agreement is based on interprovincial co-operation. 
Suddenly, with Bill C-84, the federal government is 
surreptitiously putting its big paws in this agreement by 
introducing a judicial process into an agreement based on an 
administrative consensus that disputes should be settled 
between the parties.
<P>
	However, the federal government has now come up with a 
wonderful idea. In one case, whether or not the federal 
government is a party to the dispute, it may impose sanctions on 
the provinces which, in its opinion, do not comply with the 
agreement. This amounts to being both judge and party. This is a 
concrete example of the paternalistic approach used by this 
government and developed by the Canadian federal system, 
since, under the federal decision making process, senior 
officials  always feel that they are right about what to impose on 
Canadians.
<P>
	I now come back to the example of the Standing Committee 
on Human Resources Development. A year ago, officials, 
deputy ministers told the committee that UI reform would 
introduce two levels of coverage. They said that people in the 
outlying regions and seasonal workers go on UI because they are 
not prepared to work hard. Our committee travelled across 
Canada and unanimously rejected the proposed system. The 
minister set up a committee on seasonal work, which also 
rejected the whole approach proposed by the federal 
bureaucrats. This week, senior officials smugly outlined for our 
committee the same vision they had a year ago.
<P>
	Although he may have acted in good faith in this matter, the 
minister did not succeed in convincing them to change their 
proposal one iota. The bureaucracy's control over Canada's 
development is unhealthy. Bureaucrats are responsible for the 
current results. It is because of them that regional disparities are 
so wide, because they never wanted, because this government in 
particular does not want, to give each region control over 
important sectors. Instead, perhaps because the constitutional 
provisions on the division of powers are so vague, it always feels 
like interfering in areas of provincial jurisdiction, simply 
because it has the right to collect and redistribute taxes.
<P>
	Following the Canadian social transfer and the agreement on 
internal trade, the federal government is stepping up its attacks 
by proposing a new Business Development Bank of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	Clauses 20 and 21 of the new legislation to change the name of 
the Federal Business Development Bank to Business 
Development Bank of Canada, which is a minor change as far 
the name is concerned, make it possible for the federal 
government to systematically interfere in regional 
development. This goes to show, once again, that the federal 
government does not regard regional development as a 
provincial area of responsibility. In fact, it is unclear whether 
the provinces exist at all in the eyes of the federal government.
<P>
	Under clause 20 of this bill, it may deal directly with any 
organization, which means that the same pattern will be used as 
in the past. The federal government will walk in with its money, 
tell community consultation organizations, municipalities or 
development funds: ``The thing is, we can give you money for 
regional development, but we want to have a say about how it 
will be used, since our contribution will be substantial''. And 
the pattern of fighting will be repeated, with provincial and 
federal organizations each defending their turf. In the end, who 
will be the losers? The people. In this case, with the 
development bank, the businessman is the one who will be in a 
worse 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13109"> 13109 </A></B>
<P>
position than before with the various departments he will have 
to deal with.
<P>
	This is the third bill which, under the guise of simple name 
change, is used to discreetly introduce provisions that would 
have gone unnoticed if it were not for the watchful eye of the 
opposition. But this is serious business and it speaks volumes 
about how this government operates, always trying to go over 
the heads of the provinces.
<P>
	If we were certain that this approach was effective, we would 
have to recognize that, as unconstitutional as it may be, it is 
efficient, but experience shows that it is not effective and never 
has been. A region like Eastern Quebec is a perfect example, 
having been a proving ground for every federal-provincial 
action for the past 25 years. And the end result was a significant 
drop in population. All the young people have moved away, and 
we are struggling in our communities to get out of this situation, 
but were it not for the goodwill and sweat of local stakeholders, 
we would get nowhere. But we also get tired of trying to work 
with that system and finding ways to implement programs 
locally.
<P>
	There is another clause in the Business Development Bank of 
Canada bill which is indicative of duplication, as it set out two 
different goals for a development policy. I am referring to the 
fact that the bank is to support Canadian entrepreneurship. This 
is a very general statement. It means that, if some provinces 
implement projects on their territory to make up for the 
seasonality of their economy, for example in the Maritimes or in 
certain regions of Quebec, a federal intervention aimed at 
providing programs which support Canadian entrepreneurship 
could easily trigger a centralization of businesses in the large 
centres, and thus result in an even greater population decrease in 
the outlying regions.
<P>
	The provinces, and particularly Quebec, will have to spend 
energy and money to fight that approach. The federal 
government will do just the same, with the result that public 
servants will be very busy and will work really hard, but not 
toward the stated goal, which is to develop the economy.
<P>
	If only one bill or another was involved, we could talk about a 
blip on the screen, or say that the federal government wants to 
interfere in social programs because it feels that some provinces 
are not adequately assuming their responsibilities. However, 
this is a planned approach. It is a systematic approach designed 
to make Canada a unitary state.
<P>
	The predominantly English-speaking provinces probably 
have no problem with that approach, since they are pretty 
comfortable with a system where the federal government 
assumes all the responsibilities. A university chancellor in the 
Maritimes told me that we were now at a stage where we need a 
federal department of education and that it will have to come to 
that. I told him that I appreciated his being so clear about the 
issue. Such will be the choice for Quebecers. They will have to 
decide whether to keep the steamroller which, in 1982,  
unilaterally erased the reference to two founding nations in 
Canada's constitution.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	Now we are left with the Canadian people. Since 1982, all the 
federal structures have favoured this approach, which is at odds 
with how Quebec wishes to develop.
<P>
	Take health, as an example. The official opposition is said to 
continually criticize the federal government's interference in 
areas of provincial jurisdiction, but, of course, they are 
sovereignists. The members opposite will even say we are 
separatists. But if we take an event like the health forum, there 
could have been two different approaches.
<P>
	The federal government could have made sure that the 
provinces were represented. The discussions might have taken a 
little longer, but it would have been possible to reach a 
consensus and find a logical solution. Instead, it was decided to 
hold the health forum without the provinces. Not to worry, we 
will bring in experts to define Canada's needs. The result was 
inevitable.
<P>
	We find ourselves in the situation where the recommendations 
resulting from this forum will have no credibility with the 
provinces, who already have jurisdiction in this area and are 
aware of the problems created by the reduced federal budgets. 
And more problems are expected in the future. The provinces 
must take on increasing responsibilities, with no consultation by 
the federal government, accepting the news and making short 
term adjustments.
<P>
	Here we are at the beginning of June 1995. Quebecers are 
three weeks away from their national holiday and a few months 
away from a referendum in which they must decide if they want 
the future of the people of Quebec to be governed entirely by 
Quebecers or whether they can risk seeing the people of Quebec 
become just a minority among Canadians within the Canadian 
constitutional context.
<P>
	We have the choice of accepting the model proposed by the 
federal government or fighting it within the existing Canadian 
system. But that has been the nightmare of the last 30 years. 
There is no longer anyone in Quebec who dares to say that we 
should keep trying to change the federal system. No one in a 
position of political responsibility would say it because it no 
longer has any credibility, there is no longer any likelihood that 
it can be done.
<P>
	The third choice available to Quebecers is to leave the 
existing federal system, eliminate duplications and overlap, all 
the reasons to do with how it operates. But why, when it comes 
right down to it, should we leave? Why must we make sure that 
these unsuccessful efforts are not repeated? Why cease these 
futile struggles? Because, fundamentally, we are a nation. We 
have long sought to work out an agreement with Canada's other 
founding nation. Now is the time to make a choice. As Maurice 
Duplessis said: ``Donnez-nous notre butin''. Faced with a 
choice between what this government is  offering us and taking 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13110"> 13110 </A></B>
<P>
control of our own destiny, I think that Quebecers will choose 
Quebec and that, in the fall, they will decide that it is time they 
had their own country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jane Stewart (Brant, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, in my 
hon. colleague's earlier remarks he referred to Bill C-76, 
particularly the Canada health and social transfer, somehow 
implying that our change to a block funding format is reducing 
the flexibility or changing the control the province has in the 
areas of health, education and social assistance.
<P>
	I sat on the finance committee and listened to witness after 
witness say that they were concerned the strategy was quite the 
opposite, that perhaps the block transfer gave too much 
flexibility to the provinces.
<P>
	The hon. member must be able to defend that. The people of 
Canada are seeing just the opposite. Under Bill C-76 we are not 
infringing upon or tying the hands of the provinces but doing 
quite the opposite. We are giving them far more latitude, far 
more opportunity to spend the moneys transferred to the 
provinces in the way they see as best.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	There were questions earlier of my hon. colleague, the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance, that said we 
were somehow creating new guidelines and controls on the 
provinces. However, as the parliamentary secretary indicated 
very clearly, the words mutual consent are just that. The 
provinces would have to agree to any new standards and 
guidelines and if they did not, fair game.
<P>
	How can the hon. member convolute Bill C-76, particularly 
the Canada health and social transfer, into any kind of 
representation that the federal government is trying to put more 
controls and more strings on the provincial responsibilities and 
ability to use their funding in those areas?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Madam Speaker, I think that the question is quite 
pertinent, because it gets to the heart of the debate. In effect, the 
organizations from English Canada which testified before 
committee had the gall to say that, if the provinces were given 
too much latitude, they might do things that hinder their 
objectives as organizations.
<P>
	Let us look at what led to this situation. Twenty-five or thirty 
years ago, the federal government opened up its floodgates and 
began funding all kinds of programs. This contributed to our 
current debt. These organizations, which have all along been fed 
by the federal government, fear that when the government runs 
out of money, instead of simply saying so, it will decide to 
reduce transfers to the provinces, which will in turn reduce the 
capacity of these organizations to act.
<P>
	Their reaction is understandable, absolutely normal and 
healthy. They want to survive and are looking for funding. Each 
group is doing it the best way it knows how. But did you see any 
Quebec organizations behave in such a fashion in front of the 
finance and human resources development committees? Did any 
of Quebec's organizations appearing before the finance 
committee say ``we could not live with the decision to give 
Quebec jurisdiction over social programs?'' No, not a one.
<P>
	The main government for Quebecers is the government of 
Quebec. The government of Quebec is responsible for providing 
the fundamentals to promote at the very least the survival of 
Quebecers as a people. Many years ago, Quebec realized that 
that was not enough. We cannot live on unemployment 
insurance benefits alone. We do not want people telling us that 
they are our cash cow, that they hold the key to our development. 
What we want is control over our own development and the 
ability to implement measures that will get us out of difficult 
situations.
<P>
	We, not just Paul Crête the separatist but all Quebec labour 
stakeholders, have been systematically petitioning for 
jurisdiction over the labour portfolio for 10 years now. The 
Liberal Party of Quebec, the Conseil du patronat du Québec, the 
unions, and everybody in between all agree.
<P>
	It is obvious that Quebecers took part in the Canadian 
confederation in the hope of harvesting good economic benefits. 
Today, they are realizing that they do not have enough power to 
develop to their potential in this system. Worse yet, they are 
realizing that the federal government would force them to use 
the model that the other provinces want.
<P>
	Take for example the changes made to the loan and bursary 
program this year. The main section says that all provinces with 
a loan and bursary program must meet all of the requirements of 
the federal minister. The anglophone provinces have no problem 
with that, but Quebec developed a unique loan and bursary 
program 25 years ago. When this program becomes compulsory, 
which is why in Quebec particularly, students were opposed to 
this bill, Quebec will have to revamp its program completely to 
make it conform to national standards, without the social 
adjustments we want to include.
<P>
	In Quebec we are willing to have government pay a larger 
share of tuition fees. We are willing to let students have a better 
balance of bursaries and loans. The Canadian model does not 
want to develop that. Let them go ahead and develop a different 
model, but let Quebec have the option of doing as it sees fit.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13111"> 13111 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	Briefly, to answer the question, I think we have reached a 
decisive stage. We must get out of this artificial financing, 
because Canada no longer has the artificial means to spend as if 
there were no tomorrow. The debt is no longer the government's 
business, when people from outside the country come to tell the 
government to find ways to control the debt.
<P>
	So they closed the tap part of the way. The federal government 
decided it would offload budget cuts on the provinces, and now 
we are going to have to pick up the pieces. You can live beyond 
your means some of time, but not all of the time. In any case, 
there will have to be some major structural changes, but the 
most positive change would be to give these two communities, 
Quebec and Canada, a chance to develop side by side without 
putting obstacles in each other's way, and to let them each 
control their own future.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Stewart (Brant):</B> Madam Speaker, I think the hon. 
member has just made my case. He says that the people of 
Quebec want to have the responsibility to spend the moneys on 
health, education and social assistance in the way they see fit.
<P>
	That is what the block transfer allows them to do. We put the 
money together in a fund and give it to the provinces that 
constitutionally have the responsibility to provide programs and 
services for health, education and social assistance. We are 
telling them they know best. They can take the money and 
allocate it in the way they see best fitting for the people of 
Quebec. The block transfer gives that flexibility. It gives the 
provinces the responsibility to respond to its own constituency 
in those areas.
<P>
	In the course of the debate I cannot see that the opposition has 
any real clarity or substance to its point.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Madam Speaker, I think the clearest answer to this 
question, the best example, to be objective, is not to be found in 
Quebec, but in Alberta. The provincial government there has an 
approach which is very different from what the federal 
government might wish. It is almost forced to cheat with federal 
standards in the area of health. It is forced to beat about the bush, 
because it wants different rules. But the federal government, 
despite its reduced funding, feels free to establish very clear 
national standards regarding the five principal conditions. And 
so the provincial government becomes the bad guy. Provincial 
governments are certainly not going to accept responsibility for 
the years of bad management of funds by the federal 
government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome-Missisquoi, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to make a couple of comments on what we 
have just heard.
<P>
	First, a reminder regarding the Canada social transfer. Could 
it be that what the Bloc members do not like in this is the word 
``Canada''? They might like it better if it were called the Bloc 
social transfer. Indeed, it is the word ``Canada'' that irritates 
them the most in the expression Canada social transfer.
<P>
	It must be pointed out that the Canada social transfer includes 
education, health care, and social assistance. From now on, 
under the Canada social transfer, Quebec will receive block 
funding, as will all the other provinces, each one of them; the 
Quebec government will be able to allocate this block funding as 
it sees fit. It will decide how much will go to education, how 
much to health care, and how much to social assistance. This is 
important.
<P>
	The federal government is only setting the following two 
conditions; this is extraordinary decentralization and flexible 
federalism. First, the health care system will have to remain 
Canadian, and accessible to all Canadians. As our Prime 
Minister has said on several occasions, the health care system 
must allow people to be admitted to the hospital when they are 
sick, not because they have money.
<P>
	Therefore, a universal health care system is the first 
condition, The second one is that there be no minimal residence 
requirements. This is simple, this is not complicated, this is 
what the Canada social transfer is all about, whether you like it 
or not. Furthermore, the member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup mentioned earlier that this 
system was centralizing.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	I would like to go back to something I said earlier using 
FORD-Q as an example. This is something I discussed with 
several of my constituents-I am fresh out of an election 
campaign and have been in this House for close to three 
months-and people in Brome-Missisquoi want to keep 
FORD-Q. Not only do they want to keep it but, as I mentioned 
earlier, at a forum recently held in Trois-Rivières on the future 
of the regions in Quebec, people demanded that Quebec do its 
share with regard to regional development. To this day, Quebec 
has done nothing. The federal example is convincing and I 
believe that we must continue along the same line.
<P>
	To conclude, I would like to ask a question to the member.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry, but the 
member has risen on debate. He has 10 minutes. I understand 
that you are sharing your time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paradis:</B> Madam Speaker, I thought I had risen on 
questions and comments. For the debate, I intend to share my 
time with the member for Durham.
<P>
	The motion of the opposition suggests, among other things, 
that the legislation implementing the Agreement on Internal 
Trade is aimed at reducing Quebec's powers to the benefit of the 
federal government. First of all, I would like the member for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13112"> 13112 </A></B>
<P>
Shefford, the mover of the motion, to become familiar with the 
bill.
<P>
	The preamble reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WHEREAS the Government of Canada together with the Governments of 
Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, Quebec, 
Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia, the Northwest 
Territories and the Yukon Territory have entered into an Agreement on Internal 
Trade;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>AND WHEREAS the reduction or elimination of barriers to the free movement 
of persons, goods, services and investments is essential for the promotion of an 
open, efficient and stable domestic market to enhance the competitiveness of 
Canadian business and sustainable development-</BLOCKQUOTE>
This is the preamble to the bill.
<P>
	Clause 5 is not too complicated. Clause 7 says: ``The 
Agreement is hereby approved''.
<P>
	This is an agreement between the provinces and the federal 
government. This agreement between the federal government 
and the provinces shows once again how efficiently Canadian 
federalism can accommodate differences and produce concrete, 
practical results.
<P>
	For example, in Brome-Missisquoi and particularly in the 
Estrie region, there is an very high degree of co-operation in 
labour matters between the Monteregian and Estrie manpower 
associations and Human Resources Development Canada. We 
sat down together and signed an agreement, a document looking 
at job opportunities in the next five years.
<P>
	This is another example of the co-operation between the 
federal government and Quebec.
<P>
	Canadian federalism requires a high degree of consultation 
and co-operation between the federal government and the 
provinces on a wide range of issues. Federal-provincial 
relations are doing very well in Brome-Missisquoi. I must say 
that the relations are quite friendly.
<P>
	Our federalism is based on a series of intergovernmental 
mechanisms that allows us to overcome difficulties. That is 
why, over the years, we were able to work out various 
arrangements between the two levels of government.
<P>
	This approach is successful in our federation because the 
Prime Minister, the premiers, ministers and public officials all 
work in close co-operation to achieve concrete, practical 
results.
<P>
	These arrangements are an essential component of the 
Canadian federation and provide flexibility.
<P>
	These various mechanisms and this great flexibility 
associated with our kind of federalism enabled us to achieve the 
following in co-operation with our partners: the signature of 
infrastructure program agreements with all the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	This program was implemented quickly with the co-operation 
of the federal government and all the provinces, is working very 
well and has created jobs from coast to coast, which is what 
Canadians want.
<P>
	We also signed action plans to reduce overlap and duplication 
with eight provinces and two territories. We set up Team 
Canada. As you may recall, the Prime Minister travelled to Asia 
and South America for the purpose of making inroads on new, 
promising markets. Again, for the purpose of strengthening the 
economic union, we signed an agreement to reduce 
interprovincial barriers to the free movement of goods and 
people.
<P>
	Consultations on interprovincial barrier elimination in 
Canada is a fine example of co-operation that lead to a practical 
agreement, which reflects the flexibility and vitality of this 
federation. The Government of Canada engaged in consultations 
with the provinces and territories, and together they agreed on a 
process that resulted, once again, in an agreement which is fair 
and just for all concerned.
<P>
	Specifically, the agreement lays the basis for preventing the 
creation of new barriers and eliminating existing ones in nine 
areas of economic activity. It increases transparency and puts in 
place a dispute settlement mechanism available to individuals 
as well as businesses to ensure government compliance with the 
agreement.
<P>
	It provides for the development of action plans in a number of 
areas, so that standards are harmonized. It covers major areas 
like transportation and consumer protection. In addition, great 
emphasis is put on the environment in this agreement, thereby 
setting it up as a modern-day concern.
<P>
	Finally, the agreement takes Canadian diversity into account 
by ensuring a fair balance between trade objectives and 
government objectives.
<P>
	This is the first agreement of its kind in Canada. It represents 
a major victory for all Canadians. It proves conclusively that the 
federal, provincial and territorial governments can work 
together, provided there is good faith.
<P>
	This agreement is a key part of this government's strategy for 
promoting strong economic growth in Canada and getting 
Canadians back to work. The Internal Trade Agreement, 
complete with concrete changes, implementation schedules and 
thorough process, will reinforce the Canadian economic union 
and promote freer movement of people, capital, goods and 
services within it. It is the exact opposite of the separatist 
option, characterized mainly by self-centredness and a 
fascination with one's navel.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13113"> 13113 </A></B>
<P>
	Contrary to what the hon. member opposite suggests, the act 
to implement the Internal Trade Agreement is not designed to 
take powers away from Quebec or any other province, but to 
ensure that we all grow stronger.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
will make a few comments before putting my question. First, I 
want to point out the contradiction in the hon. member's last 
comment. He claims that sovereignists are self-centered, but it 
is the federalists who say that, if we do achieve sovereignty, they 
will not enter into an economic union with Quebec.
<P>
	So, which side is self-centered? It is the Canadian side, and I 
do not mean the people, but those who are mandated to represent 
them and do not do so properly in this case. They are the ones 
who say that they will refuse to participate in an economic union 
with Quebec. They are the ones who are self-centered, not us.
<P>
	As for us, we are saying just the opposite: we welcome the 
idea of a partnership. After all, it would be consistent with 
today's trend. It is possible to want to control things and have as 
much power as possible as a nation and still be open to the idea 
of economic partnerships with others.
<P>
	It is the hon. member who is inward-looking and 
self-centered. He is new here but, over time, he will come to 
recognize all the examples of duplication which exist.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	The member referred to the Canada social transfer. I 
participated in a talk show at a Montreal radio station, CJAD, 
with the Minister of Human Resources Development, who 
addressed people who were panicking at the idea that the federal 
government would no longer have control. Interest groups in 
Canada are indeed concerned when they realize that the federal 
government will have less control over social programs. They 
are worried when they see the rise of the right wing in western 
Canada, and I can certainly understand their concern. They are 
worried about this whole issue.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development told these 
people, and you can listen to the tapes: ``Quite the contrary! We 
will now have more control than before''. I would appreciate it if 
the two of them could get together and try to reconcile their 
views, given that the member just referred to an extraordinary 
flexibility.
<P>
	He also mentioned the Federal Office of Regional 
Development, now a federal structure with no money and no 
means to act, but which gets involved in many issues. The 
member says: ``Now, this is a good illustration of the future in 
regional development''. I say that there is still a lot of room for 
improvement.
<P>
	Let us now look at the issue of manpower, to which the 
member briefly alluded, and also the co-operation agreements 
in his region. In his speech, the hon. member said that we would 
discuss, examine and consider the issue, and that is exactly what 
is being done. But while governments are discussing, the 
unemployed and welfare recipients are not working. While he 
says: ``It is all  right, federal and provincial officers are working 
together, trying to harmonize things and reduce overlap'', 
nothing is being done, because of all the tension between the two 
levels of government which are always eager to pass the buck 
back and forth.
<P>
	When only one level of government will be dealing with this 
issue, things will be clearer for the citizens who will have a more 
direct influence. The time will have come to stop talking about it 
and to take action, and I can hardly wait. My question is related 
to all of this. At first, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development said that he would reduce transfer payments for 
post-secondary education. Given the reaction of students, the 
government decided to hide its agenda first by lumping up the 
programs and then by making its cuts so that no one would know 
which program was hit the hardest.
<P>
	Having said that, let me add that the Quebec National 
Assembly unanimously passed a motion put forward by the 
Action démocratique, with the support of the Liberal Party of 
Quebec, the close federalist friends of the members opposite, 
which said that Quebec should get more tax points instead. They 
all agreed on that.
<P>
	Since the hon. member believes that the system is flexible, I 
would like him to tell us why his government does not want to 
give this area of jurisdiction to the province of Quebec and if he 
supports the resolution passed by the National Assembly of 
Quebec, which is asking for more tax points instead of cuts to 
cash transfers. I would like to find out the position of the hon. 
member on this issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paradis:</B> Madam Speaker, my first comment would be to 
say that Canada is a country that works. Maybe that is why our 
colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois do not know which way to 
turn. Canada is a working proposition. A moment ago, they were 
talking about dismantling something that works just fine in 
order to set up a new partnership. That is exactly the word used 
by colleague from the Bloc.
<P>
	If we are to have a partnership, mutual respect is a 
prerequisite. Hurling insults at people or at a system will lead us 
nowhere. Canada already has a structure to accommodate 
co-operation and partnership between the provinces and the 
federal government. Scores of agreements have been signed by 
both levels of government. That structure has been designed to 
let Canada as a whole and the provinces, reach for a better 
future.
<P>
	My second point concerns the Canada social transfer, which 
demonstrates the flexibility of federalism.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it 
gives me great pleasure to enter into this debate on the motion by 
my hon. colleague in the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13114"> 13114 </A></B>
<P>
	What we are discussing today is flexible federalism. Indeed, 
I think sometimes that my hon. colleagues in the Bloc do not 
understand the word flexible. What has kept Canada together 
for many years has been the fact that people have been able to 
understand and respect each other's differences and diversities.
<P>
	I can remember reading an article about an American study 
which was commissioned during the second world war. It said 
that of all the allied countries which were fighting in the war, 
Canada was the most likely to break up.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	As we stand here today we can reflect on the erroneousness of 
that report which talked about Canada's being so decentralized 
it would be an easy matter for it to dissolve. The reality is the 
decentralization of Canada is its strength.
<P>
	We govern a huge geographical country. This part of the 
northern hemisphere has not only great cultural diversity but 
also climactic diversity due to our geography. Lester Pearson 
once said we have too much geography in this country. There is 
some truth to that.
<P>
	My fellow colleagues in the Bloc often discuss and point to 
what they believe is duplication and overlap. They like to point 
out this is some kind of failure of our federal system. Let us look 
at some of these programs. I am amazed at some of the areas 
Quebec does control. It has control over immigration and 
controls for a large part its own income tax system. For most 
countries their individual states do not have these kinds of 
powers. Clearly we have already decentralized significantly in 
Canada.
<P>
	The Bloc often says our having shared jurisdictions creates 
inefficiency. Duplication and overlap is the theory. I have been 
interested to discover one area of purely provincial jurisdiction 
in Quebec, education, does not perform particularly well. Next 
to Alberta, Quebec has the highest drop out rate for secondary 
education institutions, over 30 per cent.
<P>
	Quebec spends the highest per capita on education with 
$7,132 per student. With this exclusive control it would appear 
it has been unable to solve its problems. All provinces have 
problems, but it is not clear that by not having shared 
jurisdictions somehow there are great efficiencies to be earned. 
With shared jurisdictions there is more of a consultative 
framework, more of an opportunity to get good advice form 
across the country.
<P>
	I will deal with two components of the motion. It talks about 
Bill C-88, an agreement on internal trade. All provinces have 
basically consented to this and signed this agreement. In an era 
when we are discussing things like the GATT agreement and 
NAFTA it seems almost a tarnish and a shame on Canada that we 
have to argue and discuss trade agreements within our country.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has often talked about a European Union 
type of government. In reality the European Union probably has 
freer trade within its union than does Canada. The agreement on 
internal trade does not solve all of these problems. There is 
continued inhibition of trade within our country. It seems odd to 
me when this act is used as part of an argument that somehow we 
are trying to concentrate power in Ottawa when in reality we are 
trying to create a free market within our nation.
<P>
	The motion deals with Bill C-91, an act not to create 
something new but merely to rename something. I can only 
assume my colleague's concern is the Federal Business 
Development Bank may well become the business development 
bank of Canada. I do not know if the use of the word Canada 
bothers him so much. I do not like those words. When I see the 
words of Canada I think of American corporations operating in 
Canada, such as General Motors of Canada. Be that as it may this 
is the proposed new name.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	It seems to me some of the things proposed in the legislation 
are to create more dynamism in arranging capitalization of 
small and medium sized businesses. This is something very 
close to my heart. I believe through creating new capital markets 
in Canada we will encourage and create new jobs. The business 
formation is inhibited by its inability to seek capital.
<P>
	I have listened to some of my colleagues in the Reform Party 
who speak against this bill because they feel it is a competition 
with existing banking structures. The Federal Business 
Development Bank and in some ways its sister company, the 
Farm Credit Corporation came into existence for a very 
significant and real reason: there is a significant lack of long 
term business financing. Our banking sector has basically 
become a short term lender. The popular loan within the banks is 
a demand loan. Imagine borrowing some money today and 
tomorrow the banks can call it back. That is how the banks want 
to lend. There are a number of reasons. It has to do with their 
deposits and so on. That is what banks are.
<P>
	In a sense there is a disequilibrium in the market which is long 
term financing. Banks do not get involved in it mainly because 
of the way they are capitalized. The Federal Business 
Development Bank, which is now called the business 
development bank of Canada, will raise funds in Europe and 
other equity markets throughout the world and attempt to match 
them on a long term approach.
<P>
	It does not matter whether we are in Quebec, Ontario or 
Saskatchewan, small business needs some kind of access to this 
capitalization and it is not being provided in Canada.
<P>
	In the United States it is common to have mortgages that run 
30 years and payable in 30 years. This gives people a great deal 
of security in their arrangements. We do not have this in Canada. 
Our capital markets are  deficient because we have only short 
term lenders. Because of that uncertainty in our marketplace 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13115"> 13115 </A></B>
<P>
small businesses find it very difficult to become capitalized. 
What they want is equipment. Farmers are probably the most 
capital intensive of any business with farmland, equipment and 
buildings that cannot be paid off tomorrow.
<P>
	I am surprised that my colleagues in the Bloc, who I am sure 
must be interested in creating jobs in Quebec which has one of 
the highest unemployment rates in Canada, would see this bill as 
somehow a centralizing factor. This bank has branches 
throughout Quebec. If we had only one branch in Ottawa and we 
made all the people come here, I would call that centralization. 
When in reality facilities are available not only in Quebec but 
throughout Canada that is a decentralized approach and we are 
not treating any one province differently than another.
<P>
	These are not gifts. These are not grants. These are not 
sources of regional development. People simply borrow money 
on a long term basis and pay it back over an agreed period of 
time. It is fulfilling a need.
<P>
	I understand some people wish the private sector would do 
this. Why Canada is typified by short term capital markets I do 
not know. However, this is the way it is being addressed. 
Hopefully some day we can privatize this bank, but it has not 
occurred. Most of the major banks still do not get involved in 
long term lending.
<P>
	From my experience the Federal Business Development Bank 
has been a major asset in lending to small businesses.
<P>
	The important thing is both of these pieces of legislation have 
nothing to do with centralizing the power of the state but they 
have everything to do with creating jobs in neighbourhoods and 
communities in Quebec and in Ontario.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	The problem we have with a lot of people is we have too much 
government. I do not think we need to centralize it. We need to 
get government closer to the people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure for me to rise this afternoon and speak in opposition to 
the Bloc motion.
<P>
	In some ways and in some areas of the bill highlighted on this 
motion we agree with the Bloc that the system is broken and 
these bills are not addressing the real problem.
<P>
	Where we differ with our colleagues from the Bloc is the 
problem is repairable. It can be fixed. There is absolutely no 
reason for quitting or separating. Canada is worth fighting for 
and that is what we have to do.
<P>
	What I read in this motion, the me, we mentality, is the real 
problem. It is what is in it for me and not what is in it for Canada.
<P>
	I recall an article about the me, we generation. It identified the 
1980s as the me generation. It talked about the Milkens in the 
United States and the Campeaus in Canada who were out for 
personal gain and glory at the expense of jobs to thousands of 
Canadians.
<P>
	The article suggested that changed in the 1990s, that the 
1990s changed to what we call the we generation. It talked about 
people becoming more concerned about what is really important 
in life. It talked about the number of people who have started 
contributing to charities and working for the betterment of their 
communities.
<P>
	In the article a minister had interviewed many people in their 
last moments. He never had heard anyone say in those last 
moments they wished they had spent more time at the office. 
The message there was we all have to remember that what is 
good for the family is really what is important.
<P>
	There was also a story of a very successful stockbroker who 
had made millions in the stock exchange, more money than he 
could ever hope to spend in his lifetime. He quit all that when he 
realized what was really meaningful in life and what was really 
important to him was missing. He walked away from it. He went 
home to look after a young family even to the point of making 
sandwiches and participating in life. He found a great deal more 
satisfaction from that. This mentality of we, me is at the bottom 
of many of the problems we have in Canada today.
<P>
	The status quo has been rejected overwhelmingly. There is no 
question about that with 205 new members elected to 
Parliament. There was a very strong message from the Canadian 
people they were not happy with what had been happening here 
and they wanted change.
<P>
	Change does not mean walking away or quitting. The change 
they are asking for is a change to the system to make it work, to 
make for a better and united Canada. Canada is worth fighting 
for. We have the greatest country in the world.
<P>
	We have a great opportunity with 205 new members. We have 
some fresh thinking, some new ideas and new visions for a new 
Canada, a Canada where all citizens in all provinces will be 
treated equally.
<P>
	I am sure the people in the province of Quebec are no different 
from the people in every province across this great country. 
They are looking for a government that will live within its 
means. They are looking for a government that will do what it 
has to do in their lives and in their businesses.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13116"> 13116 </A></B>
<P>
	There is no way any family or any business can continue to 
go deeper and deeper in debt year after year and survive. The 
people in Quebec are looking for politicians with integrity who 
will say what they mean and mean what they say. The tragedy 
of broken promises has created a level of cynicism which has 
to be overcome all across Canada.
<P>
	They are looking for a change in the process. They are looking 
for changes with the government being more responsive to the 
needs and demands of the people. They want to have a say in 
what is going on in Ottawa, not just hear the voice of Ottawa in 
the ridings. They want a change in the process. Freer votes, 
referenda and recall are all issues which the people of Quebec 
would support as well as the rest of Canadians. As I said in 
another speech, if you want trust you have to give trust. We have 
to do that to return to the level of trust that has been lost. I am 
sure the people of Quebec are no different from other Canadians 
in wanting safer streets, safer homes and safer communities.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	This motion highlights several bills and I would like to deal 
with two of them, the budget bill, Bill C-76, and Bill C-88, that 
deals with interprovincial trade barriers. In those two bills the 
government missed an opportunity and failed to unite Canada 
and to address the barriers which exist. I would like to highlight 
where the government went wrong and what should be done to 
restore Canada as a united nation.
<P>
	The budget was wrong. It failed dismally in addressing the 
deficit and the debt, which are the most serious problems 
Canada has today. I was very disturbed and disappointed by the 
Bloc response to the budget. Apparently Bloc members still do 
not understand and appreciate the fact that the deficit and the 
debt are the major problems in Canada. What I heard was: ``It is 
not really a problem. It is not too serious. All we have to do is 
trim a bit of government fat. Whatever we do, we should not 
touch the social programs because they are sacred''.
<P>
	I would suggest that with a $600 billion debt, overspending of 
$25 billion a year and interest payments approaching $52 
billion, all programs have to be looked at thoroughly. It cannot 
be done simply by trimming government fat or by going after the 
social programs. All areas of government spending must be 
addressed. The spending which has been taking place in social 
programs, because they represent such a huge portion of the 
total spending envelope, absolutely has to be addressed.
<P>
	The message is that Canada has a spending problem, not a 
revenue problem. Canadians from coast to coast understand 
that. They were ready for the budget. When I say coast to coast I 
am including the people of the province of Quebec. They 
understand the magnitude of the problem. They understand that 
living beyond our means has to come to an end. There will be 
some pain associated with it, but that is facing reality. To 
suggest  that the deficit might be tackled by getting delinquent 
taxpayers to pay the tax dollars they owe is a flight in fantasy. It 
nowhere nearly approaches our enormous debt.
<P>
	It is interesting that Moody's, the bond rating agency which 
fired a warning shot across the bow of the finance minister 
before the budget came out is not Conservative, Liberal, Reform 
or Bloc. Moody's is non-political and was, as a bond rating 
agency, in my estimation, doing us a favour. It was sending a 
warning to the government about the seriousness of the 
overspending problem.
<P>
	What did we do? We shot the messenger. The messenger was 
not telling us what we wanted to hear. In reality the messenger 
was giving us good fiscal advice to get our house in order and to 
get it in order quickly. It did that in advance of the budget 
because there were two messages which it wanted the 
government to get.
<P>
	The first message was that 3 per cent of GDP is too low a 
target. It is easy and it will not fly with the investors that have 
been buying our bonds. The second part of the message was that 
it wanted a date set when Canada was going to achieve a 
balanced budget. Rolling two-year targets that the government 
hopes to meet will not fly with the people who have been buying 
our bonds. They want to know how and when Canada will 
balance its budget. No reasonable banker and no reasonable 
Canadian would expect less.
<P>
	The downgrade which Moody's threatened before the budget 
was introduced, as we know now, happened. The budget which 
could have united us did not. In fact, it is doing more damage to 
the country as we are going deeper and deeper into debt. The 
downgrade has not really taken effect yet but it will down the 
road. It will have a very dramatic effect on the rate of interest 
paid to finance our bonds. Every 1 per cent increase in those 
interest rates costs Canadian taxpayers in the first year of 
borrowing an extra $1.7 billion. The impact of that downgrade is 
very significant and does not look well for the future.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	The budget has been passed on the assumption that interest 
rates will remain fairly stable. That is a very dangerous 
assumption. It does not take into account the possibility of a 
downturn in the economy which we know is coming. It is not a 
matter of if it is going to come. Economies go up and down and 
Canada could very well be into a downturn in the economy now 
and is very poorly positioned to deal with it.
<P>
	Canadians know there are three ways to balance the books in 
Ottawa. One is to raise taxes. The second is to hope for growth in 
the economy and the third is to cut spending.
<P>
	Canadians from coast to coast are not prepared to pay any 
more taxes. Again, the people in Quebec are no different from 
the people in every other province who are taxed to the limit. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13117"> 13117 </A></B>
<P>
That is not an avenue that the  government should explore to 
raise funds in order to balance the books.
<P>
	Growth in the economy is an area the Liberals look at through 
rose coloured glasses, hoping that there would be greater growth 
in the economy than actually happens. The downside of that is 
when the economy does not grow. In fact our deficit and debt has 
increased, it has not been reduced.
<P>
	Going back to taxes for a moment, taxes right across Canada 
are counterproductive. The more taxes are increased, the more 
the underground economy is fuelled. As huge as it is now, it will 
only grow by any attempt at an additional tax grab.
<P>
	The area that we have complete control over is spending. That 
is where the government missed with this budget. It did not go 
after the reductions in spending to get the books in balance so 
that there would be no new and increased taxes.
<P>
	The government likes to say that it inherited the problem. I 
suggest that it initiated the problem. I go back to the years 1963 
to 1984 when the debt rose from $20 billion to just about $200 
billion when it left office.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the Conservatives took office and in their 
years from 1984 to 1993 the debt increased from $200 billion to 
some $490 billion. It is interesting that some of the Bloc 
members today were actually sitting with the Conservative 
government and were allowing that debt hole to continue to go 
as deep as it did.
<P>
	It is also interesting to recall that very little was done by 
government members when they were in opposition to support 
any of the attempts that were made to get spending under 
control. For them to say that they inherited the debt is not quite 
factual. They initiated the problem several years ago that put us 
in the mess we are in today.
<P>
	In 1993 when the Liberals presented their first budget, they 
still had no idea of the magnitude of the problem. The message 
we got then was: ``Be happy, don't worry. This deficit and debt 
are not serious. We are not going to do anything''. In fact they 
did nothing.
<P>
	I should not say that nothing was done but what was done was 
unbelievable in the short time after the budget. The Bloc was 
part of this. They gave in to the smugglers. They gave away $350 
million in taxes that Canadians could ill afford then and 
certainly could not afford today. That is aside from the 
additional health costs that are down the road because of that 
very foolish move on the part of the government.
<P>
	What has been learned since is that the forecast of $350 
million, which should not have surprised us because they are not 
good with numbers, turned out to be something like $800 or 
$850 million. It cost nearly a billion dollars to give in to the bad 
guys, the smugglers. It is unbelievable given the fiscal position 
we are in.
<P>
	What happened in 1994? We had an admission that the 
problem was serious. Now the finance minister is saying that 
this is a serious problem. It may even be life threatening. 
Unfortunately he does not have a solution.
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	They have some plans for these rolling targets. At the end of 
this first rolling target the government will still be overspending 
by $25 billion a year and will be $600 billion in debt. When it 
addresses the next budget it will be trying to shoehorn in $52 
billion in interest payments.
<P>
	If members think this budget was difficult, try the next one, 
where the government will be trying to find a way to 
accommodate $52 billion in interest payments without any 
significant cuts. I would suggest it cannot be done.
<P>
	Canadians in every province want fiscal sanity in this place 
and that is not what Bill C-76 gave us. They are not looking for 
pie in the sky. They know what has to be done. They are looking 
for reality and they are prepared to support a government that 
will give it to them.
<P>
	Let me speak for a moment on Bill C-88 concerning 
interprovincial trade barriers. It is a bill that could have meant a 
great deal to uniting the country but it missed the mark 
completely. It was a great opportunity to bring down the walls 
that are dividing us east to west.
<P>
	In spite of the barriers there is about $146 billion in trade 
between the provinces. It was the Canadian Manufacturers' 
Association that said those barriers are costing taxpayers $6 
billion and hundreds of thousands of jobs.
<P>
	Canada can trade north-south with free trade but it still cannot 
trade east-west. Bill C-88 did nothing to really address that. It 
just touched lightly on some areas but did not get into the real 
meat of the barriers that are there.
<P>
	Free trade is talked about as the salvation of Canada. If it was 
not for free trade, our exports would be in a much sadder 
condition than they are presently. Free trade was violently 
opposed by the current government when it was in opposition. 
Today it is proving to be its salvation.
<P>
	The federal government has a responsibility for breaking 
down the barriers to interprovincial trade but it has abdicated the 
responsibility. Those walls must be broken down because those 
barriers are interfering with the interaction of governments and 
deterring the development of culture between the different 
provinces.
<P>
	The provinces have always been able to negotiate bilateral 
trade agreements. As a matter of fact one was negotiated 
between Quebec and Ontario regarding the construction trades. 
Both provinces worked that out and it was a model which 
showed those things could be worked out across Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13118"> 13118 </A></B>
<P>
	Bill C-88 as it is now discourages international investors 
from coming into all the provinces and creating employment. 
Years were spent negotiating GATT. The Department of Finance 
estimated it represents about a .04 per cent increase in Canada's 
gross domestic product. Yet the Fraser Institute said that if 
interprovincial trade barriers could be broken down the GDP 
could be increased anywhere from 2 per cent to 6 per cent. All 
this time has been spent negotiating GATT for .04 per cent when 
if something was done about internal barriers a much more 
significant improvement could be made in the GDP. This would 
translate into jobs that are sorely needed in the economy. As 
I said, it would strengthen our economic, political and cultural 
ties.
<P>
	These barriers cause lost jobs in every province resulting in 
higher taxes and making us less competitive in the global 
economy. If we really want to benefit from north-south free 
trade, we can only do it by maximizing trade east-west as well. 
Again, it is the me mentality that exists which must be broken 
down. It has to give way to the we mentality.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to say that with 205 new members in 
the House we have a great opportunity to resolve the problems in 
the country. We do have problems. There is no denying that. We 
are a family and all families must give and take. In every 
successful marriage it is give and take. It is never all one way if 
it is to be a successful and happy marriage. Working together we 
can fix it. We can make Canada a better place for all Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
	Indeed, Canada is worth fighting for. I intend to fight for it as 
hard as I can, as hard as I know how. I want to do that because my 
grandchildren are counting on me to do that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to 
begin by making a comment and then asking my colleague to 
answer a question.
<P>
	First, I very much enjoyed the beginning of his speech where 
he spoke about the me and we mentality. Then for whatever 
reason, I do not know why, he derailed himself and took a 
different type of train. I counted in excess of 52 different 
negative connotations throughout his speech. He spoke at the 
beginning about public cynicism and public confidence, yet his 
speech dealt only with the negative but not really the positive 
things this government and this country have to offer its people.
<P>
	My colleague surely knows it is not government that creates 
jobs; it is the private sector. Surely my colleague and the public 
would know that all the government can and should do is create a 
proper environment so the private sector can create jobs. 
Historically, it has always been the private sector that has 
created jobs.
<P>
	I would like to bring to the attention of my colleagues that 
interest rates since we took office have been stable; we have 
stability in interest rates. Our trade has hit an  all-time high. Our 
economic growth is leading the G-7 countries. My colleague 
could testify to the fact that our growth is greater than any other 
country in the western hemisphere.
<P>
	The government has taken a number of steps in order to 
streamline and reorganize the way we deliver services. In fact 
some of those bills deal specifically with reorganizing, with 
giving different levels of government different responsibilities 
so we can better do the job we are supposed to be doing.
<P>
	I also wanted to bring to my colleague's attention that there is 
a myth that government should not be looking at taxes for 
generating revenue. The only way for government to get revenue 
is through taxes. How else can we support programs unless we 
are generating tax revenues? Economic growth means 
businesses are doing well, which means government is 
generating more taxes.
<P>
	Telling the public we are no longer going to collect taxes gives 
the wrong signal; it is the wrong thing to say. We should be 
saying that we need economic growth so government revenue 
could increase through taxes. If businesses do well we will bring 
in more taxes.
<P>
	I do not understand why my colleague would say we can no 
longer collect tax from the private domain. That is the only way 
governments here and anywhere in the world can do business 
unless they were to go into business themselves. We were in 
business in the past. This government is trying to get out of 
doing business itself by streamlining, by privatizing part of the 
crown corporations we have so they can do the kind of work 
done by them in the past through the government. They will be 
able to do it on their own.
<P>
	On the issue of spending, this government has done a 
tremendous amount of work in the area of spending. I do not 
know what my colleague expects. In one year the government 
came down with a budget that slashed over 45,000 jobs from the 
public service itself, from the public domain.
<P>
	If we were to look at the balance sheet, this government is now 
generating more revenues than we are spending. In a way we are 
already in a surplus position. The problem here is there are no 
more cuts to be done but we have to increase revenues.
<P>
	I will submit to my colleague that we should turn the me and 
we mentality into a mentality of we collectively.
<P>
	Finally, I wanted to ask him what specifically he would 
suggest the government do that it has not done, and give it to us 
in point form without any negatives.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Madam Speaker, there was a 
lot said by the member for Ottawa Centre.
<P>
	I would like to begin by saying it is very difficult to find 
anything but negatives when we are responding to this 
government's agenda. I could not believe it when I heard the 
member say that it is not governments that create jobs but the 
private sector. That is not the message that has been coming 
across the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13119"> 13119 </A></B>
<P>
floor. They have spent  $6 billion on an infrastructure program 
because governments were going to create jobs, arenas, boccie 
courts.
<P>
<B>(1350 ) </B>
<P>
	That is government creating false jobs, not real jobs. It still 
fails to get the connection between high taxes and job creation. 
High taxes kill job creation. If we want to create jobs we have to 
lower taxes. One of the provinces is doing that right now. It is 
lowering taxes and cutting spending. What is happening? It is 
increasing employment. It is getting more jobs for its people.
<P>
	This budget is not a job creator, it is a job killer. The 
government does not create jobs, the private sector does, and the 
private sector is looking for tax reductions. Anybody in the 
private sector will say: ``Get out of our lives. Get off our backs. 
Get out of our pockets. We will create the jobs, but we do not 
need you on our backs. Get off our backs and we will do it''.
<P>
	The hon. member spoke about the myth of taxes. I am sure that 
Canadians who were listening to ``we do it with more taxes'' are 
responding to that, because they are eagerly waiting to give the 
government more tax dollars. They have been giving the 
government all of these tax dollars and they have been receiving 
fewer services. Does the government not think they are getting 
the message?
<P>
	The reason for the tax increases over the years has been 
supposedly to do something about our deficit and debt, but they 
have been getting deeper and deeper. It has not happened. There 
is no proof that the answer is to go after more taxes. In fact, the 
opposite has been happening for 25 years.
<P>
	Where is the justification for standing up and talking about 
the myth of taxes? The myth is that we are taxing too much. We 
have to cut our spending. When we have been overspending for 
the number of years we have been, to suggest that we can 
continue to overspend and that the Canadian people will be 
prepared to support us with more tax dollars is to dream in the 
extreme.
<P>
	The government has not yet received the message. It will get it 
in the next election. When the government addresses the next 
budget let it find how it will accommodate $52 billion in interest 
payments that are going out the window without increasing 
taxes and again hurting the creation of jobs.
<P>
	It is nice to hear hon. members opposite talking about free 
trade. When they were in opposition they were vehemently 
opposed to free trade. Yet in fact free trade today is the salvation 
of this government. If it were not for free trade it would be in far 
worse shape than it is right now.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, as my colleague for Simcoe-Centre was saying, it is 
true that the Liberal government does not understand anything. 
But, unfortunately, the Reform Party has not  yet understood that 
Canada's fundamental problem is not about to be solved.
<P>
	Despite their good intentions, Reform members have not 
understood that, when powers are centralized in Ottawa, it just 
perpetuates a long-standing problem in Canada. When powers 
are centralized, taxes go up, costs go up and we do not get the 
services we need. So when a Reform member rises in this House 
to tell us that what we need is more services for the people, I 
have to tell him that it is certainly not by centralizing powers in 
Ottawa that we will be able to provide more services to the 
people. Anybody with good common sense would recognize 
that, if we want to provide more services at a lower cost, we have 
to get closer to the people. Therefore, powers have to be 
decentralized.
<P>
	We can see through all the bills I have talked about that the 
Liberal government is trying once again to centralize even more. 
And, once again, it will be expensive, it may even lead to tax 
increases, it will certainly cause more waste, more 
irresponsibility, more lobbying and all the other evils that come 
with excessive centralization of powers in Ottawa.
<P>
	If members from the Reform Party, from the west, really want 
to offer a solution for Canada, they have to try to return powers 
to their provinces. They really have to do that. If they do, 
government will become more efficient.
<P>
	We, in Quebec, understand that bureaucracy has to be 
reduced. We have known that for a long time. That is exactly 
why we are sovereignist. We have understood that it is the only 
solution for us if we want to provide more services to the people, 
to reduce costs, to reduce duplication and to get the federal 
government out of the picture.
<P>

understood the situation, they would agree with us because the

	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Madam Speaker, I am not sure 
what the question was. I do not even think it was a question. I 
think it was a very eloquent statement from a very eloquent 
member.
<P>
	Nowhere did I say the government should offer more services. 
That is not a reality and I did not suggest that for a moment. 
What I am saying and what I said in my remarks is that we have 
to get less government. We have to get government out of our 
lives. There is too much government, and we have to reduce that 
level. However, we do have to provide services, and we can 
provide services by getting the services provided by the 
government that is closest to the people. There are many areas 
where that means transferring it to the provincial governments. 
We do 
<P>

<B><A NAME="13120"> 13120 </A></B>
<P>
not have a problem with that. We  have to deliver these services 
in the most cost efficient way possible.
<P>
	The member was suggesting that people in Quebec might be 
prepared to pay more taxes. I would like to see a poll on that. I do 
not think they are prepared to pay any more taxes. I think they 
feel the same way as the people in Ontario: They are taxed to 
death and they are looking for some relief by the government 
cutting its spending. That is the answer to creating the jobs the 
member needs in Quebec, just as we need them in Ontario.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> That is a lively little exchange we have going. I 
think it is almost two o'clock.

Order 30(5), the House will now move on to members'

<P>
	Some 30 students from Como Lake Junior Secondary in 
British Columbia and from l'école Saint-François-Xavier in 
Quebec have been participating in a praiseworthy cultural

Columbia,

the French culture and language.

laudable efforts of the Canadian and Quebec mining industry to 
be more environmentally conscious.
<P>
	The Canadian mining industry is the first mining association 
in the world to develop an environmental policy for all of its 
members. Under this initiative, dubbed ARET, Accelerated 
Reduction/Elimination of Toxics, the largest mining companies 
have committed themselves to reducing the most offensive 
emissions by 71 per cent by the year 2000.
<P>
	We can only welcome any measure which aims to make the 
sustainable development of natural resources more 
environmentally friendly.

is a big step in the right direction. Our congratulations.

Speaker, with next week being Canadian Environment Week, I 
want to point out the many improvements that have taken place 
in our natural resource industries, especially forestry, to protect 
the environment.
<P>
	As someone who has earned a living as a logger and a 
prospector, I know that most people work in the bush because 
they love it. I know that forest industry employees want to 
ensure that jobs in the bush remain available for their 
communities, their children and their grandchildren. They want 
to be able to continue hunting, fishing, hiking and camping on 
public lands. They want their communities' watersheds also to 
be protected.
<P>
	Science and technology are helping us to gain a better 
understanding of how these activities affect one another. I 
believe it is only through a national commitment to sustainable 
development of our natural resources that our Canadian 
standard of living, widely recognized as the best in the world, 
will be maintained, including the environment.

	<B>Mr. Ian Murray (Lanark-Carleton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Minister of the Environment recently announced the release 
of the first summary report on the 1993 national pollutant 
release inventory. Over 1,400 companies across Canada 
reported their releases and transfers of 178 specified pollutants 
as required under the Environmental Protection Act.
<P>
	The most significant feature of this inventory is that it is 
completely accessible to the Canadian public. For the first time 
in history, Canadians can find out directly from a full database 
of information about the pollutants being released in their 
neighbourhoods and communities or across the country. 
Canadians can access the information on this inventory through 
Internet either on their personal computers or they can use those 
available to them at libraries, schools and universities.
<P>
	This important initiative will support the government's 
commitment to encourage pollution prevention by making both 
the public and industry aware of the quantities of pollutants 
being released all around us.

	Gun control is one measure to help address the issue of

almost half of domestic homicides, guns are the weapons of 
choice for men who kill their spouses.

guns used are not smuggled or illegally owned. The registration

order to obtain these potentially dangerous weapons and to

Canadian soldiers volunteer to replace their colleagues who 
have been taken hostage so they can take turns.
<P>
	Notwithstanding the noble proposition of our Canadian 
peacekeepers, could the government tell us whether these 
exchanges will be restricted to hostages who are ill, because 
otherwise, it would be tantamount to agreeing that the Serbs 
have the right to take hostages?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, obviously, the soldiers who are there and who know 
their colleagues are being held a few kilometres away from the 
base are trying to find a way to put an end to this situation. They 
are trying to find a way to end the deadlock. Last year, the 
situation went on for a few weeks, and the local commanding 
officer managed to find a solution that was acceptable to all 
parties.
<P>
	For the time being, I would rather let the local authorities 
decide on the best way to obtain the release of the hostages or at 
least provide for maximum security, under the circumstances.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I must say we are far removed from the days when 
Lester B. Pearson was a household word in international 
relations.
<P>
	Are we to understand that Canada has no clearcut policy on 
redefining the mandate of the peacekeepers in Bosnia because it 
no longer has any influence and has ceased to show leadership 
among peacekeeping forces on the international scene, now that 
it is not even a member of the contact group and has been 
relegated to the role of a bit player, merely following the cues 
given by other countries?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

Secretary-General of the United Nations is exactly the one we 
proposed to him over the weekend. I personally had a discussion 
with him on Sunday morning.
<P>
	We are using all the channels available to us. In that case it is 
evident that the position of Canada was integral to reaching a 
conclusion. It is not one that is supported by all participants. We 
are in constant contact with the United Nations.
<P>
	I have to say that the Secretary-General of the United Nations 
recognizes that of all the forces available anywhere in the world, 
when Canadians are there he can always rely on them because 
they are the best. He is listening to Canadians as he has done in 
that case.

by 0.7 per cent in March.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	It would appear that the economic slow-down is due to a

slow-down, when its present policy flies in the face of its 
election promises regarding job creation, and when there has 
been no net job creation during the past five months?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

at these statistics, it is obvious that something happened which 
hurt the economy. We had a two-week long transportation strike 
which caused the economy to slow down.

	At that time, we told the Bloc Quebecois that by refusing to 
pass the government bill, it was causing an economic 
slow-down. Today, the economy is paying for the Bloc's 
irresponsibility.

the Douglas Lake ranch and the RCMP is worried that someone 
will get seriously hurt or killed.
<P>
	The blockade is just the tip of the iceberg. What we do not 
want are three or four Okas in B.C. this summer, yet the Minister

this and other similar situations.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern

question.
<P>
	As far as jurisdiction is concerned, this demonstration is 
clearly off reserve and is not within federal jurisdiction. I 
checked and the Upper Nicola Band does not have a specific 
claim which would put us in the picture. It is not a part of the 
B.C. treaty process. On these three grounds it is clearly 
provincial. However, if requested by the province, we are 
prepared to go in and do whatever we can to facilitate.
<P>
	I am encouraged by several things. First, several significant 
aboriginal leaders have volunteered to help. The hon. member of 
the Reform Party in whose riding this is has talked to my 
executive assistant. He has offered some help. I am prepared to 
delegate someone if Mr. Cashore asks for help.
<P>
	The other encouraging thing although the situation could get 
volatile is that Joe Gardner, manager of the Douglas Lake cattle 
ranch, the person who is most involved, has told the various 
ranchers to sit still. He has insisted that the dispute be resolved 
peacefully and we agree with his position. Hopefully we can get 
it resolved.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr.

unreasonable expectations on the part of the aboriginal people. 
In Quebec, the Band Council of Kahnawake, with the help of 
Frank Vieni, one of those in charge of Indian Affairs during the 
Oka crisis, has presented to the Department of Indian Affairs a 
land claim asking for millions and even billions of dollars. The 
co-ordinator of the project for the department, Kate Fawkes, 
said that the document contains some real breakthroughs.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>

	Is it the policy of the department to encourage claims of such a

meet those expectations?

	We are trying to do the reasonable thing. We are trying to do

<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr.

aboriginal peoples and governments it has been inflated 
expectations and broken promises.
<P>
	The current minister appears to be going down the same road 
as his predecessors. The Liberal red book promises on land 
claims and self-government raise aboriginal expectations sky 
high, and then the government simply cannot deliver.
<P>
	Would the minister not agree it would be better to make one or 
two simple commitments to aboriginals that he could keep 
rather than make inflated promises to 600 aboriginal bands that 
he is simply unable to keep at the end of the day?

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	A report from Statistics Canada shows a new decrease in the 
number of unemployed people covered by unemployment 
insurance. In 1990, seventy-seven per cent of the unemployed 
were covered by unemployment insurance, whereas in March of 
this year the proportion was down to 49.7 per cent. This shows 
how much the reform introduced by the government in its 
February 1994 Budget is hitting the unemployed.
<P>
	Considering that the unemployment insurance plan is helping 
only half the unemployed, does the Prime Minister not realize 
that his reform is increasing the poverty problem in Quebec and 
Canada and that he must rescind the cruel decisions taken in 
February 1994?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her question. It raises the 
very important issue of unemployment in Canada, which the 
government takes quite seriously. It is for this reason that 
through various programs initiated by the government over 
460,000 new full time jobs have been created in Canada.
<P>
	I also bring to the attention of the hon. member that reading 
the report would make it very clear to her that the reason there 
are fewer people on unemployment is job creation.
<P>
	In Quebec over 110,000 full time jobs have been created. Also 
in the province of Quebec over 86,000 people did not exhaust 
their UI benefits prior to gaining new employment. That to me is 
positive change for the people of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is 
very hard to swallow since there has not been any net job 
creation for the last five months, since the new report on social 
assistance shows that there has been a further increase despite 
the fact that we are supposed to be in a period of prosperity, 
since irate unemployed are confronting members everywhere.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Since, to this day, the 
Unemployment Insurance Fund has a surplus of $4 billion, due 
to the cuts and the 15 per cent reduction in the money distributed 
despite an increase in applications, does the Prime Minister not 
find it indecent that his Cabinet is studying a plan to cut 
unemployment insurance by a further $700 million next year?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to

	The fact is that because of the changes we have made to UI, 
over 280,000 low income families in this country are benefiting 
through a differential benefit rate of 60 per cent.

appearance of patronage, saying: ``I am not concerned. I think 
merit is the primary consideration for an appointment''.

to the revenue minister's election campaign might have been the 
real consideration?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, it would seem to me that the 
question does not deal with the administrative responsibility of

responsibility of a minister of the government.

	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, I can redefine it this way. In 
making appointments of law firms to work for the justice 
department, my understanding is that the justice minister would 
go to the minister or some Liberal in that area.

Quebec air transport associations have warned the minister

McKinsey firm from the U.S., and the Canadian Conference of 
the Arts. Even before these studies are completed, the CBC is 
already cutting staff, in particular at its library in Montreal.
<P>
	Does the minister not agree that these cuts are premature, 
since officially he should wait for at least two of these reports 
before making a decision on the CBC's future, and that a 
moratorium should therefore be imposed on the proposed cuts?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the CBC's financial situation results from a 
series of budgets that go back a number of years. It is quite 
normal for the CBC's president and managers to make 
adjustments in line with budget needs.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, does 
the minister agree that the alacrity with which the CBC's senior 
officials are cutting services without knowing what the 
committees' findings will be suggests that we can expect more 
drastic cuts in the coming years?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I have full confidence in the CBC 
president's ability to manage his affairs. What I find surprising 
is that our friends from the Bloc Quebecois do not seem 
interested in the fate of Radio-Québec, which is being cut to 
pieces.

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, regarding allegations of illegal dumping by the 
Canadian Wheat Board we now have confirmation from the 
RCMP in both Winnipeg and Ottawa that no one from the 
solicitor general's office ever asked it to review these 
allegations.
<P>
	Why did the solicitor general write to the member for 
Lisgar-Marquette on March 28, 1995, saying the RCMP had 
been asked to investigate this matter?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think my hon. friend is misinterpreting my letter.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13130"> 13130 </A></B>
<P>
	My office took the material given to it by the member's 
colleague. According to our practice it was transmitted to the 
RCMP for such action as it considered appropriate.
<P>
	It has not been my practice or custom to give direction to the 
RCMP on matters of investigation. Information was provided to 
me by the commissioner of the RCMP who reviewed the matter 
and decided that on the basis of that material there were not 
grounds for a criminal investigation. That information was put 
in my letter to the hon. member's colleague.
<P>
	The whole thing is quite consistent with what I said in my 
letter. I regret my hon. friend keeps pursuing the matter in spite 
of the totally inappropriate conduct of his colleague. Instead of 
pursuing the matter he should get his colleague to apologize.
<P>
<B>(1450 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the RCMP has reported the matter was not even 
brought to its attention. The RCMP did not even receive a file on 
the matter from the solicitor general and was not even notified 
of the incident.
<P>
	How can the solicitor general tell the House he pursued the 
matter when the RCMP was not notified that it should look into 
it to see whether it was worthy of an investigation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the RCMP will provide further information about the 
way it dealt with the matter.
<P>
	I put on record an accurate quote from my letter of March 28: 
``The commissioner of the RCMP has informed me that the 
commercial crime section in Winnipeg has reviewed your'', the 
hon. member for Lisgar-Marquette, ``allegations and the 
RCMP has concluded there is no basis to support an 
investigation into the Canadian Wheat Board. However, the 
commissioner has informed me that the RCMP is willing to 
examine any new information you might have to support these 
allegations''.
<P>
	I transmitted to the hon. member information provided me by 
the RCMP and I think if the hon. member and his colleagues had 
any respect for Parliament they would apologize for the 
unwarranted accusation.
<P>
	If they will not apologize and withdraw their unwarranted 
accusations, everything they say about their respect for

of dioxins, furans and hexachlorobenzenes emitted through the 
incineration of medical waste, sewage sludge and cement kilns 
burning hazardous waste.

	Does the government have plans to regulate carcinogenic 
emissions from incinerators and are federal guidelines for 
human exposure to dioxins adequate to protect human health 
and ecosystems?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

Health Canada on the acceptable level of dioxins and furans for 
human exposure are under review.
<P>
	We are extremely concerned about activities south of the 
border which could put the health of Canadians at risk. In 
Canada we already have an acceptable smog level about 30 per 
cent lower than the level in the United States, but at the same 
time the Americans are looking at raising their smog level.

<P>
	In answer to a question in this House, the Deputy Prime 
Minister said that this government could not be held responsible 
for the iniquity of previous governments regarding R&amp;D. Yet, 
since October 1993 the minister of Natural Resources has 
granted less than ten per cent of external R&amp;D contracts to firms

<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Quebec is already being robbed of $650 million a 
year in expenditures by the Department of Defence. The 
Department of Justice awards only one per cent of its external 
contracts to Quebec, and now the Department of Natural 
Resources refuses to give Quebec its fair share of R&amp;D 
contracts. Can the minister explain why Quebec is once more 
being robbed of its fair share?

my question is for the President of the Treasury Board.
<P>
	I quote from two different red books. The first red book states 
the Liberals will implement changes to strengthen the 
Employment Equity Act. The second red book states the 
Employment Equity Act is widely regarded as adversarial, 
bureaucratic and expensive to administer.

which quote is from his red book and which one is from the 
Ontario provincial Liberal red book. I wonder in which direction 
the government is heading.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board

Speaker, we are both heading in the same direction in terms of 
support for employment equity. We quite clearly support 
employment equity in the government. It is part of our priority 
and we will continue to implement it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will leave it to the electorate to determine if they are heading in 
the same direction.
<P>
	The red books do not agree which shows provincial and the 
federal Liberals are divided on this issue. Provincial Liberals 
want to reduce employment equity while federal Liberals want 
to make it stronger.

with the provincial Liberal leader's policy on employment 
equity?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board

Speaker, what is to the point is this government's policy on 
employment equity.

<P>
	My colleague from Regina-Lumsden has continually in the 
House asked the minister to take action on the pricing of 
gasoline. No action has been taken and yet over the past few 
days we have seen the price of gasoline go up again by as much 
as four cents a litre with no apparent economic justification. 
These new increases could cost the Canadian taxpayer up to a 
billion dollars.
<P>
	In light of these new increases would the Minister of Industry 
now take action to protect consumers and immediately call an 
inquiry into price fixing at Canadian gas stations?

	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as the hon. member knows, there has been a series of 
investigations by the director of investigations and research 
under the Competition Act with respect to this issue. 
Prosecutions have been launched. Some have been before the 
courts. As she knows, it is my belief that competition is the best 
way to control prices.

tough and effective enforcement of our competition laws, and

<P>
	When the minister spoke to constituents in my riding of Parry 
Sound-Muskoka last summer he assured them a boating 
infraction ticketing procedure would be in place by June of this 
year to protect boaters on waterways in my riding and across the 
country.
<P>
	What plan does the minister have to effectively enforce 
boating regulations on Canadian waterways this summer?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I well remember the 
delightful day I spent in the hon. member's riding last June. I 
remember the very pleasant meeting I had with the Muskoka 
Lakes Boating Association. I also recall that we discussed the 
Contraventions Act which is a statute passed in October 1992 by 
Parliament but not yet proclaimed in force.
<P>
	The idea behind the Contraventions Act is to permit the 
enforcement of federal statutes by a ticketing scheme 
administered by officials at all levels of government.
<P>
	We had hoped that statute would be proclaimed in force this 
month but through discussions with the provinces we have found 
that changes to the statute will be necessary in order for us to 
take advantage of the provincial contraventions procedures and 
save the taxpayers money. Therefore it will not come into force 
this June.
<P>
	I can say that officials of the federal Department of Transport 
are in discussions with provincial authorities to see that there is 
effective supervision and enforcement on lakes this summer so 
safety of boaters is assured in the meantime.

	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my error. I rise on a point of 
privilege.

	Never before have the rights of members been so blatantly

directly to the administration of government concerning the 
awarding of legal contracts for acting crown prosecutors. While 
I accept the fact that the allegations of patronage in the

<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I hope the hon. member for 
Kootenay East will weigh very carefully the words he is using. I 
believe from the words he has used the hon. member is 
questioning a decision taken by the Speaker of the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	When the hon. member uses such words it calls into question 
not only the decision of the Speaker but also all of the House 
itself, as embodied in me are the rights and privileges of all 
members of this House.
<P>
	That the hon. member is frustrated because his question was 
ruled out of order is to me understandable. The House has 
empowered me to make rulings such as these. The rulings I make 
are never taken frivolously and never taken to give advantage to 
one side or the other. My sole duty here is to see that the rights 
and privileges of all parliamentarians are adhered to and 
respected. That is what I try to do in this chair.

	When the hon. member stood for his first question, I judged in 
that particular case he was referring to party matters. I permitted 
the hon. member to rephrase his question, which he did. In my 
judgment the question of the hon. member was in order and 
therefore I permitted it.
<P>
	When the hon. member used words in the second question 
which I thought were leading down the same path as the first, I 
intervened.
<P>
	I appeal to the hon. member who is standing on this point of 
privilege to please take into consideration the great weight that 
his words have in here. If the judgment of the Speaker is to be 
called into question, surely it is not because he is not 
being-excuse me if I do not use the right word 
here-responsible. But if the hon. member would like to speak 
with me in my chambers, I would be very happy to speak with 
him.
<P>
	My judgment on that particular question stands. I would 
appeal to all hon. members to cease and desist now on this point 
of privilege because you are attacking your Speaker. In my view, 
I do not know that we can long operate like this.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin Cauchon (Outremont, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
must say it is with mixed feelings that I rise today in the House 
to discuss a motion tabled by the official opposition member for 
Richmond-Wolfe.
<P>
	By mixed feelings, I mean that, looking at the motion and the 
four bills mentioned therein, I sincerely do not understand a 
thing. The four bills that, according to the official opposition, 
are extremely centralizing are in fact and without a doubt 
excessively decentralizing.
<P>
	I have mixed feelings because, as I have said before in this 
House, I believe that the official opposition can do a good job if 
it acts in good faith and stands up for its constituents' interests. 
Once again, I must admit these people are unable to rise above 
strictly partisan interests. The motion under consideration is 
another astonishing example of this fact.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	I have mixed feelings because, on the other hand, I have the 
opportunity to rise in this House and express myself on what is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13134"> 13134 </A></B>
<P>
Canadian federalism, what it has been for years, and what it will 
be in the future with our government. But before I go on, let me 
say that the Bloc Quebecois does not seem to be following a 
program of its own but, rather, a program dictated by the Quebec 
National Assembly.
<P>
	Take, for example, the motion tabled three or four weeks ago 
to support the claims made by the Quebec Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs. That motion was essentially related 
to three claims submitted to the federal government by the 
Quebec government. There again, I had the opportunity to 
participate in the debate on the motion and show this House to 
what extent Bloc members are biased and do not want the federal 
system to work.
<P>
	But I digress. On the one hand, you have the extremist 
doctrine of the Bloc Quebecois, which says that, if you look at 
the evolution of the federal system since 1960, you will see that 
we are headed for an extremely centralizing system which will 
soon leave very little power, if any, to the provinces. Yet, since 
our Liberal government came to office, there have been striking 
examples showing that federalism can evolve in such a way that 
the wishes of all the governments involved, both federal and 
provincial ones, can be respected.
<P>
	Our federal system compares favourably with other 
federations in the world. For example, consumer spending by 
the provincial administrations is 3.5 times higher than for the 
federal government. That says a lot about whether we are a 
centralized or a decentralized federation. It indicates that the 
Canadian federation is in fact more decentralized than that of 
many other countries, including Switzerland, Germany, 
Australia and the United States.
<P>
	As regards the fact that the Canadian federation is a model of 
decentralization, allow me to quote a statement made in 1977, at 
the University of Edinburgh, by a famous person. That person 
agrees with me and this government, since he clearly said that 
the Canadian federation is decentralized. The comment, made in 
English, was as follows:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And because rather often in Canada we tend to talk of the abusive centralized 
powers of Ottawa we tend to forget that in reality Canada is highly 
decentralized.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That was reported in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> of May 9, 1977, and 
the words came from none other than Quebec's Premier, Jacques 
Parizeau, who maintained that Canada was a model of 
decentralization. There you have an excellent example of double 
standards. You have an example that shows clearly that these 
people can say one thing abroad, and quite another when 
addressing Quebecers, when they are concerned about their own 
interests and their own objectives.
<P>
	Besides, one only has to think of Mr. Parizeau's speech to the 
permanent council of French-speaking countries, on his last 
visit to Paris. When you listen to that speech, and consider Mr. 
Parizeau's comparisons of Quebec, you are not proud to be a 
Quebecer. Quebecers are greater than that, they are energetic, 
they can take their place in Canada, and they will take their place 
internationally. Mr. Parizeau's speech on the international scene 
does not  reflect this energy. As a Quebecer, I am upset by such 
speeches.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	You know that members opposite talk about centralizing 
federalism. At the beginning of my speech, I said I would have 
the opportunity to review a number of issues which clearly show 
that our federation is an extremely decentralized federation. 
Take for instance the immigration issue. The immigration 
agreement is a striking example of good co-operation between 
Quebec and Ottawa, where the province of Quebec was given 
more power to select immigrants.
<P>
	Some argue that it does not work, but I could give you other 
examples, including the status of some provinces among French 
speaking countries. Did the province of Quebec or did New 
Brunswick belong at the Francophonie table? No. The federal 
government reached an agreement with both provinces so that 
these provincial governments would be considered guests 
among the French speaking countries and be able to fully take 
part in the events. This is another remarkable example of a 
flexible federation, but mostly of a respectful one.
<P>
	The members opposite are turning a deaf ear, saying that it 
does not work. Let me give you some more examples. Direct 
collection of the GST is another good example of 
federal-provincial co-operation, which has an extremely 
positive impact on the population and makes the collection of 
that tax easier. This is another striking example of 
decentralization.
<P>
	Members opposite refuse to hear anything positive and 
simply say that federation is not working. However, we could 
give them many more examples which would all indicate that 
our federation is flexible. They do not want to understand 
anything, so let us give them more examples. The St. Lawrence 
2000 Agreement was signed with the province of Quebec. My 
colleagues opposite are leaving the House or making fun of what 
I say, mostly because the truth hurts. When you give them 
examples, they refuse to listen and leave the House. The St. 
Lawrence 2000 Agreement is an outstanding example of 
co-operation between Quebec and Ottawa. This extremely 
positive agreement was signed so that the St. Lawrence could 
get cleaned up. It is an agreement that eliminates overlap and 
that is beneficial to the people of Canada.
<P>
	And that is not all. Some will say that is not enough. The 
Canada-Quebec Infrastructure Program. Is there another 
example of a program that has been implemented in record time 
like this one has? It took only four or five months to put this 
program in place. This program, involving the three levels of 
govern-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13135"> 13135 </A></B>
<P>
ment, municipal, provincial and federal, is aimed at setting in 
motion incredibly vast projects that have direct repercussions 
on the people and that serve the interests of the people.
<P>
	Some will say that that is not all good and there is no 
decentralization of powers within the federation. Let us look at 
another example, the Communications Québec agreement, 
which allows the use of Communications Québec displays to 
advertise products available from various federal departments. 
This agreement exists, it has been signed, it works well and its 
ultimate goal is efficiency. We still have a window on the street 
but we can save some money.
<P>
	Some will say that it is not good enough. That they are not 
impressed. They will say, to try and mislead Quebecers, that the 
system does not work despite all this.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	There are many more examples. Let us take the Canada social 
transfer. This is a remarkable example where the official 
opposition has simply done an about-turn.
<P>
	Members will remember that, before the budget was tabled, 
we were told that all programs were centralized in Ottawa, that 
Ottawa was controlling funds for post-secondary education, 
health and social programs and that there should be a global 
social transfer. That is what we were told before the budget.
<P>
	Now to Mr. Martin's budget. We are giving the Canadian 
public-not just Quebec, but all of the provinces because they 
all requested it-the Canada social transfer, as a means of 
making the federation progress, as a means of showing that the 
system is flexible, as a means of bringing the management of 
funds closer to the people and of ensuring that decisions 
regarding spending will be more sensitive to the needs of the 
people.
<P>
	Now that the Canada social transfer exists, now that it is 
reality, we are being told that that is not good, that the Minister 
of Human Resources Development will try to set national 
standards unilaterally. Just another example of the inability of 
the people across the way to rise above partisan interests and to 
seriously look at what the finance minister's budget really offers 
to Quebecers and Canadians.
<P>
	In fact, the Canada social transfer is a Canadian 
decentralization model. As part of this initiative, the Minister of 
Human Resources Development has invited all provinces to 
participate in discussions with the federal government regarding 
national standards which will apply coast to coast.
<P>
	Obviously, this bothers Bloc members. This bothers them 
because, if this continues, obviously the people of Quebec are 
going to realize, and they already do realize, that the Canadian 
federation is working well. This bothers them because if it 
works too well, like it is now, their pipedream of separating is 
simply going to vanish into thin air.
<P>
	There has been much talk about national standards. As you 
know, the people across the way decry national standards. I 
worked on the social program reform committee, and I must say 
that nobody in Canada, even Quebecers, is against national 
standards. However, what people are against is the federal 
government unilaterally setting those national standards.
<P>
	Times have changed. The federal government has said 
repeatedly: ``We want a flexible system. We want to work 
together with all the provinces and, because we are a country, to 
develop national standards that will respect the identities, 
wishes and needs of the provinces from coast to coast''.
<P>
	Another example of decentralization is the Human Resources 
Investment Fund that will come into force in April 1996. It is a 
good example of how we respect the wishes and the will of the 
people. There was a reference to manpower issues and to the 
need for decentralizing manpower services. There are two 
schools of thought. There is the position taken by the Parti 
Quebecois in Quebec City and the position taken by the public, 
which is the one we have chosen.
<P>
	The Parti Quebecois takes the position that everything related 
to manpower development and manpower training should be 
theirs alone because they are the experts and know best what is 
needed. On the other side we have the public that wants to see a 
partnership between various levels of government that will have 
access to flexible funding, as opposed to rigid programs, 
funding that organizations at the local level will be able to 
manage according to genuine need.
<P>
	I need hardly add that the course of action chosen by this 
government is clearcut, straightforward and non-partisan.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	I am happy to say that this is the route the people wanted us to 
take. This is what the human resources investment fund is about. 
It will ensure that local agencies will be able to manage very 
flexible funds according to the real needs of the community.
<P>
	There is another thing. Those opposite criticize us from time 
to time for intervening in regional economic development. We 
intervene, because people ask us to. People ask us to intervene 
as the federal government and also as a partner.
<P>
	Am I to understand that what members opposite want is for 
the federal government to withdraw essentially from its regional 
development function? Does this mean that all the money 
invested in people to strengthen our economic fibre should be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13136"> 13136 </A></B>
<P>
withdrawn? They will have the task of explaining locally why 
they want the federal government out of regional development 
when we have very recent and particularly eloquent examples of 
efficiency and of funds invested, once again, in business, in the 
economy and, ultimately, in the people.
<P>
	Recently, we announced the CESAM project in Montreal. It is 
a remarkable project, another partnership with the province and 
private enterprise. It brings together people from the same 
sector to exchange information and knowledge thus making 
Quebec businesses competitive not only provincially, not only 
nationally but internationally. This is what today's Quebec is all 
about. This is the sort of positive talk the people of Quebec want 
to hear, talk that is in their interest and that will make them 
stronger and more viable economically.
<P>
	There are other remarkable examples proving that we are 
headed in the right direction. What about Team Canada, headed 
by the Prime Minister, which also brought back $11.3 billion in 
contracts. In conclusion, noteworthy examples demonstrating 
that, if we work together to ensure Quebec felt its interests were 
well protected both at the National Assembly and in Ottawa, we 
could build a strong Quebec and a strong country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member 
for Outremont was speaking about the great Quebec dream. I 
think he dreams that one day Canada will be good for us, but this 
is an illusion. If he would just look at the results, the 
consequences of the Canadian federation, maybe he would have 
the answer to his dreams.
<P>
	I always look at the results first and, in our case, the result is 
that Canada now has an accumulated debt of $600 billion and 
that it cannot even balance its budget. That is the result, the 
consequence of federalism. We should stop talking about nice 
agreements between Canada and Quebec, we should stop saying 
that everything is fine and dandy. We cannot even balance the 
budget and the Canadian federation has turned into a fiasco over 
a short period of time.
<P>
	It is urgent that we put our house in order. As Mr. Lévesque 
once said so well: ``Canada is like having two scorpions in a 
bottle; they try to kill each other, they both want to prove that 
they are distinct and different, they both want to spread out, but 
they are stuck in the same bottle. One day they will both die''. 
This is what is happening now. We are on the edge of the abyss, 
we are both dying.
<P>
	Because there are two nations in this country, it is urgent that 
each one become a country and that we give ourselves a chance 
to thrive. That is the reality. That is the mandate Quebecers gave 
us. They sent us here to Ottawa for that purpose. They told us: 
``Go to Ottawa to promote sovereignty; it is essential and urgent 
for Quebec because we are now in death throes financially.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	We hear nice stories about common projects, a million here, a 
million there, a dozen million elsewhere, and we try to make 
Quebecers believe that federalism is a way of life and that 
without it Quebecers could not survive.
<P>
	In duplications alone, this system costs $2 to $3 billion. We 
are told that the administration cost of the GST, for individuals 
and businesses, is in the order of $2 to $3 billion. We did not 
need that. All the government had to do was say: ``Administer 
the tax. Combine it with yours immediately. Hide it if you want, 
but administer it in a sensible way and we will return a certain 
percentage to you''. But that is not the way the federal 
government does it, it returns money to Quebec as if it were a 
gift.
<P>
	The federal government has always tried to do it this way, to 
make Quebecers believe that without the federal government 
they would, all of a sudden, become much poorer. This is not 
true. The government always forget to say that Quebec sends 
$29 billion, that is $29,000 million, to Ottawa, every year, and 
the federal government uses this money according to its own 
priorities and most of the time without due consideration to 
Quebec priorities. More often than not decisions are made 
unilaterally. The government does not care whether Quebec 
prospers or not, as we have seen when the government spent $2 
billion of Quebec's money to promote Hibernia, when 
everybody knows that it will never be viable. Yet, Quebecers 
will continue to pay.
<P>
	This was a nice dream, sure, but it is time to come back to 
reality. And the reality is that we are two peoples and that, if we 
want to move ahead, we must separate into two different 
countries.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cauchon: </B>Mr. Speaker, when I listen to the opposition 
member, I seriously wonder if we are really living in the same 
world and if, in the last year and a half, he has looked at the 
policies carried out by the present government.
<P>
	First of all, when people on the other side of the House tell us 
that Quebecers elected them to make Quebec's independence, I 
think that is playing down the issues of the last election. 
Quebecers told us, in the last election, that they expressed their 
discontent at the ballot box, and it simply happened that the vote 
went heavily to the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	Why discontent? There were years of Conservative 
government when an absolutely incredible debt and deficit were 
built up, and I point out that the hon. member who just spoke was 
part of that government and voted for all its legislation. 
Moreover, there were years that resulted in the people losing 
confidence in the government machinery, in the public servants.
<P>
	I think that, today, when we look at the polls in general and the 
work done by this government in the last few months, we can see 
clearly that the people of Canada and Quebec have regained this 
confidence, because we promised certain things during the last 
election campaign  and we delivered, because these promises, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13137"> 13137 </A></B>
<P>
the economy and job creation, were of interest and concern to 
the people. Last year, 430,000 jobs were created, and we are still 
creating more.
<P>
	So, essentially, in everything that my colleague has been 
saying about the debt and the fact that Quebec would simply go 
and beg for these things in Ottawa, we can see that it is the Bloc 
Quebecois that is trying to make sure Quebec is perceived that 
way. But that is totally untrue. Quebec has a large place in the 
Canadian federation. On the economic level, Quebec plays an 
extremely important role within the federation. And on this side 
of the House, we want to make sure that Quebec and the nine 
other provinces can first develop individually, but also within 
the Canadian federation and according to major international 
trends, that they can develop together and excel on the 
international scene. That is our goal and we will succeed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger): </B>Since there are only two 
minutes left, I will divide them between the question and the 
answer. I give the floor to the hon. member for Témiscamingue.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened carefully to the speech of our friend from Outremont, 
who loved to pass out cheques for the infrastructure program, of 
which he spoke with a certain wistfulness. He also referred to 
my colleague of Longueuil who is a former Conservative. I 
would remind him that the latter at least had the courage to cross 
the floor and change sides. I hope the hon. member will have as 
much courage when the time comes to make decisions in the 
interest of Quebec, which he is supposed to represent.
<P>
	My colleague said all sorts of things about decentralization. 
He chose a good example when he spoke of the Canada social 
transfer. Actually, it was the deficit that was decentralized. I 
hope he will rise in caucus to defend the interests of Quebec, 
because he should know that Quebec might have to bear more 
than 40 per cent of those cuts. I also hope, when he talks about 
the consensus in Quebec about manpower training, that he will 
be intelligent enough to look at what is really going on. The 
consensus is not only inside the Parti Quebecois. Ghislain 
Dufour is not, as far as I know, a member of the Parti Quebecois, 
and is not likely to become one in the near future. Yet, he was 
among those who said that manpower training should be the 
responsibility of the government of Quebec.
<P>
	What positive action he intends to take in the coming weeks 
within his own party to defend the interests of Quebec on those 
two issues?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cauchon:</B> Mr. Speaker, when they hear things that do not 
please them, the members of the Bloc Quebecois launch into 
personal attacks, saying such things as: ``I hope my colleague 
for Outremont will be intelligent enough-'' Obviously, what I 
said does not suit him,  because he is not hearing what he would 
like to hear from members on this side. He knows that what he is 
hearing from members on this side is also what the people want 
to hear.
<P>
	As for the Canada social transfer and the human resources 
investment fund, I was among the members of Quebec who 
stood for these issues in the national caucus, and for two 
reasons. First, we are an economically responsible government. 
As such, we had to rationalize the programs to propoerly 
manage the debt and the deficit. Second, we had to decentralize 
as well, because that was what people were asking for. I was 
among those who championed these two programs. I am proud 
of it, and proud of what the government did.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very happy to participate in this debate on the official 
opposition's motion denouncing the excessive centralization of 
powers by the federal government, which is preparing, without 
saying anything and without consultations, a new, centralized 
Canada by passing at least the four bills we mentioned.
<P>
	I will not repeat my colleagues' extremely important and 
interesting explanations on Bill C-88, Bill C-91 and Bill C-46. 
I, however, have a lot to say about the bill to implement the 
budget. But first, I would like to talk about unemployment and 
poverty in Quebec.
<P>
	I want to explain why the sovereignists here in Ottawa and in 
Quebec want to achieve sovereignty, after all the years of 
repeatedly trying to convince others that Quebec needs more 
than crumbs and federal commissions. Because we are a people 
and a nation, we need control over Quebec's economic and 
social development. Let us talk about poverty. This year, 
Quebec won the award for poverty.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	In its report released this year, the Family and Social Affairs 
Council showed that, in 1993, Quebec came first among poor 
provinces for the number and percentage of people and families 
living below the poverty line.
<P>
	Last month, 803,900 people-372,000 households-were on 
welfare in Quebec. This figure includes people who are willing 
to work and a large number of children we are concerned about, 
because children raised with the bare minimum often lack what 
they need in life to develop normally.
<P>
	Poverty has many causes but that is not what we hear because 
of the strong prejudices against poor people, who are already 
facing great difficulties. In summary, poverty is not only a lack 
of money but also a deep sense of failure, of insecurity, of 
vulnerability, of worthlessness. All additional failures, such as 
fruitless job searches, problems with the spouse or children, and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13138"> 13138 </A></B>
<P>
difficulties in finding suitable housing or in meeting nutritional 
needs, further marginalize the poor.
<P>
	Losing a job often leads to poverty. By making drastic cuts to 
UI, the government has reduced the number of recipients, not 
because there are fewer unemployed workers, but because a 
smaller number of them are eligible for benefits.
<P>
	In Canada, only 49 per cent of the unemployed qualified for 
UI benefits last month, as compared to 77 percent in 1990. As far 
as unemployment is concerned, the rate is 14.4 per cent in 
Quebec and it is seasonally adjusted, while the rate of 
unemployment in Ontario is 8.7 per cent. That is almost three 
percentage points lower.
<P>
	To compare Quebec to Ontario or the rest of Canada, we must 
consider not only the number of persons who are unemployed, 
but more appropriately the number of persons who are 
employed; this is called the employment population ratio. It is 
quite simple. If 65 per cent of the population 15 and older has a 
job, therefore producing wealth, spending money on clothes and 
putting some in the bank, much more wealth will be produced 
than if 50 per cent of the same population was employed.
<P>
	When you look at the difference between employment and 
population, you notice differences much greater and more 
alarming than those for unemployment. For example, the 
employment population ratio for Ontario is 59 per cent, as 
compared to 53.8 per cent in Quebec. This means that, quite 
apart from the unemployment rate, thousands of jobs would be 
required just for Quebec to match the level of employment in 
Ontario.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	That is not all. What is absolutely tragic is that, if you 
compare Quebec to the rest of Canada, if you compile statistics 
on all of Canada minus Quebec, what do you find? You find that 
the overall employment population ratio for Canada is 59 per 
cent, while in Quebec, as I indicated earlier, it is only 53.8 per 
cent. This is a very substantial gap.
<P>
	It is important to remind you why we are angry in Quebec, and 
I am not referring only to our anger but to the anger we can feel 
brewing in many people, ordinary citizens who are unable to 
find work, who are given funny looks by UI or welfare officers 
because they always take them for defrauders at first, and the 
anger of community groups striving to help those in need, and 
seeing their resources cut time and time again while the need for 
assistance continues to grow.
<P>
	You may wonder what this has to do with the motion. The 
connection between the two is extremely important because, 
after a long process- of which I will relate the details, time 
permitting-we came to the conclusion that our only chance to 
make it was to take control of all the levers, to pass all our 
legislation, to collect all our taxes, and to sign all our treaties, 
including treaties with the rest of Canada.
<P>
	Let me read you a text which I recently came upon. It was 
written by René Lévesque, then a federalist Liberal minister 
responsible for family and welfare issues, at a conference on 
poverty held in Ottawa, on December 10, 1965.
<P>
	Mr. Lévesque said: ``It is absolutely essential, to use a 
redundancy, that the government primarily responsible for 
developing and implementing these measures on our territory be 
the Quebec government. This is the only way to ensure efficient 
action. It is also the only way to implement a co-ordinated 
policy for economic and social development which will truly put 
the accent on the individual''.
<P>
	We could use those same words today to explain our program.
<P>
	Mr. Lévesque added: ``We do not feel it necessary to prove 
that our government is closer to its population than Ottawa is. 
Our government is by far in the best position to adapt the 
possible solutions to the needs of its citizens. It is so because our 
government has the immediate data on land development, and 
also because it can monitor the implementation of its selected 
policies and make necessary changes without having to wait for 
federal-provincial conferences which take ages to organize or 
which are useless''.
<P>
	I might add that there has not been any federal-provincial 
conference on the vital issue of manpower since this 
government took office.
<P>
	Mr. Lévesque continued by saying: ``Moreover, our 
government can more easily enlist the co-operation of its 
citizens than the federal government could. This is important at 
a time when the issues of democratic planning and concerted 
action by citizens and their government take on a greater 
significance. Moreover, how could we possibly ensure the 
necessary co-operation in the socio-economic sector if, in 
addition to the usual problems related to co-ordinating the 
efforts of a large number of Quebec departments, we would also 
have to take into account similar initiatives and projects by the 
federal government? To raise the question is to answer it''.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	Those words were written by René Lévesque in 1965, when he 
was a Liberal minister, in his last days as a federalist.
<P>
	In those days, René Lévesque thought it was possible to have 
some kind of arrangement with Ottawa while keeping control in 
Quebec. We are a people. We are a nation. In our house-our 
economic and social development-we cannot have two 
architects, two teams of engineers working their own way, with 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13139"> 13139 </A></B>
<P>
separate budgets, and giving orders. That is what our motion is 
all about.
<P>
	The federal government is making the plan of our house, with 
our money and without consulting us, when we already have a 
plan in Quebec. We do not have all the money we need, because 
part of it was coming to us from transfers originating in our own 
pockets. In our confederation, the constitution gives the federal 
government the power to collect money to spend in areas that are 
outside its jurisdiction.
<P>
	So, the federal government uses our own money to draw the 
plan of our house without consulting us, while, on our side, we 
try as best we can, with whatever means left to us, to prevent the 
worst, in a situation where we have 803,000 welfare recipients 
and more than 327,000 unemployed, not to mention people who 
have given up, and the young who have no hope.
<P>
	It is hard to keep calm when we hear the federal government 
bragging that it brought its deficit under control. How dit it 
manage to do it? By transferring cuts instead of money to 
provinces, and more particularly Quebec. I stressed how, more 
than ever, Quebec's economy needs only one architect and only 
one team of engineers working under the control of that 
architect, in co-operation with others when information is 
needed. However, we just cannot continue with this madhouse 
being built at the people's expense, in spite of the 130 members 
elected by Quebecers out of a total of 200 at both levels of 
government.
<P>
	Quebecers elect, at both the federal and provincial levels, 200 
parliamentarians, 130 of whom are sovereignists. They are fed 
up with the central government using taxpayers' money to try to 
build a house they do not want, with blueprints they do not want, 
and for whose satisfaction? To satisfy those who, since 
confederation, think they are the only ones who know what kind 
of house should be built, and how.
<P>
	Now, we happen to be a nation. We are not only a distinct 
society, but a nation. We are a nation according to every existing 
international criterion, the main one being the collective will to 
live. This collective will to live is our main mandate to see to it 
that our house is built following our blueprints and, moreover, 
with our money.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	I want to read, if I may, a motion that I have just this instant 
received, and that has just been tabled in the National Assembly: 
``That the Quebec National Assembly call upon the federal 
government to review its Bill C-91, which will have the effect of 
sanctioning the federal government's interference and 
increasing duplication in regional development''.
<P>
	This comes just at the right moment in my speech. Yes, we 
will do our utmost to explain that to Quebecers, who have had 
about as much as they can take of the problems of everyday 
life-and we can understand that sometimes they do not know 
which way to turn. We will try to explain to them that it is 
absurd, with our limited resources, to have two teams of 
architects contradicting each other, whereas there is only one 
team they can  control democratically. The only one they can 
control democratically is the one they elect.
<P>
	Some could say: ``Oh! but why is it not Ottawa that looks after 
all of Canada's economy?'' We could have a group of 
economists who would disagree on many things, but who would 
agree on one thing, that is as culture goes, so goes the economy. 
The Japanese do not think like the French, the Germans or the 
Americans when it comes to the economy and money. What is 
working for Toyota in Japan is not necessarily working in 
Mississauga.
<P>
	The same is true for Boisbriand versus Mississauga. Why? 
Because culture has a profound influence on how we work, on 
how we create, on how we organize, on how we sell, on what we 
decide to work on. It is in the name of this culture, in a broad 
sense, and in the name of this nation that we are saying in this 
House, and I understand that it can be annoying, that the 
movement will not stop. As René Lévesque, who was to become 
the founder of the Parti Quebecois, said in 1965, once a 
movement has started, nothing can stop it.
<P>
	It would be better to start realizing that we will have to 
negotiate together, but let no one think that they are going to 
sneak one past us, that they are going to ignore us and create a 
Canada in which we will not feel perfectly at home, with our 
money and against our interests. I spoke mostly of Quebec, but I 
would like to conclude by saying that if the bills in question 
allow for a better development of Canada, I would say great, if 
that is what you want. I respect your culture and I respect the fact 
that that is how you want to develop, but for Quebec, and I am 
speaking in the name of the majority of members elected by 
Quebecers, it will not do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be brief. In her speech, the hon. member said that 
there was anger among Quebecers. She said that she felt that 
anger, and I agree with her, it is true that there is anger among 
Quebecers, but I would simply like to point out to the hon. 
member that that anger, and it does exist, comes from a great 
disappointment vis-à-vis the present Quebec government. The 
other way to govern of that government, which is a branch of the 
Bloc Quebecois, scares Quebecers.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	We even saw sovereignist central labour bodies question their 
allegiance to sovereignty. Just consider the cuts in health care, 
which is a provincial jurisdiction. So, yes, there is anger. Since 
you also talked about your plan, about the architects, I will ask 
you a very simple question: Since you have a plan-
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13140"> 13140 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, please. I simply 
want to remind my colleagues on both sides of the House that 
all comments must be made through the chair and not directly, 
from one side of the floor to the other.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patry:</B> Through you, Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask this 
of the hon. member: If you have architects, if you have a plan, 
why wait? I would like to know when the Quebec government 
will decide to call a referendum with a simple and clear 
question.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, you will understand that it is not 
up to me to answer that question and to say when the referendum 
will be held. It will be held when the Government of Quebec, 
which has the power to hold such a referendum under Quebec 
law, will decide to do so.
<P>
	However, I would like to respond to my hon. colleague who 
suggested that our anger comes from our disappointment in the 
present Parti Quebecois government. With all due respect, my 
colleague is mistaken. I want to tell him that we did not find 
ourselves with so many people on welfare and unemployed 
overnight and that the previous government, which was in office 
for nine years, had something to do with it.
<P>
	I want to remind the member that as soon as the previous 
government led by Robert Bourassa came into office, it asked 
the central government to negotiate so that Quebec could regain 
powers in five areas in order to rejoin the constitutional fold. It 
thought it was important not only from a cultural standpoint, but 
also for the economy.
<P>
	I want to remind the member that, for years, we had a 
federalist Liberal government, led by Mr. Bourassa, and a 
central government that wanted to help Quebec back into the 
Constitution because it had been imposed upon it even though 
that Constitution brought fundamental changes to the rules 
established at the time of Confederation in 1867. But Robert 
Bourassa saw the Meech Lake Accord fail because of whom? 
Because of the party that is now in office. We know, and it has 
been well documented in the newspapers and in many history 
books, that this party put pressure on some people, one of our 
honourable colleagues who shall remain nameless and the 
premier of Newfoundland, Clyde Wells, to get them to oppose 
this deal. And then the federalist Liberal Party of Quebec voted 
for the Allaire report, which left very few powers to the federal 
government.
<P>
	What did it do after that? There was the Bélanger-Campeau 
commission, and then it adopted a bill, Bill 150, saying that it 
would hold a referendum if it did not get satisfactory offers, 
which we know never came.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	Despite all that, a referendum was held and, as we all 
remember, the Charlottetown agreement was rejected in Quebec 
because it was not enough and in the rest of Canada because it 
was too much. Now we are being told  that the people are angry 
because of the unemployment and welfare situation, they are 
angry at all the levels of governments, and they are angry 
because they feel powerless, and I can certainly understand 
them, and all that anger is directed towards the new government.
<P>
	I had a better opinion of my Quebec colleague than that. 
Politics does not make you lose your analytical ability, your 
knowledge of history or your good sense. Yes, people are more 
and more angry, and my hon. colleagues should realize that our 
constituents want change. It is true that a large number of people 
are facing such problems that it does not make sense any longer.
<P>
	You only have to think about these women who are walking 
from Montreal to Quebec City-at first it was for bread and 
roses, but I am sure it is not rosy all the time-who are 
painstakingly making their way to Quebec City to show that 
poverty as they know it does not make sense. Their situation was 
documented, written about, told, but now they want concrete 
solutions. These women know full well that our scope of action 
is limited as long as the province of Quebec does not have all the 
powers it needs.
<P>
	Even within a sovereign Quebec, we will not be able to make 
all the needed changes instantly, but we know we will eliminate 
all the overlap and stop arguing, when we cannot even take the 
necessary measures to help the ordinary citizens. Ottawa will 
never do this for Quebec. So, everyone, including my hon. 
colleagues, will have to join us to build Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened carefully to the remarks made by the last speakers, 
particularly those made by the member for Longueuil who 
blamed the national debt on the Canadian federation. I also 
listened to the remarks made by the member for Mercier who, at 
the beginning of her speech, was going to blame the poverty 
level in the Montreal area on federalism, or I thought she would, 
but she stopped.
<P>
	Moreover, she tried to say that the high unemployment rate 
was again a consequence of the federal system. Strangely 
enough, she forgot to mention that, even with the Canada social 
transfer, Quebec benefits considerably from federalism through 
equalization.
<P>
	Many studies have clearly shown that Quebec has been able to 
grow within a federal system while benefiting enormously from 
such a system. She also forgot to mention that, through the 
unemployment insurance program, Quebec gets over $1 billion 
more.
<P>
	In this last allotted day that the official opposition has during 
this session, it has chosen once again to talk about four bills in 
order to try to show that federalism does not work, that the 
government wants to centralize powers. In her speech, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13141"> 13141 </A></B>
<P>
member for Mercier also said that the time has come for 
Quebecers to take complete control of their own destiny.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	However, I find it hard to keep a straight face when I hear 
these arguments, because in their draft bill, they want their 
dollar to be the Canadian dollar, they want their passport to be a 
Canadian passport. And throughout the debate on these issues, 
they want to determine the scope and subject of the referendum 
question. They had a debate, and they told us the question would 
include one on political and economic association with Canada. 
It seems to me they want what Canada has to offer. In that case, I 
challenge them to do the following. Instead of wasting the 10 or 
11 million dollars it cost to conduct these consultations-the 
hon. member for Mercier also mentioned the high poverty 
rate-I think this money would have been better spent on 
dealing with unemployment and poverty.
<P>
	So we have four bills that were mentioned together in an 
attempt to demonstrate that federalism, as they see it, has 
become centralist.
<P>
	I would like to discuss Bill C-76, which implements certain 
provisions of the budget tabled by the Minister of Finance. In 
referring to this bill, the opposition is very critical and says we 
want to centralize everything. In fact, the only condition set by 
the government for the Canada social transfer is the period of 
residence, which cannot disqualify a recipient from receiving 
social assistance.
<P>
	The other criterion, which already exists, is maintaining the 
five principles of health care. At the request of the Province of 
Quebec and the other provinces, the government decided to 
group these transfers. Again, at the request of the provinces, the 
government gave them a set target budget, guaranteed for a 
period of two years. And the members of the Bloc Quebecois 
complain that we want to centralize powers!
<P>
	I find it very hard to understand how the motion could 
possibly be about centralization, since in this bill and other bills, 
and also in our approach as a government, we have shown 
repeatedly that we want to decentralize powers, in two respects. 
The first one is to eliminate overlap and duplication. Not 
because it is the will of the Province of Quebec or of the Bloc. 
No. Because it is the will of all of Canada, all Canadians, 
because it will save us money. That is what we are doing.
<P>
	My presentation is about Bill C-91, the bill in relation to 
which the National Assembly just passed a motion, as the hon. 
member for Mercier just said. As I will explain, I find it hard to 
believe how the Bloc Quebecois can construe this bill as an 
effort on the part of the federal government to once again 
centralize powers.
<P>
	Canada and Quebec have entered a new phase of economic 
growth. The federal administration is sensitive to the 
globalization of markets and to the increased emphasis on 
competitiveness. We are redefining the federal government's 
approach to the economy.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	The most important part of this new approach is recognizing 
the dynamic role that small and medium size businesses play in 
job creation and the creation of wealth.
<P>
	This government has developed many approaches and 
reworked its strategy and its tools to take into consideration the 
key role that they play in our economic prosperity.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Bill C-91 gives the Federal Business Development Bank a 
new mandate. Under this new mandate the bank will be able to 
increase its activity in smaller loans and investments and focus 
more on knowledge based industries and exporters, two of the 
thriving forces in the global economy.
<P>
	A key element of the bank's new mandate is partnership. Bill 
C-91 makes it easier for the bank to work in close partnership 
with other partners. These new closer partnerships will help 
small and medium size businesses and will avoid inefficient and 
costly overlap and duplication, contrary to what the members of 
the Bloc Quebecois have said.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The opposition's reaction to Bill C-91 disappoints me. The 
opposition claims that the objectives of this bill are to usurp 
provincial powers, to build a centralized state and to take 
considerable powers away from Quebec.
<P>
	This opinion could only be based on a misinterpretation of 
clause 20 of this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Clause 20 says: ``The bank may enter into agreements with 
and act as agents for any department or agency of the 
Government of Canada or a province or any other body or person 
for the provision of services or programs to, on behalf of, or 
jointly with that body or person''. I do not know how the 
opposition member can misread that. It is quite clear. This is not 
in any way an intrusion by the federal government into 
provincial jurisdiction. Clause 20 of Bill C-91 facilitates 
co-operative joint ventures with partners from the private sector 
as well as the public sector.
<P>
	Clause 20 permits the bank to enter into agreements with 
other persons and organizations, including federal and 
provincial government departments and agencies. The 
authorization applies to the bank, not to the other parties 
involved. Let me repeat that again so members of the opposition 
understand. Clause 20 applies to the bank only. I think this is 
where they are having a hard time. It does not apply to the other 
parties at all. The other parties, whether they be government 
agencies or 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13142"> 13142 </A></B>
<P>
provincial boards, still have to obtain proper authorization from 
their jurisdictional authorities before entering into any 
agreement with the bank.
<P>
	In circumstances and situations in which a jurisdictional body 
must grant authorization for a partner to enter an agreement 
there will be no change.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Why is this change necessary? Because the wording of the 
previous legislation limited the bank's ability to conclude 
agreements with non commercial firms. In some cases, these 
organizations, some of which come under provincial 
jurisdiction, proposed to the bank itself that it help provide 
financial and management services.
<P>
	The bank could not do anything at the time, because it lacked 
the legislative authority to enable it to co-operate. A lot of time 
and effort went into obtaining this authority. Clause 20 will 
eliminate all the bureaucratic red tape and will make it possible 
to provide more effective services, which small business can 
use.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Clause 20 of Bill C-91 is very technical I will admit, but it 
allows the bank to enter into joint co-operative agreements. 
Clause 20 will allow partnerships, joint ventures and even the 
delivery of financial assistance on behalf of other agencies 
subject to the banks usual guidelines.
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	As an example of co-operation and collaboration, the Federal 
Business Development Bank and FORD-Q, the body 
responsible for regional development in Quebec, are currently 
developing a strategic partnership as part of a pilot project. The 
object is to create a special fund which will have a leverage 
effect in order to support projects undertaken by small and 
medium size enterprises in unexploited niches.
<P>
	In addition, the bank has developed strategic partnerships 
with agencies and departments of Quebec's provincial 
government. For example, the bank recently completed an 
agreement to develop a technology training and counselling 
program with le Ministère de l'Industrie, du Commerce et de la 
Technologie du Québec and the Professional Engineers 
Association of Quebec.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The bank, moreover, joined with the Société québécoise de la 
main-d'oeuvre to start up a program to promote and encourage 
women's initiatives in conjunction with a Bank of Montreal 
program to train and develop business women.
<P>
	Together with the Maison régionale de l'industrie in 
Sherbrooke, the Federal Regional Development Office designed 
a program to advise and train new exporters. The power to 
establish partnerships is no different from similar provisions in 
legislation governing other crown corporations, including the 
Farm Credit Corporation and the Export Development 
Corporation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I must point out at this point that the ability to enter into 
partnerships certainly follows one of the recommendations of 
``Taking Care of Business'', the report which the Standing 
Committee on Industry released in October 1994. I had the 
pleasure to sit on that committee. The committee recommended 
that the mandate of the bank be confirmed and refocused as a 
complementary lender to small and medium size businesses and 
that it be authorized to use new financial instruments to fulfil its 
mandate. The two members of the Bloc Quebecois who sit on 
that committee were in full agreement with that 
recommendation.
<P>
	Bill C-91 is an important element in creating the supportive 
environment for small and medium size enterprises across 
Canada which will contribute to building a long and lasting 
prosperity. This bill is one part of the future we are building for 
small businesses and for Canada's economic prosperity.
<P>
	There is no doubt about the importance of small and medium 
size businesses to our economy today and tomorrow. Small 
businesses employ more than half of the Canadians working in 
the private sector. Since the early 1980s small businesses have 
created over 87 per cent of all new jobs in Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Small and medium size businesses will continue to be a 
source of jobs and wealth in Canada. Our goal is to create a 
climate in which businesses will be able to continue to create 
jobs for Canadians, and to contribute to the wealth of the 
country.
<P>
	We are taking action on this basis, and moving toward our 
goal. In 1994, we asked several groups and organizations in the 
public and private sectors, including the committee, how the 
government could create a suitable climate to foster the growth 
of small businesses.
<P>
	Everybody agreed that small and medium size businesses 
have great potential to create even more jobs and wealth. 
Unfortunately, that potential is too often left untapped. The 
groups and organizations we consulted said that, in order to tap 
this potential, the government had to start with reducing the 
deficit. The first step was taken by the finance minister in his 
last budget.
<P>
	Moreover, they told us that we must develop more efficient, 
more effective, and more relevant programs for small 
businesses. Finally, we must recognize that the government 
cannot, on its own, foster, in the small business community, the 
vitality and the growth the country needs.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13143"> 13143 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	On the basis of these recommendations, we outlined in our 
report entitled <I>Building a More Innovative Economy </I>a wide 
range of initiatives aimed at fostering the growth of small 
business in Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the vital area of financing, we have pressed the banks to 
improve their relationship with small businesses. We have taken 
steps to ease access to capital for innovative projects. We are 
refocusing federal government financing programs to fill in the 
gaps left by the private sector.
<P>
	At our urging, the Canadian Bankers Association developed a 
code of conduct to help ensure accountability, understandable 
contracts, more efficient credit processing, and an effective 
method in dealing with complaints. Member banks are 
incorporating these standards into their own codes of conduct.
<P>
	The federal regional agencies, such as the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency, the Federal Office of Regional 
Development in Quebec, western diversification, and the 
federal office of regional economic development for northern 
Ontario, have all refocused their programs almost entirely on 
small businesses. Federal agencies now focus on recoverable 
contributions and information to businesses.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	At the end of the 1994 fiscal year, we amended the Small 
Businesses Loans Act by increasing the credit ceiling to $12 
billion in order to meet the ever growing demand.
<P>
	On April 1, we implemented other amendments allowing for 
cost recovery in accordance with our overall deficit reduction 
goal. These amendments will also help identify the main 
beneficiaries of the program.
<P>
	In the next few weeks, we will table further amendments to 
the SBLA in order to get on with the process of recovering all 
program costs and make other minor changes affecting lenders 
and borrowers.
<P>
	The review of the small business policy clearly showed that 
one of the most pressing problems facing small and medium size 
businesses is access to capital.
<P>
	The review of the role and mandate of the Federal Business 
Development Bank was a key element of the government's 
efforts to improve this access.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Federal Business Development Bank, since it started 
almost 50 years ago as the former Industrial Development Bank, 
has helped Canadian businesses respond to the changing 
demands of the economy through timely and innovative 
financing and management services. As the economy changes 
again, the time has now come to change the Federal Business 
Development Act as it stands.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The purpose of Bill C-91 is to modernize the bank's mandate. 
It is based on the experience and skills acquired to provide the 
financial and administrative leadership needed by small and 
medium size businesses in the knowledge-based economy, 
without neglecting traditional finance sectors.
<P>
	The Business Development Bank of Canada will be an 
important source of support to small business, as it will be able 
to fill in what I would call the ``gaps'' faced by small and 
medium size businesses across the country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Bill C-91 in no way intrudes on provincial jurisdiction. It 
does not take powers away from any province. It does, however, 
make this very important institution more flexible and more 
responsive to the needs of small and medium sized businesses 
for the benefit of all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to point out to the hon. member for Vaudreuil that he 
missed something in his remarks. He clearly identified the needs 
of the small and medium size business sector, needs that we 
recognize because in Quebec-and there was much talk about 
this in committee-all the organizations concerned and directly 
involved with meeting the needs of this industry, not only in 
terms of development but also in terms of export, have been 
identified.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	Take the solidarity funds, the Paillé project and the regional 
development fund for example. And now, in the wake of the 
APEX program, we are setting up in all of Quebec's regions a 
commissioner of exports system.
<P>
	The hon. member for Vaudreuil failed to assess the impact of 
Bill C-91 on regional development. He was careful not to get 
into the impact of the provision in which the federal government 
gives itself the power to step in and enter into agreements 
directly with whomever it wants in Quebec, whether an 
organization, a regional development council, a municipality, a 
business or what not.
<P>
	However, the hon. member for Vaudreuil knows very well 
that, in terms of regional development, Quebec is the only 
province where a federal development office called FORD-Q 
has been established, with offices in every region of the 
province. No such agency exists elsewhere in Canada. In the rest 
of Canada, regional development is overseen through agencies 
like ACOA in the east for Atlantic Canada, WDO, which stands 
for Western Diversification Office, for western Canada, or 
FEDNOR in Ontario. And these agencies do not have regional 
offices all over the place.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13144"> 13144 </A></B>
<P>
	This FORD-Q we are talking about is everywhere in Quebec. 
We call it the delivery arm, seeing that this agency signs 
memoranda of understanding with other departments, which in 
turn deliver services, having themselves signed MOUs with the 
Federal Bank.
<P>
	We have put questions to the Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, the Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency as well as the Minister of Industry for Ontario, and none 
of them was aware of the existence of a delivery arm elsewhere 
in Canada. None of these development authorities had heard 
about agreements or MOUs between departments. Incredible 
efforts are made in Quebec in terms of federal interference in 
regional development.
<P>
	I would like to tell the hon. member for Vaudreuil that the 
position taken by the official opposition should come as no 
surprise to him. After all, he said that Quebec is a prime mover 
and a leader in regional development. This fact was stated quite 
simply.
<P>
	In Quebec, we have a decentralized sectorial and political 
structure. The powers related to regional development were 
delegated to various organizations accountable to the Quebec 
government. Some of these organizations are present in the hon. 
member's riding of Vaudreuil, and he knows these structures. 
There are regional county municipalities, municipalities, school 
boards, CEGEPs, universities, regional health boards, Quebec 
manpower development societies, regional manpower councils 
and regional development councils. All these organizations are 
established in the province's 16 administrative regions and are 
accountable to the Quebec government.
<P>
	Moreover, there is an act respecting the ministère du Conseil 
exécutif, which provides that the Quebec government is the only 
authority which can sign development agreements, or any other 
type of agreement, with other governments.
<P>
	Yet, through its bills, the federal government is assuming the 
authority to unilaterally interfere by reaching agreements with 
organizations which are under Quebec's jurisdiction. This is a 
flat rejection of a Quebec law, as well as a flat denial of the 
Quebec government's jurisdiction over regional development.
<P>
	The legislation on the business development bank of Canada, 
which seeks to allow agreements with federal or provincial 
departments and organizations, as well as with any other body or 
individual, goes so far as to say that the bank could act as agent 
for such organizations. This is a direct and blatant attempt to 
take over regional development, by totalling bypassing the 
Quebec government and dismissing its authority.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	I want to tell the hon. member for Vaudreuil that, in August 
1991, some of his Quebec Liberal colleagues denounced the 
establishment, by order in council, of the federal office of 
regional development in Quebec. Indeed, the Quebec Liberal 
minister responsible for regional development, Yvon Picotte, 
was quick to react to the order in council confirming the 
establishment of a federal department of regional development 
and the appointment of a deputy minister in that department.Mr. Picotte said that, under the more discreet title of Federal 
Office of Regional Development for Quebec, the new 
department could, in the medium term, end up costing Quebec 
regions a lot. The federal government does not have the 
expertise to ensure that the subsidized projects will match the 
regional development priorities that were set these last few 
years by all of the stakeholders within each of Quebec's 
regions.'' He also said: ``It is obvious that, with this federal 
approach, Quebec is faced with a <I>fait accompli</I> through orders in 
council.''
<P>
	What do we find in the bills which are central to today's 
debate? Exactly the same thing. Let us not forget that it was his 
Liberal friends from Quebec who protested. I should add that the 
then Minister of Federal-Provincial Relations, Mr. Rémillard, 
stated on August 8, 1991, that the government of Quebec was 
determined to stop co-operating with the federal government in 
the area of regional development.
<P>
	The Quebec minister reminds us of the conditions for 
approval-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order! I think we all 
understand that the question and comment period can lead to 
debate. I would certainly like to give the hon. member for 
Vaudreuil the opportunity to answer these comments and 
questions. I would ask the hon. member for Richmond-Wolfe 
to conclude so that our colleague can answer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
getting to my question. Given all these facts, which are not 
necessarily the work of the Bloc Quebecois, but are the results of 
all the negotiations held throughout the years with our Liberal 
colleagues opposite, who protested against our approach, how 
can the hon. member for Vaudreuil forget to mention the direct 
impact these bills will have on regional development and 
control, and refuse to recognize that Quebec has exclusive 
jurisdiction in this area?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> Mr. Speaker, the industry committee has been 
examining this bill for three days now and here, in the House, 
the minister has now been trying to allay the hon. member's 
fears for two or three days. With each passing day, I realize that 
his understanding of this bill's role is getting lesser and lesser.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13145"> 13145 </A></B>
<P>
	The clock is ticking away and, unless we pass this bill before 
the end of June, there will be no more money for the Federal 
Business Development Bank, to name one, and no more money 
for small and medium size businesses. One of the aims of this 
bill is to increase the capital available to these businesses as 
loans.
<P>
	The hon. members say that no other province boasts so many 
regional offices. That is because the other provinces, like the 
four Atlantic provinces, have their own agency. I know at least 
70 members from Ontario who would like to get their hands on 
the budget for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec to give it to Ontario, where the program 
does not even exist.
<P>
	I am going to quote again the clause with which the hon. 
member seems to have so much difficulty. Clause 20 clearly 
says that ``The Bank may enter into agreements with, and act as 
agent for, any department or agency of the government of 
Canada or a province-''
<P>
	I am stopping here because I think he is stumbling on the word 
``province''. When he talks about the RCMs, municipalities and 
school boards of Quebec-I must agree that municipalities were 
created by the provincial government-that did not prevent us 
from signing the Canada-Quebec infrastructure agreement with 
all three levels of government.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	Therefore, I fail to see why he should worry, because, in my 
opinion, there is no cause for worry. We can sign agreements 
with agencies, and if they fall under provincial jurisdiction, the 
agencies, for example a municipality, will be obliged by law to 
obtain the provincial government's agreement.
<P>
	There is no doubt in my mind that we are not trying to erode 
powers. What we are trying to do is resolve the problem many 
small and medium size businesses are having regarding access 
to capital. This bill aims to bring within their reach the $50,000, 
$60,000 or $100,000 they need, which banks cannot offer them, 
at the moment.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before resuming debate, 
it is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the House 
that the question to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment 
is as follows: the hon. member for Davenport-the 
environment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome 
this opportunity today to speak to the motion presented by the 
Bloc Quebecois. It is a pleasure to do so, both personally and 
especially on behalf of the people of Quebec who will hear what 
we have to say about the federal government and its constant 
push for centralization. I will try to show how the federal 
government is centralizing powers at the expense of the 
provinces and especially Quebec.
<P>
	Quebec is a nation that is truly distinct from Canada and that 
has always wanted to develop its potential according to its 
priorities-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hon. member for 
Vaudreuil, on a point of order.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. As far 
as I know Quebec is still a province. It is not a nation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I realize that occasionally 
members may wish to get involved in the debate, but this is not a 
point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Mr. Speaker, this motion 
condemns the federal government for wanting to centralize 
powers through legislation, and more specifically, through Bills 
C-46, C-91, C-88 and C-76. Little by little, the government, 
acting as it were behind the scenes, has made the Canadian 
federation, and especially the government of that federation, the 
master of this Canadian destiny, while ignoring the people of 
Quebec who want to develop their potential according to their 
own priorities, their own culture, their own way of doing things. 
It is always the same old story.
<P>
	The process is a very gradual and very discreet one, and if we 
look at the situation very carefully, we realize that gradually, the 
provinces, if the process is allowed to continue, would become 
regions that would merely act on decisions handed down by 
Ottawa, something Quebec will never except, since for years we 
have refused to become a part of this way of running Canada.
<P>
	The federal government, and a Liberal one to boot, says it 
wants a flexible and open federation, but at the same time it 
decides to centralize and give itself certain powers without 
further consultation. As my colleague said, there have been no 
federal-provincial meetings since this Liberal government was 
elected. Why? Because it is independent. It thinks it is the only 
government in Canada that should determine the future of this 
country. It does not consult the provinces, and it goes ahead, 
slowly but surely, little by little, very discreetly. It is very smart 
about the way it is doing this, but we in the Bloc Quebecois, who 
came to Ottawa to defend the interests of Quebec and promote 
the sovereignty of Quebec because we felt we had to do this, we 
cannot let this go on.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	I would remind you that this desire to centralize powers in 
Ottawa is not new. Sixty years ago, Mr. Duplessis was elected in 
Quebec in 1936 on a platform of: ``Il faut rapatrier notre butin''. 
I remember by father and grandfather voted for Mr. Duplessis, 
who was Quebec's premier for many years and who got elected 
on the platform of: ``Il faut rapatrier notre butin d'Ottawa''. 
Quebecers' mistrust of the federal government is not new. In 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13146"> 13146 </A></B>
<P>
order to grow, we need more  independence. Mr. Duplessis got 
elected with the slogan: ``Il faut rapatrier notre butin''.
<P>
	Jean Lesage was a Liberal, a senior public servant and a 
former member of Parliament in Ottawa. He ran for election in 
Quebec City in 1960 and was elected with the slogan ``Maîtres 
chez nous''. This is important. Quebecers voted for Mr. Lesage 
because he talked to them about being ``Maîtres chez nous''. He 
was a Liberal, a former member of Parliament in Ottawa, and he 
became the Premier of Quebec who got the quiet revolution in 
Quebec rolling. This is when Quebec really began to pick up 
speed in achieving success and bringing about change. It 
happened because Quebecers began to take pride in themselves 
and because the Liberal Premier of Quebec in 1960 said that we 
had to be ``Maîtres chez nous''. This is how he got elected.
<P>
	Daniel Johnson, the father of the Union Nationale, got elected 
with the slogan ``Égalité ou indépendance''. So, here again, 
Quebecers elected a government in Quebec on the strength of a 
slogan like ``Égalité ou indépendance''. It is important, when 
the federal government wants to centralize things here in Ottawa 
and proves the point with the bills we mentioned earlier, to note 
that governments in Quebec have been elected almost since the 
start of the century on the strength of such slogans.
<P>
	We are not here by chance, we in the Bloc Quebecois. We were 
sent here by Quebecers to defend this point again. Today, as in 
the past, while it has been in power, the Liberal Party continues 
to try to centralize, obviously a little at a time and somewhat 
deceitfully. They are good at it. People do not really realize it, 
but we are being had yet again.
<P>
	In 1976, Mr. Lévesque got elected with 
``Souveraineté-association''. We can see that things have 
evolved. Sixty years ago, Mr. Duplessis used to say: ``Il faut 
rapatrier notre butin''. Mr. Lesage: ``Maître chez nous'', Daniel 
Johnson Senior: ``Égalité ou indépendance'', and Mr. Lévesque, 
in 1976: ``Souveraineté-association''. While keeping a close 
eye on things, we realized that the federal government wanted to 
take over more and more and centralize more powers in Ottawa.
<P>
	What happened? In the 1970s, Mr. Trudeau's Liberals 
realized that Quebec was really coming along with its 
governments which were really working for the 
people-Maîtres chez nous, Égalité ou indépendance, and so on 
and so forth-Quebecers were really starting to be proud and to 
grow. So the federal government said: ``We cannot let this 
happen, Quebecers are going to be ahead of us''. In order to stay 
ahead, the federal government decided to use its spending 
power. And it established all kinds of programs. It set health 
care standards. It injected money, taxpayers' money, of course, 
it is never the money of the federal government, it is the money 
of taxpayers. It started borrowing.
<P>
	In 1972, the federal government borrowed so much money 
that it started accumulating a debt. From a zero deficit in 1972, 
the federal government had accumulated a $175 billion debt by 
1984. In 1980, its accumulated debt had reached $80 billion, 
strictly to show its superiority over Quebec. Seeing that Quebec 
was developing, seeing Quebec with a sovereignist movement 
more sovereignist than Quebecers themselves, if I may say so, 
the federal government, not looking kindly on these 
developments, said: ``We are going to show Quebecers that we 
are important. We are going to spend money and show them that 
they will not survive without us''.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	Quietly, they borrowed and borrowed. What has been the 
result? For the sole purpose of proving its superiority, the 
federal government borrowed and spent. At the same time, it 
created a completely artificial economy which contradicted the 
very model of the Liberal free entreprise system. It did not 
create a system, it created an artificial economy by injecting so 
much money into it. It was not free enterprise which caused the 
economy to overheat and go into a crisis, it was the government 
with its interventionist policy.
<P>
	Remember that in the 1970s, the federal government caused 
inflation by trying to prove its superiority with its free spending. 
The annual inflation rate climbed to 10, 12 and even 15 per cent. 
The federal government continued its free spending until after 
the 1980 referendum. We had to wait until 1980. In that year, a 
referendum was held in Quebec, a referendum which was lost by 
Quebecers. But still they won by 43 to 45 per cent.
<P>
	It was only after the referendum that the government began to 
say that it made no sense. It had been causing inflation for so 
long that it now had to stop it. And the only way to stop it-the 
governor of the Bank of Canada said it himself-was by raising 
interest rates. So, in 1981, 1982, interest rates soared to 21 per 
cent. The recession which ensued was so severe that many small 
businesses in Quebec as well as in Canada went bankrupt. The 
hon. member from Vaudreuil knows that, he just mentioned it. I 
know too, I was in business at that time. I can tell you, Mr. 
Speaker, that those were very hard times. A lot of businesses 
went belly up.
<P>
	Many businesses were expanding, they had lines of credit and 
heavy mortgages. Quebecers went with the flow, they grew, 
contracted loans, etc. because Quebec was part of the modern 
economy. The recession which was a pure creation of the federal 
government which brutally raised interest rates up to 22 per cent 
over a very short period of time caused bankruptcies and 
economic and social chaos. The whole problem was caused by 
the federal government which wanted to prove that it was the big 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13147"> 13147 </A></B>
<P>
boss, that it was the greatest and that it must stick its nose 
everywhere. It was terrible, simply shocking.
<P>
	In 1984, the cumulative debt totalled $170 billion. That year, 
to show its superiority, the liberal government, with Mr. 
Lalonde as Minister of Finance, presented its last budget before 
being defeated that same year. Its deficit was estimated at $38 
billion and its revenues at $70 billion. The government was 
borrowing $38 billion, which meant it was spending almost 150 
per cent of its anticipated revenues. It collected $70 billion and 
borrowed $38 billion. That was the Lalonde budget. All that, I 
repeat, only to show that it was superior, to show Quebecers that 
it was the big boss, that it spent and controlled.
<P>
	As you know, in the 18th century, the Emperor Napoleon 
spent 135 per cent of what he could collect in revenues to 
maintain his empire.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	But in 1984, Lalonde and Trudeau were spending 165 per cent 
to maintain their superiority here in Ottawa. That is what 
happened. People wonder why we are deep in debt and why 
things are not working. Why? Because two nations want to grow 
and they are fighting to see who will be the strongest. We 
decided that the best way was to have two countries so that both 
nations could grow.
<P>
	The same thing happened in 1984. I arrived here as a 
Conservative in 1984. We had three slogans: decentralization of 
powers, national reconciliation and spending cuts. Those are the 
three reasons why I joined the Conservatives and why we were 
elected in 1984. Some said that a decentralization of powers was 
needed, and I agreed with that. In any case, we had lost the 
referendum, so we decided to take the risk of starting over again 
if that were possible.
<P>
	The Conservatives were well-intentioned. They said that they 
would decentralize powers. A national reconciliation was 
necessary. Everybody was fighting, so we had to clean up our 
act. A reduction in spending was obviously needed. We had an 
accumulated debt of $175 billion, which was way too much. 
That is what we said. The Conservative government did cut 
spending and did make extraordinary efforts toward a national 
reconciliation. But you know what happened to Meech.
<P>
	The Meech Lake Accord failed because it provided for a 
reduction in the federal government's spending power. That is 
why it failed. It failed because Mr. Chretien, the current Prime 
Minister, did not want to see the spending power of the federal 
government reduced. He used the premiers of New Brunswick 
and of Newfoundland, Mr. McKenna and Mr. Wells, and also 
Mrs. Carstairs, who is now a senator, to bring about the failure of 
the Meech Lake Accord because it limited the spending power of 
the federal government.
<P>
	That was the major problem. We were absolutely right in 
asking for that, but it was the reason the accord was rejected. 
The leader of the present government is the one who caused the 
failure of the Meech Lake Accord. He is the one most 
responsible for the failure of the Meech Lake Accord. Everyone 
knows it. It is not something we made up.
<P>
	What were the consequences? The consequences were that the 
Tories spent even more to prove their superiority. Despite 
spending cuts, they spent approximately $30 billion, $32 billion 
annually in excess of what they collected, that is a yearly deficit 
of $30 billion, $32 billion dollars. They continued to artificially 
inflate the economy, to raise inflation. They created a kind of 
artificial economy.
<P>
	The economic growth was between 3 and 3.9 per cent, but the 
real economic growth-if the government had not invested $30 
billion, $32 billion dollars to prove its superiority-would 
probably have been 2 per cent. Real economic growth such as we 
are seeing in Europe and elsewhere. Real economic growth of 
1.5 or 2 per cent per year. But no. The federal government 
borrowed abroad and now 40 per cent of the $600 billion we owe 
are foreign owned. They artificially inflated the economy, and 
we are now faced with this big problem.
<P>
	What I want to say is that because of the federal government's 
desire to centralize, to prove that it is in control, the Canadian 
economy has been destroyed. Canada is bankrupt as a result. It 
has to stop. Even if, tomorrow morning or in the fall, Quebecers 
lost the referendum, the problem would be the same. Fifty per 
cent of the sovereignists in Quebec still would want to prove 
their superiority, to continue to develop according to their 
needs, to their priorities. The problem would be the same.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	I am telling Quebecers through you, Mr. Speaker, that they 
must vote for sovereignty. They have to create a new country for 
the good of Canada and for the good of Quebec. We must strive 
to do so. There is no alternative, otherwise we will never get out 
of it. For the good of our children, for the good of our 
grand-children, for the good of Quebec and Canada, we should 
build a sound economic union. If we had some kind of union 
council, with delegates from the two countries, it would be fine. 
But we should each have the opportunity to develop according to 
our own priorities and according to our own culture.
<P>
	I guarantee you that we would be better off not centralizing, as 
it is done right now, but becoming two separate sovereign 
nations linked by an economic union. There is some kind of 
agreement on the management of such an union.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is 
the second time the member for Longueuil refers to the debt. In 
his speech, he said that in the sixties our slogan was ``Maîtres 
chez nous'', in the seventies it was  ``Égalité ou indépendance'' 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13148"> 13148 </A></B>
<P>
and in the eighties it became ``Souveraineté-Association''. I 
prefer to talk about the ``Beau risque'' of the seventies. But now, 
the change of direction of March 1995 has turned into no 
direction at all.
<P>
	Why do I say that? Because the Bloc Quebecois with its 
separation option does not know what to offer Quebecers. The 
member for Longueuil speaks about the debt as if it belonged 
exclusively to the federal government. Quebecers also 
participated in that debt. If Quebec becomes independent, the 
quality of life of its citizens will drop from the 9th position, 
where it stands right now, to the 19th. The member also said that 
the political system is not working, that it does not meet the 
expectations or requirements of Quebec and that we created an 
artificial economy in Canada.
<P>
	My question for the member is this: If he does not approve of 
Canada's political system, if our economy does not meet his 
expectations, why is it that in their plan, the Bloc members say 
they want sovereignty, but they also want to maintain the same 
economic union and the same political system? Is there not a 
contradiction there? I am asking the member because he said 
himself that after the referendum, if the answer is no, there will 
still be 54 members promoting independence for Quebec.
<P>
	I want to ask the member if that means that all Bloc Quebecois 
members will resign if their option is rejected during the fall 
referendum, as he claims?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find it rather 
strange that when we say that we want an economic association 
with the rest of Canada, the Liberal Party, especially the Quebec 
members and the Prime Minister, who is also from Quebec, say: 
``We do not want any association with the rest of Canada''. And 
yet, they too are Quebecers.
<P>
	You see, this economic association is unavoidable, no matter 
what. We do a lot of trade with Ontario and western Canada. As a 
matter of fact, the West sells more in Quebec that we sell there. 
There is a deficit. Ontario buys slightly over one billion more 
from Quebec than we purchase from Ontario. If we were to 
become sovereign, without an economic association, Ontario 
would have a trade deficit with Quebec.
<P>
	In order not to disturb this economy which is working and will 
go on, in any case, and which business people and economists 
will want to keep going, we say that we need some kind of 
economic association. No matter the form it takes, we will need 
some kind of economic association to manage and continue to 
manage our trade.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	Moreover, we must say that, at the present time, it is harder to 
trade among provinces that it is with the United States through 
the FTA. I find this terrible. It seems to me that it should be easy 
for Canada and Quebec to have an economic association at least 
as open as the one we have with the United States.
<P>
	In Quebec, we tend to trade north-south, because the market 
there is very large, as in New York City and Boston. It is said that 
there are close to 100 million consumers within a range of 1,000 
kilometres from Montreal. This explains why we tend to trade 
with the South. But this does not mean that we do not want to 
maintain our economic links with the rest of Canada. To achieve 
this, we say that we need an economic association. It could be 
managed by some kind of a council which could sit, perhaps here 
in Ottawa, with delegates from the government in Quebec City, 
MPs delegated by the government in Ottawa, who could sit once 
in a while to manage this united council. This is not 
complicated, this is simple. Life goes on.
<P>
	Any way, one cannot claim that governments can do 
everything. It is the economy which fosters good trade relations.
<P>
	I hear the Liberals laugh over there, and I think they are being 
rather foolish. I cannot understand why they are laughing. It 
bothers me to hear them laugh, I do not like it. I heard the Prime 
Minister, himself a Quebecer, say that he does not want a union 
with the rest of Canada, that he has no need for it. I do not know 
what he is going to do. He is going to die alone. I do not know; 
maybe he will have to move to Toronto, because he lives in 
Quebec. I think he lives in Quebec, although I am not sure. I 
rather think that he has been living in Ontario for 30 years. I am 
not sure about that. When I listen to him, I wonder if the 
language, the words he uses are not words that Quebecers were 
using 30 years ago. The language of Quebecers has evolved, but 
the Prime Minister talks as people used to 30 years ago. I think 
that he has been living in Ontario for 30 years and that he seldom 
goes back to Quebec. The language there has evolved.
<P>
	So, I find it a little strange to hear Quebec Liberals-because 
that applies only to Quebec Liberals-say that they do not want 
an economic association with the rest of Canada. I am really 
disappointed. I do not understand.
<P>
	In this regard, in the interests of all Quebecers, it is high time 
for us to be sovereign so that we can grow and also have an 
economic association with the rest of Canada that will come 
naturally, I am sure. Some may say that they do not want it, but 
that is not true; it will come naturally. Business people, 
professionals, economists, all those who are in business will 
want it to be maintained.
<P>
	Planes full of business people link Montreal and Toronto 
every day. I used to be in business and I used to go regularly to 
Toronto to buy products. I was president of a wholesale 
company and I used to buy a lot of products in Toronto. I went 
there 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13149"> 13149 </A></B>
<P>
regularly. Ontarians will surely want Quebecers to continue to 
buy products in Toronto. I am sure of it.
<P>
	In Ontario, over 100,000 jobs are dependent on sales in 
Quebec. I doubt that Ontarians will refuse to sell to Quebec any 
more if 100,000 jobs are at stake. I doubt that westerners will 
refuse to sell their beef to Quebec when we buy $800 or $900 
million of it each year.
<P>
	Therefore, those who claim that there will be no economic 
union with Quebec are talking nonsense. Anyone who is the 
least realistic will understand that this is a bare fact, that we are 
not inventing anything and that it will evolve quite naturally.
<P>
	What we are saying is that we are determined enough to do it. 
If Liberals, and especially those from Quebec, maintain that 
they do not want that, it just baffles me.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to be able to engage in this debate, 
particularly after having listened to that rather enlightening 
rendition of creative imagination on the part of the Bloc 
Quebecois members. I am happy to know that Jules Verne is 
alive and well and writing science fiction when we hear their 
description of how everything can change while everything 
remains the same. It does challenge the imagination.
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	I want to speak for a few moments about the allegations 
contained in the motion on the floor today with respect to Bill 
C-88. That is the bill to implement the internal trade agreement 
which was negotiated and signed among the federal government 
and the provinces about a year ago today. I must say that the 
allegations contained in that motion represent an inability or 
perhaps an unwillingness on the part of the Bloc Quebecois to 
understand the plain meaning of the text in the bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As was said in the House before, the federal government 
would seldom intervene as plaintiff in a dispute that arises 
within the context of the Agreement on Internal Trade. If a 
dispute is settled in the federal government's favour and the 
province concerned refuses to accept the conclusions of an 
impartial panel, the federal government could then suspend 
benefits or impose retaliatory measures of equivalent effect.
<P>
	Clearly, such measures would be imposed in the same sector 
as the initial violation or in another sector regulated by the 
agreement. Retaliatory measures would not affect transfer 
payments or social programs since these do not come under the 
purview of this agreement.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Bill C-88 does not make the federal government the 
policeman of the internal trade agreement as the official 
opposition mistakenly insists. Anyone who takes the time to 
read the bill, even the headnote to clause 9 of Bill C-88 or to 
read article 1710 of the agreement on internal trade can only 
verify the accuracy of what I have just outlined. Bill C-88 deals 
only with what the federal  government must do to live up to its 
obligations under the internal trade agreement and nothing else.
<P>
	As I said in the House on May 4, the agreement on internal 
trade is a consensual agreement. All the parties who agreed to it 
must act within their own jurisdiction to implement it and 
comply with its obligations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	So far, only the federal government and the Government of 
Alberta have tabled legislation to implement the agreement and 
comply with their respective obligations in this regard. It is 
probable that most of the other parties to the agreement will 
decide to do likewise, sooner or later.
<P>
	I am sure that all Canadians are anxious to see what 
governments that claim to support domestic free trade will 
actually do to implement the Agreement on Internal Trade and 
eliminate the barriers they themselves created over the years.
<P>
	Bill C-88 is an historic milestone. It is an opportunity for the 
federal government to show leadership and to do so with the 
governments of the other parties to the agreement, as they 
implement the first comprehensive domestic free trade 
agreement since the British North America Act, 1867.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Since 1867 the Canadian economy has grown and evolved in 
ways never imagined by the Fathers of Confederation. The 
federal government still has the constitutional responsibility for 
trade and commerce. Over time, provinces have assumed 
prominent roles as influencers of economic growth and in the 
regulation of trade and commerce at their level.
<P>
	As a result, trading arrangements and regulations have 
developed in an ad hoc way often in response to a particular 
regional need. Many of these measures create barriers to trade as 
they impact on the free flow of goods, services, people and 
capital within Canada.
<P>
	Such barriers can lead to the inefficient use of resources and 
limit the ability of industry to take advantage of economies of 
scale and to maintain competitive market positions. The result is 
to reduce the competitiveness of Canadian business and 
adversely affect the Canadian economy.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	Also, in Canada we have a patchwork of regulations, 
standards and other barriers to interprovincial trade that have 
grown around us and have become an unacceptable feature of 
our domestic market. There has been growing concern and 
evidence these barriers to trade are seriously affecting our 
ability to remain competitive in the international trading 
environment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13150"> 13150 </A></B>
<P>
	It is urgent that we establish a new trading regime in Canada, 
one based on more open interprovincial trade, one that would 
not impede the movement of people and investment within the 
country and one that would allow for co-operative approaches 
to the resolution of domestic trade disputes. Bill C-88 is a key 
element in bringing to fruition the process of intergovernmental 
negotiation and co-operation that will produce that new regime.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This bill concludes a lengthy process to which many people 
have contributed and which has involved analyzing a great many 
issues and points of view. Ministers and officials of the federal, 
provincial and territorial governments took an active part in this 
process, as well as representatives of the private sector.
<P>
	In fact, representatives of the private sector and especially 
members of the business community have put constant pressure 
on all levels of government to find ways to deal with 
interprovincial trade barriers and the resulting economic cost 
for Canada.
<P>
	The Canadian Manufacturers Association, for instance, 
estimates that trade barriers on domestic markets cost the 
Canadian economy about $7 billion annually in terms of lost 
jobs and income.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The agreement on internal free trade signed last year by the 
Prime Minister and other first ministers is an outstanding 
example of what can be accomplished within a co-operative 
framework in Canada. It is also important to note that political 
parties of all stripes and all regional perspectives have been part 
of this process.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	All parties that took part in the negotiations share the same 
view and recognize the benefits of a more open market for 
Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As a result of the work done by the committee of ministers on 
internal trade and by the chief negotiators, we achieved a 
comprehensive agreement. It provides for a rules based system 
for trade within Canada, a dispute settlement mechanism to 
resolve issues on internal trade matters, a standstill on new 
barriers, commitments to future negotiations to broaden and 
deepen the agreement, a code of conduct to prevent destructive 
competition for investment, increased labour mobility and a 
commitment to reconcile standards related measures. These are 
significant achievements.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Dispute settlement is a key component of this agreement as it 
is of any trade agreement. This agreement represents a unique 
response to circumstances that are uniquely Canadian. The 
agreement is based on rules which, in turn, are based on certain 
concepts and agreements that are well established in 
international trade but adapted to the Canadian context.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Well known examples include the GATT agreement, the 
European Union and NAFTA. There have been suggestions that 
we in Canada should just use one or other of these models in the 
Canadian situation. However, these suggestions overlook the 
important issue of the sovereignty of the parties to an agreement 
as well as the degree of political control the parties themselves 
are willing to give up to the compliance mechanism which is in 
place in the accord.
<P>
	The agreement on internal trade sets out the framework and 
basic underpinnings for a dispute resolution mechanism 
approach that is unique to the Canadian context and provides for 
open access to the settlement process. This approach commits 
all parties to the use of conciliation to address problems arising 
from the provisions of the agreement, including its principles, 
its rules and its individual sectoral agreements.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	The mandate of the committee on internal trade is to ``assist in 
the resolution of disputes arising out of interpretations and 
applications of the agreement''. The working philosophy of the 
committee and of the agreement is to use consultation and 
conciliation in dispute resolution.
<P>
	Disputing parties will be encouraged to make every attempt 
through co-operation, consultation and other forms of dispute 
resolution to arrive at a solution. If consultation fails, 
governments or governments on behalf of individual persons or 
persons directly can ask to have matters raised with a panel. The 
panel will consider the facts and make recommendations for 
changing policies or behaviour, but it will not assess damages. 
The underlying objective of the process is to seek to change 
inconsistent behaviour and policies and not apply penalties or 
award damages.
<P>
	Under the agreement, retaliation is only possible at the end of 
the dispute settlement process. Only in cases where the federal 
government was a complainant in a dispute and only where a 
province has refused for a year to change a measure found by an 
impartial panel to have violated the agreement could the federal 
government consider taking retaliatory action.
<P>
	Such action would first have to be discussed with the 
committee on internal trade. Even then it could only be such as 
to have the equivalent economic effect to the measure that had 
originally violated the agreement and it would have to be taken 
in a sector specifically covered by the agreement. This is what 
the Bloc Quebecois is complaining about as an undue intrusion 
of the federal government into provincial affairs. I ask you, Mr. 
Speaker, if you have ever heard anything so ridiculous.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="13151"> 13151 </A></B>
<P>
	In addition to dispute resolution procedures, the bill also 
presents amendments to a number of other federal acts which 
need to be changed in order that we meet our obligations to the 
provinces and territories to make the changes to federal 
legislation and regulations necessary to implement the 
agreement which we signed last year. All parties to the 
agreement were informed on April 12 in Calgary that the federal 
government would be introducing these amendments in the near 
future.
<P>
	Our work to date has emphasized the value of the 
co-operative approach to solving trade problems internally in 
Canada. Our work in the future will do so as well. That is the 
very reason the agreement on internal trade has been criticized 
by members of the Reform Party for not going far enough fast 
enough. Other members opposite would have had the 
government act unilaterally. They have suggested under 
sections 91(a) and 121 of the Constitution to impose free 
internal trade on the provinces. That is the very thing the other 
opposition party accuses us of having done. Both criticisms are 
purely and simply ill founded and wrong headed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The government tried to resolve this country's problems in 
collaboration with the provincial governements. The process 
leading up to the Free Trade Agreement bears witness to this. It 
has been our approach in the past, it is our approach now and it is 
the only approach that any responsible Canadian government 
can take in the future. It is the only way to govern and that is 
what real power is.
<P>
	Cases where the federal government is the grievor in a 
disagreement under the Free Trade Agreement will be few. If a 
dispute were settled in favour of the federal government and if 
the province in question were to refuse to respect the 
conclusions of the impartial panel, the federal government 
would have the right to withdraw equivalent benefits.
<P>
	Such retaliatory measures should be taken in the same sector 
as the initial violation or in another sector covered by the 
accord.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Retaliation could not involve transfer payments or social 
programs because these things are not covered by the 
agreement. Bill C-88 does not make the federal government a 
policeman of the internal trade agreement as the official 
opposition has claimed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Bill C-88 only covers the federal government's obligations 
under the interprovincial trade accord, nothing more. The 
interprovincial trade accord is a consensual accord. All parties 
to this accord are responsible for applying it in their own 
jurisdictions and for meeting its requirements.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	What we have heard over this day of debate is a series of 
allegations founded on misapprehension, perhaps wilful 
misunderstanding of the contents of bills before the House.
<P>
	The agreement on internal trade we want to see broadened, 
deepened and strengthened. There is a lot more work to do. I call 
on the official opposition, since the Government of Quebec has 
claimed to be a free trader, not to put up roadblocks to a real free 
internal trading market within Canada but to begin to support it 
with actions instead of protestations.

	The House resumed from April 26 consideration of the 
motion.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> At the time of 
adjournment on Wednesday, April 26, 1995 the hon. member for 
Elk Island had seven minutes remaining for debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is the 
second time I have had a speech interrupted by a period of some 
two to three months. It is difficult to keep one's train of thought 
when that happens. However, I shall review the beginning of my 
speech and then carry on.
<P>
	We are debating the motion put forward by the hon. member 
for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve which has to do with the 
government taking the necessary measures to recognize same 
sex spouses. In my intervention last April 26, before I was 
interrupted, I was stating that as legislators, we have a 
responsibility, an obligation, a high calling to do what is right 
for our country and its citizens. Very often debates such as this 
are limited because we allow our emotions to enter into them to 
such an extent that we sometimes fail to ask the real questions. 
We need to ask some very serious questions about this issue. 
Where are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13152"> 13152 </A></B>
<P>
we going as a society? How are we going to determine what is 
best in this regard?
<P>
	I would like to submit several ideas for the criteria we could 
use in determining what is best. One which is very important, 
and which I alluded to in my last intervention, is that we need to 
listen to Canadians. That is so important. As members of 
Parliament we are sent here to represent our constituents 
according to what they want us to do.
<P>
	We are all aware that Canadians have been expressing their 
views on this issue. There is a continual stream of petitions on 
the subject. Why do people do these things? Why do they get 
into the mode of asking questions of people? ``Here is an issue. 
Do you agree with it? If you agree will you sign the petition?'' 
They think a decision is about to be made which is of 
considerable importance to them. They want to express their 
opinions and have them represented in the House. Consequently, 
we have had many petitions in which the members of 
Parliament, the House of Commons assembled, have been 
petitioned to not change any laws that would indicate approval 
of same sex relationships or homosexuality.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	That may on the surface appear to be somewhat intolerant, but 
the question needs to be asked: Are we experiencing the tyranny 
of the majority? Does the majority feel this way? According to 
statistics and various surveys that have been taken, by far the 
majority of Canadians believes that heterosexual couples are the 
ideal models for marriage and for family.
<P>
	We would err if we were to ignore the advice from Canadians 
when they say: ``Hold it here, legislators. There is a danger. You 
are embarking on dangerous ground. Stop, do not do this''.
<P>
	There have been other very notable instances where the 
wishes of Canadians have not been taken into account. I suppose 
the best example is the infamous GST. If I am not mistaken, 
there were more petitions presented on the GST than on any 
issue when it was being debated. However, the legislators of the 
day chose to ignore that advice and we now have on the books 
and in practice the most hated tax that Canada has ever had. It is 
so hated that we all know what happened to the government that 
brought it in.
<P>
	It is incredible that the present government got elected on, 
among other things, a promise to eliminate the GST. That is how 
strongly Canadians felt about it. Consequently the GST is one of 
the best examples of government ignoring the advice of 
Canadians. There are some consequences to us in this place if we 
ignore advice and put through legislation anyway.
<P>
	That would be one of the arguments I would put in favour of 
my view and in my opposition to this motion. We need to learn to 
increasingly trust and express the views of the Canadian people 
when they express themselves in this way.
<P>
	Something else we ought to take into account is that this is not 
the tyranny of the majority. By saying we do not want to 
recognize same sex couples, we are not telling these people that 
it is justifiable to persecute them and to do other things that are 
not right to any member of our society. I would really emphasize 
that.
<P>
	I grieve for anyone who is attacked, beaten up or assaulted. It 
does not matter to me whether that person is male or female, a 
native Canadian or an immigrant Canadian, or a Canadian who 
has been here for two or three generations. It also does not 
matter to me whether that person is a homosexual or a 
heterosexual. If that person is assaulted it is wrong. No 
Canadian should be deprived of the protection of law for such 
fundamental things as freedom of security and freedom of 
person. When we speak in opposition to this motion it is not 
because we are in any way condoning that type of activity.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to say that it is my definite opinion 
and certainly the opinion of many who have communicated to 
me on this topic, that we need to promote, to the greatest extent 
possible, what we might label as the traditional family: the 
mother and father, the procreative couple, the family with 
children. Our taxation laws and laws on benefits should promote 
and encourage that kind of loving family relationship.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	At the same time we say to these people who wish to engage in 
same sex relationships that there is presently nothing in the law 
preventing same sex relationships. Many of us disagree with it. 
It would be ill-advised of us as a Parliament and as a country to 
condone it, to approve it, to say that it is okay by voting in favour 
of a motion such as the one that we have before us.
<P>
	With great respect for the member who brought forward this 
motion, I will not be able to support it.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Roseanne Skoke (Central Nova, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
from the outset I wish to advise the House that I do not support 
this motion.
<P>
	This motion is specifically asking Parliament to encroach on a 
jurisdiction that is not within the domain of Parliament. This 
motion is asking Parliament to take the necessary measures for 
the legal recognition of same sex spouses.
<P>
	In effect, Parliament is being asked to provide special legal 
status to homosexuals, thereby allowing them to redefine the 
family, to redefine marriage, to enter into the realm of sanctity 
of marriage, to allow homosexuals to adopt children, to enter 
into schools, education and infiltrate the curriculum within our 
school system and to impose an alternative lifestyle on our 
youth. This is unacceptable.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13153"> 13153 </A></B>
<P>
	All these demands are encroaching on and undermining the 
inherent and inviolable rights of families. Families have existed 
before the church. Families have existed before the state. 
Parliament has absolutely no legal or constitutional authority 
to redefine family, or to enter into the realm of the sanctity of 
marriage.
<P>
	It is important for the House to understand why this line of 
thinking is present here today and why such a motion would 
even be entertained on the floor of the House.
<P>
	The first theme that we have to come to understand is that of 
freedom. At the collective level, people are saying that they 
want freedom to govern themselves, develop their own 
economies, to enhance their overall quality of life, and the 
freedom of choice.
<P>
	Closely tied to this theme of freedom is our second theme, 
that is, the individual. At the personal level, people are saying 
that they want to be free to express themselves, free to work, 
free to worship, free to travel, free to be what they aspire to be 
and once again, individual freedom of choice.
<P>
	Closely tied to our themes of freedom and individualism in 
our country is our third emphasis and that is pluralism. As a 
policy, pluralism contributes to collective and personal freedom 
by legitimizing diversity. It appears on the surface to resolve the 
issue of how different individuals who want to be free can live in 
community and harmony.
<P>
	Our three themes of freedom, individualism and pluralism are 
now joined with our fourth theme in our country, relativism. The 
free expression of the individual and groups is made possible 
only by suspending value judgments about how people live or 
what choices people have made.
<P>
	Truth has been replaced by relativism, which is the 
legitimization of diverse choice. Under the guise of equality and 
fairness, pluralism coupled with relativism has come to pervade 
Canadian minds and Canadian institutions.
<P>
	Canadians have become conditioned to be tolerant, to respect, 
to appreciate diversity. The insistence that individuals must be 
free to think and free to behave without interference according 
to their conscience has been reinforced in our pluralistic secular 
society today.
<P>
	The introduction of the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms and the promotion of multiculturalism has once again 
reaffirmed Canada's goal of harmonious co-existence whereby 
the ideas, lifestyles and free thinking of all individuals must be 
accepted and respected to ensure equality and fairness.
<P>
	To accept and to endorse the theory of pluralism coupled with 
relativism is to accept that truth is nothing more than personal 
opinion. Relativism in our pluralistic society has stripped us as 
Canadians of our ethical and moral guidelines. Justice, law and 
morality are  inseparable. In Canada we cannot have laws unless 
our laws are just and moral.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	The preamble to our Canadian Constitution set forth in the 
Constitution Act recognizes the supremacy of God in the rule of 
law. The recognition of the supremacy of God entrenches into 
the Constitution natural law, and therefore the laws of our 
country must not contravene natural law, for to do so the laws 
would be ultra vires or unconstitutional.
<P>
	I refer to recent Supreme Court of Canada decision Nesbit and 
Egan. This decision was rendered on May 25, 1995 and the 
decision makers refer to the relevancy and the functional values 
underlining the law and that the Canadian charter of rights is not 
enacted in a vacuum but must be placed in its proper linguistic, 
philosophic and historical context.
<P>
	Also Chief Justice Lamer and the majority of the Supreme 
Court judiciary stated quite eloquently: ``Marriage has from 
time immemorial been firmly grounded in our legal tradition, 
one that is itself a reflection of longstanding philosophical and 
religious traditions, but its ultimate raison d'étre transcends all 
of these and is firmly anchored in the biological and social 
realities that heterosexual couples have the unique ability to 
procreate, that most children are the product of these 
relationships and that they are generally cared for and nurtured 
by those who live in that relationship. In this sense marriage is 
by nature heterosexual''.
<P>
	The rights of family are being seriously undermined and 
eroded in Canada today. The conventional terms of debate in 
matters of political, economic and legal issues tend to focus on 
individual rights and the rights of state, not the rights of the 
family. This is unfortunate and must change, for the family is the 
most important reality in our lives. To redefine the family to 
include homosexual and lesbian relationships is immoral and 
unjust and a violation of the rights of the family which are well 
founded in both our Canadian and natural law.
<P>
	The family unit is the basic institution of life and the solid 
foundation in which our forefathers have built this great nation. 
The protection of families, family life and family values must be 
a priority with the government. Families have inherent and 
inviolable rights. Families have existed before the church, 
families have existed before the state. The rights of family must 
be preserved, safeguarded and protected by Parliament.
<P>
	To recognize same sex marriages would give credence to a 
faction in our society undermining and destroying our values, 
principles and morality. Such a special recognition of same sex 
marriage by Parliament is an overt acceptance and condonation 
of homosexuality being imposed on Canadians. It has the effect 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13154"> 13154 </A></B>
<P>
of legislating a morality that is not supported by our Canadian 
principles, morals and values.
<P>
	Canadians do not have to accept homosexuality as being 
natural and moral. Homosexuality is not natural. It is immoral 
and it is undermining the inherent rights and values of Canadian 
families and it must not and should not be condoned.
<P>
	To endorse same sex marriages or to include the words sexual 
orientation in any federal legislation would allow homosexuals 
to obtain special legal status. It would allow them to redefine the 
family, to redefine marriage and enter into the realm of the 
sanctity of marriage, to adopt children, to enter into our schools 
and infiltrate the curriculum of our schools and to impose an 
alternative lifestyle on our youth. All these demands are 
encroaching on and undermining the inherent and inviolable 
rights of family.
<P>
	Families have existed before the church and families have 
existed before the state. Parliament has absolutely no legal or 
constitutional authority to redefine family or to enter into the 
realm of sanctity of marriage. For Parliament to do so would 
encroach on the rights and responsibilities of family. It would 
also encroach on the rights of the church. I use the word church 
all inclusively.
<P>
	Parliament must be reminded that separation of church and 
state has been respected for centuries. The state must not 
interfere in matters of church. However, the church has the right 
and responsibility to enter into and be concerned with matters of 
state. The power of church, and I use the word all inclusively, 
must not be underestimated. Over the last 25 years Parliament 
has gradually encroached on the rights of the church, the rights 
of family and the rights of life.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	Over the last 25 years morality, an essential element in justice 
and legislation, has been gradually removed from our laws. 
Such examples are decriminalization of homosexuality, no fault 
divorce, facilitating and funding abortion and our Young 
Offenders Act. Now this motion before the House is requesting 
special legal status for homosexuals to allow them to redefine 
family, to undermine and erode and destroy the rights of family 
and to destroy the sanctity of marriage.
<P>
	It is important for Parliament to be reminded that family is the 
basic institution of life. Life begins from the moment of 
conception and continues until natural death. In the words of the 
Supreme Court of Canada in Egan and Nesbit, marriage is 
heterosexual by nature.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to say to the members of this House that I fully 
support the motion by my colleague for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. As we know, this motion concerns 
legal recognition of same sex partners. In my opinion, we must 
remember, for the purposes of this debate, the limit my 
colleague wanted to set in his motion. We are not talking here 
about the right of same sex couples to marry or adopt. Debate on 
this matter, also a current issue, will take place later.
<P>
	Today, we are trying to decide whether the Government of 
Canada should legally recognize couples of the same sex. I say it 
should. My support for the motion is based on certain 
observations, and I would like to present to you the conclusions I 
have drawn from them.
<P>
	Individually, the members of a same sex couple enjoy the 
same rights as everyone else. This first point may seem rather 
obvious. However, I still think it should be made, because there 
is sometimes a tendency in some debates to assume that certain 
people are more equal than others. I am thinking here primarily 
of white heterosexual males.
<P>
	Individuals who are homosexual are entitled to the same 
individual rights as everyone else and are also entitled to the 
same protection of these rights. Their constitutional rights, that 
is their basic freedoms, their democratic rights, their mobility 
rights, their legal rights, and their right to equality are 
guaranteed by the law and monitored by the courts. No 
government can set aside these rights with impunity. On the 
contrary, government has the obligation to ensure that 
everyone's rights are respected.
<P>
	My second observation: homosexual couples are 
discriminated against.
<P>
	Although homosexual individuals enjoy the same rights, 
individually and under the law, as their heterosexual 
neighbours, they become the subject of discrimination when in a 
relationship.
<P>
	In fact, treatment accorded homosexual couples is completely 
opposite that given heterosexual couples. The courts have 
recognized this discrimination on many occasions, in cases 
involving the entitlement of members of homosexual couples to 
the benefits enjoyed by their heterosexual colleagues.
<P>
	In Canada, several judges and arbitrators have had to analyze 
laws and collective agreements that did not recognize same sex 
spouses, thus denying these people the spousal rights and 
benefits provided under these statutory instruments. In several 
cases, after noting the existence of discrimination and its 
impact, the courts ordered employers to provide the same social 
benefits to both homosexual and heterosexual spouses.
<P>
	Last week, the Supreme Court of Canada finally recognized 
sexual orientation as a prohibited ground of discrimination 
under the Canadian charter. However, on the issue of 
recognizing same sex spouses, the Supreme Court ruling clearly 
sends the ball back into Parliament's court. We can expect the 
conse-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13155"> 13155 </A></B>
<P>
quences of this decision to help lessen discrimination against 
homosexual and lesbian partners.
<P>
	A third finding is that the cost of eliminating discriminatory 
policies will be minimal.
<P>
	The legal recognition of same sex spouses would not cost a 
fortune, contrary to what some people may have feared. 
Although there are no detailed actuarial studies on the 
additional cost of extending social benefits to same sex spouses, 
we can look at the experience of employers who have recognized 
such couples.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	Several private companies, organizations, and governments 
asked actuarial firms to assess the cost of proposed measures 
intended for same sex spouses. The experts surveyed concluded 
that the additional costs would be minimal, in the order of 0.5 to 
1.5 per cent depending on the various social benefits being 
considered. The argument that costs would be prohibitive is 
therefore not valid.
<P>
	Fourth and last, the public would support the recognition of 
same sex spouses.
<P>
	Finally, in discussing new social policy-and that is what we 
are dealing with today-we must assess how acceptable this new 
policy is to the public. This is essential to the success of the 
operation. Often, governments that tried to impose changes 
without first securing public support were quickly called to 
order.
<P>
	I think that the public is ready now for the legal recognition of 
same sex spouses. In Quebec-we are always different-you 
would even find greater support than in Canada.
<P>
	According to an Environics poll conducted in Ontario in the 
spring of 1994, fifty-five per cent of respondents were prepared 
to recognize entitlement to social benefits for same sex spouses. 
An Angus Reid poll showed similar results across Canada. In 
Quebec, 73 per cent of respondents to a SOM poll conducted in 
the fall of 1993 were in favour.
<P>
	To conclude, the members of this House should support the 
motion put forward by my colleague because it is a matter of 
justice and equity. First and foremost, it is a matter of justice 
because all individuals in our society are equal. Being equal, 
they should not be subject to discrimination when they join with 
another person to form a couple.
<P>
	Second, it is a matter of equity because homosexual couples 
are not given the same treatment as heterosexual couples, and 
the only difference between the two is sexual orientation. 
Parliament must therefore encourage the government to take the 
measures necessary to put an end to this discrimination against 
same sex couples.
<P>
	In turn, this stand for justice and equity may well prompt the 
public to exhibit a more positive attitude in terms of respecting 
differences, something we really need in our society if we want 
it to be a better place, with less violence and hatred.
<P>
	This motion does not ask for the recognition of special rights, 
but for the enforcement of the right to equality. That is why I 
urge this House to vote for the motion put forward by my hon. 
colleague from Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (St. Paul's, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to speak to this motion which 
calls on the government to take the necessary measures for the 
legal recognition of same sex spouses.
<P>
	I commend my colleague from Hochelaga-Maisonneuve for 
his initiative in bringing up this issue; it is timely and 
exceedingly important.
<P>
	Before I discuss my views on the question I state clearly and 
unequivocally I reject the suggestion this debate is blasphemy or 
that those who would promote equality are part of some 
conspiracy to kidnap our children.
<P>
	In due course the government will have to address this issue. 
The precious moments of private members' business at the end 
of each day provide an opportunity for us to express our personal 
views, and I am pleased to do so.
<P>
	I have spoken in the House in support of the hate crimes 
provisions of Bill C-41 and in support of amending the 
Canadian Human Rights Act. I have encouraged my colleagues 
on all sides of the House to support these initiatives. I have 
supported them because these initiatives are the right and decent 
thing to do as Canadians.
<P>
	Amending the Canadian Human Rights Act is a matter of 
fundamental justice and equality. The goal of the act is not to 
confer special rights on anyone but rather to ensure equal rights 
for everyone. The measures we have taken in Bill C-41, the 
proposed amendments of the human rights act when they are 
introduced, are totally consistent with the commitment we have 
as Liberals and as Canadians to attack hatred and discrimination 
and promote tolerance.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	I am pleased that in its ruling last Thursday the Supreme 
Court of Canada unanimously agreed that sexual orientation 
should be read into section 15 of the charter, thus barring 
discrimination against gays and lesbians. It is an important step 
toward full equality for all members of Canadian society.
<P>
	On the thornier issue, the more difficult issue of extending 
benefits to same sex couples living together, the court was split. 
It will soon be up to us as legislators to decide what actions we 
should take as we consider the question in the debate today and 
in the weeks ahead.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13156"> 13156 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to make it clear that extending recognition to 
non-traditional relationships is not an attempt to undermine the 
family, but it is rather an effort to recognize today's realities 
and to end discrimination. Traditional families remain the 
majority and a fundamental building block of society. But we 
cannot ignore that there are different types of family units that 
exist today.
<P>
	In response to a question put forward by the member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve dealing with the Egan and Nesbit 
supreme court ruling and the extension of same sex benefits, the 
Minister of Justice expressed views before the Standing 
Committee on Human Rights and the Status of Disabled Persons 
to the following effect. When we talk about extending benefits 
we should be looking at relationships and dependency instead of 
exclusively sexual criteria to define those relationships. We 
should be thinking of a brother and sister living together, a son 
taking care of an elderly mother, a mother taking care of an adult 
daughter, and other types of relationships where adults depend 
on each other emotionally and financially. And there are many 
such cases in this complex society.
<P>
	I think the Minister of Justice has put forward an interesting 
and innovative proposition, and I would be ready to support that 
position. However, I must stress that we have no immediate 
intention of introducing such legislation. We must engage in a 
full cost analysis and we must have a full debate in the House.
<P>
	I want to add that the benefits we need to consider granting to 
partners in non-traditional relationships go beyond monetary 
ones. Even if the government has yet to put same sex 
relationships on an equal footing with more traditional ones, I 
firmly believe that measures should be taken to prevent 
incidents of discrimination in the workplace and we should be 
looking seriously at bereavement leave and family care leave to 
same sex partners.
<P>
	Ironically, while we as elected officials are anxious to provide 
leadership on these issues, it is the courts and the private sector 
who are doing so, doing the right and courageous things by 
protecting the rights of all Canadians.
<P>
	In its 1994 annual report the Canadian Human Rights 
Commission listed major private institutions offering such 
arrangements, firms such as BC-Tel, Hudson's Bay Company, 
Northern Telecom, Southam Publishing, Shell Canada, Levi 
Strauss, Toronto Sun Publishing Corporation, Dow Chemical, 
and the Toronto Dominion Bank. Canada Post entered into an 
agreement with the Canadian Union of Postal Workers that 
would provide same sex benefits for its 52,000 members.
<P>
	I think the Human Rights Commissioner expressed it best 
when he said in reference to these corporations: ``All of this 
should deliver a simple message. Institutions of this sort are not 
wild-eyed reformers. They are not interested in endorsing 
certain lifestyles or  debating the meaning of the word spouse. 
They are changing their practices to bring them into line with the 
intent of the charter, provincial law and a growing body of 
jurisprudence''. And I might add, to bring them into consistency 
with reality.
<P>
	As I conclude and I look at the clock, it may be 1805 to some 
members of the House, but on this side of the House it is 1995. 
Discrimination, bigotry, ignorance persist. One of my goals as 
an elected member of Parliament is to work toward ending all 
forms of discrimination. In that effort, I invite the help of my 
colleagues on both sides of the House. This is not an Ozzie and 
Harriet world, however much we might wish it would be. I look 
forward to working with hon. members on both sides of the 
House on these important issues.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this, in my opinion, is the most important piece of private 
members' business presently before the House. There is no more 
pressing issue facing the House than in what direction we as 
parliamentarians want to take the morality of the country.
<P>
<B>(1805 ) </B>
<P>
	Our actions as parliamentarians have consequences. We must 
take extreme care not to subvert institutions that form the fabric 
of our society and way of life. This motion would do just that. 
That is why I am strongly, unreservedly, and unapologetically 
speaking against it. That is why, as an elected representative of 
the families of my riding, I will fight against any move by this or 
any government to subvert or undermine traditional family 
values. The family is the very building block of our society, not 
individuals, because individuals alone cannot maintain and 
sustain our country, only families can. It is in this defence of the 
family, the most important and basic union of all, that I give this 
speech.
<P>
	I am one of those not so rare people who believe that law is 
about morality. I believe it is impossible to separate law and 
morality. All laws are either based on or express a fundamental 
view of ordering of human relations. That, whether we like it or 
not, is morality.
<P>
	I am also one of those people who believe that a liberal 
democratic society founded upon rights requires a certain kind 
of moral grounding if it hopes to function. Therefore, if you are 
like me and you accept these premises, then you must also 
accept the conclusion that government must not pass laws that 
threaten the morality upon which fundamental structures of our 
society are built. It is not only undemocratic, it is dangerous. 
Government must serve its citizens. It must respect and promote 
the morality that is the consensus of its citizens. It must not 
attack it. It must not threaten it. It must rarely seek to change it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13157"> 13157 </A></B>
<P>
	This government does not agree with me. The government 
and the hon. member from the Bloc who sponsored today's 
motion think that it is the role of government to subvert the 
consensually accepted morality of our society, not universally 
accepted, of course, as no single moral rule is ever universally 
accepted, but consensually accepted.
<P>
	Poll after poll show that Canadians are overwhelmingly 
opposed to changing the definition of family to include 
homosexual unions. People are overwhelmingly opposed to 
giving homosexual unions moral and legal parity with the union 
that sustains our country and sustains our species, that of man 
and woman. Canadians are overwhelmingly opposed to giving 
in to the vocal if irrational demands of the 2 per cent of the 
population who think that sexual preference does not matter 
when talking about family. However, that does not stop the gay 
rights ideologues and the radical attackers of the family from 
shamelessly promoting their narrow special interest cause.
<P>
	Our Supreme Court is waiting for the House to make its 
decision on the family. It is waiting for a message from the 
House. The message my colleague from the Bloc wants to send 
is that there is no morality, that Canadian law should promote 
homosexuality, and that the traditional male-female union is not 
the best model of a family history could ever devise. He is 
wrong, and I hope that the motion and any other laws like it are 
stopped before the moral fabric of the country is rent apart by 
narrow interests' societal engineering.
<P>
	A respected professor of political history and human rights at 
Claremont College in California has said that the gay rights 
movement is the most radical and sinister challenge to emerge to 
not just sexual morality but to all morality. He did not say that 
lightly or flippantly, and neither do I. Morality, the structured 
relations of humans with one another, is based on our natural 
affinities. It is based upon the fact that we are all human. Human 
rights are just that: rights that are based upon our common 
natural humanity.
<P>
	Nature is the basis of all humanity. It must be. Convention is 
not enough. Common agreement is not enough. This is a bond to 
break down in the face of opposition. Morality is, has been, and 
always will be based on our natural condition as fellow members 
of the human race, dedicated to self-preservation and the good 
functioning of our communities.
<P>
	Allow me to cite Professor Jaffa again, because he puts this 
argument so well. The reason we regard the killing of people as a 
personal and societal wrong is because we share a common 
nature. The reason we regard the enslavement of people as 
wrong and not the enslavement of cattle, for example, is because 
we share a common nature with people. That commonality, 
which is the basis of all morality, is grounded in nature.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	Homosexuality, to anyone who has not been brainwashed by 
the last decade of effective propaganda by the gay lobby, is 
unnatural. It is a repudiation of nature. Nature requires 
procreation. Morality must defend the continuation of 
humanity. Rights must protect those things that promote the 
continuation of our country and of our species. Homosexuality 
does none of these things. Homosexuality is nihilistic. It 
protects nothing, it defends nothing, it continues nothing, and it 
sustains nothing.
<P>
	The call for so-called gay rights is an example of an extreme 
repudiation of nature, an extreme repudiation of morality, an 
extreme repudiation of every ground upon which we base human 
rights. There lies the irony and there lies the tragedy of the 
project our justice minister and his colleagues are embarking on 
in Bill C-41 and the amendments to the Canadian Human Rights 
Act. There lies the tragedy of the failure of our highest court to 
firmly and unequivocally defend morality. There lies the 
tragedy of this government's apparent unwillingness to send a 
strong message to the courts about the need to protect the family.
<P>
	Canadians agree with me that we need to protect the family 
because Canadians have more sense possibly than the justice 
minister, more sense than my colleague from the Bloc, more 
sense than my colleague from Burnaby-Kingsway. Canadians 
understand the importance of the family and of the necessity of 
natural relationships to our society.
<P>
	Canadians may not have the fancy rhetoric or the well 
practised if wrong headed arguments of the gay lobby, but they 
do have common sense. They have the lessons of history, and 
that is what this House should be defending and representing.
<P>
	Governments have defined the family as a man and a woman 
because that works and because we need that sort of family. It is 
not because we want to punish someone for not choosing that 
lifestyle but because we want to reward those who do. We confer 
benefits upon that kind of union because it provides benefits for 
us. We have protected that sort of family because it protects our 
children and ultimately us.
<P>
	We legally recognize the natural family because we want to 
promote it. We as a society have the right to defend and protect 
those institutions that benefit our society. We are under no 
obligation to protect and codify into law unions or lifestyles that 
confer no societal benefit. And when there is damage that will be 
inevitably done to our society and to our shared collective 
morality by the legal recognition and therefore promotion of 
homosexuality, we are under no obligation to recognize that 
lifestyle under law, none whatsoever. We are, however, under an 
obligation to protect the family from attacks by special 
interests.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13158"> 13158 </A></B>
<P>
	Let me finish by saying that I have never in my experience, 
inside or outside of this House, heard anyone call for active 
discrimination against individual homosexuals. No doubt some 
will build strawman arguments by suggesting that the 
opponents of the legal recognition of homosexual unions are 
in favour of this. That is pure nonsense and pure fear 
mongering. That is up to individuals. However, when someone 
who prefers living a certain lifestyle that demands of me as a 
citizen and a legislator that I codify government support for the 
union that lifestyle spawns, then they are asking for me to 
approve of, promote, and support that lifestyle. They are asking 
for my sanction on that union.
<P>
	As someone who is dedicated to Canada and to the families of 
Canada, you can count me out. I will not support any measure in 
law that attempts to make homosexual unions and natural 
families equal. My constituents have spoken loud and clear. I, 
unlike some members of this House, including the justice 
minister, have been listening.
<P>
	I encourage all Canadians from all over this country to start a 
campaign. I urge all Canadians, in the name of the preservation 
of our families, to let your MP, the justice minister, and the 
Prime Minister know how you feel about the preservation of the 
family. Stand up for what works in our country. Stand up for the 
family. Fight back with common sense against motions of this 
nature.
<P>
	I urge all hon. colleagues to defeat this motion.
<P>
<B>(1815 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to look at the exact wording of this motion. I have been 
listening to people going off on tangents talking about things 
that are absolutely irrelevant to the motion before the House 
today. The motion states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should take the measures 
necessary for the legal recognition of same sex spouses.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	There is no such thing in this country at the present time as a 
same sex spouse. Spouses are heterosexual. Spouses are 
husband and wife either legally married or common law. That is 
the legal fact in this country now. The words of the motion are 
simply incorrect to begin with. At best the motion should 
perhaps read: ``That, in the opinion of this House the 
government should take the measures necessary for the legal 
recognition of same sex couples''.
<P>
	What the mover of the motion wants is that same sex couples 
be given legal recognition. How? By being called spouses. What 
does that mean? It means this motion is calling for this House to 
recognize two people of the same sex to be legally married. 
There is absolutely no other possible interpretation of this 
motion.
<P>
	The motion calls for the legal recognition of same sex 
spouses. We cannot recognize same sex spouses legally unless 
we declare them spouses. The only way to declare them spouses 
is to marry them. There is absolutely no  question at all about 
what this motion is calling upon Parliament to do. I do not care 
how they try to pretend it does not do this, the words themselves 
say it. They want this House to declare homosexual unions as 
legal marriages.
<P>
	What do my constituents say about that proposition? It just so 
happens I have asked my constituents that very question. I want 
to read one of the questions I asked them. I will not read them all 
because I want to keep my comments relevant to the motion we 
are discussing, unlike some people who have spoken here. The 
question was: Do you want same sex marriages to be legally 
recognized as the equivalent of heterosexual marriages-pretty 
straightforward-including the right to sponsor same sex 
spouses or fiancés for immigration purposes? The answer was 
crystal clear: 84 per cent of my constituents said no; 13 per cent 
said yes; and 3 per cent were undecided. Eighty-four per cent.
<P>
	In my respectful submission, there is no poll that could be 
taken anywhere in this country that would deviate from those 
numbers significantly. That is simply a fact. My constituents do 
not want homosexual unions to be recognized as marriages.
<P>
	It has nothing to do with fear. It has nothing to do with hate. It 
has nothing to do with equality. It has nothing to do with 
homophobia. It has to do with promoting and giving advantage 
to that which promotes and gives advantage to society.
<P>
	People have talked about inequality. I stand here as a white 
male. I admit it and I make no apologies for the fact I was born a 
male or that I was born a Caucasian. That is the way I am. The 
fact is that everyone in this country is equal under the law. The 
charter of rights and freedoms provides that everyone is equal 
under the law. There is not a criminal matter, there is nothing 
that I am entitled to as a matter of law that no one else is entitled 
to.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	There is often a distinction made or a distinction tried to be 
played between a right and a benefit. A benefit is not a right. No 
matter how we call it, no matter how we try to disguise it, a 
benefit will never become a right. One is not entitled to it as a 
matter of right; one is entitled to it after meeting certain criteria.
<P>
	The debate then has to be as to what kind of benefits we want 
to give to what kind of people. We can talk about that as much as 
we want but not under the rubric, at least not with logic, of this 
motion. This motion is not talking about benefits. This motion is 
not talking about equality. This motion is talking plainly and 
simply about asking this Parliament to legally recognize same 
sex unions as a marriage because there is no other way to legally 
recognize same sex spouses.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13159"> 13159 </A></B>
<P>
	I repeat that someone cannot be a spouse unless he or she 
is married. The only way to recognize same sex spouses is to 
recognize the legality of the marriage of same sex spouses. Why 
should we not do that?
<P>
	The Supreme Court has spoken and four of the judges, 
including the chief justice, had a few interesting comments to 
make. I wish to quote directly from the decision. I am talking 
about marriage. That is what we are talking about in this motion.
<P>
	The decision states: ``Suffice it to say that marriage has from 
time immemorial been firmly grounded in our legal tradition, 
one that is itself a reflection of longstanding philosophical and 
religious traditions. But its ultimate raison d'être transcends all 
of these and is firmly anchored in the biological and social 
realities that heterosexual couples have the unique ability to 
procreate, that most children are the product of these 
relationships and that they are generally cared for and nurtured 
by those who live in that relationship. In this sense'', say these 
justices of the Supreme Court, ``marriage is by nature 
heterosexual''.
<P>
	The decision goes on: ``It would be possible to legally define 
marriage to include homosexual couples'', which is what this 
motion wants. Yes, it would be possible but this would not 
change the biological and social realities that underlie the 
traditional marriage. We can call a homosexual union what we 
want but it is not a marriage. That is what this particular motion 
wants.
<P>
	The court then went on to consider that it is perfectly 
legitimate in Canadian society for Canadian society to promote 
the traditional heterosexual biological family. There is nothing 
wrong in doing that and it is not discrimination according to the 
justices.
<P>
	Why not? I quote again from the judgment: ``The singling out 
of legally married and common law couples as the recipients of 
benefits necessarily excludes all sorts of other couples living 
together, such as brothers and sisters or other relatives 
regardless of sex and others who are not related, whatever 
reasons these other couples may have for doing so and whatever 
their sexual orientation''. Of course it excludes them if we are 
promoting the traditional family.
<P>
	The court goes on to say: ``Homosexual couples, it is true, 
differ from other excluded couples in that their relationship 
includes a sexual aspect, but this sexual aspect has nothing to do 
with the social objectives for which Parliament affords a 
measure of support to married couples and those who live in a 
common law relationship. In a word, the distinction made by 
Parliament is grounded in a social relationship, a social unit that 
is fundamental to society and that is the heterosexual biological 
traditional family''.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	The court states homosexual couples are not therefore 
discriminated against, that is to say when society provides 
benefits to the heterosexual couples. They are simply included 
with other types of couples such as brothers and  sisters, 
boyfriend and girlfriend, two sisters living together who are also 
excluded. The court specifically said, at least four of the judges, 
that there was no discrimination.
<P>
	My constituents have spoken clearly no matter how one 
pretends to hide what this motion means; it means House of 
Commons, declare homosexual unions, marriages under the 
laws of Canada.
<P>
	My constituents have said no. I say no.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the debate on the motion tabled by the 
hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, asking the 
government to take the measures necessary for the legal 
recognition of same sex spouses.
<P>
	I listened carefully to the comments of many members who 
oppose the motion. I think we have to put things in their proper 
context. The fact is that there are same sex couples engaged in a 
relation which is in every way similar to that of heterosexual 
couples.
<P>
	That is the reality. And it is a reality which we must respect, 
primarily because these are human beings engaged in an 
emotional relationship. These people also happen to be citizens 
who have a right to enjoy the same benefits as any other 
Canadian, and that includes the provisions of the Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms, which I will discuss later on.
<P>
	It is essential to keep the notion of respect in mind, otherwise 
we quickly fall into stereotyping, an attitude which, for 
centuries, has had the effect of marginalizing and stigmatizing 
same sex couples. The time has come to put an end to that in 
Canada.
<P>
	In our country, same sex relations were decriminalized in 
1968. Consequently, the issue that we are discussing today does 
not fall under the Criminal Code. It is absolutely unfair, 
demagogic and unacceptable to assimilate the lives of people 
engaged in same sex relationships to those of people engaged in 
sexual deviations prohibited in the Criminal Code.
<P>
	In 1968, under Prime Minister Trudeau and justice minister 
Turner, homosexual relations stopped being considered a crime 
in Canada. We are talking about relations which are accepted in 
our society, which are not criminal in any way, and which are 
experienced by Canadian citizens.
<P>
	These Canadians are also entitled to the benefits of the 1982 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom. As you know, the 
charter prohibits discrimination, specifically discrimination 
based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, 
age or mental or physical disability. I think that sexual 
orientation falls into the same category as the grounds listed in 
section 15 of the charter.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="13160"> 13160 </A></B>
<P>
	In today's society, same sex spouses can use section 15 of 
the charter of rights and freedoms to put a stop to any 
discrimination against them. I believe that the latest decision 
made by the Supreme Court in this area, the Egan decision, 
recognized that fact. It indicated that discrimination based on 
sexual orientation is similar to all the other types of 
discrimination mentioned in section 15 of the charter.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	Now, could any breach of the charter be justified? I do not 
think so. As you know, pursuant to some provisions in the 
charter, under some circumstances, some types of 
discrimination can be accepted, but I do not think it would apply 
to homosexuals, because we do not see how it could be justified.
<P>
	Why could discrimination based on religion, race, colour or 
age be prohibited, but discrimination based on sexual 
orientation allowed, when homosexuality has not been illegal in 
Canada since 1968? Of course, there is some opposition to this 
motion, as we heard from some of the previous speakers, but I 
think some members are mixing everything up and are raising 
issues which have nothing to do with the motion put forward by 
my colleague, the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.
<P>
	They talk about family and marriage. In the motion before the 
House, we are not trying to redefine family or marriage. We are 
only trying to put a stop to the discrimination against same sex 
spouses in Canada. My colleague is not asking Parliament to 
recognize that two individuals of the same sex who live as a 
couple constitute a family. He is not asking Parliament to decide 
if they are married or not. This issue may be debated at another 
time, but the object of today's motion is only to recognize that 
two homosexuals having a stable relationship can enjoy the 
same benefits the Canadian government and Canadian 
legislation give to legally married spouses or common law 
partners.
<P>
	While listening to the previous speakers, I realized that the 
arguments they used must be the same arguments that came up 
during the debates over the Divorce Act or other bills granting 
benefits to common law spouses. They would have said that we 
are attacking the family and the whole concept of marriage, but 
that is not the case.
<P>
	Obviously, the legislation concerning divorce in Canada and 
giving some benefits to common law spouses have in no way 
undermined the concept of family in Canada. I see that my time 
is up. I hope I will be able to complete my speech during the 
third hour of debate on this motion.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hon. member for 
Jonquière is absolutely right. Next time the motion tabled by the 
hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve is called, he will 
have the opportunity to complete his remarks in the third hour of 
debate.
<P>
	The hour provided for the consideration of Private Members' 
Business has now expired. Pursuant to Standing Order 93, the 
order is dropped to the bottom of the order of precedence on the 
Order Paper.

<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THEENVIRONMENT">THE ENVIRONMENT</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
because of the amendments to the clean water act recently 
passed by the United States house of representatives and in light 
of a recent study identifying Canadian and American sources of 
dioxins, furans and hexachlorobenzenes which are making their 
way into the Great Lakes, on May 19 I asked the Minister of the 
Environment what action is being taken to ensure water quality 
of the Great Lakes.
<P>
	The study I am referring to is by Dr. Barry Commoner, at the 
Centre for the Biology of Natural Systems in Flushing, New 
York. He warns about dioxins and dioxin like compounds 
because they are highly toxic chemicals produced by industrial 
processes and waste incineration.
<P>
	These processes have been linked with cancer and are 
believed to interfere with the reproductive capacities of many 
species. Scientists warn also that dioxins contribute to the rising 
levels of breast and testicular cancer and declining sperm counts 
in humans.
<P>
	From the report we learned that the vast majority of the dioxin 
deposited in the Great Lakes originates in the United States. We 
also learned incineration of medical waste accounts for 51 per 
cent of all airborne dioxin entering the lakes. Municipal waste 
incinerators account for some 24 per cent and cement kilns 
burning hazardous waste account for 4.9 per cent.
<P>
	Research into dioxin exposure in Canada by researchers at 
Boston University's School of Public Health suggests there is no 
safe limit of exposure to these toxic chemicals.
<P>
	In light of Dr. Commoner's findings and recommendations 
from the international joint commission in its fifth biennial 
report on Great Lakes water quality urging action to stop the 
inflow of persistent toxic substances into the Great Lakes, I ask 
the minister's parliamentary secretary whether he can inform 
the House what the Government of Canada intends to do with 
respect to this very serious matter. Does the government intend 
to negotiate a reduction of dioxin emissions in the U.S. under the 
Canada-U.S. air quality accord?
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="13161"> 13161 </A></B>
<P>
	Measures are needed which will protect the health of 
Canadians and North American ecosystems. I look forward to 
the parliamentary secretary's reply.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I share the hon. member's deep concern about dioxins 
and furans. They are a proven and very important source of 
cancer. The sources of dioxins and furans are several: municipal 
incinerators, waste incinerators, effluence from steel mills and 
pulp mills.
<P>
	The big problem is that under our main legislation dealing 
with toxic substances, the Canadian Environmental Protection 
Act, we have dealt with dioxins and furans with regard to plant 
effluence; however, we have not dealt with air emissions with 
regard to dioxins and furans.
<P>
	The Standing Committee on the Environment and Sustainable 
Development is now reviewing the Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act. It is my fervent hope that under the leadership of 
the chairman of the committee we will recommend to the 
government air emissions be included within the CEPA as soon 
as possible.
<P>
	With respect to the air quality accord with the United States, 
the accord effectively provides for a mutual commitment 
between the two countries to monitor and control air flows with 
regard to air pollution. I commit myself to raising this matter as 
soon as possible with the Minister of the Environment to see 
what can be done under the air quality accord with the United 
States.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38, the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
have been adopted. Accordingly, the House stands adjourned 
until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.38 p.m.)
