questionable and I would ask that it be reviewed.

Basically, both amendments are aimed at making sure the complete 
text of the Rome Statute is incorporated into the schedule to 
the bill, whereas currently only two articles are incorporated 
in the bill as it now stands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These two motions were supposedly found out of order because the 
amendments went beyond the scope of the bill. 
I find it difficult to understand how the amendments go beyond 
the scope of the bill as they are aimed at incorporating the 
whole statute when some parts of it are already incorporated 
into the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The true aim of these amendments is to circulate the text of the 
Rome Statute so that citizens may learn what it is all about 
when they read the act, as is the case with other implementing 
acts which include the text of the Geneva conventions, for 
instance, or of the treaties on antipersonnel mines or the 
nuclear test ban, which were recently passed by this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the Chair to review the decision and rule in order two of 
the amendments aimed at incorporating the complete text of the 
Rome Statute in Bill C-19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> At this time I would like 
to take the point of order raised by the member under advisement 
and we will get back to him on that very soon.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Madam Speaker, we have noticed that some of the clauses 
which are the subject of the amendments you just read cannot be 
found in several pieces of legislation recently passed by the 
House of Commons to implement international conventions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in the Anti-Personnel Mines Convention 
Implementation Act and in the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban 
Treaty Implementation Act, it says at the beginning that a 
particular minister is designated by the governor in council to 
administer the act and that it is possible for that minister to 
delegate this responsibility to another minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Implementation Act, 
there is also a provision that was added, at our request, to 
take into account the way in which Australia fulfilled its 
obligations under that convention, provision whereby the 
minister was required to submit an annual report on the 
application of the act in order to inform the people about how 
the act was administered and how it allowed the country to 
fulfil its obligations under the treaty to which it had become a 
party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the reason why amendments such as these could not only 
be useful, but could also give more consistency to the various 
implementation bills this Parliament is called upon to pass so 
that Canada's international obligations under the treaties to 
which it becomes a party are fulfilled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am calling here for a certain degree of consistency in our 
treaty implementation legislation, a consistency which is 
lacking and which the House should reflect upon more deeply 
since we do not seem to be able to have the same legislative 
practices whether we are dealing with the anti-personnel mines 
convention or, in this case, with the Rome Statute of the 
International Criminal Court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments would improve the bill and give more 
consistency to our treaty implementation legislation.

everybody respects his opinions as an international law

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The importance of establishing the international criminal court 
literally cannot be overstated.  The court is a legacy of the 
Nuremberg war trials which came out of the ashes of the Holocaust 
and the second world war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all aware of the depths of horror that the 20th century 
brought to millions and millions of our fellow human beings on 
this planet.  There have been forced famines, genocides, mass 
expulsions, mass rapes, that horrible term ethnic cleansing, and 
every war crime one could imagine.  Those who commit those crimes 
from now on must be held accountable to humanity. 
People who do these things must no longer be able to hide 
anywhere on the face of the earth.  In order for the 
international criminal court to be created, 60 nations must 
ratify this proposal before December of this year.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many members of the House have recognized the importance and the 
urgency of ratifying the international criminal court and 
actively urge other nations to follow suit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Human rights NGOs have echoed repeatedly the urgency of passing 
the bill at committee hearings.  I would like to commend in 
particular the members for Mount Royal, Burnaby—Douglas and our 
colleague from Mercier for their unequivocal commitment to seeing 
the establishment of the court and the timely adoption of this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I also commend the members of the foreign affairs committee 
and in particular the chair, the hon. member for Toronto 
Centre—Rosedale, who played a most productive, thoughtful and 
constructive role at the committee. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Beauharnois—Salaberry is very much aware of 
that because he was fully involved maybe more than any other 
member in the committee hearings and he knows that the committee 
heard a lot of testimony. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It passed 18 amendments as a result of suggestions from members 
of all parties, including the hon. member's own party.  I 
understand it was a most non-partisan, collaborative and 
satisfying process such that the chair referred to it in the 
House the other day.  He said, “I should like to take one minute 
and share an observation with the House.  It is often said that 
in committee time is not given to study bills properly and to 
amend them.  I urge members of the House to have a look at the 
many amendments which were made to this bill with the 
co-operation of all members”.  The member for 
Beauharnois—Salaberry expressed his satisfaction with the 
process calling it “une expérience tout à fait extraordinaire”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore a surprise, although it is perfectly proper as 
the member knows, to see a further 20 amendments at report stage, 
possibly knowing it would delay passage of the bill while there 
are only a very critical few days left in the House before 
adjournment.  I would submit that the amendments are either 
identical or similar to those considered thoroughly at the 
committee stage, or more relevant to the hon. member's personal 
interest, the role of parliament in treaty implementation. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, we were surprised on this side of the House to see the 
hon. member submit so many amendments this morning. It must be 
clear that the government cannot accept any of these amendments. 
I must also clarify something: I mentioned that 60 countries 
must approve the treaty; this is a ratification issue. Sixty 
countries must ratify the treaty before it can come into effect.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to speak to Bill C-19 and the 
various amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is very important for all of us. As has been indicated 
it relates to the implementation of Canada's obligations under 
the Rome statute regarding the international criminal court. 
This bill would certainly make it an offence to commit genocide, 
a crime against humanity, or a war crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look around today we see so many examples of war crimes 
and atrocities being committed that this is a certainly an area 
we have to pay strict attention to.  Human life is our most 
valuable resource and asset. We see crimes being committed 
against humanity, against children, women and quite often 
innocent bystanders of war. This is an area that we have to 
seriously look at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at the background of this situation, it was in July 1998 
that 160 nations decided in Rome to establish a permanent 
international criminal court.  This was a big move forward in 
terms of looking after the interests of mankind and protecting 
humanity.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill deals with the implementation of Canada's obligations 
and indeed is very important.  Canada has been a strong proponent 
for the establishment of the international criminal court. It has 
often been suggested that our poor record at home in prosecuting 
suspected war criminals is something to look at closely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We certainly support implementing our obligations. With respect 
to the amendments, I support my hon. colleague from the Bloc 
Quebecois concerning the necessity of an annual report.  I 
believe that is in Motion No. 7. An annual report is important 
because it brings about accountability and transparency.  It is 
the record and way of informing the public as to what we are 
doing on issues.  We know how very important annual reports are 
so we support the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not speak to the amendments tabled today because we have 
not had the opportunity to study them.  However, certainly we 
would support anything that helps or alleviates some of the 
suffering we see as a result of war crimes, and brings about a 
fair process to deal with that kind of situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an aside, we talk about war crimes and define them in terms 
of genocide and various acts and atrocities.  In the whole 
process of war and our involvement, when we send our troops 
abroad into the battlefield, we have to have a much broader 
definition of what is criminal, what really can be “criminal” 
when it comes to how we treat our own people who defend our 
shores. In a lot of instances we have to draw our attention to 
what we ourselves do by way of supporting or not supporting our 
troops when they are on missions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing which I think is a very serious “crime”. 
When a soldier who has dedicated and devoted his life to our 
country goes off to war and he is concerned about taking a 
vaccine that could harm him because of problems with that 
vaccine, he faces a court martial.  The individual has to go 
through the strain, stress and turmoil of a court martial.  It 
places stress on him, his family and others close to him.  There 
are the costs involved.  When he is successful and a judge 
pronounces that something has been done wrong and his rights have 
been violated, then the government sees fit to institute an 
appeal against that decision and the individual is put through 
further turmoil, strife, pain and suffering. This to me is a 
crime in itself and is something we have to look at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot talk about being concerned about war crimes and what 
happens in other parts of the world when here at home we put our 
own people through what can be truly described as a criminal 
experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With those comments I conclude my remarks.  When we look at 
these things I urge that we truly consider what we are saying and 
where we are coming from in our own hearts and minds.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak today on Bill C-19, an act respecting genocide, 
crimes against humanity and ward crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party supports and applauds this 
excellent initiative by the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I should like to congratulate the members of the 
standing committee on foreign affairs, who all worked together 
on this initiative without any needless party politics. 
Moreover, the committee report was tabled this week and all 
members are, I believe, pleased with the way it has turned out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much can be said about this bill.  I believe it would be 
advisable to review the main thrust of Bill C-19.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of Bill C-19 is to implement Canada's obligations 
under the Rome Statute, adopted by the United Nations Diplomatic 
Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Establishment of an 
International Criminal Court, the ICC, on July 17, 1998. In 
order to have a clear understanding of this bill, it is 
important to first of all have a clear understanding of the 
objective and scope of the Rome Statute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Statute was approved in July 1998 by 120 countries and will 
come into existence after ratification by the parliaments of 60 
states.  The ICC will be the first permanent international instance 
mandated to investigate the most serious of crimes under 
international law: genocide, crimes against humanity, and war 
crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud.  It was high time for Canada to show some leadership 
by ensuring that the authors of these horrible crimes are 
charged and punished.  With so many lives lost, the 
international community should work together in order to do 
something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill C-19 Canada joins forces with the numerous countries, 
which are taking the necessary steps to integrate the Rome 
Statute with their national legislation.  Although nine states 
have already ratified the Statute, it is a source of pride to 
the Progressive Conservatives Party that Canada is one of the 
first to enact legislation to implement the Rome Statute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Department of Justice there are presently in 
Canada 400 people that are deemed to have been involved in war 
crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is totally unacceptable that those war criminals could 
quietly live as if nothing had happened. Canada does not want to 
be recognized as a haven for war criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The clock was ticking. The international community had to get 
together to develop a permanent organization having all the 
powers to fulfil it's obligations. We could not ignore the 
atrocities committed in some countries under the guise of war 
any more. It was too easy, and unfortunately, the previous system 
of ad hoc tribunals was not very efficient. Being a permanent 
organization, the ICC will be able to fulfil its mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 4 of the bill states that every person who commits 
genocide, a crime against humanity or a war crime is guilty of 
an indictable offence. The definition of those three terms is 
based on sections 6, 7 and 8 of the Rome Statute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an addition to the criminal code since every person 
convicted of one of these offences is sentenced to life 
emprisonement if their crime was intentional. In all other 
cases, that person is liable to life imprisonment.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These measures would apply to offences committed in Canada and 
would allow the government to bring an action against the 
perpetrators or to extradite them so that they can be judged by 
the ICC. As I have already said, it is a real improvement 
because it was very difficult for the Department of Justice to 
prosecute war criminals who had found refuge in Canada because 
of the court's decision in the Finta case that we have already 
talked about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is however an element on which I would like to come back, 
and it is the defence argument of obedience to the orders of a 
superior. 
It will be remembered that in his client's defence, Mr. Finta's 
lawyer argued correctly that, under the criminal code, the 
defence of obedience to a superior's orders was available to 
members of the military or police forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From now on this kind of defence will no longer be available, 
except under international law. These provisions were necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another feature of the bill is its retroactivity. Some expressed 
reservations about this. Nevertheless, I want to congratulate 
the minister and the committee on their work. In most cases, the 
events in question occurred as far back as the second world war 
or during conflicts prior to the signing of the Rome Statute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One must be realistic. 
Since most of the events date back more than 50 years, it is 
becoming increasingly difficult to find the individuals who 
perpetrated war crimes or crimes against humanity, especially 
under the nazi regime. Moreover, justice department officials 
had difficulty finding witnesses to those events to justify the 
extradition. If the bill had not applied retroactively, it would 
not have made sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-19 is fairly complete, as it gives jurisdiction to 
Canadian courts in the case of offences committed outside Canada 
through clause 8. This clause also recognizes that Canadian 
courts have the authority to prosecute any person charged with 
having committed specific acts, providing one of the conditions 
listed exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Bill C-19, Canada now has an obligation to 
surrender people caught by the ICC for genocide, crimes against 
humanity and war crimes. I could say a lot more about the need 
for such a bill, but in conclusion I will mention that victims 
of war have suffered terrible ordeals, and through Bill C-19 
Canada takes the position that no war criminal is safe or 
welcome within our borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This position has the support of Canadians and the Progressive 
Conservative Party. We do not want our great country to serve as 
a haven for war criminals.

implementation bill like Bill C-19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that Canada could become one of the main advocates of 
the statute in the international community to convince 50 other 
states to ratify the Rome Statute. So far, ten nations, one 
very recently, have ratified the statute. We need 50 more 
countries to pass similar legislation so that the statute can 
come into force and the International criminal court can start 
to operate, try and, if need be, sentence people found guilty of 
serious crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide or war crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently the Bloc fully supports the bill and, with my 
colleagues from Mercier and Laval Centre, we co-operated in the 
work of the committee to improve the bill. However, there is 
still room for improvement. 
That is the object of some of our amendments at report stage. 
Incidentally, we had made our intentions known in this regard in 
committee.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the secretary of state's surprise, but is it not 
appropriate sometimes for the opposition to surprise the 
government? It always has so many surprises in store for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, we wanted to propose a few amendments to further 
improve the bill. I will call the members' attention to two of 
those amendments for the purposes of this debate and, most 
likely, for the purposes of the arguments that may take be 
raised before the courts that will be called upon to enforce 
this legislation, prosecute and eventually convict the authors 
of such serious crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 5, which amends clause 8 of the bill, would give 
Canadian courts extended universal jurisdiction in the case of 
serious international crimes such as those covered by Bill C-19. 
In this bill, universal jurisdiction is limited in scope because 
there has to be some kind of connection with regard to the 
nationality of the victim or the accused, or to the person who, 
during an armed conflict, committed a war crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the connection to the territory since a person 
cannot be accused if he or she is not present in Canada. 
We would like to see this notion of custodian jurisdiction 
extended so that Canada has the power to request the extradition 
of a person for prosecution under this bill, a power countries 
such as Belgium and Switzerland seem to have already assumed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like the universal jurisdiction recognized in Bill C-19 
to be wider in scope, so that Canada can stop being a haven for 
war criminals and become a place where these people are brought 
to justice. If Canada gave its courts extended universal 
jurisdiction, compared to what is provided for in Bill C-19 as it 
stands now, Canada would be in a position where it would meet 
its international commitments better than any other country and 
where it would show its desire not to let serious international 
crimes go unpunished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another provision that we would wish to see amended. It 
would involve adding to this bill a new clause, clause 11.1, 
which would very explicitly recognize that, if a foreign head of 
state or government or member of a government, or even a member 
of parliament, is on Canadian territory and could be brought to 
trial, this person would not be able to rely on immunity before 
the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make this clear, we could give the example of General 
Pinochet who, if he were on Canadian territory, could be brought 
to trial, but could perhaps claim some immunity before our 
courts if our legislation were not clear enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the work of the committee, experts from the Department of 
Foreign Affairs told us that the precedents set by the judiciary 
committee of the privy council in London that examined the case 
of Mr. Pinochet had deprived General Pinochet of his immunity. 
Consequently, these precedents could be applied here. The common 
law that resulted from these precedents could be applied by our 
courts and deprive someone such as General Pinochet or someone 
in a similar situation of his immunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Bloc Quebecois would have wished for and still wishes 
for is for these precedents set by the judiciary committee of 
the Privy Council to be included in the bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we are proposing subclause 11.1, which would clearly 
say that an accused who formerly occupied a position as a head 
of state or government, member of a government or parliament, 
elected representative or government official and who, at the 
time of the proceedings, no longer occupies that position, may 
not rely on immunities or special procedural rules that may 
attach, by virtue of statute law or common law, to the official 
capacity of the person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such a provision would be useful because it would provide for 
more certainty; we would be absolutely sure that individuals 
suspected of having committed serious crimes, such as crimes 
against humanity, war crimes or genocide, could not obtain 
immunity before our courts.  It would enshrine the common law in 
the statutes of Canada and would allow courts to strip those 
individuals of their immunity in order to punish crimes that 
should be punished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have proposed other amendments that should improve this bill, 
including a provision clearly stating that this act relates to 
the discharge of Canada's obligations under the Rome Statute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like to say how important it is to 
sustain the effort to ensure rapid implementation of the Rome 
Statute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The adoption of the Rome Statute in 1998 by the 
Conference of Plenipotentiaries was a turning point in the 
history of humanity.  We are collectively trying to establish an 
institution that would allow nations and international 
institutions to truly punish international crimes. 
We already have an institution.  All we need now is to adopt and 
ratify the treaties, pass the implementing legislation, as we 
are doing today, and that dream will become reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I would like to pay tribute to someone who is no longer 
with us, Justice Jules Deschênes, who devoted part of his life 
to these issues. A major report was drafted by the Commission of 
Inquiry on War Criminals, which he presided. 
I want to pay tribute to Justice Deschênes and to thank him and 
his family for his contribution to this debate, which he would 
have been proud to witness today.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to speak to this group of motions.  Generally 
speaking we would be supportive of this group of motions, 
although we find that Motion No. 5 could perhaps be worded a 
little better.  Generally speaking we agree with the intent of 
that motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, the whole bill is one that is extremely 
important.  Even though it was in July 1998 that the nations 
agreed to this international criminal court, we realize that the 
UN General Assembly recognized the need for an international 
criminal court as early as 1948 in the aftermath of the second 
world war and the subsequent Nuremberg and Tokyo trials.  The 
U.S., France, Russia and China have argued for a court with 
circumscribed powers.  A Canadian led group of like minded 
nations supported a strong international criminal court, 
including the U.K., Croatia, Singapore and Egypt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at home at how this concept has developed, we 
realize that the international criminal court and Bill C-19 do 
not really have a high profile in Canada.  We have to elevate 
that profile and bring to people's attention how important this 
kind of process is.  The limited opposition has been focused on 
minor issues without putting forward the question of the 
principle of the court.  That is a very important principle that 
has to be looked at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within the non-governmental organization community we know that 
the International Centre for Human Rights and Democratic 
Development has established a wide network of supporters in 
Canada and internationally, including groups such as Amnesty 
International, the U.S. based Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, 
Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, Human Rights Watch and 
Human Rights Internet.  Certainly our party is supportive of the 
idea of this court.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, we have to look at a broader aspect when we 
deal with the whole issue of war crimes.  One very serious issue 
that is taking place right now, and if it were to unfold we could 
certainly say it would lay the groundwork for further war and war 
crimes, is the national missile defence system which the United 
States is proposing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just recently the President of the United States journeyed to 
Russia to try to convince the Russian president and the Russian 
Duma that his system was something they should be unconcerned 
about and that they should perhaps support.  We realize that 
mission fell flat on its face and now we notice that the Russian 
president has travelled to North Korea to try to sort out 
questions and concerns around that whole issue with the North 
Koreans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very serious issue.  It is something that ties into 
the topic that we are looking at today when we talk about war and 
war crimes.  Right now, if we look seriously at the issue, Canada 
could be a leader in this whole area.  We could perhaps be 
calling for a solution to the problem the U.S. feels it faces and 
would give rise to the need for such a national missile defence 
system and the whole question of ballistic missiles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be leading the fight to call for an international ban 
on test missile flights.  The whole issue of missiles could be 
tackled from a different perspective, a preventive perspective, 
in the same way as we did with land mines.  We could be the 
leaders in dealing with the issue in a proactive, preventive way 
as opposed to the reactionary way in which the U.S. is dealing 
with it that is tending to lead to arms augmentation and more 
build-up rather than disarmament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just tie that into the issue because it is very important.  We 
know the outcome of any further activity in that area could 
certainly lead to many serious cases of war crimes being looked 
at.

disappeared.  These 600 people are only the tip of the iceberg 
when it comes to people who come to Canada with the aid of people 
smugglers.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Just recently York University received a $14,000 grant under the

the development of scientific expertise in northern research and 
in promoting the vital and growing role of Canadian universities 
in this field.  Without this support, many of these initiatives 
would be very difficult to promote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second initiative is part of the Canadian Foundation for

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Canadian

are releasing a unanimous report on federal health care spending. 
We have received a copy of the report and it shows that the 
federal government has virtually turned its back on its 
responsibility to fund health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the minister uses tax points to give the illusion of 
larger federal spending, in realty federal per capita spending 
has fallen 27% since this government came to power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the health care of Canadians such a low priority to the 
government? 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the fact is that 
the transfers to the provinces today are at an all time high. 
That means we have put our money where our mouth is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that health care is a priority.  We have also said 
that we want to sit down with the provinces and work out an 
agreement on the fundamental nature of how to protect the Canada 
Health Act.  Our money will be there in addition to what we have 
already done. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Canadian

year Canadians uncovered a black hole of mismanagement into which 
billions of federal dollars are poured every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While federal spending on grants and contributions will reach 
$17 billion this year, total spending on health and social 
transfers will only be $15.5 billion.  That is more spent on 
boondoggles than on hospital beds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the federal government choose to spend more on grants 
and contributions than it does on the health care of Canadians? 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let us look at 
our transfers to the provinces:  over $30 billion in terms of the 
CHST and the tax points that go with it; and ,in addition, we 
have about $10 billion in equalization payments that go to the 
provinces and that can be dedicated to health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our transfers for health care to the provinces are at an all 
time high.  We have said that we will increase them when we can 
get an agreement to protect the Canada Health Act.  That is our 
commitment to health care. 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let us talk about this government's 
disgraceful legacy on the issue of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When medicare started the federal government picked up half the 
cost of health care; that was 50 cents on every dollar.  It now 
picks up just 10.2 cents of every health care dollar spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has a bigger surplus than it has ever had. 
Canadians are more worried about health care than they have ever 
been in the past.  They want a simple answer to a very simple 
question:  When is this minister going to contribute his fair 
share to health care? 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let us look at 
the breakdown of how our transfers apply.  When we include the 
tax points, which the provinces have not said they want to give 
back to us, we are funding fully 31% of all publicly provided 
health care in Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>

54% of that going for health, that is about $17 billion.  In 
addition the federal government spends another $3 billion itself 
on health care, which brings our expenditure up to $20 billion 
out of the $64 billion which is spent every year by governments 
on health care in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister commit today to attend this meeting, or will 
he dodge it like he does his responsibility to health care? 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
let me first of all say that we welcome the report which is to be 
delivered today from the provinces and territories. I have not 
yet seen it but I hope very much that it is a constructive 
contribution to a dialogue we are having with the provinces on 
health care and its funding into the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Minister of Health I believe strongly that there should and 
must be more federal money in health care.  All we ask is that it 
go to support the public health care system, not to fund tax cuts 
in Ontario.  We ask that it go to make the changes that are 
needed to make it a truly sustainable health care system.  I look 
forward to talking about those plans with my counterparts in the

not to respond to the present needs of young families but rather 
to raise the profile of his government. Second, that he is 
woefully ignorant of developments in Quebec's parental insurance 
project when he states that the federal government is in the 
lead role in this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the Prime Minister aware that the parental insurance project

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government is clearly determined not to understand something 
that is, after all, simple.  The decision by Quebec dates back 
to February 1996 and led to a consensus at the November 1996 
economic summit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right from the start, right from February 1997, Quebec has 
attempted to negotiate the mechanisms of this program with 
Ottawa.  Despite Quebec's offer on several occasions to resume 
negotiations, nothing has yet come of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is holding back the government from merely showing a bit of

in this matter? 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>

is obvious that the hon. member does not possess the facts.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the issue of parental insurance has been the subject of 
discussions in Quebec since February 1996. Having received 
support at the November 1996 economic summit, Quebec has been 
trying to negotiate such a program with Ottawa since 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of giving a positive reply to that request to negotiate, 
the federal government, in its September 1999 throne speech and 
its February 2000 budget, did not hesitate to propose a measure 
that willfully excludes thousands of young families from its 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the government justify its decision to block a process 
that has the support of all Quebecers and to merely propose an 
incomplete, unfair and unsatisfactory measure? 
<P><A NAME="LINK72"></A></P>

did not block any program. If something is unfair, it is the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP)</B> moved

Price Commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, Canadians from all over the country are 
very concerned about price gouging, in particular with respect to 
gasoline and diesel fuel.  The Canadian population does not 
believe the big oil companies.  They are sick and tired of the 
Liberal's buck-passing on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We regulate stamps, cable television and many other things. The 
bill I am introducing today will indeed establish an energy price 
commission which will regulate the wholesale and the retail price 
of motor fuels, including diesel, propane, heating oil, natural 
gas and electric power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of price regulation is to avoid unreasonable 
increases that affect the cost of living and depress business 
activity.  The bill will facilitate reasonable consistency in 
prices from province to province allowing for production and 
distribution costs.  The regulation further minimizes the risk of 
collusion in pricing, which many Canadians believe is happening, 
and prevents dominant suppliers from setting unreasonable prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The major objective of the bill is to provide some transparency 
in the pricing of fuel and energy.  The refiners are not 
transparent and there are vertically integrated companies. I 
believe there has to be a time when the government stands up and 
takes some action to protect consumers, as this bill will.

were ruled out of order.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I rise to speak to this bill with some trepidation 
because of the largely emotional aspect of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many years ago there was a song that was sung on the radio.  It 
went, “Ain't going to study war no more”.  I will not sing it 
because that may affect negatively on the people on the other 
side of the House who may rise in derision at my attempt to sing. 
It was a spiritual song, “Ain't going to study war no more”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without exception, all thinking people, all people with any 
conscience at all, will agree that war is terribly bad. 
It is really wrong.  It is as great an evil as we can think of. 
Even if it involves only the people who are enlisted, it still 
involves humans pointing weapons at their fellow humans with the 
intent to kill them, and success goes to the one who wipes out 
the other side.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a great aberration to our society. It is one that would 
drive humanists to despair.  For many years the humanists have 
said that we as a humanity are getting better and better but it 
is quite clear that is not happening.  If I were a humanist in 
the sense of that being a religious faith, my faith would be 
severely shaken because of the atrocities that have continued 
through the ages and which continue to this very day.  Quite 
clearly war crimes, atrocities committed in war and indeed even 
atrocities that are committed outside of war are abhorrent to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of another phrase.  There are some things that are so 
evil, so offensive, that it is even difficult for us to speak 
about them.  The atrocities of war certainly come into that 
category. I find it difficult to even think about them let alone 
speak about them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I happen to be sandwiched between two generations that have 
firsthand experience with this.  My grandparents and parents were 
in the middle of such atrocities.  My parents were in their very 
early teens when they escaped from what we affectionately call 
the old country.  They did so under the threat of losing their 
lives if they stayed.  They were able to escape.  I have said in 
the House many times and I will never stop saying it, how 
grateful I am that their escape was successful, that my 
grandparents made the decision to make Canada their home and that 
Canada, with its arms wide open for refugees, accepted our 
family.  I will be forever grateful for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said I was sandwiched between two generations which have had 
firsthand experience with this.  The other side of it is the 
experiences of my son, who I suppose picked up some of our family 
values.  He spent one summer while he was at university working 
in third world countries with a Christian relief agency. The 
stories he told of things that he observed firsthand are enough 
to make one cry.  It is impossible to imagine the things that 
humans will do to one another.  I want to relate just a few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a name like Epp, it is not to be unexpected that I have 
some Mennonite heritage, since that name appears quite frequently 
in Mennonite circles.  My family members in southern Russia at 
the end of the first world war and during the time of the Russian 
revolution were considered to be enemies of the revolution 
because they would not take up arms in order to annihilate fellow 
human beings.  They thought that was morally wrong so they would 
not do it.  As a result my family and all other Mennonite 
families were considered by the revolutionaries to be enemies of 
the revolution.  Hence they became targets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many times late at night, sometimes after midnight, their homes 
would be attacked by the revolutionaries.  Because they knew that 
the people who inhabited those homes were not for the revolution, 
they were simply taken out and shot.  Three of my maternal 
grandfather's brothers lost their lives.  It was a miracle that 
my grandfather survived in that particular occurrence. There were 
many other cases.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read not too long ago <I>The Diary of Anna Baerg</I> who 
underwent some of these atrocities and wrote about them in a 
diary not unlike <I>The Diary of Anne Frank</I>. I recommend that 
book to all members.  As a matter of fact, the government House 
leader had a copy of that book and lent it to me since he knew of 
my interest in it.  I read the book carefully and with great 
interest because it represented the things that my own family 
went through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She relates some of the atrocities about the people who were 
summarily shot, people she knew and lived with, her neighbours. 
She indicated how one girl was not shot.  She said in her book 
that there are some things worse than death, and Madam Speaker, 
you and I know what she is talking about.  I cannot help but 
grieve when I think of the things people are willing to do to 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My son worked in different places in Africa, in southern Sudan, 
Somalia and Rwanda.  He worked in Croatia.  In Croatia a home was 
set up for women who suffered terribly in the conflict.  He told 
me stories that broke my heart about things that were done to 
children while their mothers watched.  The stories are so 
detestable that I cannot and will not speak about them though the 
picture is very vivid in my mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what the answer is.  We have before us a bill to 
bring to justice the people who do these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My son and his wife went to Rwanda. The government provided them 
with a school so they could provide housing for the hundreds of 
children whose parents were killed in the conflict.  To kill 
parents in front of their children and to leave the children on 
their own is a huge atrocity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My son and his wife had as their first job to clean the school. 
The school was filled with bullet holes. The enemies had entered 
the school when it was in operation and when the so-called 
soldiers left, every student and teacher in the school had been 
shot and subsequently died.  My son's job was to clean up all the 
mess on the walls.  That school was used to house the children 
and give them some shelter and love. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, I see your signal and cannot believe that I have 
only covered my preamble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's involvement in reducing the crime of war throughout the 
country is what we should be emphasizing.  Let us help to spread 
the message of love and forgiveness and learn to live with one 
another so these things do not happen.  Yes, we must to the 
degree that we are able, help to restrain the evil which pervades 
our country and our very world and which leads to the hideous 
atrocities committed against women, children and men.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I in turn wish to congratulate the Standing Committee on Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade on its work. I must say that I 
have been on two other committees during my parliamentary life 
and I have greatly appreciated the committee's ability to work 
in a non-partisan manner on a number of issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was certainly the case for this bill, and I congratulate 
the committee chair.  I also pay tribute to all members and to 
the departmental representatives who appeared before us.  We 
worked hard to come up with the best legislation possible for 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, I also wish to point out that it became 
clear in the course of our work and also from what was said by 
the witnesses who appeared before us from the department, or 
from one of the other departments, that this bill was 
progressive, but that it could be even more so, especially with 
respect to jurisdiction and immunity.  It was on these two 
issues in particular that the member for Beauharnois—Salaberry 
moved the amendments which I seconded.  Yes, we salute this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We salute the work done to improve it, through the good faith of 
all parties on the committee.  I also point out that this bill 
can be improved further.  Some witnesses who appeared before the 
committee even admitted that, if has not yet been improved, it 
could be improved later on, and in fact the discussion we 
brought about this morning will pave the way for the committee's 
subsequent work, although we would like the government to agree 
this morning to broaden the scope of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now give our reasons for having moved some of these 
amendments.  First, we would have liked the government to have 
admitted, by adopting an amendment, that the present bill has to 
do with the performance of Canada's obligations under the Rome 
Statute.  If that is the objective, why not spell it out in the 
bill?  This leaves a doubt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And this doubt is all the greater because in committee and now, 
this morning, the Chair has told us that the government did not 
want to include the Rome Statute and its amendments in a 
schedule.  I note that, in the ruling just now, the Chair cited 
Beauchesne as saying that it is not necessary to include 
agreements or treaties in implementing statutes.  Our concern is 
not with the need to do so, but the fact that this has already 
been done in other Canadian implementing statutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as this law is concerned, we need to provide people with 
some information, as the colleague who spoke before me has already 
stated so eloquently, because the International Criminal Court is 
still not well known.  Often the NGOs who worked to create it 
and the various government and international law experts are the 
only ones to receive any information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need, however, to make the general public aware of the 
preparations that have been made throughout the world in order 
to create an international criminal court which would be 
empowered to judge all those who have committed crimes of such 
enormity, these horrible crimes of genocide, crimes against 
humanity and war crimes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>War is never a clean business, but the countries have come to 
mutual agreement on a certain number of rules relating to 
civilians and prisoners of war.  As we know, and as we have seen 
recently, and continue to see, there are certain groups, certain 
troops that have turned their backs on this international 
convention.  The crimes of genocide and crimes against humanity 
are defined in the bill.  These are definitions which will apply 
equally in future to Canadian statutes and to the implementation 
of the provisions of the Rome Statute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have liked to have seen the Rome Statute and its 
amendments given as an appendix to the bill, but what we would 
have liked still more would have been to have the bill provide 
broader jurisdiction for Canadian courts acting in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is meant by broader jurisdiction?  I am not a lawyer, and 
sometimes glad of it, since I then have to translate these 
things into words, which I hope will be understandable to 
everyone, what my hon. colleagues say most precisely, but not 
always in a way that is understandable to the general public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What broader jurisdiction means is that the Canadian courts 
could judge people who have been charged of such crimes, not 
solely those whose victims are Canadians or who, as 
perpetrators, are Canadians, but also anyone who has committed 
such crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reaction to this will be “But that is extremely broad. 
Can it be done?” The answer is yes. I will quote the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs of Belgium. It should be known that Belgium 
enacted legislation giving its courts broader powers. In June 
1998, addressing a gathering of the representatives of the 
countries that formed the project of an international tribunal, 
International Criminal Court, Minister Derijke made the 
following announcement. He said “In compliance with the 
principle of universal jurisdiction, my country passed 
legislation enabling its courts and tribunals to prosecute in 
1993 suspected criminals”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He did not say Belgian criminals or persons against whom 
Belgians may have committed crimes. He referred instead to 
persons suspected of having committed war crimes, regardless of 
where the crimes were committed or the citizenship of the 
perpetrators. He is talking about an expanded universal 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that Canada acted as a catalyst during the drafting of 
the Rome Statute. I know also that departmental officials, and 
external affairs officials in particular, worked hard on it and 
I salute them. At the same time I serve notice that the Bloc 
will keep on working to expand jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there is more at issue, namely the issue of immunity. But 
even with expanded powers or jurisdictions, if at the same time, 
we in Canada were to grant immunity to former general Pinochet, 
for instance, then, we would have failed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the reason why we introduced these amendments. 
It is not to unduly prolong the proceedings of the House. We 
thought this voice should be heard in the House of Commons 
during this debate. I have heard colleagues from at least one 
other party who were receptive to our comments.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It will not be easy to establish the International Criminal 
Court. Nine countries have already ratified the treaty. Canada 
will soon follow, but 60 signatories are required. Once the 
treaty has been ratified by 60 countries, the court will have 
jurisdiction over the signatory countries, but it will have to 
go through the security council counsel to have jurisdiction 
over other countries or criminals who take refuge or are living 
in other countries, hence the importance for countries, as the 
Belgium minister said, to give themselves the broadest 
jurisdiction possible.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to debate Bill C-27, an act 
respecting the national parks act of Canada at report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance have made a number of amendments to help 
improve the legislation in the following areas:  First, to 
strengthen democratic processes as well making it more inclusive; 
second, to help the parks administration become more accountable 
for its decision making; third, to recognize the traditional 
historic rights to access water from a park; and fourth, to make 
sure that park wardens have all the resources needed to do their 
jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me being by saying that our amendments to clauses 5 and 6 
will make the consultation process much more inclusive by 
including local government bodies in the text.  We at the federal 
level always talk about municipal governments and how important 
they are but rarely do we include them in our legislation.  It is 
irresponsible for the federal state to not recognize local 
government bodies throughout the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I still remember the present Prime Minister, in June 1996 at a 
FCM Calgary convention, telling the folks how important the 
municipalities were in Canada.  Well, Mr. Prime Minister, the 
municipalities are all still waiting to be acknowledged.  Perhaps 
accepting this amendment would be a good start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance amendment to clause 10 by adding the words 
“traditional supply water from the park” will recognize the 
historic rights which existed prior to the formation of the park. 
This amendment will break the gridlock between Parks Canada and 
Dauphin, my home town.  Dauphin has drawn water from the Riding 
Mountain National Park since the early 1900s, predating the 
existence of the park.  Today the water source of the town is the 
same.  Over the last decade, under my watch as the former mayor, 
an agreement could not be ironed out.  Recognizing the 
traditional rights of the town will be a big help in finalizing 
an agreement with the park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having the ability to draw water from a park does not mean it is 
potable.  In 1995 Dauphin was inflicted with a water emergency 
much like Walkerton, the only difference was that the infected 
did not die.  They became very sick from drinking the park water. 
We found out that the water was contaminated with a 
micro-organism called giardia.  The source of this giardia were 
the beavers in the park.  A boil order lasted for almost two 
years until a new water treatment plant was constructed.  The 
giardia is still in the water from the park.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our amendment to clause 12 states that for greater certainty, 
whenever fees, rents, rates and other charges for the use of park 
resources and facilities are increased, the minister shall 
provide opportunity for public participation.  In others words, 
the people must have a say whenever an increase is levied. The 
public must have input to decisions that are made which affect 
their pocketbook.  If they do not have input, it is taxation 
without representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance amendment to clause 18 ensures that park 
wardens will have access to all resources that are required, 
including the possession of a firearm for the enforcement of this 
act and the regulations in all parts of the Canada, and for the 
preservation and maintenance of the public peace in parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ten out of eleven provincial natural resources organizations 
equip their officers with firearms. I ask members to put 
themselves in their shoes before opposing this amendment.  These 
officers have families and love ones like you and me, Mr. 
Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our next amendment to clause 33 mandates that as a person who is 
a member of or who has a proprietary interest in the lands 
included in the park community is entitled to a reasonable 
opportunity to be consulted and make representation in respect of 
the development and approval of the community plan for the park 
community.  In other words, if the park user has an interest in 
the park, then they need to have access to decision making.  This 
in essence calls for democratizing the decision making process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance's last amendment deals with the whole 
issue of air safety.  This issue has been debated for too long. 
Small aircraft flying through the Rocky Mountains need alternate 
landing strips in case of emergency.  This is the reason that all 
airstrips in national parks should be in operational condition. 
COPA has been lobbying for this change for too many years.  This 
amendment was made for the purpose of public safety.  The air 
facilities in national parks should be open at all times.  The 
saving of one life is worth supporting this amendment.  As a 
pilot who has been flying for over 30 years, this amendment is 
about saving lives, and I ask my colleagues for their support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canadians we all love our national parks.  We all use 
national parks in different ways.  Some of us like to use the 
beaches and some the campgrounds, some like to see the town sites 
and some the wilderness areas, and some like to take part in the 
nature programs.  Parks and people go hand in hand.  Can anyone 
imagine a park without giving people access? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having travelled and consulted with most of the western park 
communities, what I found disturbing was the lack of trust in 
Parks Canada by both seasonal and full time residents of national 
parks.  People want to be treated with openness, honesty and 
respect.  I do not think this will happen unless this legislation 
mandates compulsory consultation and accountability.  The problem 
at this time is that the buck does not stop anywhere.  I believe 
checks and balances are needed to ensure that the buck does stop 
somewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I say that our amendments were made with the 
objective to improve this bill.  I ask all members for their 
support to these amendment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, during second 
reading of Bill C-27 on national parks, the Bloc Quebecois 
indicated that it was in agreement in principle, but that it 
intended to raise some important concerns. First, there was the 
issue of maintaining and restoring the ecological integrity of 
parks, and the question of the time limits for the examination 
of ministerial orders with respect to amendments to certain 
schedules of the proposed legislation, which we feel are too 
short. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was also the issue of respect for the rights of 
communities living within or near parks and, finally, the 
designation of historic sites, without consulting provinces or 
municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following representations made to the Standing Committee on 
Canadian Heritage by the various interested parties, the Bloc 
Quebecois moved twenty or so amendments.  The committee agreed 
to include a definition of ecological integrity in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would also have liked clause 4 to deal more directly with 
this issue of ecological integrity, but we are happy that clause 
8 stipulates that the minister's first priority shall be matters 
of ecological integrity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee extended the time limit for examining ministerial 
orders to amend certain schedules to the legislation from 20 to 
30 days.  This is no guarantee that the committees responsible 
for these matters will be convened, but it reduces the risk 
considerably and we are satisfied.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of respect for the rights of communities living within 
or near parks has not, in our view, been entirely resolved. 
However, clause 12 has been considerably improved so as to 
require the minister to encourage the public to participate in 
the development of policies and regulations that might concern 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, I must point out that, thanks to the intervention 
of the member for Manicouagan, the representations from 
inhabitants of the Mingan Archipelago were well received.  Thus, 
in accordance with the wishes expressed by its inhabitants, the 
Mingan Archipelago has been added to the list of parks in clause 
17 of the bill in respect of which the minister may make 
regulations regarding the exercise of traditional renewable 
resource harvesting activities. 
Besides, the limits of the park in the Mingan Archipelago will 
be, for each island, at the high water mark, as the 
representatives of the area wanted it to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On another topic, clause 42 of the bill provides that the 
governor in council may set any land as a national historic site 
to commemorate a historic event or preserve a historic landmark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At first sight, these provisions appear desirable and harmless, 
but a closer examination shows that the minister could intrude, 
without provinces and even interested municipalities being 
aware, on sites and historic sites and deal with them and 
develop them the way he wants without necessarily abiding by 
town planning, zoning or any other municipal bylaws or 
provincial regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a risk that a quiet neighbourhood might be 
transformed over night. A historic town centre could become a 
federal property, one building at the time, and the whole of it 
would become free from any obligation relating to provincial 
regulations or municipal bylaws. This is unacceptable in my 
opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois moved in the Standing Committee on Canadian 
Heritage an amendment proposing that such acquisitions should at 
least be approved by the provinces or province involved. The 
amendment was rejected by the Liberal majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why, and we will come to that later, I move that this 
clause be withdrawn, as it creates this type of risk for our 
provinces, municipalities and populations. 
If the House does not withdraw this section, I urge all 
provincial legislatures to legislate in order to subject to the 
approval of a provincial minister all real property transactions 
that would result in the transfer of a site to the federal 
government for the purpose of making it an historical site. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this way the transaction could be made, but the provincial 
government and the municipalities would know about it and would 
be able to take steps to ensure that those transactions are 
respectful of the people and the authorities concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, the Bloc will support the bill as amended at report 
stage. We will, however, be carefully monitoring how Parks 
Canada, whose priority must be the preservation and restoration 
of the environmental integrity, is carrying out its mission .

would be debating Bill C-27 the next day.  I was fortunate that I 
was present and could participate in the debate, but some of my 
colleagues were not able to do so.  That is the type of thing 
that takes away from the good will in the heritage committee and 
from the ability to properly participate in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw some of this going on in committee when we had to sit 
extended hours for two or three days just so that we could listen 
to all the witnesses that had to come before us.  I am not 
bothered by the fact that we had to work extended hours but I 
felt we had to rush and could not properly do all that had to be 
done.  It meant that we had not only to listen to testimony but 
also had to study and read transcripts.  The period of time to do 
that was too compressed and took away from our ability as 
parliamentarians to do our work in the proper way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the member for Dauphin—Swan River for submitting 
his thoughtful amendments.  I only regret, however, that he chose 
to withdraw the same amendments from the heritage committee 
during clause by clause consideration where we would have had the 
opportunity to debate them to see exactly where he was going with 
this piece of legislation and his amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought some of the amendments that the member made were quite 
reasonable.  When he refused to put them forward at the heritage 
committee I began questioning whether the member had changed his 
mind and now agreed with the government's position on the 
particular clauses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Enough about that.  Let me touch a little on the motions before 
us, in particular Motions Nos. 1 and 2 introduced by the member 
for Dauphin—Swan River.  These motions would have the federal 
government seek agreement with the provinces and the local 
governing body when creating or enlarging a park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the member for Dauphin—Swan River, I also was concerned 
with ensuring that people living within the park communities had 
a chance to take part in the discussions and have input, but the 
problem arises with the ability to define local government and to 
describe exactly what it means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Banff has its own government.  We know that the federal 
government would not like to see that.  We recognize that Jasper 
really did not want that type of thing but wanted some input into 
the process.  The difficulty lies in defining exactly what local 
government is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 3 was introduced by my hon. colleague from Churchill 
River.  This motion further highlights the extent to which 
negotiations must be undertaken with all stakeholders.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We introduced an amendment during clause by clause consideration 
by the heritage committee that would specifically include 
commercial interest as part of the negotiations.   The government 
changed the clause such that we could support what it did that 
would make the process broader to include commercial interests as 
well.  This amendment would serve to strengthen the consultation 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 4 is an amendment again introduced by my colleague 
from Dauphin—Swan River.  It would ensure that the federal 
government could not cut off the traditional supply of water to 
adjacent residents.  With the focus on ecological integrity, 
maintenance and restoration, this could possibly come into play. 
It is not a bad idea.  It is there to ensure that the supply of 
fresh water remains constant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 5 was also introduced by my colleague from 
Dauphin—Swan River.  I like this amendment because it gives 
local residents a greater say in determining the increase in 
fees, rates, rents and other charges for those who use park 
resources and facilities.  Since this affects them directly they 
should have a say in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It might also help prevent the astronomical increase in property 
taxes that the people of Jasper are now being threatened with. 
Perhaps through public input we could determine an appropriate 
cost for entering our national parks areas that will be 
affordable to the average Canadian.  We want all Canadians to be 
able to enjoy our national parts.  That is what national parks 
are all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 5 concerns the control of access to parks by air, 
which again was introduced by my colleague from Dauphin—Swan 
River.  I know he is an avid pilot who has been flying for years. 
This issue had been dealt with in the past by the removal of an 
airport at Banff.  It is my belief the landing strip should be 
maintained for emergency purposes just in case it is needed.  It 
should be maintained for those purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 10 was introduced by the hon. member for 
Dauphin—Swan River.  We would like to encourage participation by 
all stakeholders in any decision making process.  We want 
operators of our ski hills to have an equal say in the future of 
their industry.  As any homeowner or business owner, they have a 
role to play in the creation of a community plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 13 was introduced by the hon. member for Churchill 
River.  I am not certain it reinforces the rights of aboriginal 
people to carry on their traditional renewable resource 
harvesting activities.  The language of the government better 
addresses this concern.  However we do not dispute the aboriginal 
peoples right to carry on their traditional harvesting in park 
reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I thank the House for allowing me this time to 
speak to these motions and to the reworking and preparation of 
Bill C-27. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will not be very long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues 
from all parties who are members of the Standing Committee on 
Canadian Heritage for the excellent work they have done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that we had a good discussion on Bill C-27. We heard many 
witnesses and, on the whole—I suppose that everyone is not 
satisfied in terms of the measures they wanted—the committee 
met the concerns expressed during the hearings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, for the aboriginals, we included a notwithstanding 
clause and made other amendments in reply to certain concerns 
that were expressed. We did the same thing for ecological 
integrity. Each opposition party wanted a definition of this 
concept. The government suggested one, which was amended and 
which obtained the unanimous assent of committee. The same thing 
happened in terms of the concerns expressed by the communities 
living in the parks.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We tried, in clauses 10 and 12, to partly follow their 
recommendations, by ensuring that they will be consulted and 
that the minister can conclude agreements with a variety of 
groups, including business interests, among others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we really met the concerns of those who made that 
presentation. For the benefit of my colleague from Portneuf, I 
must make a small correction concerning the Mingan Archipelago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a big deal, but I want to mention that the reason 
the government fully endorsed and followed through with the 
proposals of this community is mainly the quality of the 
delegation we received and of its presentation. The members of 
the delegation were very warm in the way they convinced us of 
the legitimacy of their proposals. I believe they convinced 
everybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>True enough, their MP made representations, but the quality of 
this group had a lot to do with the government's decision. I 
wanted to make sure the people from Mingan knew that it is in 
great part due to their work that they will be satisfied if the 
bill is passed. I do not want to guess what the House will 
decide. I wanted to make sure they knew it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I want to mention that in the first group we will 
support Amendment No. 4, but none of the others. Again, overall, 
the concerns raised by the opposition parties and by the groups 
that appeared before the committee were listened to. We amended 
the bill to reflect them in a positive way.

<P><A NAME="LINK247"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak to Motion No. 259 which states that the 
government should give consideration to exempting up to $30,000 
of income from income tax as a gesture of support for those 
artists, writers and performers who work in Canada's cultural 
industry. The motion has been brought forward by the member for 
Kamloops—Thompson and Highland Valleys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the surface it seems to be a proposal which is very much in 
harmony with the government's stand on the arts.  The government 
recognizes the importance of providing continued support to 
individuals engaged in the arts.  However, this is not the way to 
do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is committed to ensuring that Canadians have 
Canadian choices and that they are connected to other Canadians 
and to the very diverse Canadian culture.  This means focusing on 
the creation of Canadian content and supporting creators, artists 
and innovators. It means enhancing the capacity of cultural 
organizations, cultural industries and cultural institutions to 
build and retain audiences and to seize both the opportunities 
and the challenges created by the globalization and new 
technologies which are unfolding. It means finding ways to build 
connections among Canadians across communities, to connect 
Canadians to the world, and to engage young Canadians in all that 
we do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government's commitment also means taking into account the 
uniqueness and the distinct character of Quebec culture and the 
needs and circumstances of French language communities in other 
parts of Canada as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taken at a glance, the proposed tax exemption for artists, 
writers and performers could be seen to be very consistent with 
these stated objectives.  However on closer inspection, it 
becomes less clear that such a tax exemption is warranted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1997 I have been a member of the Standing Committee on 
Finance.  It is interesting that this motion has come forward for 
consideration by the government, yet creators have come to the 
finance committee and asked us to look at initiatives such as 
income averaging or indeed some of the aspects of the Irish 
model. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Income earned by artists, writers, composers and sculptors from 
the sale of their work is exempt from tax in Ireland only under 
certain circumstances.  In Ireland, section 195 of the Taxes 
Consolidation Act, 1997, empowers revenue to determine that 
artistic works which are original and creative are recognized as 
having cultural or artistic merit and may have an exemption from 
tax within the year in which the claim is made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is done through the minister of finance.  It is determined in 
consultation with a board or body of persons that are 
knowledgeable in this area of art.  It looks at the sale of 
artistic endeavours such as a book or other writing, a play, a 
musical composition, a painting or other like picture, and a 
sculpture.  It also has a proviso that claimants for artists 
exemption must be resident or ordinarily reside and be domiciled 
in Ireland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are initiatives the government has been encouraged to look 
at and I believe there is merit in doing so. However the motion 
before us is simply a tax exemption of up to $30,000 for artists 
who reside in Canada. 
I would emphasize that the tax system already has features, 
several unique measures as a matter of fact, that support our 
artistic and cultural sectors.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certified Canadian film productions produced by qualified 
corporations have a special refundable tax credit which covers up 
to 12% of the cost of the eligible production.  It replaces a 
previous system of capital cost allowance deductions for certain 
investors that was in place until 1995 and it maximises a benefit 
for the eligible productions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, Canadian art objects purchased by businesses for 
display purposes are eligible for a generous depreciation 
allowance, notwithstanding the fact that such art objects may 
retain their value or indeed appreciate in value over time.  This 
provision enhances the exposure given to Canadian art. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The designation of the national arts service organization 
provides national not for profit art groups with the same tax 
treatment as charities.  This has done much to enhance that 
sector.  Artists may deduct the cost of creating a work of art in 
the year incurred even though the work may not be sold until a 
later date.  This provision recognizes the difficulty that many 
artists face when attributing costs to a particular work and 
carrying inventory over long periods of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employed artists and musicians may deduct certain expenses 
against income from that employment notwithstanding that most 
employment expenses are non-deductible.  Specifically, employed 
artists may deduct expenses related to their artistic endeavours 
up to an annual limit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employed musicians are able to claim the cost of maintenance, 
rental, insurance and capital cost allowance on musical 
instruments.  The special deductions recognize that these 
expenses are required in order to carry on employment in these 
fields. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Artists may also elect to value charitable gifts from their 
inventory at any amount up to their fair market value.  This 
provision removes an obstacle for artists donating their works to 
charities, museums and other public institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certain objects certified to be of cultural importance to Canada 
are exempt from capital gains tax if donated to a designated 
museum or art gallery.  This provision helps to ensure that 
artistic works of cultural significance are retained in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are important provisions.  They demonstrate that the 
government has taken steps to ensure that the tax system does not 
form a barrier to engaging in artistic endeavours.  However the 
proposal before us today does not seek to address a specified 
problem faced by artists.  Rather, the proposal is for a 
substantial tax exemption for all individuals recognized as 
artists.  Such a tax exemption would raise significant concerns 
in the context of the income tax policy and administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the perspective of equity I am sure we would all agree that 
the tax system should as much as possible treat individuals in 
similar circumstances in a similar manner.  This means that 
individuals with comparable incomes and needs should pay 
comparable amounts of tax.  However under the proposed exemption 
an eligible artist would pay substantially less tax than another 
individual in a comparable position who is not an artist.  This 
would seem to me to be highly unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am certain that other taxpayers would also see this issue in 
the same light.  It would be very difficult to explain to a hard 
working taxpayer why she should be faced with a tax liability 
while another individual at the same income did not pay any tax 
whatsoever simply because she was an artist.  For this reason 
alone I find the proposal before us today to be flawed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the proposal is overly vague in several crucial 
aspects.  First, the proposed exemption would require that some 
definition of eligible artists be developed.  However the motion 
makes no reference to this definition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that some definitions already exist.  For example, in 
the Status of the Artist Act and in the guidelines used by the 
Canada Council for the Arts there are definitions, but these 
definitions were not created with the income tax system in mind 
and would likely have to be revised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is difficult to imagine that any definition could be 
developed that would satisfactorily address all needs of 
interested parties.  Without a doubt any definition that excluded 
a given group or artistic activity would be subject to dispute 
and would be very difficult both to administer and to control.

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us does not specify whether the proposed 
exemption is to apply to the income from the artists' endeavours 
only or to all income earned by eligible individuals no matter 
how they are defined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Limiting the exemption to artistic income would seem to be too 
restrictive, especially by part time artists and performers. 
However extending the exemption to all sources of income seems to 
be overly generous and would encapture people that perhaps do art 
as a hobby or simply as a sideline.  These are just a few of the 
things that make the motion before us so problematic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, while encouraging our arts and cultural 
industries has been and will continue to be an important priority 
for Canadians, I do not believe the proposed tax exemption would 
be an appropriate policy tool and I do not support it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very happy to enter the debate and to speak in favour of Motion 
No. 259 as put forward by the member for Kamloops, Thompson and 
Highland Valleys.  I know the hon. member spent a great deal of 
time speaking to arts and cultural groups across the country.  In 
fact it was at their request that the member put the idea forward 
for debate in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 259 has the endorsation of 30 arts and cultural 
groups across the country such as the Canadian Conference of the 
Arts, the Writer's Union of Canada, the Society of Composers, 
Authors and Music Publishers of Canada, and the Canada Council 
for the Arts, just to name a few of the many groups that have 
come forward asking parliament to recognize in a meaningful way 
through our tax system the contribution arts and cultural 
communities make not only to the Canadian cultural fabric but to 
the Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 259 seeks to amend the tax system to introduce tax 
fairness for our working creators.  It would encourage an income 
tax reduction that would be similar to that already offered in 
the province of Quebec for working artists.  Once again the 
province of Quebec seems to be leading the way in this type of 
issue.  At least it has recognized the value of the cultural 
industry in that province and has made meaningful changes to that 
effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 259 would benefit those artists and creators who earn 
very little income.  We are only aware of the artists who have 
reached celebrity status.  Granted, there are some musicians and 
artists who become famous and earn a good deal of money, but the 
incomes of most creators are over 50% below the national average. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just by way of an example, the Writer's Union of Canada states 
that the average annual income of writers is less than $12,000 a 
year.  According to Statistics Canada visual artists earned on 
average $12,633 in 1995.  The Crafts Association of British 
Columbia states that 50% of its members reported earnings of less 
than $5,000 per year from their craft and 31% reported earnings 
of between $5,000 and $20,000 a year.   That is the reality of 
most people working in the arts and cultural communities. 
Whether one is a writer, a visual artist, a filmmaker, a musician 
or a dancer, that is the reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want people to be in those positions and if we value the 
cultural institutions by which Canada identifies itself and in 
which Canada takes great pride, we need to support those 
individuals in a meaningful way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 259 recommends that up to $30,000 of income be 
exempt.  This would change the basic personal exemption to up to 
$30,000 of income earned from the activity for which the person 
is registered, not of their total overall earnings.  If they are 
earning supplementary income from another type of work obviously 
they would be subject to the same tax as everyone else. This is 
the actual copyrighted work that they are producing as an aspect 
of the art in which they are involved. 
I think it is very realistic.  Other countries have undertaken it 
and we have some evidence to draw from as to what it would 
actually cost or what the pick-up would be were this offered to 
the artistic community.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most famous examples is Ireland.  Ireland, as 
everyone knows, is well known for its arts, culture, music, great 
writers and great poets.  People in its cultural sector are 
valued, treasured, appreciated and accurately reflected in the 
income tax system.  I have some examples of how the Irish system 
works, but it would be safe to say that we could look to this 
model. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion put forward by the member from Kamloops is vague for 
a purpose.  The member genuinely wanted to stimulate this debate. 
He did not want to say what we should be doing or how it must be 
done.  He wanted us to speak in the House openly and freely about 
whether or not we value our creators in the cultural sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People working in the arts and cultural sectors make up 8% of 
our total labour force.  It is actually larger than forestry, 
mining and agriculture combined.  I do not believe we recognize 
them and the contribution they make not just to our quality of 
life, which is important, but to our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be a very small cost factor.  I believe there is no 
ceiling in Ireland on its tax break for income earned from 
artistic endeavours, as we are recommending.  Even there where 
they have many people involved in the arts and cultural sector 
and with no ceiling it only costs about $12 million Canadian per 
year.  Frankly that is not a great deal of money when we consider 
the contribution it makes to the economy of Ireland.  Perhaps we 
could view the impact of the program being recommended by the 
member from Kamloops in a comparable light.  That would be the 
approximate price tag we would be contemplating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that our arts and cultural community has been 
underrecognized.  We expect artists to be there when we want to 
be entertained.  We assume they will always be there because for 
the love of their craft they are willing to starve and live in 
some garret, the stereotype of the starving artist.  That is not 
necessary.  If we value the product we should be demonstrating 
that realistically with a tax exemption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other industries receive exemptions because we value them. There 
are capital gains exemptions for businesses and so on.  People in 
other occupations enjoy that type of tax credit.  It is a 
recognition of the way we value them in our community, but we do 
not do the same with artists, musicians, dancers and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some artists face real costs to carry on their craft.  Musicians 
these days, whether violinists or pianists, may have $100,000 
invested in their instruments.  They are paid abysmally because I 
do not think there is a symphony orchestra that is adequately 
funded.  After studying all their lives and investing an absolute 
fortune in a quality instrument they are virtually paid peanuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion put forward by the member from Kamloops in some way 
takes some steps toward recognizing the hardship faced by those 
who create in our arts and cultural sector.  We value them.  The 
NDP caucus is quite interested in this motion.  I was very 
pleased to be able to speak to it today.  We are disappointed 
that the first member who spoke from the Liberal side dismissed 
the idea without a great deal of thought or getting into it in 
any detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only way we could investigate this fully is to deal with it 
at the finance committee.  If the motion were allowed to pass at 
second reading we could do that.  I point out that parliament has 
dealt with the issue in the past.  In 1982 we all remember the 
Applebaum-Hébert commission on Canadian cultural life.  It 
pointed out that the largest subsidy to the cultural life in 
Canada came not from governments, corporations or other patrons, 
but from the artists themselves through their unpaid and 
underpaid labour.  As early as 1982 we were seized of this issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left>From the Committee's standpoint, investing in the arts is no less 
important than investing in the social sciences humanities, the 
purer sciences or medicines.  The Committee is also aware of the 
long term commitment made to the researchers and scholars by 
other federal government agencies and looks for a similar level 
of commitment to Canadian artists. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As recently as 1999 the heritage committee recommended this in 
its report, so I was very surprised and disappointed when the 
first speaker on this motion today simply said that it was not 
meant to be.  Maybe she has not researched the recent comments of 
the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have pointed out how much I admire the hon. member for 
Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys for bringing the motion 
forward.  It is an important debate.  Other countries do it.  The 
province of Quebec does it. I believe that the Government of 
Canada should show support for those involved in the arts and 
cultural industries.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK252"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am honoured to represent the wonderful people of the riding of 
Elk Island in the debate on a motion put forward by the hon. 
member for Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is very interesting. The hon. member is proposing 
that some people in the country who are not making enough money 
to make a decent living should have a tax break.  I have to say 
that I very much agree with that part of the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is talking about people in the arts and 
entertainment industry.  People are working full time trying to 
make a living and sometimes their income level is really 
challenged. It is very tough for them to make ends meet, yet the 
Liberals are still quite content to reach into those people's 
pockets and take some of their meagre earnings and use them to 
build fountains in Shawinigan and other projects of their liking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find this really passing strange.  It is an interesting 
comment on the Prime Minister and on Liberal thinking when we 
contemplate what the Prime Minister said in Europe just a few 
days ago.  He said something about people who want to keep more 
of their own earnings being greedy.  That was the word he used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An artist who makes $13,000 or $15,000 a year has to pay several 
hundred dollars in income tax so that the Prime Minister can take 
the money to spend in his riding.  He attributes the word greed 
to the artist who would like to keep some of his or her own 
earnings, but he somehow does not see that there is any element 
of greed in his own wanting to use that very same money for his 
nefarious purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also think of single moms.  There are many single parents and 
most of them are single moms.  Many of them make less than 
$20,000 yet the Liberal government with its so-called social 
conscience is quite content to lift from the pockets of those 
people who make less than $20,000 a year some $6 billion or $7 
billion a year in income tax.  How shameful.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An NDP member is saying that we need to be less greedy and let 
artists keep more of their earnings.  I simply say it is time we 
replaced the Liberal government which cannot see past anything 
that moves without wanting to regulate it and tax it.  In 
principle I agree with what the NDP member is proposing in the 
motion, which is is to reduce taxes, particularly for those 
people who have a very limited income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could hardly let this moment pass by without mentioning our 
solution 17.  For all intents and purposes it would take almost 
two million taxpayers off the tax rolls completely, giving them a 
100% reduction in taxes.  When the Liberals knock our solution 17 
plan, they are trying to get a message to Canadians to be 
suspicious of our plan, to not accept it and to not trust us to 
form the government.  I really wonder about the Minister of 
Finance and the Prime Minister who will not openly and honestly 
deal with the facts and let the people of Canada decide.  Instead 
they paint a bunch of pictures of our plan which are quite 
different from what the plan actually is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that low income Canadians, among them artists, 
need a substantial tax break.  The member for Kamloops, Thompson 
and Highland Valleys has suggested that the tax break should be 
100% up to $30,000 of earnings.  I have a bit of a problem with 
that.  As much as I agree with the concept of reducing the taxes, 
I am not in favour of saying let us find which groups we should 
give this benefit to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals like to line up different groups based on their 
race.  They say that one race will have a better advantage over 
another one when it comes to hiring or benefits and other things 
with respect to the government.  The NDP would probably look at 
people in terms of need, but it is only prepared to look at some 
individuals who have needs.  In this case it is looking at people 
in the artistic community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not hesitate to say it does not matter whether the person 
is an artist, a mechanic, an unemployed nurse or a part time 
worker at a fast food place.  If the person does not make enough 
money to adequately provide for his or her family, then there is 
still something fundamentally wrong with the government taking a 
certain portion of the earnings and saying that it wants it 
anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concept of increasing the basic exemption is very good. This 
is where solution 17 shines.  For an individual, we would take 
that basic exemption right up to $10,000. Many students, artists 
and other people who have a small income would be totally exempt 
from paying federal income tax, which is as it should be. The 
remainder would pay the lowest rate.  We are currently proposing 
17% for that rate.  That is why we have named it solution 17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Artists of course have other things that affect them.  Depending 
on the area where their work takes place, many of them incur 
expenses while they are producing their art.  Whether one is a 
writer or a painter, it sometimes takes a year or two or three to 
earn an income.  Producing the work takes that much time and it 
is only when the work is sold that there is income.

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps we would be much wiser if we looked not only at artists, 
but at people whose income falls into the category of a large 
income over longer intervals of time and no income for a long 
time and then a spurt of larger income and then again a time of 
limited or no income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps we should re-design our income tax system so there can 
be some long term averaging of both income and expenses. The 
annual exemption of our proposed $10,000 per year would in effect 
give the artist a $30,000 exemption over three years, the time 
that it takes to produce the work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously we need to deal with this issue not only for artists 
but for all Canadians.  Although I agree in principle with what 
the hon. member is trying to do, I am going to have to vote 
against the motion.  The simple reason is that I do not think it 
is right to single out one occupational group as a favoured group 
who can earn up to $30,000 without paying income tax, but 
everyone else regardless of how poor they are or what their 
obligations are to their children and families have to pay taxes 
on an amount of money after whatever the basic exemption is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The basic exemption is around $8,000 under the Liberals. It 
would be $10,000 per adult under our plan.  A family, a mom and a 
dad and two kids, under our plan would have a tax free income up 
to $26,000.  That is very close to what the hon. member is 
proposing for artists. The difference is that our plan would 
apply to everyone in that income category. That would be a much 
more fair way of dealing with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret that my time is up.  I would like to talk a bit more 
about some of the supports that are available to artists but I 
will have to leave that for other members.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on 
behalf of my constituents in the riding of Madawaska—Restigouche, 
New Brunswick, it gives me great pleasure to speak in favour of 
Motion No. 259, a votable motion put forward by the hon. member 
for Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important to recognize that civilized societies have 
always supported the arts and culture.  It is a tradition that 
has been valued throughout history.   We should seek to maintain 
and improve this with policies, not specifically tax policies, 
but policies that support and encourage culture and the 
development of the arts in Canada, which has had a long and 
diverse history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an Atlantic Canadian from New Brunswick, one of the most 
culturally diverse and productive regions in Canada, we value a 
tradition of excellence.  There are economic opportunities for 
all Canadians in recognizing and harnessing the power of the arts 
and cultural community, whether it is the <I>Lion King</I> in 
Toronto, or musicians like the Rankin Family and Natasha 
St-Pierre in Atlantic Canada who started from very humble means 
and have done extremely well, or artists who have reached 
international acclaim, like Roch Voisine who was born in my 
riding in New Brunswick. These types of success stories are 
worthy of recognition.  However, we must do more to help artists 
when they are starting off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is very sound from the perspective of the hon. 
member's desire to help.  However, there are some difficulties in 
its implementation and I would like to point out a couple of 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very nebulous in terms of describing who qualifies and how 
the term artist fits a specific individual and whether or not 
that can be defined and the definition defended effectively. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1400"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member also pointed out the financial roller coaster 
artists are on.  An artist may go on for several years without 
payment and then receive a lump sum payment recognizing 
contributions made over a period of time.  The best way to 
address that would be through income averaging.  This would also 
address other people who are similarly predisposed through the 
nature of their business to receive lump sum payments in 
recognition of work completed over a period of several years. 
Income averaging would be the best way to address it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average income of an artist in Canada is currently estimated 
at about $13,000.  The issue raised by the hon. member can be 
addressed in a more broadly based way by significantly raising 
the basic personal exemption for all Canadians.  The Progressive 
Conservative Party's task force which reported in January 
recommended an increase to $12,000.  This would help 
significantly.  That being the case, we should move over a period 
of time to raise the basic personal exemption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member also recognized that tax relief could play an 
important role in helping artists pursue their chosen field of 
culture and art and in keeping them in Canada.  It indicates that 
he recognizes the importance of lowering taxes for all Canadians 
to ensure that Canadians, regardless of career or life pursuit, 
can choose to stay and prosper in Canada.  Whether it is a dot 
com, e-commerce, biotech or traditional industry, Canadians could 
have a future in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member demonstrated clearly that he recognizes the 
important role that tax policy plays in encouraging and 
discouraging pursuit of particular activities.  In that vein I 
think he would agree that we should continue to be vigilant in 
ensuring that the tax burdens of Canadians are not excessive when 
compared to those of other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether Canadians wish to pursue careers in the arts or the 
traditional economy we want them to be free to do so in Canada. I 
am sure he would share with me the need to reduce taxes for all 
Canadians based on his basic premise that decreasing taxes could 
help to encourage people, in this case artists, to pursue and 
maintain a certain level of activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of capital gains tax needs to be addressed as well. In 
Canada we currently tax at 50% of the regular inclusion rate for 
the donation of publicly traded or listed securities to 
charitable foundations or institutions.  Whether it is a 
hospital, a university, an endowment fund or a cultural activity, 
we tax 50% of capital gains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Inclusion rates are taxed in Canada for donation of publicly 
traded or listed securities.  In the U.S. there is absolutely no 
capital gains taxes on contributions of listed securities.  This 
has led over the years to a significant disadvantage for Canadian 
universities, Canadian hospitals and the Canadian arts community. 
It has created a disincentive for high net worth Canadians to 
contribute listed shares of publicly traded companies to the 
cultural sector, health foundations and universities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time of the prebudget report the Progressive Conservative 
dissenting report recommended the elimination of capital gains 
tax on gifts of listed securities.  That would go a long way 
toward encouraging high net worth individuals in Canada and 
Canadians of relatively modest means who may have done very well 
in equity investing in recent years to help foster a greater 
environment for cultural activity in Canada.  That is one way 
this could be addressed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also be interested in exploring the examples of other 
countries relative to special tax exemptions for those engaged in 
the arts.  By and large there is only one party in the House of 
Commons which consistently opposes any support for the Canadian 
arts.  I expect it would probably kick a member out of its caucus 
if it were discovered that he or she had gone to live theatre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that there be almost an all-party commitment to 
the arts and cultural community in the House of Commons.  While I 
may disagree with the particular vehicle set forth by the hon. 
member to help create a better environment for cultural and 
artistic diversity in Canada, I assure him that the Progressive 
Conservative Party of Canada remains committed to work with 
altruistically oriented parties in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must seek better ways to support and encourage the arts and 
all types of creative endeavours for Canadians, whether they be 
involved in graphic arts, the dot com universe, weaving, 
painting, dancing or playwriting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that defines us as Canadians is our unique 
culture and vibrancy from coast to coast to coast, which we shall 
continue to have with the proper support and encouragement of all 
Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to lend my support to Motion No. 259 of my hon. 
colleague from Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys.  I will 
state it clearly for the record: 
<A NAME="LINK255">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should give 
consideration to exempting up to $30,000 of income from income 
tax as a gesture of support for those artists, writers and 
performers who work in Canada's cultural industry. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My reason for speaking today is to show a gesture of support for 
our artists, writers and performers.  Not enough can be said for 
the artistic and gifted people in Canada who are continually 
contributing to an industry that is growing in leaps and bounds 
with the new media, the Internet and the information age 
interconnection.  There is a new aspect of visual, artistic, 
audio and video presentations, real time, and an international 
sharing of information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If language is a barrier among our communities and our youth, 
the whole aspect of graphics, pictures, audio visual 
presentations and music provides an international language which 
breaks the boundaries.  A flourishing industry starts with the 
planting of a seed in the form of the God-given talents of young 
people who find their calling, their true gifts and their 
strength.  Maybe it is a gift they have been given in the 
artistic field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our society is on an income base.  It is a state of dependency. 
In any city transactions involving milk, water, clothes, housing 
or electricity are dependent on money.  To live in a city one 
needs money.  Whether it be Paris, New York, Montreal, Vancouver, 
Edmonton, Lethbridge or Hull, young people are trying to find 
their calling.  This is an opportunity for Canada to give a 
gesture of support to artists.  They may find they have to scrape 
their elbows and their knees to provide food and shelter for 
themselves, their immediate families, their communities or their 
extended families such as their elderly parents or grandparents. 
Artists are probably the most generous in terms of charities. 
Artists donate their works of art as a gesture of charity to 
local events such as silent auctions.  The government should show 
a gesture of support by assisting them in finding their calling.

<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, an artist working in oils may find that those 
techniques are the best templates for the colours on a modem to 
be transferred internationally on a desk top computer in 
multi-media.  Colours and hues can be controlled by technology as 
opposed to mixing oil paints on a palette. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some may have to go for some upgrading in new styles or 
techniques.  They may have to broaden their horizons by going to 
a big city or venturing into a new part of Canada.  It would take 
considerable expense to make this happen.  As a nation we could 
make a gesture of freedom to our artists.  Basically it would 
allow them the freedom of expression and the freedom to try new 
ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to cast a good light on our artists and their 
gifts.  At a younger age when choosing my career path and 
realizing my aspirations for the gifts I was given I was told 
that an artist is a conceptualizer.  For example, someone dreamt 
up the architectural concept of the parliament buildings. 
Somebody expressed it on paper or in words.  That gesture was 
supported and it grew into the buildings on Parliament Hill.  The 
architecture of these buildings are of artistic value.  They also 
have a purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our artists may have artistic talents but they also have 
integrity and serve a purpose in terms of the nation and the new 
technologies.  There has to be a purpose.  It is not for mere 
entertainment or mere entrepreneurial skills that our artists 
work on their concepts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from a region of Canada which is known for its beadwork, 
crafts, clothing such as moccasins and dream catchers, where 
people consider their talents to be a gift and have included 
purpose in their art such as dream catchers trapping the good 
dreams and screening out the bad ones in a child's room or the 
parents' room.  The dream catcher is an artistic form but also 
has a spiritual purpose in making our lives better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has an opportunity to make a gesture of support 
for our artisans, our playwrights, our singers and our poets. I 
also think of our recently lost colleague and brother, the late 
Mr. Maurice Richard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Performers in television and movies are growing in numbers and 
attracting the motion picture industry here.  Let us support 
them.  They are seasonal jobs.  Some people might find summer 
work in shooting locations throughout the country but may fall 
short trying to make ends meet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The exemption of $30,000 worth of income could be our gesture to 
encourage artists, writers and performers to say they have a 
rightful place and that we count on them to conceptualize our 
future and make out lives better in the country we call home, 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Motion No. 259 in the name of the member for Kamloops—Thompson 
and Highland Valleys is a votable item.  We are in the second 
hour of debate.  A request has been made by the member in

to preserve the last hour of debate which of course would only 
occur I suspect some time in the fall.
