House with 245 signatures from British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners are calling upon parliament to take immediate 
steps (a) to provide a significant contribution toward homeowners 
affected by the residential construction crisis (b) to ensure 
that the cost of all qualified repairs are deductible from income 
retroactively and in the future (c) to repeal and refund all GST 
on qualified repairs and (d) to permit registered retirement 
savings plan or RRSP funds to be used to undertake qualified 
repairs without penalty and to permit previously withdrawn RRSP 
funds used to pay repair specialist assessments to be income tax 
rebated.

pursuant to Standing Order 36, I am pleased to present a petition 
on behalf of a number of Canadians including from my own riding 
of Mississauga South on the subject of human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House 
that violations of human rights continue to be rampant around the 
world in countries such as Indonesia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners also acknowledge that Canada is internationally 
recognized as the champion of internationally recognized human 
rights.  The petitioners therefore call upon parliament to 
continue to condemn human rights violations and to seek to bring 
to justice those responsible for such abuses.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have the honour to present two petitions this morning. 
The first petition is signed by hundreds of residents of my 
constituency of Burnaby—Douglas and elsewhere in British 
Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It notes that a commission of inquiry into the quality of 
condominium construction in B.C. has concluded that condominium 
owners and residents are the victims of a systemic failure to 
provide quality accommodation and as a result tens of thousands 
of residents are suffering financially, emotionally, medically 
and domestically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the petitioners urge parliament to provide a 
significant contribution toward homeowners affected by the 
residential construction crisis to ensure that the cost of all 
qualified repairs are deductible from income retroactively and in 
the future, to repeal and refund all GST on qualified repairs, 
and finally to permit RRSP funds to be used to undertake 
qualified repairs without penalty and to permit previously 
withdrawn RRSP funds used to pay repair specialist assessments to 
be income tax rebated.

Speaker, my second petition is signed by residents of a number of 
municipalities in British Columbia including Burnaby. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It draws to the attention of the House the fact that the 
multilateral agreement on investment or MAI will 
disproportionately expand and entrench unprecedented rights to 
transnational corporations and foreign investors at the expense 
of the Canadian government's ability basically to make decisions 
about our own future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It calls on parliament to consider the enormous implications to 
Canada by the signing of the MAI, to put it to open debate in the 
House and to place it for a national referendum for the people of 
Canada to decide.

</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK22"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  I am informed by the 
departments of health and national defence as follows: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>a) A Department of National Defence (DND) specific research 
study to determine whether there are any objectively measurable 
neuro-psychological effects associated with mefloquine was 
approved by the Medical Services Research Board in 1995.  The 
study designe is a double blinded, randomized, placebo controlled 
trial.  The suggested sample size requires 280 persons per active 
and placebo group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Inclusion criteria: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>1. Age over 18 years;<BR> 
2. Expected deployment to an area requiring mefloquine 
(chloroquine resistant area); and<BR> 
3. Informed, voluntary consent to participate in the study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Exclusion criteria: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>1. Prior use of mefloquine, with or without an adverse drug 
reaction;<BR> 
2. Pre-existing medical disorders, including: seizure disorder, 
vertigo, neuro-psychiatric disease or cardiac conduction 
defect;<BR> 
3. Pregnancy, or the likelihood of pregnancy during the study 
period and for three months following the study period; 
and<BR> 
4. Any allergy to the study medications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Due to the unavailability of a suitable number of Canadian 
forces (CF) participants (CF personnel since 1995 not having been 
deployed in sufficient numbers to a region where the use of 
mefloquine is required), no subjects have been recruited and 
participating centres have not been confirmed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>b) Yes, reviews indicate that the experience of the Australian, 
British and Dutch forces with mefloquine is similar to the 
Canadian forces experience.  The common experience has 
demonstrated that mefloquine is a very effective prophylaxis 
against malaria and has few significant side effects, although 
minor side effects are common.  As a result of the reviews, the 
Australian, British and Dutch forces continue to use mefloquine 
where appropriate and monitor personnel for side effects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>c) Health Canada did not undertake any formal investigations in 
October 1997.  In October 1994, there were media reports of 
claims of involvement of Lariam in several incidents in Somalia. 
Health Canada took immediate and repeated action by requesting 
the manufacturer to provide all information and adverse drug 
reaction reports as required under the safety monitoring study 
(SMS) on the possible use by DND of SMS supplies of Lariam in 
Canadian forces deployed to Somalia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>d) In October 1994, when Health Canada became aware that Lariam had 
been administered to Canadian armed forces deployed to Somalia, the 
department requested from the sponsor an accounting of all the 
supplies provided to Canadian armed forces personnel by DND, and 
a listing of adverse drug reactions observed during the course of 
the use of the drug under the auspices of the SMS.  DND indicated 
to the manufacturer that it was their belief that Lariam issued 
in Somalia was purchased separately from the SMS.  Health Canada 
concluded that the manufacturer had conducted the trial as per 
the agreed upon protocol and had responded to the inquiries in a 
timely manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>e) The date of the insert in the Lariam (mefloquine) package 
is December 12, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>f) The date on the most recent product monograph which also 
contains an information to the consumer section is December 12, 
1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>g) Health Canada has not undertaken a formal review of the 
insert in the Lariam (mefloquine) package and the prescribing 
information used in Autralia. However, prescribing information from 
various countries (Australia, UK, US as well as 
the Roche International Standard Prescribing Information) when 
provided by the manufacturer and when examined has been found to 
be similar to the Canadian labelling information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>h) Health Canada has not undertaken a formal review of the 
insert in the Lariam (mefloquine) package and the prescribing 
information used in the United Kingdom.  However, prescribing 
information from various countries (Australia, UK, US as well 
as the Roche International Standard Prescribing Information) when 
provided by the manufacturer and subsequently examined, has been 
found to be similar to the Canadian labelling information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>i) Health Canada has not undertaken a formal review of the 
differences in timing and content of the Canadian product 
monograph as compared with the Australian and British product 
monograph equivalents.  Approval for marketing of a product in 
Canada and the content of the product monograph is based on the 
data submitted to Health Canada at the time of filing of the 
submission by the manufacturer.  The filing dates as well as the 
data in support of the new drug submission may or may not be 
similar to that submitted to other regulatory organizations.

<A NAME="LINK25">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from February 5 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-63, an act respecting Canadian citizenship, be read 
the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  When the bill was last before the 
House the hon. member for Dewdney—Alouette had the floor.  He 
has six minutes remaining in his allotted time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to resume the debate.  As I was saying earlier 
in debate, I would like to frame my comments in the setting of 
the following phrase, that the immigration system is broken and 
the minister is either unwilling or unable to fix it.  I make 
that comment based on the fact that the minister has now been the 
minister for three years and has done very little in terms of 
substantive changes to the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read a little from the report of the legislative 
review group which the minister commissioned last.  In the 
document it made the comment that one of the flaws in Canadian 
politics is the difficulty in dealing with subjects such as 
immigration— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The Reform Party continues to refer to this as the 
Immigration act.  I would like to remind the member from the 
Reform Party that Bill C-63 is the Citizenship Act.  Members of 
that party have continually referred to it as the Immigration 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I think the hon. member has made his 
point, but I am not sure it is a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I was stating, in my 
opinion the immigration system is broken.  The minister is either 
unwilling or unable to fix it.  The fact that the minister has 
brought forward the bill as her first substantive piece of 
legislation is evidence of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to state again as I was stating before I was 
interrupted by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration—he might notice that word on the end 
of the minister's portfolio—that one of the flaws in Canadian 
politics is the difficulty in dealing with subjects such as 
immigration as if to raise the issue itself is tantamount to 
questioning its beliefs.  The place of immigrants or the value of 
a certain category of immigrants in this kind of unspoken 
censorship has been a chronic problem for both journalists and 
politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We firmly believe that the government must account for the way 
the objectives of immigration programs are being met.  This is in 
accordance with the rules that allow the true exercise of the 
democratic rights of Canadian citizens.  Only then can we restore 
the public's faith in the management of immigration programs.  At 
the same time we will restore the confidence of those who 
implement these programs and, in the end, of all those who elect 
to settle in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I make that comment because quite often what happens is that 
members of the government throw names at members of the 
opposition who would point out problems with the system. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1015"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do point out problems with the system because there are 
problems with the system.  We point out those problems so that 
the system we would hope would be fixed by those who are in power 
and have the ability to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We make these comments because we believe in immigration, we 
believe it is a positive force in this country and because the 
government is derelict in its responsibility to take care of 
glaring errors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will continue to raise those issues— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
relevancy.  The member is not addressing the substance of Bill 
C-63.  Bill C-63 is about citizenship.  We do not need members of 
the opposition getting up and slandering immigrants to this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sure the hon. member for 
Dewdney—Alouette is coming to discuss the bill before the House. 
I think he knows his remarks must be relevant to the bill.  I 
think the parliamentary secretary has made a point and I am sure 
the hon. member for Dewdney—Alouette will make his remarks 
relevant to the bill before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Mr. Speaker, again, I frame these 
comments on the point that if the parliamentary secretary does 
not realize that citizenship and immigration are interlinked, I 
submit that points out a very difficult problem for that 
individual sitting as a member of the government.  I am quite 
shocked that he does not see the relevance of that comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he would like to direct the debate and send over some 
speaking notes for members of the opposition so we could say 
exactly what he wants us to say, that is fine, send them over and we 
will consider them.  In the meantime, I will continue to make the 
same point.  I would like to point out something that the member 
said which goes to the point of what he sees as priorities and 
what we see as priorities.  We would like to see the system of 
immigration addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary in committee, when these issues were 
brought up, said: “It is imperative that we not overly focus on 
the question of criminality in immigration.  Too much time has 
been spent on it.  I think we have studied the criminality 
question enough at the present time.  We should be getting on to 
some other very important issues”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that because there are a lot of important issues and that 
is one I have raised in committee and in the House. There is a 
problem happening in Vancouver with an abuse of the immigration 
system.  Individuals who will eventually become citizens of this 
country, should they choose that course, will be governed by the 
precepts of this bill that the parliamentary secretary keeps 
objecting to.  I make that comment to the parliamentary secretary 
in the hope that he will see the relevance of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians see the relevance.  They see that the system is 
broken.  They see that the government is sitting on its hands and 
not taking action on some of the very important things that need 
to happen.  The Honduran situation in Vancouver is one of them. 
The parliamentary secretary has the gall to say— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi:</B>  Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, we 
are dealing with Bill C-63, an act respecting Canadian 
citizenship.  Reform has time and time again not talked about 
this bill but instead goes off and talk about some other issues 
related to immigration, not to citizenship.  That debate is going 
to come to this House at some point in time and then the members 
opposite can address the issue.  Right now they are irrelevant. 
They are not addressing the citizenship act before this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would ask that you direct the member of the 
opposition to speak about the citizenship act. Otherwise he 
should not speak at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sure that the hon. member for 
Dewdney—Alouette is about to make his remarks about the bill.  I 
invite him to do so at the earliest opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Mr. Speaker, for the third time I will 
try.  I hope the parliamentary secretary is listening this time 
because he certainly has not been listening to anything that has 
been said so far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will mention something one more time.  Perhaps I will slow 
down a bit for the parliamentary secretary so he can understand 
that the minister is the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration. 
That is the whole realm of the minister's responsibility.  She 
has brought in a bill having to do with citizenship and the 
citizenship act.  I know the members opposite continue to heckle 
because they do not want to listen to substantive changes.  They 
do not want to listen to positive changes.  There is a force of 
negativity coming from the government side.  Rather than 
listening to positive ideas and suggestions of how to fix the 
system, how to improve this bill and how to improve the 
immigration system itself, the government wants to shout down 
opposition.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not want to listen to ideas being brought forward by 
Canadians, by lots of people, by one of the minister's own 
consultants, Dr. Don DeVoretz of Simon Fraser University, whom 
the minister consults with regularly and who points out some of 
the problems not only with this bill but with the immigration 
system as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had hoped that the government would be willing to listen to 
some of these suggestions.  Obviously that does not seem to be 
happening so far today.  I can only hope that the government's 
manners improve a bit today and that it has the opportunity to 
listen, because there are lots of people calling for changes to a 
system that is broken and hoping that the minister will take 
action to address these problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this bill I do not see a lot of substantive changes.  I thank 
you for listening, Mr. Speaker.  You have been very attentive.  I

<P><A NAME="LINK27"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask my hon. colleague who 
has tried on two occasions to address the issue if he could maybe 
point out for the benefit of the government members who do not 
seem to see a connection between immigration and citizenship and 
perhaps very succinctly explain to them how the relationship is 
there between immigration and Canadian citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was trying to say earlier in my speech, of course 
citizenship and the act of immigration are intricately linked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Individuals who come to our country through the immigration 
system are the individuals who end up becoming citizens of this 
country.  That is how Canada was built.  Canada was built on the 
positive force of immigration, people coming from other countries 
to settle here and build this great country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a bit surprised that members of the government do not see 
that link.  They are linked in such a way that I do not think it 
needs explaining, but obviously it does to the members of the 
government.

after day attacking immigrants and attacking refugees.  They say 
that they are only dealing with a small percentage.  But the fact 
of the matter is if one is to examine everything the Reform Party 
has said about immigrants and refugees, it is making links to 
criminality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I came to this country as a refugee.  There are many refugees in 
this country who became citizens.  I tell the members of the 
Reform Party that you will not get support from new Canadians 
when you continuously attack and smear them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I know the member would like to get excited about this, but I 
notice he is not addressing the Chair when he is speaking.  I 
just ask that he settle down and keep things cool and address the 
Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. House leader has a point. 
The parliamentary secretary I am sure will address his remarks to 
the Chair and not to other members of the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. I have to suggest that this person is totally off topic. 
He is not making any relevant comments to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The parliamentary secretary does 
appear to be asking a question or making a comment in relation to 
the previous speech.  I know he is about to ask a question which 
I assume will have some relevance to the speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi:</B>  Mr. Speaker, they seem kind of touchy 
on that side and I can understand it, being a party that is 
compassionately challenged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, the 
parliamentary secretary said we attacked aboriginal people. I 
would like an apology from the parliamentary secretary.  He is 
talking about my family.  Please withdraw that comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The member has made his point but I 
am not sure he has a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi:</B>  Mr. Speaker, to wrap it up and pose 
the question, how can the official opposition exhibit the kind of 
intolerance it has toward aboriginal people, immigrants and 
refugees, and expect to promote good citizenship in this country 
when it is forever slandering those people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is a great deal of 
rhetoric coming from the parliamentary secretary and I think that 
is obvious to all in the House and I hope obvious to all watching 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me ask the parliamentary secretary a question to see if he 
would agree with one of his own members of the government, the 
member for Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam who made the 
following statement. He uses this rhetoric about the Reform Party 
being against immigration which is completely untrue.  He knows 
it and he is continuing this rhetoric.  I will quote directly 
what a member of the Liberal government said: “I happen to 
believe that by deporting refugee claimants convicted of dealing 
drugs we would be taking a major step forward in the fight 
against the illegal sale of drugs.  They should be deported 
immediately with no review or appeal allowed to drag things 
out”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a member of the government making that comment and I 
cannot believe it.  That is extremism.  That is an unbelievable 
comment coming from a member of the government.  The members have 
the gall to stand in their places and throw stones here when all 
we are pointing out is that the system needs to be changed.  The 
problems that are so glaring need to be addressed and the members 
of the government are unwilling and unable to do it.  All they 
can do is throw stones and be negative where we will be a 
positive force.  We will make the positive changes that are 
needed to fix the problems with the system.  That is what we are 
here for.  We are here for positiveness, not for the negativity 
we hear from the government side. 
<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will point out a couple of things and then I will ask a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am an immigrant.  I immigrated to Canada in 1968.  I guess the 
parliamentary secretary thinks I would stand up and slander 
myself.  He says we slander immigrants, which I totally object 
to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A good deal of our caucus consists of immigrants and they are 
valuable and good Canadians.  There was a quote from the country 
I come from that I was reminded of recently and I will pass it on 
to this parliamentary secretary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The person said remember that we have two ears and one mouth and 
only one of them was meant to close.  I hope that some of these 
people, particularly the parliamentary secretary, will remember 
that when he is sitting and supposed to be listening to speeches. 
He will have his turn to talk, I am sure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I express to the member that we went through quite a lengthy 
process when I came to Canada in 1968 with regard to obtaining 
our citizenship.  I thought it was valuable.  I thought it was 
worthwhile and it is something that should be done.  It is 
something that has ceased being done to the extent that it was in 
1968.  I thought it was great the way they did it in the years we 
arrived. 
Now they have become very loose and very different which has not 
been positive for this country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member feel we need to strengthen the qualifications 
for citizenship in comparison to what they used to be?  Does he 
believe there should not be any screening at all?  The 
parliamentary secretary seems to believe that if we do screen, we 
are slandering these people.  I would like the member's comments 
on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Mr. Speaker, citizenship is a positive 
force in our country and we know that.  The minister is bringing 
forward a bill and I was pointing out that I thought she should 
have some other priorities over and above this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about being an immigrant himself, as many of 
our caucus members are.  We know that being a citizen is a 
privilege in this country.  Individuals who work toward 
citizenship do so with the intention of making a positive 
contribution to this country, and we appreciate that.  That is 
what Canada was built on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out once again that it is the members of the official 
opposition who are pointing out problems with the system that 
need to be fixed and members opposite seem to think that is a 
problem.  They do not even listen to their own minister's panel 
which says that this kind of unspoken censorship has been a 
chronic problem for both journalists and politicians.  If 
somebody makes a comment that we should improve the system, then 
that person must be against immigration, but nothing could be 
further from the truth.  We are for immigration and that is why 
we ask that these problems be addressed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK30"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will address the comments made by the members of the opposition 
in the last few minutes.  Nowhere in this debate in which the 
members of the official opposition have participated have they 
mentioned anything about the Citizenship Act.  The reason behind 
this debate is to make suggestions to the minister responsible 
regarding the bill before us now.  Nowhere have I heard any 
creative or constructive suggestions regarding this bill.  I 
remind the Canadian public that those members are talking about 
immigration and not about citizenship. My own remarks will touch 
directly on the subject. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to have the opportunity today to participate in the 
debate on Bill C-63 introduced by the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration.  This is a bill I support fully, for a number of 
reasons. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian society and its values have changed since the 
citizenship law of 1977.  Canadians have changed.  They now have 
friends and neighbours of various origins.  More than ever they 
do business all over the planet.  They adopt children from 
overseas and they travel more often than ever before. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all these social changes, the distinction between citizens 
and immigrants has now often become synonymous with the 
distinction between existing citizens and potential citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wording of the new legislation on citizenship reflects what 
each of us feels increasingly in our identity as Canadians.  By 
touching on political identity, this legislation reflects 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is the people of Canada.  It is itself a 
citizenship act, because it does more than simply create legal 
Canadian citizenship, that is official citizenship for legal 
purposes.  It also draws on Canadian citizenship, everyday 
citizenship as reflected in the love we feel for our country, 
the specific way we are Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to emphasize two important aspects of Bill C-63. 
First, it corresponds to our modern way of understanding 
citizenship.  Second, it recognizes the increased importance we 
give to the sentiment of belonging. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1035"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT7"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT7"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1035

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Traditionally, the Canadian concept of citizenship was better 
defined as the law of the soil rather than the law of the blood. 
Since the Canadian Citizenship Act of 1946, a child born of 
Mexican parents, for example, automatically became a Canadian 
citizen at birth if he was born on Canadian soil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even then, Canada was innovative.  Our country was beginning to 
distance itself from narrow nationalism based on the law of the 
blood, which had twice brought disaster to Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our citizenship supports our values, which lead to the law of 
the soil, and in turn, based on acceptance and collective 
construction, support citizenship.  Our citizenship is thus a 
constitutional identity rather than an organic, a tribal or even 
a mystic one. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This logic brings us to consider adopted children who, when this 
bill becomes law, will no longer be differentiated from natural 
born children.  This is one of the important changes proposed by 
Bill C-63. Our government recognizes the importance of adoption 
for the family.  And in fact for family members this will 
probably be one of the most critical events in their life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An immigrant who becomes a citizen enjoys the same rights as any 
other Canadian, but in return, he or she has an obligation to 
respect the values and standards that make these rights possible. 
These exclusive rights we must not forget are actually acquired 
privileges and such privileges do not come free of charge to 
anyone. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-63 introduces a modified oath that places greater emphasis 
on the defence of Canadian civic and democratic values, rather 
than merely seeking to create a formal attachment to an abstract 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada represents a particular set of values, experiences and 
feelings for each of us.  The suggested oath briefly summarizes 
the rights and responsibilities inherent in our citizenship and 
identity as Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is proud of its democratic principles and these 
principles apply to all residents.  Non-Canadian landed 
immigrants have the same rights as Canadians, with one 
exception: they may not take part in the political aspects of 
democracy in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other than that, a landed immigrant may enjoy all aspects of 
life in Canada and the accompanying economic and social rights. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later on if immigrants decide to really get involved in building 
our country, they will have to show that they are willing to do 
this in full knowledge of the requirements and responsibilities 
expected of citizens.  They will have to ask explicitly for the 
privilege of citizenship and show that they understand all the 
implications of this new status. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to look at the second aspect of the citizenship 
bill, the key role a feeling of belonging plays in national 
unity. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all aware that the rules of trade have changed a great 
deal.  Economic borders have become more permeable. International 
organizations and agreements such as NAFTA, APEC and WTO have 
codified laws and informal agreements that manage, encourage and 
facilitate transnational trade.  Because trade is increasingly 
carried out across borders, business men and women travel much 
more often than they have ever done. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government therefore understands the constraints faced by 
businessmen and women and recognizes the economic contribution 
they make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the present legislation, three years of residence in 
Canada are required during the four years preceding an 
application for citizenship.  However, in response to this new 
economic reality, Bill C-63 will allow a landed immigrant to 
reside in Canada for three years during a five-year period in 
order to qualify for citizenship.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not lose sight of the fact that citizenship is the 
cornerstone of political participation, a participation which is 
not fully possible for someone who has not had the opportunity 
to assimilate the country's values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to Bill C-63, however, we will now require physical 
presence by the immigrant, and “cut-rate” citizenship will no 
longer be available. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to address the most important topic, the loss 
or the denial of citizenship for reasons of serious crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government through Bill C-63 has shown that Canadians are 
not naive.  Because citizenship is such an important notion, 
utmost vigilance is required. Immigrants who have come to Canada 
by the use of fraud and who come here to take advantage of the 
Canadian way of life through a false declaration will find the 
door closed to them. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, persons guilty of serious crimes or deemed to be a 
threat to national security will continue to be unwelcome.  Bill 
C-63 enables us to tighten up this important means of rejection 
still further in order to protect Canadians properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same vein, the mechanisms for cancelling citizenship 
provided in Bill C-63 make it possible to do away with potential 
fraud or error by revoking the citizenship of persons who ought 
not to have been granted it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not in any way mean that we will treat old and new 
citizens differently by threatening new citizens with a 
punishment inapplicable to old ones, namely loss of their 
citizenship.  All citizens are equal; this is an inviolable 
principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, this is an acknowledgment that, since the conditions 
necessary for recognition of citizenship have not been met by 
certain persons, it will be as if citizenship had never been 
granted to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada wants good honest citizens who are able to integrate. 
Someone who has committed fraud in this connection has, quite 
obviously, never met the prerequisites of the law.  What is 
more, the serious crimes he has committed may rightly be 
interpreted as constituting a danger for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, in certain cases citizenship will no longer be as 
readily passed from generation to generation as in the past. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a family who has lived abroad for two generations, the third 
generation could now lose their citizenship at age 28. Let us use 
as an example a Canadian couple who today seeks a residence in 
another country.  Their children will remain Canadian citizens 
throughout their entire lives.  However, their grandchildren will 
have to come back and live in Canada for at least four years in 
the five years preceding their request to remain Canadian 
citizens and this before their 28th birthday. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like to add that Bill C-63 proposes 
legislation that is better suited to the Canada of today, while 
still retaining the historical, cultural and linguistic elements 
that have shaped the identity of our country, and continue to do 
so.  They will even be enhanced and enriched by the 
contributions of new arrivals from all of the world's regions 
and all of the world's cultures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether refugees or immigrants who have come to Canada to rejoin 
family members, to invest or to make new lives for themselves, 
these newcomers will understand, thanks to this new process of 
naturalization, that they are becoming members of a big family 
that owes them much but—and it is vital to keep this in mind—to 
whom they owe just as much.

I listened to the hon. member very carefully.  I have reviewed 
Bill C-63 thoroughly and have found that the minister has drafted 
her own wording on the citizenship oath in the bill.  The

family relations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She has completely ignored what Canadians are saying.  She has 
not consulted members of parliament.  There was no debate on 
those issues in the House.  She has completely ignored the 
recommendations of the citizenship and immigration committee, 
which is dominated by Liberals, on the subject of citizenship 
given by birth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have noticed in the bill that the minister has garnished more 
and more power around herself rather than use a democratic 
process and listen to Canadians from coast to coast to coast and 
have the involvement of members of parliament, the elected 
officials in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the minister has garnished more support around her and is 
making decisions behind closed doors without oversight by 
parliament, I would like to find out, if this is not Liberal 
arrogance, what it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am absolutely 
surprised by what the member of the official opposition has just 
said.  He said that the minister has ignored Canadians.  It seems 
to me that it is quite the opposite.  The minister has travelled 
from coast to coast to coast.  We all know that she travelled 
across Canada last year, met with hundreds of Canadians and asked 
for public consultation from coast to coast to coast.  She has 
done this in my own riding and throughout my home province of 
Quebec and other provinces.  That is one aspect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second aspect is that the intention of debate is to consult 
members not only of her caucus but of the other caucuses, the 
official opposition and the other opposition parties.  This is 
exact reason we have parliamentary debate.  It is Canadian 
tradition to debate a bill at second reading so I do not 
understand the comments of the hon. member across the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about citizenship by birth.  This particular bill 
continues the Canadian tradition of saying that children who are 
born on Canadian soil automatically become Canadian citizens. 
This is a longstanding tradition as I explained in the speech I 
just made.  We want to continue this most important Canadian 
tradition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask a question of the hon. member who I know is 
a Canadian that was not born here but was born elsewhere.  I 
cannot understand how people who have come here, who have been 
received into our Canadian family, can make comments which mean 
they would like to close the immigration door once they are on 
Canadian soil.  This is totally unacceptable.

<P><A NAME="LINK32"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to ask my colleague from Laval West a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When she talks of national cohesion in Canada, does she know 
what provision there is in the spirit of the law for Quebec and 
the people of Quebec, especially? In Quebec, we must remember, 
83% of the people do not speak the language of the majority of 
Canadians.  So, I would ask my colleague what provision is made 
for this fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the spirit of the Canadian arrangement, does this mean that 
newcomers arriving in Quebec find, although there is an obvious 
specificity, that this is not taken into account? Does this mean 
that, in the spirit of the legislation, the existence of 
Quebeckers as a people is denied, that Quebec is considered not 
only a province but a province just like all the others?  I 
would like to hear her response. 
deaf 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to hear the 
question from the hon. member of the opposition. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1050"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, there is a legal agreement between Quebec and the 
Canadian government with respect to immigration and refugees. 
The Government of Quebec has a large say in the criteria for 
accepting immigrants into Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind the member that the Government of Quebec already 
enjoys considerable autonomy in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the Government of Quebec has criteria such as 
knowledge of the French language and the culture of Quebec that 
it uses in screening immigrants wishing to come to Quebec.  That 
is one point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second is that, under this agreement, the Government of 
Quebec receives a large sum of money from the federal 
government, giving it complete control over all the budgets for 
integrating immigrants into Quebec society.  By integrating, I 
mean learning the French language and the culture of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Quebec receives the money from the federal 
government and allocates it for the provision of courses in the 
French language and the culture of Quebec.  Immigrants to Quebec 
are therefore able to learn the province's language and culture 
and be as fully integrated as possible into Quebec society. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member made 
some racist comments.  She said that since I was not born in 
Canada why was I trying to stop immigration.  That is not true. I 
have frequently been accused of this by members opposite.  They 
say that my party or myself is trying to stop immigration.  That 
is complete nonsense and out of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, the Liberals are bragging about what good 
they are allegedly doing for immigrants but then are doing the 
opposite to what they are saying.  When they came to office in 
1993 new immigrants were paying a $425 fee.  Now new immigrants 
are paying a $1,500 fee.  The extra $900 goes to general revenue 
to balance the budget.  It does not go to ESL. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is that $1,500 is about 15 days of average wages in 
Canada, in the U.K, in Australia or in New Zealand, but $1,500 is 
15 months wages in countries in Africa, in India, in Pakistan, in 
Sri Lanka and in Bangladesh.  If this is not a racist policy, 
what is it?  Is this not hampering people who come from those 
countries where it takes 15 more months to earn the money to pay 
the fee? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the hon. member makes those comments, could she justify 
this $1,500 head tax to fund Canada's revenue which on the other 
hand discourages people who come from those countries? How does 
she justify this?  How can she brag about how well her party is 
doing when it is doing the opposite of that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I take great exception 
to the charge of racism.  My record speaks for itself.  I have 
worked practically all my life with people from various 
backgrounds, no matter where they come from and no matter what 
colour they are.  I take great exception to this charge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not close our eyes to the fact that we may be born 
elsewhere.  It is not an insult to be born elsewhere.  It is a 
fact of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again the comments of the hon. member of the official 
opposition are on subjects that are absolutely not part of the 
debate.  When he first rose this morning he said that we were not 
having a debate about the citizenship question, so I challenged 
the member to speak on the question of citizenship.  Why does he 
want to go back to immigration?  We know there is a link between 
the two, but we also know that in the near future we will have a 
debate on immigration in the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask members of the official opposition and of all other 
opposition parties to debate the bill before us which deals with 
citizenship.  We will come to immigration in due time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK33"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to indicate at the beginning that I will be 
splitting my 20 minutes with the hon. member for Vancouver East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to be able to speak to the bill today.  I know that 
the member from Winnipeg Centre, our critic in this area, has 
already expressed the views and some of the concerns of our party 
on some aspects of bill, for instance with respect to the 
language requirements, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to pick up on the debate that has been going on in 
the House about citizenship and immigration because they are 
inextricably linked.  I do not think we can talk about one 
without talking about the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The points of order being expressed by the government are 
themselves out of order and show just how sensitive the 
government is.  It is funny for me, as was said earlier by a 
colleague, to listen to the Liberal Party accuse other parties of 
being anti-immigration when it is the party that brought in the 
$1,500 head tax and refused, against all advice to the contrary, 
to change that head tax.  Any self-righteousness on the part of 
Liberals in this respect is quite out of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also think it was quite out of order, and I say out of order 
politically, not procedurally, for the member to suggest that 
people who are immigrants to this country somehow should not be 
critical of particular aspects of the immigration policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is partly what is wrong with debate about immigration in this 
country and, for that matter, about a lot of the other debates we 
have in this place.  When people want to criticize a particular 
aspect of something, their motives are impugned and they are 
painted with a broad brush in some negative way.  It is high time 
that people were able to express concerns about particular 
aspects of the refugee and immigration system in this country and 
not be accused of racism and of being anti-immigrant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We clearly see that the government can do this.  The member who 
just spoke from the government side expressed concerns about 
criminals getting into the country and sent a warning to them. 
When she does that it is okay, but when others are concerned 
about that it is somehow not okay.  That is part of the problem. 
I too am concerned about what is happening to Canadian 
citizenship like so many other members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have people come into my constituency office.  They have very 
painful tales to tell about members of their families who have 
been left in other countries of the world and cannot come to 
Canada because of various technicalities in the Immigration Act. 
There are daughters who turned 19 before they came or who married 
not knowing that it would harm their chances.  There are families 
whose family circles are broken.  They have daughters and sons or 
sisters and brothers in other countries who are the last 
remaining members of their families in the country of origin.  It 
makes perfect sense to me that they should be able to reunite 
with their families, and they cannot do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where I want to talk about citizenship.  Yet if they 
have enough money they can get into this country any time they 
like. I have an ad which appeared in the <I>Latin Trade 
Magazine</I>. This <I>Latin Trade Magazine</I> is published out of 
Miami, Florida.  It caters to an elite business readership of 
approximately 86,000, over 40,000 from Latin American and 
Caribbean countries and 40,000 from the U.S. It is distributed on 
many Latin American airline routes.  It is distributed by the 
American chambers of commerce, world trade centres and other 
trade organizations through Latin America and can be found at 
upscale hotel chains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do these ads say?  They say “Guaranteed immigration to 
Canada”—just wait for the punch line—“with the purchase of a 
fleet rent a car franchise, a total investment of $50,000 
Canadian/approximately $30,000 U.S. you are guaranteed”—and 
guaranteed is underlined—“immigration to Canada, even with a 
criminal record”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry if being concerned about this makes me a racist but I 
do not think it does.  I am concerned that there can be ads in 
these kinds of magazines saying “You put enough money down on 
the table and you can get into this country no matter who you 
are”. It is a problem I have had with the investor immigrant 
program for a long time.  It has cheapened the notion of Canadian 
citizenship, that people can buy their way into this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find this ad particularly offensive and it is why I entered 
into the debate today.  It says “For information write 5950 
Bathurst Street, Suite 1009, Toronto, Ontario”, and it gives a 
fax number, et cetera. This is precisely one of the things that 
is wrong with our immigration policy.  I do not think Canadian 
citizenship is something that should be able to be bought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all should be concerned about any aspects of our immigration 
and refugee policy, particularly our immigration policy, which if 
it is not functioning properly does allow people who are 
undesirable to become Canadian citizens.  I do not see anything 
wrong with being concerned about that.  I think a lot of my 
constituents are concerned about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I make this point to the government.  The government has said 
there is action on immigration coming and it is somehow 
inappropriate for us to talk about immigration in the context of 
this Citizenship Act.  I do not think it is.  I think it is an 
opportunity for us to express some of the concerns that our 
constituents have. Certainly the constituent who brought this ad 
to me was very, very concerned that Canadian citizenship should 
be for sale in this particular way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just wanted to register my opposition to this particular 
notion of Canadian citizenship as something that can be bought 
and sold in the marketplace like any other commodity.  I do not 
believe that being a Canadian is a commodity.  I do not think it 
is something that can be bought.  There are a lot of people out 
there who want to be reunited with their families who should be 
given first consideration instead of people who can put $50,000 
Canadian down for buying some kind of fleet of rent a cars. 
<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>   Mr. 
Speaker, what a pleasure it is to hear reasoned debate from my 
colleague. I want to thank him for taking the opportunity to 
point out many of the same points that were pointed out earlier. 
I was glad that the government was actually listening instead of 
heckling. I hope that the message is getting through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there is a problem with the system it is our job as 
opposition members to point out the problems to the government so 
that it will take action to address the problems.  That is 
exactly what my colleague was pointing out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask my colleague this question.  He talked about 
citizenship of convenience and people buying their way into the 
country.  I want to make him aware of a comment made by a CIC 
official.  This is a person who works within the immigration 
department who says that he believes that part of the business 
entrepreneur category of citizenship is a way for people to buy 
their way into the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Coolen noted that this program “assists and promotes 
citizenship of convenience fraud, promotes abuse in national and 
provincial social programs and in my opinion is a national 
disgrace”. Later the same person working for immigration said 
“The program has never been audited since its inception in 1978. 
Any claims of investment or job creation are suspect and not 
reliable due to faulty methods of collection and the lack of any 
quality control”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is another example of an abuse of the system.  I would not 
mind hearing my colleague's comments on this example of fraud as 
one which he mentioned earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I did not use the term 
citizenship of convenience when I spoke.  Wherever citizenship is 
being used as a convenience or as a strategy or as an option, I 
think that is something we should be concerned about.  I was 
addressing the fact that people seem to be able to buy their way 
into the country and it is advertised blatantly that this is able 
to be done.  That is what I was expressing concern about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with this is not that it is fraud.  The problem is 
it seems that it is perfectly legal. We are not talking about 
fraud here; we are talking about what is admissible in the 
current system. 
There may be all kinds of problems with fraud but that is another 
matter altogether.  That is not what I was addressing.  I am 
addressing the way the system actually works when it is working 
according to the rules.  That is what disturbs me.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, to my friend 
opposite, one must first apply in the investor program.  One of 
the criteria for the investor program is that one also has to be 
ready to invest $250,000 into Canada, not $50,000, but $250,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend tells me there are consultants that create 
misimpressions about what the policy is about.  I do not disagree 
with him.  That is one of the reasons we have to review the act, 
which we will do after we deal with the Citizenship Act.  The 
matter of consultants is one area we have to pay particular 
attention to because all too often there are consultants who prey 
upon people wanting to go to another country.  We as a government 
have to guard against that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member against the legitimate use of the investor program 
to come into the country and is he against the entrepreneurial 
designation as well? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not take any comfort 
from the fact that it is not $50,000 but is $250,000.  In some 
ways depending on how we look at it, this only makes it worse. 
It is still a problem. We are not making a distinction here 
between a high priced brothel and a lower priced activity.  It is 
all the same. I think when we put a price on our citizenship, we 
are prostituting the notion of Canadian citizenship and I do not 
like it in whatever form it takes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate having this opportunity to speak to second reading of 
Bill C-63. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Representing the riding of Vancouver East has been a real 
privilege.  One of the real characteristics and part of what 
makes my community unique is the fact that it has long been in 
the history of Vancouver a place where new Canadians have sought 
to come, to make their home and put down roots, for families to 
raise their their children and to contribute to Vancouver, 
British Columbia and to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had interaction and discussions with people in my riding 
and organizations like Success, the Chinese Cultural Centre, the 
Chinese Benevolent Association, Mosaic, and the Filipino 
Association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whenever the government comes forward with discussion papers, 
and we have had the immigration and refugee legislative review, 
but whenever we have citizenship reviews there is always a lot of 
concern. People in my community understand that very often the 
issues of citizenship and immigration get cast about and thrown 
about in terms of the prevailing political winds of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my community citizenship and immigration have been absolutely 
integral in the development of the diversity and uniqueness of 
east Vancouver.  I think of my riding and the groups that are 
represented from Asia, south Asia, the Philippines, Europe, from 
all over the world and every part of the globe.  It makes this 
community very special.  It contributes to the richness of what 
we have. Vancouver is a great city because it is built on this 
wealth of diversity and cultural experience which provide a very 
strong economic base, a very strong cultural base and a very 
strong multilingual base.  That is something people are very 
proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have attended a number of citizenship ceremonies and I know 
how proud people are to become Canadian citizens.  I know what it 
means to them and I know what it means to me.  I remember 
becoming a Canadian citizen.  I remember that day as a young 
person and how it felt to become a citizen of a new country. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1110"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within that context I am glad to have the opportunity to speak 
on this bill because the changes in this bill will have an impact 
on what we do in the future in terms of citizenship.  From 
discussions I have had in my own community I know people are very 
concerned that the provisions in this bill will send out the 
message that Canada is not the welcoming place we read about and 
hear about from government material, from the Liberal red book 
and so on. The Liberal Party in government is not even meeting 
its own immigration and citizenship targets as outlined in the 
Liberals' red book.  They fall far short of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many MPs have probably had a similar experience with the system 
and what we have to deal with and what people have to go through 
in terms of the incredible bureaucracy. It is amazing when I deal 
with individual cases and find out the experiences people have 
had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One problem is that the system is very often suspicious of 
people.  The amount of red tape and bureaucracy involved in 
having a case sorted out and getting something through requires 
an incredible amount of dedication and resources and often a 
financial commitment. That contradicts other messages which are 
sent out by the government that Canada welcomes new immigrants 
and welcomes people to become citizens. These are issues we have 
to be very concerned about in the legislation and policy changes 
that come forward by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a lot of concern about the language requirements. 
It is easy to fall into the trap that we should get into major 
testing and that new immigrants should be fluent in one of the 
official languages.  I know from what takes place in my local 
community and from the contributions made by my constituents that 
language is not necessarily the issue upon which we can determine 
whether or not someone is part of a community and is 
contributing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of the history of Vancouver East and neighbourhoods like 
Strathcona, Chinatown, or Grandview Woodlands where Italians 
settled.  Many of the people who came to those communities were 
not proficient in either English or French and they still made an 
incredible contribution.  They created jobs.  They created new 
businesses.  They provided the cultural diversity which blossomed 
within the city. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The focus on the language requirement, and what many perceive to 
be a tightening of that requirement is causing very deep concern 
within the community. Government members, particularly those who 
represent ridings in which there is high cultural diversity, 
should be aware of this.  The signals being sent out concern a 
lot of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we go through these changes, and there are more to come, we 
have been told continually by the government that there have been 
mega consultations.  The feedback I get from my riding is that 
there is very strong concern about where this legislation and 
other proposals in the works are leading to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Winnipeg—Transcona pointed out that there is 
also a lot of concern about the head tax that still exists and 
the fact that it is very discriminatory.  There is still a lot of 
concern about citizenship being based on the ability to pay 
rather than on making sure our citizenship policy is based on 
welcoming all kinds of people from different economic and social 
classes.  These are matters of serious concern. 
What we want to do today is say to the government that this 
requires a serious review to make sure that the message that goes 
out is that Canada is a welcoming place, a place which does not 
place onerous requirements on people and say “you have to fit 
into this box in terms of language or in terms of money or where 
you come from, or we'll make sure that depending on where you 
apply to come in, you may or may not get through because there so 
much discretion in the system”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those of the kinds of things we want to get away from.  We want 
to get back to what I believe is a very strong historical role 
for Canada, that this country was built on new citizenship and 
built on the contribution of many different kinds of people. That 
is what has made this country great.  It is something I am very 
proud of in east Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I express those concerns to the government members, to the 
Liberal Party, and say we have to proceed very cautiously in this 
direction.  People understand that the future of Canada in terms 
of what kind of people come here, what kind of rules we have 
hangs in the balance.  I have no doubt that members have heard 
those concerns expressed but we want to make sure that those 
concerns are acted on and that Canada's policies for citizenship 
are welcoming, open and fair. 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to make a few comments on this bill today.  Immigration 
is a very important area of concern.  It is an area in which all 
of us as Canadians have a stake.  Hopefully we can look at the 
policies of the immigration department and conclude that they 
have over the years served our country well.  I think by and 
large the policies have served us well for a number of years. 
Now it is time to update the act so that these policies can move 
us into the new millennium reflecting the concerns of prospective 
immigrants and Canadians generally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One point I would like to make deals with confirming that all 
children born in Canada, except the children of foreign 
diplomats, will automatically become Canadian citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out to the minister of immigration that perhaps 
this ignores the problem of someone entering Canada, making a 
refugee claim, having a child while in Canada and then having the 
refugee claim refused. What do we do with the child if the parent 
has to be deported?  Can we force the parent to leave knowing 
that the infant Canadian citizen will either be abandoned here or 
should such an infant accompany the parent even if the parent is 
returning to an undesirable part of the world? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are difficult questions.  No doubt the courts or our 
United Nations obligations will tell us the answers in due 
course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new act treats children adopted abroad much the same as 
children born here.  I understand the minister's desire not to 
put an undue stigma on adopted children, but Canadians should 
understand as well that the change removes the requirement that 
children adopted abroad have the normal medical and other checks 
required of an immigrant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question here to the minister of immigration is are Canadians 
generally aware of that change and would they support it if they 
were fully aware of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new citizenship act requires that to be eligible to become a 
citizen on has to reside physically here for three years.  Now it 
allows one five years to accumulate these three years of actual 
residence.  That is something that we can all support, given the 
highly mobile workforce we are into today in this global 
economy. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1120"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we can all accept that.  However, I sincerely hope there 
are bureaucratic mechanisms to check on the facts of residency. 
Simply having a mailing address here in Canada is not enough and 
that has been the case in some instances in the past. People 
would apply for citizenship in Canada and simply have a mailing 
address here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no problem with requiring that a citizenship applicant as 
opposed to a new refugee for example be required to speak English 
or French, or have some working knowledge of English or French, 
and some knowledge of Canada generally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need standardized testing or other mechanisms to ensure that 
such knowledge and language skills are indeed real and not simply 
something that will be seen on an application form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased that so-called citizenship judges are being removed 
from the decision making loop.  Decisions on citizenship should 
be made by professional civil servants who have training and who 
have experience in the field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure all of us as MPs deal with immigration cases almost on 
a daily basis.  My experience as an MP dealing with actual cases 
that come across my desk is that there are often inconsistencies 
in treatment from one officer to another.  Firm guidelines for 
decision making are required so that there is a high likelihood 
that a decision made on an individual in the Vancouver office is 
consistent with the decision made on an individual in the Toronto 
office. I am sure that in committee we have heard complaints 
associated with that concern in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the replacement of judges with commissioners, I am 
wondering, and I think a lot of people would wonder, if these 
people are really needed.  Is it just another avenue for 
government to make patronage appointments?  If there is a public 
role to be performed in promoting the value of Canadian 
citizenship I suggest that the minister co-ordinate these efforts 
with the heritage minister as was pointed out by a member of the 
official opposition a couple of weeks ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 43 of the act makes provision for making regulations on 
a host of issues.  I have concerns about the widespread use of 
regulations.  Since regulations are made internally they can be 
changed internally and not necessarily debated here in the House 
of Commons or not necessarily be made available to the media for 
full and open scrutiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the oath of citizenship, I have no problems with 
swearing allegiance to the Queen since Canada is still a 
parliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarchy.  We all 
have to swear an oath to take our place here in the House of 
Commons.  As for the other parts of the oath there should be more 
public consultation as to the wording of it.  There is no problem 
with the public being involved as long as the constitutional 
bases are covered and indeed it would be beneficial to have some 
kind of public consultation or debate on the value of Canadian 
citizenship generally.  It would be beneficial for all of us here 
in the House of Commons and also for all Canadians to hear from 
time to time the value of being a Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the new laws in the world will not improve the citizenship 
application and approval process if the proper systems are not 
put in place.  Many of the problems with the current system come 
from the many inconsistencies in policy application and the lack 
of financial resources to do the proper jobs. 
The laws are no good if they are unworkable or if they are 
totally unenforceable.  What is needed first and foremost is the 
political will to do a good job and the personnel and funds to 
carry it out.

congratulate the member for St. John's East. It is refreshing to 
have somebody stand and talk to the specifics of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member agrees with getting rid of citizenship court judges 
but he wonders about the need for citizenship commissioners.  One 
of the problems we have in this country is that Canadians do not 
know enough about our history, which is an incredible history, 
and that we are not promoting Canadian citizenship the way we 
should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issues the member raised regarding the language requirements 
will be a topic of debate in committee and we will get to 
committee as soon as we pass second reading in the House. After 
we deal with this act we will be returning with other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member raised a good question as it relates granting 
citizenship status.  To the Reform Party I say it really is 
enlightening to have a pan-Canadian party, as the Conservative 
Party is, instead of a regional party, which the Reform Party is, 
stand in the House and seriously debate the substance of the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member raised the concern about granting citizenship to 
people born in this country.  He raised the issue that it could 
be a child of a refugee.  He is concerned about the implications. 
We are not aware of this being abused.  Is the member aware of 
some situation where it has been abused?  If so we would like to 
know about it.

for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not aware of any particular instance where that clause has 
been abused.  One of the responsibilities we have as members is 
to look for possible loopholes in the act. In going over the act 
I find that to be a loophole that ignored the problem of someone 
entering Canada, making a refugee claim, having the child and 
then the refugee claim being refused.  What happens in that 
instance?  What do we do with the child if the parent has to be 
deported?  That is a reasonable concern. Can we force the parent 
to leave knowing that the infant Canadian citizen is here and 
could be abandoned?  Or do we simply force the parent to take the 
child back to wherever the refugee came from, knowing it might be 
an undesirable part of the world? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a concern.  It should be raised in the House of Commons. 
The minister should address the concern and bring an answer back 
to the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to address Bill C-63.  I want to concentrate on 
several issues within it.  I will be splitting my time.  The 
member for West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast will follow me, and all 
subsequent members from the Reform Party will be splitting their 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is necessary to look at the whole citizenship issue in terms 
of the quality and quantity of citizens in Canada.  We first have 
to ask ourselves what comes first, the citizen or the immigrant. 
As all of us know the answer is that the immigration system comes 
first and it dictates the quality of citizens in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further to that I think quality of life in Canada is dependent 
upon the quality of all citizens regardless of their place of 
origin.  As we go along in the evolution of this country we have 
to keep that in mind.  For the six Liberals who are sitting in 
the House today, not very many listening to their own bill, we 
will try to make clear to them what the issues are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier one of our colleagues, the House leader of the NDP, 
discussed the issue of an advertisement in the <I>Latin Trade 
Magazine</I>.  As a matter of fact I raised this issue some time 
ago but I just want to further elaborate on it because I feel the 
same way as he does.  The very fact that ads like this are in 
magazines in other countries does not bode well for this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The image is that one can get into Canada regardless of one's 
status in one's own country.  In fact that is quite true.  The ad 
states a person is guaranteed immigration to Canada with the 
purchase of a fleet rent a car franchise for a total investment 
of $50,000.  It says in the ad that a person is guaranteed 
immigration to Canada even with a criminal record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has to wonder what possesses people in Canada to advertise 
this in other countries.  A while back I had a little talk with 
this company and I can assure members that what is in here is in 
fact true.  In fact this company takes money from individuals, 
even if they are criminals; buys some cars and I am sure pockets 
a good deal of the change; and marks up the value of those cars 
enough to justify the individual coming into this country.  It 
has closed its doors since we raised this issue or at least its 
phone calls have been relocated somewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When asked whether or not a person from another country with a 
criminal record could buy into it, the answer was: “You can get 
into Canada with criminal records.  In fact, if you go from this 
particular country to Russia and then to Europe, you could 
probably squeeze into Canada that way and through this 
sponsorship program”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pursued it a lot further than that.  The police actually 
investigated the company.  The file was forwarded to the 
Department of Justice for a decision on whether to lay a charge. 
Of course the Department of Justice did not lay a charge because 
it thought there were the usual legal industry technicalities to 
get away with it under the Immigration Act.  It said it could not 
push it because the Immigration Act was so flexible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read the Immigration Act which basically states that in the 
Immigration Act or in the enforcement of its policies a person 
with a criminal record in whatever country is precluded from 
applying to immigrate to Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also happens there are indications that this particular 
company is connected to the Russian Mafia.  Is this a surprise in 
the House of Commons?  Wrong.  The Liberal government knows about 
the ads.  The Liberal government knows how this is working.  Yet 
the Liberal government allows it to continue.  When government 
brings an act into the House, a citizenship act, knowing full 
well that ultimately those individuals will become Canadian 
citizens, exactly what does it think those individuals will be 
doing?  Will they become ministers or engineers in Canada?  What 
does it think the citizenship will be after they arrive? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes to show that on the surface bills like this one look 
great.  Basically it is platitudes to the rest of us because 
there is much more wrong with the system today than citizenship. 
I have attended lots of citizenship ceremonies since I have been 
an MP.  I have attended lots of deportation hearings of 
criminals. I have been an intervener in those hearings.  Yet the 
government fights harder and harder and spends more money for 
criminals to stay here than it does for law-abiding citizens who 
immigrate to this country to stay here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to tell the House about some of the individuals I 
have dealt with.  When I have be dealing with these individuals I 
have wondered why the government is hell bent on keeping these 
individuals in Canada, knowing full well that ultimately they 
will become citizens.  For the five Liberals in the House, I 
would really like to get my message across. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for 
Langley—Abbotsford knows that it is improper to make reference 
to the presence or absence of members in the House, particularly 
the absence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have made speeches before too, and I know there is an argument 
to be made that in referring to the number of members here you 
are actually referring to the presence of members and not the 
absence.  I have found myself in difficulty in doing that in the 
past and I know the hon. member would want to comply with the 
rules in every respect and set an example for all members of his 
party.  After all, he is the House leader and therefore he would 
want to comply with the rules in every respect.  I think he knows 
it is perhaps not quite in accordance with the standing orders to 
refer to the number of members who are here, with the suggestion 
that there is a bunch who is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members have other responsibilities.  He knows that.  Perhaps he 
could resume his remarks without those kinds of references. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I kind of 
thought the House leader of the official opposition had some kind 
of special privilege in the House to identify there were not that 
many around on the other side to listen to the fact that Bill 
C-63 was supposed to be an important bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to the difficulties I am having with this 
contradiction of the Liberals, so to speak, on one side we are 
funding through government dollars, through legal aid, to keep 
criminals in the country, as well as allowing advertising 
inviting criminals to the country.  On the other side they are 
saying that they are opening up the legislation for citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We only have to listen to a few stories like the 80-plus 
Honduran gang in Vancouver that has been openly selling drugs to 
our kids on the street.  Not too long ago the police in Vancouver 
arrested these thugs and yet not one of them has been deported. 
They will very likely be staying in this country and will 
ultimately become citizens.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have cases upon cases of individuals who are basically 
undesirable in our country wreaking havoc among our citizenry, 
selling drugs and whatnot.  Yet the Liberals are hell bent on 
determining that we should improve the system of citizenship to 
make sure some of these people stay.  That is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Citizenship Act provides now for immigrants to come into the 
country and be citizens.  We are happy for that, but the front 
end take of the immigration system is flawed.  The patronage 
appointment system to the refugee board and the immigration board 
is flawed.  I know members opposite do not want to hear this but 
it is flawed.  I have been through that more than anybody in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder why, for instance, the refugee system is currently 
entertaining an application from an American.  Why is it that we 
are entertaining a refugee application from an American?  I tried 
to be an intervener in that process and was cut off.  The 
individual applicant basically said “It is a matter of my 
privacy and you cannot come in”.  Now I have to fight that, get 
on the inside and find out what the problem is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A fellow by the name of Montenegro, a Honduran drug dealer with 
numerous trafficking charges, has claimed refugee status. Why? To 
beat a deportation certificate.  I applied to attend the refugee 
hearing but as soon as the refugee board got my application as an 
intervener it gave him a hearing because it did not want the 
spotlight on this individual.  I told the board to make its 
decision and let me know what it did with him.  The board said 
“No, that is privacy and we will not tell you what we did with 
him”.  I happen to know that individual is still in the country 
and will ultimately perhaps become a citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is this citizenship legislation that so few Liberals want 
to listen to?  The front end of our citizenship program in this 
country has to be immigration and the immigration system cannot 
be flawed.  My message to the Liberals is to concentrate on what 
has to be changed, and that is a very flawed immigration-refugee 
system. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I point out 
to the hon. member that when people who are here on refugee 
status get charged they are presumed to be innocent until they 
are convicted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member is telling the House that as soon as a charge is 
laid we should then consider the individual guilty, I wish he 
would stand in his place and say so because due process applies 
to everybody in Canada.  Mr. Sekora— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. parliamentary secretary 
knows he will have to use the proper constituency name.  I am 
sure he is referring to the hon. member for Port 
Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam.  I hope that is what he meant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is certainly what I 
meant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That member said if someone is convicted, not charged but 
convicted.  I think it is important for the Reform Party to 
understand the difference because it really determines the kind 
of country we are living in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are countries in the world, on the planet, where once one 
is charged one is deemed to be guilty.  Maybe that is what the 
Reform Party wants, but certainly the government does not want 
that and most Canadians do not want that. 
The member referred to the Hondurans who are charged before the 
courts.  I can assure the member that once a person is convicted 
that is very much taken into account as to whether that person is 
allowed to stay in this country. I would venture to say that 
people who are convicted of drug offences will not find 
themselves granted citizenship. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1145"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, if the member were to examine that he would notice 
that in cases where people are applying for citizenship and they 
are facing a criminal charge or if they are on probation, then 
they will not get citizenship during that period of time.  I 
think it is important for the member to let Canadians know that 
yes, we are very much concerned about making sure people who come 
to this country and acquire their citizenship are going to be 
contributing to this country, instead of focusing continually on 
the small percentage of people who cause us problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B> Mr. Speaker, if this member ever came to 
my community he would find out that this is not such a small 
problem. The fact is these Hondurans are on film.  They have been 
selling drugs to our kids in Vancouver. They have every 
opportunity and will very likely stay in this country because 
this deportation system does not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is there was a fellow in my riding, until I had him 
removed to Laos, Boungan Inthavong, who got his refugee status 
while in prison.  It was given to him to block his deportation 
after he had beaten a 17-year old to death with a bat in my 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can cite dozens of examples like this. The problem is this 
government has no clue whatsoever of how serious the problem is. 
Individuals in this country convicted of crimes very seldom are 
deported because this government has a policy of spending 
taxpayer money to defend them at the same time it is spending 
taxpayer money to deport them.  It is the only government in the 
world that fights itself and loses. 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak in this debate today.  It 
was interesting to listen to the parliamentary secretary talk 
about what is happening in this area.  The citizenship bill was 
brought to the minister by this House four and a half years ago. 
We have had to wait four and a half years for legislation that is 
not going to solve the problem of when people come to Canada 
until they become citizens of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is amazing to me to listen to the parliamentary secretary 
talk about the Reform Party.  I also heard the member for 
Kitchener—Waterloo, a parliamentary secretary, and also the 
member for Laval West talk about the Reform Party and our 
position on immigration and how we do not like immigrants, how we 
do not want immigrants in this country, and he is nodding his 
head.  It is a bunch of nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the parliamentary secretary, when he has some time 
instead of sitting there in his political way looking at these 
partisan issues, to sit down and talk to the member for 
Edmonton—Strathcona in my party, talk to a man who was a 
refugee, an immigrant to this country who is now a citizen and a 
member of parliament; talk to the member for Dauphin—Swan River 
who came to this country and is not only a citizen of this 
country now but is also a member of parliament; talk to the 
member for Surrey Central who came to this country as a refugee, 
an immigrant, and became a citizen of this country and was 
elected to the Parliament of Canada; talk to the member for 
Calgary East who came to this country as a refugee, an immigrant, 
and is now a member of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member wants to talk about citizenship, he should 
talk to the Reform Party.  We are out there listening to people. 
We have members elected by Canadians who know what immigration is 
all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary can smile about that but we are here 
to improve the country for Canadians.  We like immigrants. We 
know Canada is built on immigrants.  That is why we have the 
largest number of immigrants elected in this party right here in 
this parliament than any other party.  The member can check those 
numbers out and find out I am correct. 
We are talking ratios of our party to any party in this House. We 
have more than all the other opposition parties combined.  We 
have done that because our party does go out and talk to the 
immigrants of this country.  We have talked to the people who are 
building Canada.  We are very proud of what we are doing and of 
what we are doing in this House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government wants to talk about citizenship.  It has taken 
four and a half years.  Government members have talked about 
penalties for bureaucratic delays.  When I read that section of 
the bill it made me smile.  The current act allows an individual 
whose application for permanent residence is approved to count 
each full day of residency in Canada from the date they put their 
application in.  That makes sense.  You are living here, you are 
an immigrant to Canada, you are applying to become a citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the government do in this bill?  Bill C-63 removes 
that provision so applicants will now be penalized for the 
system's bureaucratic delays even when the delays are through no 
fault of the applicant.  What does that mean?  I cannot believe 
any responsible person elected to this House would allow this 
section to be in the bill.  It obviously could not have been read 
by the minister, the parliamentary secretary or anybody else on 
that side of the House.  This is a bureaucratic insert in the 
bill.  I say that because bureaucrats like delays. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the immigration department when it comes to 
delays.  Let us look at the L.A. office.  A person from Hong Kong 
applied through the L.A. office because they had been turned down 
in Hong Kong.  This party brought it to the attention of the 
House.  This party forced the government into having an 
investigation of that application through the L.A. office.  It 
was party that got a person appointed to go down there to have a 
look at it.  The person came back with a report saying that it 
was all a big mistake, there was no criminality but just a big 
mistake.  He should never have been approved there.  Somebody 
forgot to punch it in the computer to find out he had been 
refused.  He is now sitting in Canada.  He is one of the biggest 
crooks in the world and he is still in Canada, still in British 
Columbia.  He will probably get some citizenship somewhere along 
the line because we will not have the guts to deport him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what this bill is about, bureaucratic delays.  We do not 
need those bureaucratic delays.  It was this party that brought 
to the attention of the government that up to $200,000 went 
missing in the L.A. office.  That was well over a year ago and we 
have yet to hear what has happened to that $200,000.  We know the 
RCMP was investigating.  We know the police in L.A. were 
investigating.  We know somebody has taken off with the money but 
where is it?  We do not know and the bureaucrats do not want us 
to know because they are afraid it might embarrass this 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet what do we have in this bill?  A section that says 
bureaucratic delays are taken away from your time when you are 
applying to become a citizen.  That does not sound to me like a 
party that wants to create citizens in Canada.  It wants to delay 
your citizenship.  That is in this bill.  It is not a very good 
section of the bill.  It is really rather embarrassing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a lot of other very upsetting areas of this bill.  The 
most upsetting part of all is that we have not really got to the 
major parts of what is wrong with this whole department. Here we 
have a minister who takes four and a half years after a 
parliamentary committee makes a recommendation to make changes in 
citizenship and other areas, and what do we have?  We have a bill 
on citizenship with loads of holes and loads of faults, one of 
which I just mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where are the bills on the refugee issue?  Where are the bills 
on the criminality?  All we have seen from this minister in the 
last year and a half is two big press conferences, big thick 
books full of things she is going to do, and then she changes her 
mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the scanning process to make sure these illegal 
refugees do not get in this country?  That is an issue everybody 
in the committee agreed on, even the Liberals who sat on that 
side, yet it will not even be in the legislation according to the 
minister's latest press release.  She is not looking at that 
problem because it does not suit her needs or her plans. This 
minister has sat on her seat for four and a half years with no 
legislation for immigration.  We have a citizenship bill that is 
full of holes but it is not the major problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year's auditor general's report talked about 20,000 people 
being ordered deported from this country.  How many have been 
deported?  Four thousand.  When we asked the department where the 
other 16,000 were, it was not quite sure.  They probably 
reapplied to get their citizenship.  We want to talk about this 
bill.  Where are those people today?  Probably still roaming 
Canada somewhere although the department says that some of them 
may have crossed the border and gone somewhere else.  I doubt 
that very much.  It seems there is more crossing the border to 
come into Canada than going the other way.  That includes what my 
colleague, the House leader, talked about with the Hondurans in 
British Columbia.  The member smiles on the other side and asks 
if they have been convicted yet.  Yes, a lot of them have been 
convicted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in Vancouver with a bunch of Vancouver police and some 
RCMP immigration officers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were looking down to the east side of Vancouver where a lot 
of people come when they arrive in Canada while waiting to apply 
for citizenship. We were talking to a young 17 year old fellow 
from Honduras.  He produced his papers for us.  This young man 
had been in the country nine days.  He was wearing quite nice 
clothes.  The policeman said “You're mumbling.  You have 
something in your mouth.  Spit it out.” So he spit out $1,700 
worth of crack cocaine.  This man was 17 years old from Honduras 
and has been in downtown Vancouver for nine days. They just 
kicked him in the pants and told him to disappear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the Vancouver police why they did not arrest him. As 
members know, in British Columbia the police cannot lay charges. 
Charges have to be laid by a crown prosecutor.  Crown prosecutors 
in British Columbia with a socialist government have told the 
police they do not want so many people in jail so eliminate some 
of the problems they have.  It is not worthwhile to arrest this 
fellow.  These are the words of the Vancouver police. They are 
frustrated over this whole issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I then turned to the RCMP officers and said why not at least get 
his name and his landed immigrant or refugee file number. The 
police cannot do that because he has not been convicted.  This is 
the magic word from the parliamentary secretary.  Has he been 
convicted yet? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of society do we live in where we have to have a 
conviction?  I was there. I saw the man spit the crack cocaine 
out.  It is an illegal substance.  We know he is peddling or 
using it.  He should have been taken in.  At least we should be 
telling the refugee officials this guy is in the drug business 
and should be sent back to Honduras right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be rounding these people up, putting them on an 
airplane and sending them right back to Honduras.  It is not a 
bad place to be.  Certainly Canada is better but there is process 
people must apply through to come to this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned people in my party who came here as refugees and 
immigrants.  Talk to the member for North Vancouver.  He came 
here as an immigrant and applied. The member for Wild Rose came 
here as an immigrant and applied through the system.  What is 
wrong with the system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is wrong with the system is sections of Bill C-63 that talk 
about allowing the bureaucrats to use the days of their delay to 
delay the right of somebody to become a citizen in this country. 
I want these immigrants to become citizens of Canada.  We should 
be encouraging it.  The bureaucrats of this bill will be able to 
take three, four, five, six years to allow people who are 
legitimate refugees to become citizens of this great country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are as concerned as anybody regarding this situation of 
immigration and citizenship.  But this bill should not have been 
the first bill in this House. The minister should get the other 
legislation here that all Canadians want. I hope we can get this 
section changed in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No immigrant in this country should have their citizenship 
delayed because some bureaucrat wants to sit on it for another 30 
or 60 days.  It should not be a penalty for them. We should 
penalize the bureaucrats and give the immigrant a double day 
bonus for every day the bureaucrats delay him or her. This bill 
is wrong and we will oppose it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member 
talked about what I deduce he believes are instant citizens.  In 
other words, once a person comes to this country that is the 
automatic acceptance of their commitment to our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the process is established to ensure that the person 
living here becomes familiar with our customs, our culture and 
our history.  I think that is very important and they can 
actually prove they have taken the time and made the effort to 
learn who we are as a people before they declare their 
citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was surprised at the member's cavalier attitude that once 
someone is landed in this country we should suddenly grant them 
citizenship.  Is that the thrust of the member's argument? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is not a cavalier 
attitude.  We have a process and we agree with that process.  A 
person has to be here for a certain period of time and study this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member to read this bill, because I am sure he is 
sincere, and the section concerning the legal amount of time to 
become a citizen. I am sure the member, like I, would like every 
immigrant who comes to this country to become a citizen of Canada 
so they can vote and participate in what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But right now this bill says after the period of time the person 
has been here, puts their application in, the days they have been 
here after that do not count.  They should count for the amount 
of time they have been here.  This allows the bureaucrats any 
delays they want.  They can delay citizenship as long as they 
want with no penalties to the bureaucrats at all.  I think that 
is wrong and I think the member would agree it is wrong.

delays should not be counted against anyone.  I think everybody 
in this House would want it.  Anybody who comes to this country 
usually wants to become a citizen.  We should do what we can to 
encourage them.  I agree there are the three years they are here 
which used to be five years.  That is the time in which they 
assimilate into the community and learn the Canadian ways. I 
would hope we would encourage people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember speaking with David Lam, who was lieutenant governor 
of British Columbia when I was speaker of the British Columbia 
legislature. He asked me to an ethnic dinner. He made a speech 
about people not living with their own people when they came to 
Canada. He advised Italians not to live in little Italy, and 
Chinese not to live in Chinatown but to live in the community. 
This was not me speaking.  It was David Lam, an immigrant to 
Canada who rose to the highest post possible in our province as 
lieutenant governor.  He was one of the greatest lieutenant 
governors we ever had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about studying the citizenship papers.  He advised 
listeners to get their Canadian citizenship and become part of 
the community. I believe deeply in that.  We should be 
encouraging people.  We do not do enough of that.  This is not 
partisan politics now.  No matter what party is in power we 
should be encouraging everybody who comes here as an immigrant to 
get those papers, study hard and become a Canadian, part of the 
Canadian mosiac.

Speaker, my colleague has spent a great deal of time in politics. 
He is very wise in the area of looking at a system and seeing the 
problems and then looking for solutions that would make the 
system better.  I too had the opportunity to go to Vancouver and 
witness the kinds of things he mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the parliamentary secretary and the government do not 
really want to hear today about the problems with the system. 
That has been shown in their attitudes here today.  I would not 
mind hearing from my colleague what it is that he believes the 
minister should be focusing on rather than this particular piece 
of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have already mentioned 
the one fault with the bill.  There is another issue which I am 
sure my colleague from Burnaby will be speaking on.  It is where 
the minister will have the power to redefine the family in this 
bill before the Parliament of Canada decides who should be 
redefining the family. Those are two issues of the bill which are 
of concern to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main issue in this whole area is that the minister should be 
looking at the refugee problem and how it is happening.  How are 
people getting across our border every day just by using the word 
refugee, while legitimate people from other parts of the world 
who want to come to Canada through the normal process are held 
back? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the parliamentary secretary can go on and on but as the 
auditor general said, 20,000 people were ordered deported last 
year and only 4,000 were deported.  The same thing happens every 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a lot of serious problems.  This bill is not touching 
one one-hundredth of one per cent of the problems with 
immigration.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to discuss Bill C-63, an act respecting Canadian 
citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citizenship is an issue that is very important to me, both 
personally and as a member of parliament.  As an immigrant 
myself, I chose Canada as my country where I would live, work, 
raise a family and serve the community. As the member of 
parliament for Vancouver Kingsway, I represent one of the most 
ethnically and culturally diverse ridings in the country.  I 
represent constituents who immigrated to Canada from countries 
around the globe, individuals from Italy, Portugal, Korea, Japan, 
India, China and many others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand well how important it is that Canada has 
citizenship legislation that is up to date.  We must clearly 
reflect contemporary Canadian values.  Bill C-63 aims to 
modernize Canada's citizenship legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Before 1947 when the first Canadian Citizenship Act was 
implemented, people born in Canada were considered to be British 
subjects.  Of course the concept of citizenship has evolved over 
time.  On the eve of the new century the Minister of Citizenship 
and Immigration has tabled the citizenship of Canada act.  I 
would like to explain some of the changes the bill outlines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time all children born in Canada are granted 
citizenship regardless of the immigration or citizenship status 
of their parents.  Bill C-63 does not propose a change to this 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citizenship is also granted to children born outside the country 
to Canadian parents.  The implementation of this legislation 
would mean Canadian children born abroad would be required to 
meet residency requirements by the age of 28 in order to maintain 
their citizenship.  This proposed requirement reflects the 
importance that Canadians attach to having strong ties to Canada 
as a condition of citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the act would end discrimination against Canadian 
parents who adopt a child overseas.  With the proposed changes, 
adopted children would be granted citizenship without having to 
go through the immigration process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-63 would also make changes to residency requirements for 
immigrants.  The legislation proposes that individuals applying 
for citizenship would live in Canada for at least three of the 
five years.  These residency requirements ensure that prospective 
Canadians become familiar with life in Canada and demonstrate 
their commitment to our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation would also increase the chances for family 
reunification. We understand that need and respect the wishes of 
the Canadian family.  It is important to have the family united 
in this land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also makes changes to the roles and the 
responsibilities of citizenship judges.  Their title would be 
changed to citizenship commissioner.  Their responsibilities 
would involve conducting ceremonies, advising the minister upon 
request and promoting citizenship.  The new rules would guard 
against the abuse of powers or other offences committed in the 
context of duty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also proposes changes to the oath sworn by new 
Canadians when they obtain their citizenship.  New citizens would 
swear allegiance to Canada and loyalty to Canada's head of state, 
Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.  New Canadians would commit to 
respect Canada's laws, rights and freedoms.  The new oath will 
demonstrate attachment and commitment to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada depends on the commitment of people from diverse 
backgrounds to build a future together based on the sharing of 
such Canadian values as democracy, human rights and respect for 
the rule of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an immigrant I am proud to be a Canadian and I am proud to be 
the member of parliament for Vancouver Kingsway.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it was 
interesting that the official opposition was concerned about the 
numbers of government members in the House for this debate.  I 
was wondering about the arithmetic but I stand corrected, I 
thought there was no opposition member where in fact there is 
one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gives me great pleasure to enter this debate on Bill C-63, an 
act to amend our Citizenship Act.  I understand that the 
Citizenship Act has not been amended since 1947. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an interesting day to have this debate because yesterday 
was flag day to honour the 34th birthday of our great flag.  It 
was my privilege to be part of a number of celebrations that 
occurred in my riding yesterday.  It is something I have been 
promoting.  When this first came about, only one school in my 
riding celebrated it and now about 10 schools are celebrating 
flag day.  Hopefully some day it will be a national holiday and a 
national event for Canadians to celebrate another part of their 
heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a young country in the family of nations. At the same 
time we are continuing to evolve and build our traditions. A 
number of issues come out when I look at one aspect of the bill, 
clause 34 which deals with the oath of citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was first elected I went to a lot of citizenship 
ceremonies.  Sadly there are not as many in my riding now because 
the judge system has changed.  It was a tremendous event. Young 
and old people came to this country not because they were forced 
to but through selection.  They wanted to come here for a very 
important reason.  They wanted to leave possibly a poorer 
lifestyle to come and share in our lifestyle, our culture and our 
traditions.  They wanted very much to be part of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those were great celebrations.  There were people from all over 
the world who had spent five years in this country and had taken 
the time to study our history, our traditions and our culture. 
It was such an important day in their lives to swear allegiance 
to this country and to take their position along with the rest of 
us, having no less rights and freedoms than anyone else in this 
country.  For anyone who has attended those ceremonies, it cannot 
help but be an uplifting experience to see what a great country 
this is.  I sometimes think one of the problems is that not 
enough Canadians go overseas to really appreciate what a great 
country Canada is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at the oath of citizenship I see three themes. 
Strangely enough, I have studied the oaths in other countries and 
the themes are somewhat similar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first deals with respect for our democratic traditions. 
Canadians have developed their own unique traditions.  We have 
certainly borrowed from other countries in the past.  Notably the 
British common law system and also the French civil law system 
are a part of our culture.  We have developed on that footing to 
evolve our own democratic traditions and ideals which has taken 
us over 100 years to do. What is important is that we have done 
that within Canada, Canadians dealing with each other, making 
comprises with each other and trying to understand each other and 
evolving their political traditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another theme seems to be rights and freedoms.  Those same 
people I talked about who came to this country very much 
understand what it is like to have rights and freedoms.  They may 
possibly have come from countries that did not have those rights 
and freedoms. Canadians developed their own charter of rights and 
freedoms.  In this place and in other legislatures in this 
country we have developed a whole body of rights and freedoms 
which we commonly respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other theme seems essentially to be a respect for our laws. 
In other words we swear an oath saying we believe that even if 
the laws of the country are not just, we agree to abide by them 
and try to work within the political system to change them. 
However, at first blush we accept the laws of our country and we 
will respect them.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have studied this issue of oath because it interested me.  In 
Carswell's Canadian Law Dictionary the definition is the basic 
purpose of an oath is to bind the consciousness of the witness. 
In other words, the conscience of the person who is taking this 
oath tells him that he must respect the rights and freedoms of 
these people.  Canadians respect their laws and respect their 
democratic values.  This is a very powerful statement of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am alluding to is that section 34 does not quite address 
what I think is an important aspect.  That is Canadians have 
developed all the functions of a legal framework.  There have 
been Canadians who have taken some of those traditions, evolved 
them and made them into something unique. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we face the next millennium which is months away it seems 
appropriate that Canadians stand up and make their statement that 
their oath of allegiance is to Canada.  It partially says that 
but it goes a little further.  My colleague who just spoke 
specifically mentioned the oath. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the last election I made a certain point to go beyond the 
so-called oath of the House of Commons. It is important because 
it is more significant than the traditional oath. I said that I 
do solemnly affirm my true allegiance to Canada in conformity 
with the Constitution of Canada.  Something to this effect is a 
more appropriate oath for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people will mention the monarchy.  I am not opposed.  I am 
not an anti-monarchist.  I am pro-Canadian.  It is time for 
Canadians to stand up and have an allegiance to their country 
which does not involve the head of state of another country, that 
of Great Britain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I suggest to the government is that we propose some sort of 
amendment to this legislation that will recognize that the oath 
of citizenship is to Canada only and to no other country.  It has 
always seemed absurd to me when I listen to some of these people 
taking this oath of citizenship.  Some of them did come from the 
United Kingdom.  I know what was going through their minds.  What 
they often asked me was what had they done. They thought they 
were coming to a new country.  They wanted to share in our 
culture and traditions but they had to swear their allegiance to 
the monarch they left.  They did not understand what we were 
doing as a country.  I had to agree with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not anti-anything.  A lot of people get involved in the 
emotions of all this.  Nobody can steal our tradition as a 
people.  We have had a linkage of history with the British 
commonwealth as we have with France.  I am not talking about 
doing away with it.  Canada can continue to be part of the 
British commonwealth.  But as a small token of the realization 
that we are going into the 21st century we should as a minimum 
change this oath so it clearly swears allegiance solely to 
Canada, Canada's democratic traditions that Canadians have 
developed of themselves, Canada's rights and freedoms that we 
have developed by ourselves and those traditions that talk about 
our loyalty to our laws and upholding the laws of Canada that we 
evolved and developed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Canadian citizenship is worthy of 
protection.  Our citizenship is very highly regarded 
internationally.  I feel that Canadians expect and feel that this 
government has a duty to protect Canadian citizenship and what it 
means worldwide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The citizenship and immigration committee reviewed this issue 
back in 1994.  It sent recommendations to the government four and 
a half years ago.  All I can say is this is typical of the 
inertia of this department and of its ministry.  At this rate we 
can expect badly needed changes to the Immigration Act in the 
22nd century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The big question is if after four and a half years this is it, 
this is the best the minister can come up with? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity of representing the official opposition as 
a critic for the immigration portfolio.  I can remember sitting 
at committees where they were dominated by the Liberal 
government.  The citizenship and immigration committee four and a 
half years ago was also dominated by the Liberal government.  Yet 
it had the courage to recommend to the minister of the day that 
the laws that grant Canadian citizenship to any child born in 
Canada should be amended.  This minister chose to ignore that 
recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to examine why it is a concern to Canadians.  There 
are only two western democracies that automatically grant 
citizenship to every child born in their country, the United 
States of America and Canada.  In the United States of America it 
is because of the 14th amendment to the American Constitution 
which was proposed by Congress in June 1866 in the aftermath of 
the civil war.  It was to ensure that the freed slaves in the 
south were not denied their rights by state legislatures.  The 
14th amendment states: “All persons born or naturalised in the 
United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are 
citizens of the United States and the state within where they 
reside”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, because of this constitutional amendment the Americans 
are faced with a situation today where pregnant Mexican women sit 
on the south shore of the Rio Grande until they go into labour. 
Then they cross the river and they have children in the United 
States and are therefore United States citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier this morning we had Liberals talk about the long 
tradition in Canada of granting citizenship to children born in 
Canada.  This long tradition started in 1977, not quite so long 
ago.  This change has led to foreigners specifically coming to 
Canada to give birth so that their children will automatically 
have Canadian citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 there were 500 births to foreign women in British 
Columbia alone.  That was more than 1% of the births in British 
Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the city of Richmond almost 30% of births at the Richmond 
hospital were to foreigners.  Despite the fact that these newborn 
babies spend only one or two weeks in Canada before they depart 
for their homeland, they possess an irrevocable right of entry 
into Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has not been any great problem with this to date because 
the eldest of these children would only be 22 years old.  But who 
is to say what problems might arise in the future?  Some of these 
returning Canadians might be members of organized crime. 
They might be terrorists, they might gang members and Canada will 
not be able to deny them entry because they will be Canadian 
citizens.  What if some of these individuals have significant 
health problems?  They will not be denied entry. They will have 
full access to our health care system because they are Canadian 
citizens.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of the potential problems that will undoubtedly arise 
over the next few years, the reality is there are thousands of 
individuals around the world who are Canadian citizens but whose 
only attachment to this country was the first two weeks of their 
lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the true Reform tradition I sought out the opinions of my 
constituents two and a half years ago.  I asked should children 
born in Canada to parents who are neither Canadian citizens nor 
landed immigrants automatically be considered Canadian citizens. 
I received 3,685 responses.  Only 341 people said yes. That was 
only 9.25% of the respondents who felt that children born in 
Canada should automatically be Canadian citizens if their parents 
were not landed immigrants or Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this is how Canadians and certainly my constituents feel why 
is the minister leaving that clause alone? Why is she not 
amending it as was recommended by the immigration and citizenship 
committee that reviewed it four and a half years ago? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second issue this raises is adoption outside Canada.  There 
is a clause in this new citizenship bill that will make it easier 
for Canadian parents to gain Canadian citizenship for a child 
adopted abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting because this bill cautions that adoption must 
create a genuine parent-child relationship and cannot have been 
intended to circumvent Canadian immigration or citizenship law. 
But during my time as a member of parliament my office has dealt 
with two cases where an adopted child has subsequently tried to 
sponsor their natural parents to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to the minister that if she sincerely wants to prevent 
a circumvention of the immigration laws by adoptees, then she 
must amend the immigration law that prevents adopted children 
from sponsoring their natural parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to share the contents of an e-mail with the House. 
This is where a Canadian married a Romanian girl in Romania.  I 
received this e-mail in December 1998.  This individual returned 
to Canada in March 1998 and has been trying to get his wife to 
Canada ever since.  On July 1, 1998 his daughter was born in 
Romania.  Canadian immigration told him that Melissa, the 
daughter, was a Canadian and could accompany his wife or come to 
Canada earlier if desired.  The daughter could come before the 
wife. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two weeks ago his wife finally received her clearance to 
immigrate to Canada but was told that Melissa could not leave 
until it could be proven that she was the daughter of a Canadian. 
He was told that once his papers were filed it would be another 
six month process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ironic to me and to Canadians that here is a child born to 
a Canadian who cannot come to Canada with its mother and yet we 
are encouraging people to adopt children, who are going to become 
Canadian just like that, without being landed immigrants first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest the process we have before this amendment in the 
citizenship act is the appropriate one.  The adopted child comes 
to Canada as a landed immigrant and citizenship follows 
thereafter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I close I would like to bring up the business of 
citizenship judges.  I am very concerned that this government 
continues the process of patronage appointments in the position 
of commissioners.  We had an excellent citizenship judge, Mrs. 
Pam Glass, who served her people well in British Columbia and was 
removed because she had one flaw.  She was not a federal Liberal. 
Although she was competent and doing her job extremely well, the 
government has chosen to replace her with a political appointed 
person.  The citizenship act falls far short of what Canada needs 
in terms of protecting the citizenship we hold proudly.

no anticipated health problems?  Even if they were, our society

is more generous than it should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My comments were about newly born children.  I may be missing 
something, but I do not think a one or two week old child can be 
a professional or a business person.  We are talking about

simply to give birth.  They are not Canadian.  They are not 
landed citizens.  We are talking about people who plan holidays 
so that their children will be Canadian citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government can continue to turn its eye from the reality of 
the situation, but Canadians demand that it protects the 
integrity of Canadian citizenship.  If it fails to do that, it 
will be letting down Canadians who proudly hold citizenship, 
either those who were born here or new immigrants who take on 
citizenship.

Speaker, in the last parliament the hon. member and I were 
members of the Standing Committee on Immigration and Citizenship 
for two years.  We did not agree too many times then and I do not 
agree with her now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is on the points she did not mention like the 
citizenship oath.  Does the hon. member agree with changing the 
words in the oath?  In discussions we had in 1994 she did not 
agree with the changes.  Now we have the changes but she has not 
said anything.  Does she agree with the changes or not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is no question I 
disagree with the government.  Like one of his colleagues, I 
believe the citizenship oath of this country should also include 
a pledge of loyalty to Canada and to respect the laws and 
institutions of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West—Nepean, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have a question for the hon. member for South 
Surrey—White Rock—Langley.  If somebody's parents come from two 
different countries and have been here for two and a half to five 
years and are still waiting for citizenship, what country should 
their children be national citizens of? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is quite accepted 
internationally that children have the citizenship of their 
parents and that when the parents make application for Canadian 
citizenship they include their children in that application.

their children automatically are covered under their citizenship 
application.  The children find out when they are adults and want 
a passport or something that their parents had not made that 
application for them.  They find out they are not Canadian 
citizens when they thought they were. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We owe it to the children in Canada whose parents were not born 
here and are now Canadian citizens to make sure they understand 
that they need to check to make sure they are Canadian citizens 
and not just expect it was done for them by their parents.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a privilege to speak today to Bill C-63, an act 
respecting Canadian citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also one of the members of the Reform Party who are 
immigrants to Canada.  I was not born in this country.  I came as 
a child and at that time was unable to obtain Canadian 
citizenship until I reached my age of majority, as it was called. 
I remember one of the first things I did when I turned 21 was to 
apply to become a Canadian citizen.  I took a great deal of pride 
in attending the ceremony in citizenship court and taking a very 
heartfelt oath of allegiance.  I felt very proud of my status as 
a Canadian citizen.  I am a Canadian by choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I married a man who was also an immigrant to Canada and a 
refugee from eastern Europe, as one might tell by my name.  As a 
refugee and immigrant my husband Tom also took enormous pride in 
being a citizen of this country.  As well, my sister married an 
immigrant from Nigeria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole area of citizenship and immigration is one that is 
very near and dear to my family, to me personally and to me as a 
representative of Canada and Canadians and a representative of 
many immigrants to Canada from my riding of Calgary—Nose Hill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My records show that over half of the case work that comes into 
my constituency office is related to the area of citizenship and 
immigration.  I say to the parliamentary secretary opposite that 
the citizenship and immigration system is not working in the best 
interest of immigrants and of many new Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is a bit like an analogy where the minister has 
inherited a vehicle which is very unreliable.  It does not serve 
the people who hope to ride in it and be transported by it.  It 
is a danger to them in some cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the minister do?  The minister decides to fill up the 
windshield wiper fluid container.  That is about what the bill 
does.  We have a system which people in the House have pointed 
out to the government is not working.  It is full of very unfair, 
unworkable, even dangerous provisions, lapses and anomalies.  Yet 
the minister has chosen to bring in a bill that just does a bit 
of cosmetic change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the House are trying to point out to the government 
in a responsible and thoughtful way that there are many areas of 
our immigration and citizenship system which need substantive 
addressing.  The government is well aware of this.  Its own 
committee dominated by its own members made it clear in the past 
to the minister and to the government that substantial change and 
improvement were needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet the best the government can do is a shoddy attack on people 
who thoughtfully point out there needs to be a better service for 
Canadians, and particularly new Canadians, in the system of 
immigration and citizenship that is presently in place.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government was elected in 1993.  It was to make an overhaul 
of our social system and of our immigration and citizenship act. 
When any change is contemplated there is a study, a commission or 
committee set up to advise the government looking at the issues 
and advise the government as to changes that should be made.  In 
fact that was done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration was asked 
by the minister to advise the government on how the system should 
be overhauled.  The committee did its work.  We must bear in mind 
that the committee was made up of a majority of government 
members.  The recommendations from the committee were not just 
from the opposition but from government members.  They released a 
very thoughtful report.  It was called “Canadian Citizenship:  A 
Sense of Belonging”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee did its work with commendable timeliness.  The 
government was elected in October 1993 and in June 1994 the 
committee released its report, having made some months of 
thoughtful study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the House to calculate the amount of time from June 1994 
to the present, February 1999.  I am sure even the parliamentary 
secretary will acknowledge the truth of my assertion that it took 
nearly five years for the minister to put any legislation before 
the House.  It was five years, not from the time the government 
said it would make some needed improvements to the whole 
immigration and citizenship act, but from the time the study and 
recommendations were completed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we find in the bill?  The bottom line is that the bill 
does not address almost all the recommendations of its own 
Liberal dominated committee.  I do not know where that work, that 
study, that consultation with Canadians and that examination of 
the issues went.  I do not know what good it did.  I do not know 
that the hours of thoughtful, earnest and sincere work by 
government and opposition members on this matter were of any use 
because most of what was in the report has simply been ignored. 
The bill goes its own way and refuses to address many of the 
issues raised by the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It neglects some of the critical areas that need attention and 
alters other recommendations in a negative way.  The government 
and the minister have much to answer for in ignoring the 
recommendations of members of the House on these important points 
and issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill fails to fix some of the mechanical difficulties and 
some of the safety issues of the immigration and citizenship 
vehicle and stops at filling up the windshield wiper container. 
That is about all the bill does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under clauses 31 and 32 of the bill the duties of current 
citizenship judges will be handed over to Citizenship and 
Immigration Canada departmental officials.  The citizenship 
judges with whom I have had the privilege of being associated in 
the city of Calgary, and particularly Judge Ann Wilson, had 
nothing but the deepest respect in the immigrant and ethnic 
communities of our city.  Judge Ann Wilson, who worked tirelessly 
to cultivate good relations and communications with groups that 
represented and were representative of new Canadians, had a heart 
of welcome and of good will for new Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a pleasure to attend her citizenship ceremonies where she 
presided.  This tangible link between the minister, the 
minister's department and new Canadians will now be severed. 
However, the Liberals, although they got rid of the citizenship 
judges they did not appoint, want to have the ability to reward 
their good and faithful supporters so they have set up 
citizenship commissioners.  We are not quite sure what the 
commissioners are going to do.  We understand they are going to 
promote active citizenship in the community, whatever that means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A very good institution has been done away with under this bill 
substituting other patronage appointments under the Liberals. 
Again, what is being served other than Liberal political 
priorities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the committee will be asking some very tough questions of 
the minister and the departmental officials about this bill when 
it comes before it.  I could make a number of other criticisms 
about the bill. Unfortunately 10 minutes goes very quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee study should point out some of the obvious flaws 
of this bill.  I hope to speak to it again at third reading. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I say to the 
hon. member that I came over in the same class as her husband in 
1957. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member mentioned that we do not have any legislation before 
us.  We have this legislation before us and we are looking 
forward to getting it into committee to debate the various points 
and issues and then to bring it back to the House.  Furthermore, 
once the committee discharges its duty in relationship to this 
bill, it will be engaging in a revision of the Immigration Act 
which will result in a bill being brought before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to put that on the record to let members know that as 
soon as this bill clears the House a committee is waiting to 
study it clause by clause and call witnesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member questioned why we were changing the citizenship 
judges to citizenship commissioners.  Basically the courts have 
expressed a level of discomfort with having citizenship judges 
being called such since they are not graduates of law.  It was 
therefore deemed that commissioners would be much more 
appropriate.  However, that will be open to debate once it gets 
to committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also wanted to know what the functions would be of a 
citizenship commissioner.  The function of a citizenship 
commissioner, as the government now envisions it, will be to very 
actively throughout the country promote Canadian citizenship. 
Clearly one task that should be embraced by all members of the 
House is to promote Canadian citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get this bill to committee and we can get working on it 
clause by clause and then look forward to doing the revision of 
the Immigration Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
parliamentary secretary's explanation of this whole change from 
citizenship judges to citizenship commissioners. If it is simply 
a name change why were the citizenship judges like Judge Ann 
Wilson who were so well regarded, well known, well respect and 
effective in the communities turfed out the door so that new 
appointments could be made by Liberals? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think anyone has a problem with a name change, although 
we could quibble about whether it is really necessary, but when 
we take effective and knowledgeable people out of the community 
and out of their positions under the guise of a name change then 
there is a legitimate question being raised.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the parliamentary secretary to think about whether this

politically motivated change.  That is the way I see it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. parliamentary secretary just made a big point about getting 
this to the committee and making sure the committee had the 
appropriate interaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder whether we could ask the member from Nose Hill to 
please clarify for us why she thinks the government members 
decided not to act on the special committee that dealt with 
citizenship and immigration. Does she think or believe that in 
the new consultations on this act there will be any different 
reaction to the suggestions that might be made than was the case 
in the past? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my colleague from 
Kelowna makes a good point.  The Standing Committee on 
Citizenship and Immigration has already studied this problem.  It 
forwarded a report in June 1994 which was ignored by the 
minister.  It does seem a little amusing that the parliamentary 
secretary is so eager to have this matter brought back before the 
very same committee which his minister has already ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From my experience as a member of five plus years in the House 
very little substantive change or real thoughtful debate and 
amendment does take place at committees.  It is one of the 
frustrations I have with the way the House works.  I think that 
all members of committees could make a real contribution to 
improving legislation.  I urge the parliamentary secretary to 
ensure that, for a change, as the committee studies this bill 
this does happen. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak in support of Bill C-63, an act 
respecting Canadian citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin by congratulating the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration on this initiative in her ongoing commitment to 
improving legislation for which she is responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1968 I left behind my homeland and my family in a small 
village in Croatia in search of a better life.  I found that life 
in Canada.  I found a job.  I met my wife with whom I have four 
wonderful children.  Today I sit in the House of Commons 
representing the people of Cambridge, Kitchener, Ayr and North 
Dumfries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I still remember that day in Waterloo, September 12, 1973, the 
day I received my Canadian citizenship.  It was one of the 
proudest days of my life.  From that moment on I joined the 
Canadian family.  I became eligible to vote.  I became eligible 
to stand for elected office.  I became eligible to carry the most 
respected passport in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Almost 26 years after becoming a Canadian citizen I often find 
myself at citizenship ceremonies in my capacity as a member of 
parliament.  I can tell the House that welcoming new Canadians 
into our Canadian family is a part of my job which I enjoy.  It 
is the look of pride and commitment on the faces of my 
constituents that reminds me of my swearing-in ceremony. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I took and continue to take my responsibilities as a Canadian 
citizen very seriously.  I got involved in my community, I joined 
a political party, I ran for office and I always obeyed the laws 
of this country. 
I know the people I meet at citizenship ceremonies in Cambridge 
and Kitchener will take their responsibilities as seriously as I 
have taken mine.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a bill before us today that represents the first major 
reform with respect to citizenship in more than 20 years.  The 
most significant amendment, in my opinion, is one that changes 
the oaths of citizenship to better reflect Canadian values and 
express clearer loyalty to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important element of the new oath is that it puts 
loyalty and allegiance to Canada above everything else.  The oath 
also contains the promise to respect our country's rights and 
freedoms, to defend our democratic values, to faithfully observe 
our laws and fulfill our duties and obligations as Canadian 
citizens. These words have greater meaning to new Canadians on 
whom the original oath to the Queen is often lost and is somewhat 
confused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-63 proposes several other significant improvements to 
existing legislation.  It gives citizenship at birth to all 
persons born in Canada except the children of foreign diplomats 
and it gives children born abroad to Canadian parents automatic 
Canadian citizenship.  Second generation children born abroad 
will also receive citizenship at birth but will lose it if by age 
28 they have not resided in Canada. Third generation children 
born abroad will no longer have any claim to Canadian 
citizenship. Children adopted abroad can no longer be treated as 
immigrants and will not have to meet medical or permanent 
residency requirements before being granted citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also changes to the residency requirements for 
citizenship.  Now a prospective citizen will require at least 
three years of physical presence within Canada in the five years 
before applying for citizenship.  I think that is the right way 
to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who obtain citizenship through the use of false identity 
or who withhold information about criminal activities abroad 
could lose their citizenship as a result of new ministerial 
powers contained in this legislation. The minister also refuses 
to grant Canadian citizenship where granting would offend 
ordinary Canadians.  I firmly support these two amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone who comes to Canada as I did over 30 years ago must 
realize that citizenship in this country is not something that 
you automatically get after living here for a few years. 
Citizenship must be earned.  To earn it one must obey the laws of 
Canada, respect Canada and contribute to Canadian society in a 
positive way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If someone comes here and lies about who they are or what they 
did before they got here and then disrespect our laws, they do 
not deserve to become citizens. In fact, one has to question 
whether they should be allowed to remain in Canada at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members know I introduced a private member's bill several 
years ago which would speed up the deportation of non-citizens 
convicted of serious crimes in Canada.  I introduced the bill in 
response to two tragic murders in the Toronto area, Georgina 
Leimonis, a young woman who was murdered at a Just Desserts cafe, 
and Metro Toronto police constable Todd Baylis. 
The accused murderers in both of these cases were non-citizens 
who had lived in Canada for some time and had lengthy criminal 
records.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>People like them should not be allowed to stay in Canada.  They 
should serve time for their crimes and then put on a plane out of 
here.  We do not want them in Canada, nor should we ever consider 
giving them the privilege of Canadian citizenship. That is why I 
applaud this initiative which would allow the minister to refuse 
citizenship to anyone who is less than deserving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With reference to my bill on deportation, Bill C-321, it was in 
committee when parliament was dissolved for the 1997 election and 
has yet to be drawn this session.  I do have faith it will become 
law.  The minister and her staff have been extremely supportive 
of this initiative and I expect that the necessary changes will 
be made in the near future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike many of you, I was not born in Canada.  I chose Canada. I 
chose to become a Canadian citizen.  I have lived in other 
countries and I have travelled to many countries.  I can tell the 
House that the United Nation is right, Canada is the best country 
in the world in which to live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians who have not seen other parts of the world take 
for granted how truly lucky we are to live in this country.  But 
those Canadians who are fortunate enough to travel abroad or who 
have come from another land know that Canadian citizenship and a 
Canadian passport give us instant respect at a border crossing or 
customs checkpoint and particularly with average people around 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone we meet abroad loves Canadians.  They all have friends 
or relatives who have moved here and all hope to visit some day. 
They recognize that although we speak the same language as our 
American neighbours, we are different.  Our country is a mosaic 
and not a melting pot.  When one becomes a citizen of Canada, one 
is not asked to give up one's roots, language, culture or 
history.  One can still keep them and preserve them and share 
them with the rest of us.  One is simply asked to embrace the 
language and history of the new country and to obey its laws. 
This is a very small price to pay for the privilege of being able 
to say “I am a Canadian”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I chose this country.  I am proud of this country.  I am proud 
to serve this country and I would encourage all new Canadians to 
embrace the best country in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing I leave the House with a few words from Judge Robert 
Somerville, the citizenship judge for Cambridge, Kitchener and 
Waterloo.  By the way, he is not a Liberal and I do not care what 
party or colours he follows, he is a very good citizenship judge. 
In speaking to new Canadians he said “We have achieved a way of 
life and standards of living that are rare in the world.  The 
honour and dignity of Canadian citizenship are yours.  Please 
treasure it and be proud of it”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
compliment the member for his strong feelings about this country 
and his citizenship privilege which I likewise received 30 years 
ago and can share that with him. I have a couple of comments and 
then a couple of questions for the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing he did say was he appreciated the minister's ongoing 
efforts to deal with citizenship and immigration.  I would like 
to remind the member that this is the first piece of legislation 
I have seen since she has been minister which has been a long 
time so I do not think it is very ongoing.  We need to speed up 
the process in the immigration and refugee areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I compliment the member for his private member's bill. He can 
count on my support once it is drawn.  We are certainly thinking 
alike on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member is aware of the fact that there have been 
20,000 deportation orders issued in Canada and there have 
actually been 4,000 deported, which means there are about 16,000 
people who have not been deported.  I wonder how the member feels 
about that and what should happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On his birthright statement, the member feels that any child 
born in Canada should have the privilege of becoming a citizen of 
the country.  I would not debate that a great deal.  In the case 
of a refugee claimant who may have given birth to a child here 
and the refugee claim is denied, then what should happen to the 
Canadian citizen, namely the child?  What should we do?  Does he 
not see something missing in this bill to deal with that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on what I am getting on the changes of no longer having 
citizenship judges but having commissioners of citizenship, and 
judges already being released, I would hope that he would fight 
hard for the judge whom he believes so strongly in.  I think the 
judge's job is very short lived if this bill passes.  I think the 
citizenship judge will be gone and replaced with some patronage 
appointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member's comments, please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Janko Peric:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the 
hon. member for his future support of my private member's bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about citizenship.  We are not talking about 
immigration.  I am aware that there is a large number of 
refugees, people who should be deported.  That is exactly what I 
am recommending in my private member's bill, to streamline the 
process and deport and save Canadian taxpayers money.  I am aware 
that the hon. member knows that the Canadian Police Association 
supports this idea and I hope he will support it whenever that 
bill comes forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be much easier if there were only two countries on this 
planet, Canada and the rest of world.  Then we would not have the 
question of whether the child born in Canada has the right to 
receive Canadian citizenship automatically.  As the hon. member 
knows, we are a member of the United Nations and we have signed 
that declaration, that we do not recognize stateless people.

He was appointed by a previous government.  The hon. 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration and other area MPs including myself recommended Judge 
Somerville for reappointment.  As I said in my speech, we did not 
ask Judge Somerville what colours he follows. We are aware that 
he was a member of the Conservative Party, but that does not 
bother me.  He is a good citizenship judge. That is what is 
important. 
What are we going to call them?  Are we going to call them judges 
or commissioners?  In my opinion that is not too important.  For 
me it is important that he is a good person who is doing an 
excellent job.

want to commend the hon. member who just spoke on his passion for 
Canada and on his allegiance to Canada.  I am glad he chose 
Canada.  I am one of those who was born in Canada.  I am always 
proud to think that there are people from other countries who 
have chosen to come to Canada to live and become citizens of this 
great and wonderful land.  It makes me feel good and proud that 
others would choose to live in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it does not make any difference what is in a name, why bother 
changing it?  If it is okay to be a judge and if it is okay to be 
a commissioner and they are now judges, why bother to change it? 
If it does not make any difference to him, why change it? 
Obviously somebody thinks it makes a difference or they would not 
be bothering to make the change.  The change is only there in 
order to achieve something that somebody thinks is worthwhile. If 
it really is not important, then the legislation is unimportant 
and therefore we should not treat it with any kind of respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure there is a fundamental error here in the judgment and 
the logic being used that it does not matter what they are 
called.  If it did not matter, it would not be here.  Could the 
member please explain that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Janko Peric:</B>  Mr. Speaker, personally I have no 
problems with calling them judges or commissioners.  The hon. 
member will have an opportunity to join the committee and to 
table an amendment on that issue.  If the majority of committee 
members support it, the amendment will be accepted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have another comment 
following the member's reply to my colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure how many committees this member has sat on.  I 
have been on many committees.  I have see what comes in the front 
door and I have seen what goes out the back door.  It is usually 
the same thing.  There is very little in the way of changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has so much confidence in the committee I would like 
him to explain something to me.  Four or five years ago the 
committee submitted a very comprehensive report.  The committee 
did extensive work in getting public input and presented an 
excellent report on citizenship and what should be done.  Liberal 
members contributed a great deal to the report.  Where is that 
piece of work by the committee?  It has disappeared.  It has not 
been brought forward.  There is no reflection of it in this bill 
whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Committees on the Hill are not very functional.  They do not 
accomplish a great deal because the attitude of the ministers is 
that they can do it better than committees.  It is obvious that 
is what is happening.  What happened to that good report which I 
know the member is aware of?  Where is it at? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Janko Peric:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is aware 
that we have a process to follow.  He will have the opportunity 
to participate in the citizenship and immigration committee.  The 
committee could be as effective as the members are effective. 
The committee could be as progressive as the members are 
progressive. The member knows as well as I that we amend many 
bills clause by clause at the committee level.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of my life and part of my studies have been dealing with 
citizenship in itself.  I come from a part of Canada, a part of 
Saskatchewan, that enjoyed the benefits of massive citizenship and 
immigration, as the two are inseparable, from the spilling over 
from the Dakotas.  At that time Canada adopted for itself, almost 
word for word, the American homestead act and these people moved 
to Canada and became citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have visitors here visiting me in Ottawa whose grandparents, 
if we go back far enough, came from France across the peninsula, 
the thumb, as they call it in Michigan, on into part of 
Saskatchewan.  The remarkable thing about all this citizenship is 
when one goes through that great era, the last best west, I 
served as a justice for 25 years and I do not remember one single 
case of any of these gallant people ever becoming involved with 
the law or criminal activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also very proud to stand here and say that I have three 
adopted part Chinese sisters.  If one takes their heritage and go 
back, they too were proud of their Canadian citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of particular roles of citizenship, in my lifetime I 
was always involved before I came to this institution in working 
with people.  I have, up until the last few years, never once 
heard in the rural areas of my province of those people who came 
to this country and took citizenship, as the Chinese did, in any 
town that I worked, and there were a good many of them, ever 
becoming involved in a defamation of Canadians or their new 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe we should look at the past and ask ourselves what we were 
doing right then.  We are not proud of our record in some cases 
of what we did to immigrants from Ukraine.  By the way, the 
Ukrainian people are still the second largest ethnic group in 
Saskatchewan. We are not proud of what we did in World War I when 
we deprived them of citizenship and pushed them way up in Alberta 
and let them lose their land and virtually starve to death.  We 
are not proud of that but it happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also not proud of what we did to the Chinese when they 
came here to get their citizenship.  They worked on the railways 
and got less than average pay.  When one died on the railway they 
just pushed him into the grade and covered him up.  There was not 
even a decent burial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citizenship has to mean more than what it has meant in the last 
25 years in Canada.  We cannot be proud, as my hon. colleagues 
have mentioned, that at any one time we can have 16,000 to 20,000 
illegal immigrants in Canada and the fact is that about 80% of 
them will stay here.  Surrounding this court of citizenship, 
Canadians know what it is like.  Canadians see it as a massive 
corruptive unit.  Let us hope that this changes for good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What steps will we look back at to see how we brought 
hardworking people to this country who contributed greatly to 
this country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today when I know of people I have assisted coming in 35 years 
ago and I try to get some of their family in, I get such reports 
as “Don't bother going to your MP.  There is a good Liberal 
lawyer and he will pull the strings a lot faster”.  This is a 
fact and a terrible thing but it happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week when I was home I was confronted by individuals who 
asked me how I was getting along with this case.  They told me 
they had word that if they went to see a certain lawyer downtown 
he could speed the thing up.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we going to take legislation like this and, pardon the pun, 
liberalize it to that extent? I do not have too many immigrants 
coming. They are all leaving now.  What happened here? What 
happens when we face a situation in this country where the 
majority of the people who are apprehended and with charges were 
illegal immigrants?  Many of those people are still here.  I 
believe we ought to exercise more care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Bill C-63 does just what I hope it will, then we will be 
going back to the golden era of the last best west days when we 
brought in people who had no criminal records. They had the 
ability to survive and work.  They were welcomed in Canada and 
they made outstanding citizens.  In the immigration and 
citizenship record in Canada, while I know many to come in have 
been fine people, we have opened the gates and many of those 
people are still here and will not be deported.  While we do that 
we are denying at least 10 people I know who are hardworking, 
dedicated people, relatives here, and I am having one heck of a 
job getting them into Canada. Let us hope this bill changes that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Above all, if we are to have a deep meaning for the oath, which 
the hon. gentleman talked about, things have to change in this 
department from the past five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does this bill reverse the terrible records of this 
department in the last 25 years?  What steps are being taken now 
to prevent illegal immigrants coming to this country?  What steps 
are being taken to speed up the deportation of these people? 
These are the questions which Canadians want an answer to and I 
do not see the bill answering those questions.  I wish I did but 
I do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to bring back some sanity to the immigration and 
citizenship portfolio.  We need to truly look at bringing people 
to Canada who brought the same honour and glory of the last best 
west.  These people are still with us.  Some of the ancestors of 
these people sit in the House but we never had to deport one of 
that area that I remember.  I wish I could say the same thing for 
the past 10, 15 or 25 years.

soon as we deal with the issue of the immigration act.  If we are 
interested in getting there quickly I suggest we get this bill 
into committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important for us when we talk about immigration to 
keep things in perspective.  The vast majority of people who come 
to this country as immigrants and refugees are law-abiding.  That 
is the history of this country.

French, the United Empire Loyalists and people from all corners

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we keep that in mind.  Yes, there is some 
criminality.  We have to do what we can to make sure we deal with 
that as effectively as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member mentioned some of the terrible wrongs that have been 
done in this country to different ethnic groups.  He mentioned the 
Ukrainians and the Chinese.  There is a long history of that.  So 
many people who have come to this country have found it difficult 
and at times have been discriminated against.  Given that fact we 
ended up having a country that is very generous and is a beacon 
of civility in a world too often torn by ethnic unrest and wars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a bit of history for the hon. member, if he looks into the 
history of immigration to this country, at one point to make sure 
there were enough people in New France, Quebec, to increase the 
population, the king sent over his daughters, les filles du roi. 
Those people were not the most outstanding characters who came 
from France.  To make sure these people were married off and that 
they would help populate New France, the governor—

order.  I was wondering whether this was a speech or is the 
member on questions and comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member is on questions and 
comments.  I know he will either be bringing his comments to a 
close or asking a question very shortly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is referring to 
what the member said.  It is a commentary on what he said.  It is 
important to look at history.  Some of it is quite humorous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that the member would have to agree me that 
the vast majority of people who come to this country, 
notwithstanding that some will be a problem and we have to do 
everything we can to get them out, as refugees and immigrants go 
on to make a great contribution to the life of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will agree with the point 
that those people who come here for a purpose of establishing 
themselves make good Canadian citizens.  The hon. gentleman knows 
my area of complaint.  Canadians from coast to coast have pushed 
that complaint before this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make one correction.  It seems to me that immigration 
leads to citizenship.  We are bringing in a new citizenship act 
when we should be bringing in the controls and everything else 
surrounding immigration and then go to the citizenship act.  I am 
sure the government has a purpose in doing so but you do not sow 
your field in the spring before you have properly cultivated it. 
It seems like we should be dealing with immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud of those people I have worked with.  I am proud to 
have worked with immigrants for years.  I am proud to have their 
children within my educational institution.  But we have a new 
responsibility to make sure those people who are coming to Canada 
do not fall into the 16,000 to 20,000 people we have in Canada 
now, and I do not know how many before that, who are still here 
but should be deported.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I wish 
I could stand today and not have to speak on blatant patronage. 
Unfortunately Bill C-63 contains blatant patronage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under clauses 31 and 32 the duties of the current citizenship 
judges will be handed over to Citizenship and Immigration Canada 
officials.  The commissioners who will be replacing these judges 
will have only ceremonial responsibilities and the responsibility 
to “promote active citizenship in the community”, thus making 
this position completely irrelevant for any purpose other than a 
reward. 
When this legislation is passed the current judges will 
immediately be reclassified as commissioners, maintaining the 
same salaries, benefits, et cetera, until their contracts expire. 
The minister stated in her December 7 press conference that the 
salary for commissioners would be lower than that for judges, but 
she had no numbers to offer.  Nor did she elaborate on how many 
commissioners she would be appointing. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1330"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We question the necessity of the duties that will be performed 
by them versus the undefined qualifications required of them. The 
problem is elevated by the fact that these commissioners will be 
advising the minister on methods of evaluation for potential 
citizens when there will be no formal evaluation for the 
commissioners to pass.  The legislation does not state how this 
advice to the minister would be accomplished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the 1993 election—this is another case of a broken 
promise—the former minister vowed that the positions of 
citizenship judges would be eliminated and that no more 
appointments would be made.  What we have now is a public 
relations job.  A short lived promise indeed, a short lived 
Liberal campaign promise, but then that is not the only one we 
have ever run across. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a case of clear, blatant patronage.  We have a case of 
vote brokering with our immigration and refugee boards. That is 
one of the major problems we have with the bill, but I will talk 
about a few more.  We have a broken system and the minister is 
unable and unwilling to fix it.  We have no substantive changes 
in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Blatant Liberal patronage continues to happen under Bill C-63 as 
happened previously.  We have not seen any major changes in that 
regard.  The government is not listening to its own members, 
people in the government caucus who have problems with the 
legislation and want to see some of these changes.  It is not 
paying any attention or heed to them.  Nor is it paying attention 
or heed to the citizens of the country who have problems with the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard today that people want to see vigilance.  They 
think that vigilance is required with regard to some of these 
issues.  They recognize that currently we have fraud in the 
system, that there is a lack of consultation and that there has 
not been public consultation with regard to the administration of 
the oath or the formation of the oath.  We have a behind closed 
doors process with no parliamentary oversight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry, but the whole thing smells of Liberal arrogance.  We 
have Liberal dominated immigration and refugee boards.  Like I 
say, we go back to this issue of patronage appointments.  Whether 
immigration apparatchiks are called commissioners or citizenship 
judges the are still Liberal apparatchiks.  There is no 
difference.  We can change the name but a Liberal apparatchik 
smells the same.  What it boils down to is clear vote brokering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have mention in the bill with regard to language 
requirements, that they speak one of the official languages, 
either French or English.  Yet we have no form of testing for it. 
Will we allow people to simply mark down on a form whether or not 
they feel they are competent in either of these languages but not 
have any proper form of testing it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my colleagues in the House today referred an ad that ran 
in a trade publication.  I will read it because I think it is 
important for the folks back home to hear what it had to say.  It 
ran in a publication called the <I>Latin Trade Magazine</I> and 
this is the way it read: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Guaranteed immigration to Canada.  With the purchase of a fleet 
rent a car franchise, total investment of $50,000 
Canadian<I>approximately $30,000 U.S., you are guaranteed 
immigration to Canada even with a criminal record. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The word guaranteed was underlined.  It provided an address and 
a phone number to get a hold of somebody in Toronto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the only example of this type of thing.  We heard of 
numerous examples of these types of ads being run in foreign 
publications.  What type of representation does such an 
advertisement make of Canadians abroad or when there are 
Canadians serving as immigration consultants who try to swizzle 
money off people overseas? 
They advertise Canada as one of the countries with one of the 
most lax refugee requirements in the world.  They go ahead and 
abuse the process such that even criminals are being advertised 
to go ahead and immigrate into Canada.  What message does that 
send out to other immigrants?  It is terrible.

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has a lot of other unsavoury aspects to it.  One 
question we have to raise is with regard to those who will be 
seeking refugee status.  If they bear a child while they are in 
Canada, what happens to that child?  If the parent is to be 
deported, what is the status of the child?  This whole issue of 
citizenship at birth is something we have to examine carefully 
because it has long range complications or implications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The quality of immigrants determines the quality of citizenship 
in the country.  If we advertise for criminals overseas and 
tarnish our image that way, we can only expect that to have a 
reflection on Canadian society as a whole.  As a matter of fact, 
we have so many loopholes right now that other countries are used 
with their systems to filter or wash people who were criminals so 
they can wind up in Canada eventually.  That is a lax system and 
we have serious problems with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a Liberal administration that spends money to keep 
criminals in Canada rather than to assist citizens with legal 
aid.  I remember the case of Charles Ng that happened in Calgary, 
somebody who gained entrance into Canada.  He was well known and 
convicted in the United States for all his heinous crimes.  Yet 
the Liberal government spent good taxpayer money to keep him in 
Canada for years and dragged the process on with bureaucratic 
delays.  When Canadians of sane mind see something like that and 
know how hard they have to work for their tax dollars, they are 
infuriated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not as though the government has not had time to look at 
these things and to make appropriate changes.  It has had four 
and a half years and yet we have not seen a real substantive 
solution to this issue.  We have bureaucratic insertions in the 
bill and bureaucratic delays that are part and parcel and 
included in the legislation.  Instead of penalizing the 
bureaucrats we are penalizing the applicants to the process. 
There is something warped about that and something only a 
bureaucrat could enjoy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After four and a half years where are the bills on refugees and 
where are the bills on criminality and the problems with the 
system?  We have not seen anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general reports that we have 20,000 people to be 
deported.  Yet the records only demonstrate that 4,000 have 
actually been deported.  Pretty simple math tells us that 16,000 
people in the country are circumventing the system, of which 80% 
will probably go on to continue to stay here and become citizens. 
Talk about image tarnishing.  That is a travesty.  There are 
Liberal lawyers who are pulling the strings and making money off 
the system.  The whole thing smells. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my time is coming to a close so I will include a few more 
facts for the folks at home.  We had a high of 400,870 immigrants 
in 1913 and the low was in 1942 with 7,576.  We are known because 
of some of these laxities as being the world's most accepting 
country for immigrants and refugees.  We have all these issues 
with the criminality being advertised and everything else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want something that reduces the amount of discretion 
currently in the hands of immigration and visa officers but also 
encourages potential immigrants to prepare themselves better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All I can say on citizenship at birth is that Australia requires 
at least one parent to be an Australian citizen or permanent 
resident for the child to qualify.  It is something we should 
consider as well.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very easy to pick a case and to characterize all cases as 
having the same characteristics.  It is very easy to throw 
numbers around and suggest that somehow a greater number of 
people are engaged in a certain activity than in fact would be 
the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an example, the member used the auditor general's report and 
the issue of some 20,000 applicants whose status appeals have 
been denied and who are to leave.  I understand from the member 
that only 4,000 have left, which means there are 16,000 yet to be 
accounted for.  I wonder if the member would not also agree that 
of that number it is very likely a substantial portion of those 
people are no longer in the country.  In fact, they have probably 
left simply because of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find the member's explanation astounding. I want him to 
explain it to the House as I think it is very important.  He said 
those 16,000 people are in fact still here and that 80% of them 
will go on to become Canadian citizens.  They cannot have it both 
ways.  If they have made application under due process and have 
been denied, I wonder if the member could explain to me exactly 
how 80% of them will then go on to become Canadian citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if the member does not 
understand that there are laxities and problems with the system, 
I guess that is the Liberal member's own choosing.  We all know 
there are problems with the system.  There are 16,000 people 
unaccounted for.  We have no exit controls and no way of knowing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member says he does not have any problems with the system or 
he asks how we can go ahead and account for this and not play a 
numbers game.  I will throw another number at him if he is not 
sick of numbers yet.  In 1994 of the 230,000 immigrants entering 
the country only 14% were selected using the points system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The points system as people may be aware—and I will just go 
over it quickly—evaluates incoming immigrants on education, job 
training, experience, occupation, arranged employment, age, 
knowledge of one of the official languages, whether or not they 
have relatives in Canada and whether or not they are 
self-employed.  All these characteristics are used.  Of the 
230,000 we allowed into Canada in 1994 only 14% actually had 
anything to do with the point system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to talk about numbers, I could point to the 14% of 
230,000 or the 16,000 people that are unaccounted for that should 
have been deported and tell the member that we have a numbers 
problem.  If he does not believe it, he can read them for 
himself. 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member 
is being somewhat irresponsible when he says there are 16,000 
illegals in the country who have been ordered deported and that 
80% of them will become citizens.  That just does not wash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the member say that about 16,000 people who probably are 
not in the country?  We do not have exit controls, but the fact 
of the matter is that if people are deported they will not be 
approved as citizens.  For the member to say that is totally 
wrong.  Furthermore, to have him say that Liberal lawyers are 
getting around the system is slanderous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will tell the member about 
outrage.  Members across the way are challenging that maybe these 
16,000 deportees, or should be deportees, are not on Canadian 
soil.  Yet I have members in my own caucus who have gone on tours 
with police in the city of Vancouver where we all know—and we 
saw it on TV with our own eyes—about problems with Honduran 
gangs distributing drugs. 
He saw with his own eyes a fellow spit out $1,700 of crack 
cocaine from his mouth and he did not get charged.  He did not 
get convicted.  He did not get deported.  That is not even on the 
record books.  The ones we are talking about on the record books 
are the 20,000 who should have been deported and had an actual 
determination made.  That fellow who spit out the $1,700 worth of 
crack cocaine from his mouth into a police officer's hand did not 
even get on the records.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr Speaker, we have 
before us a bill entitled “an act respecting Canadian 
citizenship”.  The first statement inside is “This enactment 
replaces the existing Citizenship Act”. That means we have 
before us an act that we should first of all be discussing and 
debating in principle.  We should be dealing almost exclusively 
with the principles that are involved in legislation of this 
type. This creates probably the most significant function of a 
Canadian citizen, of a Canadian person, than anything else they 
can possibly do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a Canadian.  I am a Canadian citizen.  We should be able to 
say that with pride.  We should be able to say with our hands on 
our hearts “I am a Canadian”.  There should be no question that 
the number one concern here is that I am a proud Canadian. We are 
proud of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember so clearly being at an international conference in 
Dallas, Texas.  Twenty-five thousand people assembled in an 
arena.  Not a single person in that arena was not singing the 
national anthem.  Their hands were clasped over their hearts and 
they were singing with pride. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada I have witnessed Canadians singing the Canadian 
national anthem with caps on their heads, slouching with their 
hands in their pockets with absolutely no respect for the 
national anthem.  We should be proud to be Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was born here.  My grandfather was an immigrant to Canada.  He 
chose to come here.  I am so happy that he did.  It is because of 
his citizenship in Canada that I today am a Canadian citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What concerns me so very much is that the hon. minister chose to 
ignore certain things that have happened in her discussions 
across Canada.  She was told across Canada that what we need to 
have are people who are citizens, who are born of those people 
who are Canadian citizens.  What was her reply?  The minister 
stated that she made no changes in this proposed act because 
there was no research done on how big a problem the citizenship 
at birth issue really is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a statement of principle.  This is a statement of 
numbers.  In other words, it does not matter whether it is a 
matter of principle whether one is a Canadian citizen, it is 
simply a matter of how many numbers are involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That seems to me to be the typical Liberal interpretation of 
legislation. Test the winds to see how many people say a 
particular thing and then the Liberals will do it; whether it is 
right or whether it is wrong has absolutely nothing to do with 
the issue at hand. I decry that kind of statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now move on to another part of this legislation which I 
think is rather significant. Clause 6 states that an individual 
shall be granted Canadian citizenship if they have a command of 
one of the Canadian languages.  I will now ask a whole series of 
questions.  I want to draw rather heavily, in fact in detail from 
a presentation that was made to the committee as it travelled 
across Canada by the Edmonton Chamber of Commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the issues the chamber was concerned about. Who will 
be doing the standardized language testing?  Will it be the 
federal government?  Where will the testing take place?  Is it a 
part of the acceptance criteria and does it have to be done in 
the country of origin?  Will this be a major expense and 
undertaking? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that there is a big difference between 
learning English in a country of origin and learning English in 
the Canadian context in Canada. 
There are tremendous cultural differences with respect to 
language use.  Immigrants learn so much about Canadian society, 
language use and meaning through the first English as a second 
language classes they attend.

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chamber contends that as we understand it there is currently 
no universal valid test of English abroad.  Who is going to do 
the language testing overseas?  This will cause an even greater 
backlog than there is now.  We assume there will be additional 
fees associated with taking these tests and that is okay with 
them.  Does the language proficiency being proposed include 
labour readiness? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears as though the motivation behind the language 
recommendations is to discontinue support for any type of 
language training funding and to implement additional fees on top 
of the existing fee structure.  That training would be totally 
payable by the immigrants. It is interesting that Canada will 
train Canadians in either official language but it is not 
considering investing in the training of immigrants in either 
official language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many aspects of this report it appears that Canada is 
purporting to put higher demands on immigrants economically and 
socially than what it expects of its own people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to be very careful to put in place the kind of testing 
and validity that will give credence and acceptability to this 
clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 34 is a single sentence: “The form of the oath of 
citizenship is set out in the schedule”.  Is the oath of 
citizenship so unimportant that it can be relegated to a schedule 
of the act or is it as in the earlier part where the minister 
shall grant citizenship if the person pledges allegiance 
according to the oath?  The minister on her own volition has 
proposed the following oath: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From this day forward, I pledge my loyalty and allegiance to 
Canada and Her Majesty Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Canada.  I 
promise to respect our country's rights and freedoms, to defend 
our democratic values, to faithfully observe our laws and fulfil 
my duties and obligations as a Canadian citizen. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The significance here is in what is left out of the current oath 
that is asked of persons who wish to take Canadian citizenship. 
What is left out of the present oath are the words “heirs and 
successors”.  It should be allegiance to the Queen followed by 
heirs and successors.  That has been eliminated in the proposed 
oath.  Why has that been eliminated?  I can only speculate but 
the question in my mind is, is this the beginning of an effort on 
the part of the Government of Canada to eliminate the role of the 
Queen of Canada?  It looks like that sort of thing could be 
happening here very subtly and very surreptitiously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The oath adds a couple of very interesting phrases.  It adds the 
phrase “respect our country's rights and freedoms”.  I would 
like to ask the minister and all members opposite what exactly 
are the rights and freedoms of a country?  And who grants those 
rights and freedoms?  Do the citizens grant the rights and 
freedoms to the country?  Does the country grant those rights and 
freedoms to itself?  Does some other country grant those rights 
and freedoms to another country?  Does the United Nations do it? 
Does the World Court do it? Who grants these rights and freedoms 
to the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second phrase is “to defend our democratic values”.  I am 
unalterably in favour of the values we hold as a democratic 
society.  Mr. Speaker, I stand before you as a Reformer and a 
member of the official opposition based on one thing, that we 
work from the grassroots up and not from the top down.  That is 
what we need to do.  The defence of my values is the defence we 
want to do as individuals and as a country.  It is absolutely 
imperative that it be there but this is done on an individual 
basis.  I must do that and I myself pledge to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that oath is as important as I believe it is, it should not 
be relegated to the schedule in the back of the act.  It should 
be part and parcel of clause 34 in the act so everybody knows 
exactly what they stand for.  I am a Canadian, I am a citizen of 
Canada, I am proud of it and I want everybody else to know that.

without resorting to anything else other than the facts. It is 
very important that all members take that point of view.  I 
respect the member for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also knows that some statements have been made in 
this debate. I would like to ask the member whether he agrees 
with the statement that was made in the House by another member 
that Canada is advertising for criminals with regard to 
immigration. Would he support that statement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have just been handed 
an ad:  “Guaranteed immigration to Canada with the purchase of a 
Fleet rent a car franchise. Total investment of $50,000 Canadian, 
approximately $30,000 U.S.”.  “You are 
guaranteed”—underlined—“immigration to Canada, even with a 
criminal record.  For information write 5950 Bathurst Street, 
Suite 1009, Toronto, Ontario, fax at Toronto, Canada (416) 
667-1467”.  I do not know who put that ad in the paper but I 
know the ad exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Was that the Government of Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  I do not know.  I am not accusing 
anybody of doing it.  I know there is an official ad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that I do not want to advertise that sort of thing. 
I also do not want to guarantee citizenship in Canada to anyone 
other than someone who is prepared to accept the oath that I 
mentioned earlier.  We do not want people from a criminal 
element.  We do not want that in our society.  We do not want to 
advertise for them to come to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I see that it is almost two o'clock.  The 
hon. member still has three minutes of questions and comments. 
If he wishes to handle them, he will have the floor at three 
o'clock for questions and comments.  In his absence of course I 
will go to the next speaker who is from his party and they have 
agreed to split the time.

Treat parents equitably and stop rewarding just institutional 
daycare choices, leaving parents who choose other options out in

Hill during the prebudget debate by the newly formed Family Tax 
Coalition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These families carried the message one more time but louder than 
ever before.  They called out again to give an equitable, 
refundable tax credit to all parents and let them determine the 
arrangements which best meet the needs of their families.  The 
Reform Party agrees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals continue to tell parents that parental or extended 
family care has no value.  This is wrong.  Canadian families, 
through the Family Tax Coalition, are tired of being ignored.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the President of the Treasury Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The President of the Treasury Board is once again a compulsive 
fund raider.  After taking some billions of dollars from the 
unemployment insurance account, the Liberal government now wants 
to seize a $30 billion surplus from the public service, armed 
forces and the RCMP pension funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am giving the minister a chance to speak directly to the 
358,000 public sector workers and tell them why he is taking $30 
billion from their future pension benefits.  Why is he doing 
that? 
<P><A NAME="LINK124"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am quite glad to give the explanation which by the way is 
accepted by the actuaries, by the accountants, by the lawyers, by 
the auditor general.  It is very clear that the government 
guarantees the outcome to its civil servants.  The outcome is 
that they will be paid a pension once they retire, and we 
continue to guarantee these benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The deficits and the surpluses which are in the accounts are 
created by accountants.  They do not belong there and in fact 
have to go back to the taxpayers who paid for them in the first 
place.

Speaker, thousands of taxation employees spent the day at home 
with full pay while table two blue collar workers walked the 
picket line from coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last night in Halifax over 400 employees stated that the 
economic discrimination policy known as regional rates of pay is 
the number one issue.  Instead of avoiding the workers and 
prolonging the strike, will the minister commit today to sit down 
at the bargaining table and once and for all negotiate the issue 
of regional rates of pay?

we have negotiated at table two.  We have negotiated terms that 
are equivalent to the terms accepted by 80% of civil servants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think Canadians will make their own judgment about the tactics 
of the blue collar workers.  Up until now these workers have 
always accepted the fact that a member of parliament is paid 
differently if he sits in Fredericton than if he sits in Ottawa, 
in the same way plumbers and electricians have provincial rates 
that apply because of local market conditions.  These regional 
rates will continue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday the solicitor general bowed to public 
pressure and the urgings of Justice Hughes to finally pay the 
legal fees of the student complainants at the APEC inquiry. 
Although the government lawyers outnumber those of the students 
by 25 to 2, at least after 12 days the solicitor general finally 
read the writing on the wall.  Delay and deny have become 
trademarks of the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the solicitor general now indicate just how much the 
government is willing to spend to ensure fairness?  If he is not 
willing to so indicate, will he tell us when he will? 
<P><A NAME="LINK130"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I indicated yesterday, the payment 
will be fair and reasonable.  It will be done between my office 
and the public complaints commission. 
<P><A NAME="LINK131"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the government will claim that it has transformed 
the APEC inquiry into a transparent truth seeking process. 
However, with the greatest respect to Justice Hughes, a full 
judicial inquiry would best accomplish this.  The chair has 
stated that he will go where the evidence leads, perhaps to 24 
Sussex. He wishes to make it a true and open process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question that remains is simple.  Will the Prime Minister 
agree to testify under oath to his actions at the APEC summit? 
<P><A NAME="LINK132"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am sure my hon. colleague is well aware 
that the public complaints commission is an independent body. For 
me to indicate who would or would not appear would be totally 
inappropriate.  I do not intend to do that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK133"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
as has been pointed out, the solicitor general finally did that. 
That makes the situation fair.  The question is will it be 
meaningful.  It will be meaningful only if the Prime Minister 
turns up.  He said in this House that everyone in his office and 
everyone in his government was going to be available for the APEC 
inquiry.  Does that everyone include the Prime Minister? 
<P><A NAME="LINK134"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada,

its job. 
<P><A NAME="LINK135"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
we get one step forward and two steps back.  We get the funding 
but then we revert to what the former solicitor general used to 
say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the Prime Minister that it was he who said in this 
House that everyone from his office and government were going to 
be available.  He says those words in this House but he sends 
Ivan Whitehall, his lawyer, to Vancouver to make sure he does not 
have to go.  Why?  What are we supposed to believe, the Prime 
Minister's words or his actions? 
<P><A NAME="LINK136"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada,

and his ministers will co-operate fully with the public 
complaints commission.  What I would ask my hon. colleague to 
please do is to let the public complaints commission do what it 
is to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources

respect.  We comply with the law, there is no problem in that 
regard.

</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when I say the Bloc Quebecois wants to take us a step 
backward, it is because they simply want to keep people 
unemployed, because they want the unemployed to remain so as 
long as possible.  They do not even take umbrage at the fact 
that, in January 1999, we created 87,000 jobs in Canada while 
Quebec lost 1,500.

<P><A NAME="LINK141"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, quite the opposite.  By 
implementing a program based on hours, we have in fact liberated 
women who were prisoners of the 15-hour trap because they only 
worked part time and could not accumulate 15 hours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also provided a family income supplement specifically for the 
greater benefit of low-income women, which is now a part of our 
employment insurance reform.

claim that was presented to us beginning back in 1973.  This 
refers to the 1790 treaty where many first nations in 
southwestern Ontario ceded a vast tract of land to the crown in 
return for reserve lands and money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has committed itself to settling outstanding

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
not surprised that the minister has chosen not to answer the 
question.  Ministers who do not follow their own guidelines are 
usually wiser not to admit that in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My next question will be simpler.  There was no consultation 
with local agricultural groups and no consultation with the local 
municipal council.  Why is the minister willing to further 
alienate these groups by forcing a reserve with a non-contiguous 
land base in an agricultural area that depends upon co-operation 
between its farmers?

<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we 
have heard lots of rhetoric today about how good Bill C-63 will

to come to Canada, be a Canadian and enjoy what this country had 
to offer and hoping in some small way I could make a contribution 
back to this great country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned about Canadian citizenship and the things we hold 
dear about our country.  They have started to get watered down.

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of some bills that have been before this parliament 
recently.  In the last parliament, for example, Bill C-49 dealt 
with the amendments to quite a large number of boards and 
committees, largely government appointed.  We sometimes refer to 
them as patronage appointees.  I picked one dealing with the 
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation which is the guardian of our 
culture in many ways, subsidized by the Canadian taxpayer to $700 
million or $800 million a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would think that this protector of Canadian culture would be 
a truly Canadian institution.  However, section 38(1) of Bill C-49 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A person is not eligible to be appointed or to continue as a 
director if the person is not a Canadian citizen—or a permanent 
resident within the meaning of the Immigration Act. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Permanent resident were the words that were added. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked about this bastion of Canadian culture. Now we find 
that one does not have to be a Canadian citizen to sit on the 
board of CBC.  In this parliament, because that bill died on the 
order paper, Bill C-44, section 38(1) dealing with the CBC now 
reads that directors of the corporation are deemed to be 
employees for the purposes of the pension plan and makes no 
reference whatsoever to Canadian citizenship, lack thereof or 
qualifications thereof.  I presume we could now have foreigners 
sitting on the board of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation 
trying to determine what is Canadian culture and how to develop 
Canadian culture. It is this type of attitude from the government 
that tends to debase the concept of Canadian citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to take up the point that the auditor general raised 
last year and which the public accounts committee dealt with, the 
problem of immigration and refugees coming into this country. In 
response to the auditor general's report at the committee meeting 
on February 5, 1998 Ms. Janice Cochrane, deputy minister of 
citizenship and immigration, made the following statement to the 
public accounts committee: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general's report identified some important areas 
where the refugee determination system is not performing up to 
our expectations.  The report questioned the efficiency of the 
current system.  It raised concerns about the level of 
communication between CIC and the refugee board.  It also 
expressed some doubts about our ability to remove individuals who 
do not belong in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do welcome these observations.  They are consistent with some 
of the conclusions that we ourselves have reached at CIC. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those were the words of the deputy minister of citizenship and 
immigration when the auditor general pointed out that their 
policies and procedures were much less than perfect.  Hopefully 
they are now doing something about it but at that time they were 
not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also quote from the auditor general's opening statement 
to the committee meeting on February 5, 1998 dealing with the 
removal of illegal refugees and immigrants: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of removals also warrants particular attention.  At the 
end of our audit, the department was able to confirm the 
departure of only 4,300 of the 19,900 persons who were to have 
left the country.  In short, the process does not grant 
protection quickly to those who genuinely need it.  Furthermore, 
it does not discourage those who do not require or deserve 
Canada's protection from claiming refugee status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, we noted that no one in the federal government 
monitors the overall progress of the claims. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard today how we are dealing with citizenship and not 
immigration and refugees.  However, the point I want to make, 
again referring back to the auditor general's report of December 
1997, paragraph 25.41, is he talks about the huge backlog of 
26,000 refugee claims.  He points out in paragraph 25.44 that 60% 
of the people who arrive on our shores claiming refugee status 
have no documentation of any kind. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1515"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure every member in the House knows that when travelling 
to Canada people do not get on the plane without having a 
passport or travel documents.  Yet 60% of refugees who come off 
the plane have no travel documents. There was an admission before 
the committee that sometimes illegal refugees who have been 
sponsored by couriers and illegal organizations have a passport 
to get on the plane.  A courier is on the plane, picks up the 
passport and is long gone through customs.  They are left with 
nothing. Now they are here illegally with no documentation. 
Canadians are being taken for a ride. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the whole refugee process kicks into place.  It is 
overburdened. It is not monitored or administered properly. There 
are backlogs.  It takes two and a half years or more to determine 
that these people are illegal refugees.  They are given a 
deportation order.  Then they say that if they are sent back to 
where they came from, they might get hurt or they might be thrown 
in prison. An appeal process kicks in and the whole system starts 
again to determine whether there is a risk in sending them back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During that time the person gets married, or they have a child. 
Then they claim they want to stay here under humanitarian 
grounds.  Remember Bill C-63 says that children born in this 
country are automatically Canadian citizens.  Imagine Canada 
deporting the parents of a Canadian who may be a few months old 
or one, two or three years old. Absolutely not. They are 
automatically granted permanent Canadian status on the basis on 
humanitarian grounds because we took far too long to process the 
claim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 10 of Bill C-63 says “The minister may, for the purposes 
of this act, deem a person who is in Canada and who has resided 
here for at least 10 years to be or to have become a permanent 
resident” of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If people want to get into this country by the back door and at 
the same time have a legal process, they come in and apply for 
refugee status even though they do not qualify.  They work the 
system and drag it out.  They go for the appeal.  Then they go 
for the risk assessment.  Then they go for the humanitarian 
appeal because by this time they have started a family.  They 
wait a few more years and Canadian citizenship is there for the 
asking.  They have totally end-run the entire system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By virtue of Bill C-63 we are now granting these people 
automatic entry into Canada. When that gets out we can see a 
flood of people coming into this country, none of whom would 
qualify under the rules.  Yet Bill C-63 grants them Canadian 
citizenship after 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government by its inability to manage the process properly 
is subverting and debasing the value of Canadian citizenship.  I 
would hope it would take that seriously, stop it and stop it now.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I find it rather 
laughable that a two-year old child or a child who is just a baby 
would have choices that it could intelligently make. Let me quote 
the auditor general. December 1997, chapter 25, paragraph 129: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the lack of departmental statistics on the number of such 
claimants, from our analysis we were able to determine that of 
the 31,200 individuals who applied for refugee status between 
1993 and 1997 and had their claims denied, approximately 2,300 
were granted permanent residence on humanitarian and 
compassionate grounds.  Most of these individuals were given 
favourable decisions because they were married to permanent 
residents or Canadian citizens. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right there, the auditor general confirmed it to us. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my question for my colleague relates to the burden that 
is placed upon the system when we end up with refugee claimants 
who have actually departed from a location with identification 
and have arrived without it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a strong recommendation that we use digital technology. 
We all know that with the new digital technology we can take 
pictures at one end, plug them into a computer and pull them off 
anywhere in the world.  I have done that with things as simple as 
getting pictures in Ottawa of my son playing hockey in Victoria. 
I know it works even though I am fairly illiterate technically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That simple bit of technology added to the immigration and 
refugee system at all major points of departure for Canada seems 
to me would reduce the huge burden on the immigration and refugee 
system. Would my colleague like to comment on what he knows about 
that and what the cost might be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not know exactly 
what the cost would be on that type of system, but let me just 
tell the hon. member what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court has said that as soon as somebody sets foot in 
this country the charter of rights and freedoms kicks in.  Let us 
not argue with that.  That is the case.  Therefore, we know that 
when the illegal refugees, and I am talking about the illegal 
ones not the ones who have a genuine right to be here, arrive in 
this country, sometimes on the odd occasion the people from 
immigration will go right on the plane and inspect the passports 
before people get off.  Apparently that is before the charter 
kicks in because they have not touched Canadian soil at that 
point in time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet when questioned they said even though that proved and 
identified illegal refugees who could be sent right back on the 
next plane, they did not follow that policy.  They were far more 
willing to allow the people to enter into Canadian customs and 
allow the charter of rights and freedoms to kick in.  This would 
then give them several years of appeals and lawyers and ongoing 
opportunities to run up huge costs for the Canadian taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During that time if they develop a family in this country, on 
humanitarian grounds they then qualify for permanent residence. 
Then according to clause 10 of Bill C-63, after 10 years they are 
home free, a Canadian citizen with a Canadian passport.  They have 
not qualified under a point system, under a refugee system or any 
system for that matter and they are in all the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before we move on in 
debate, I should inform the House that we are past the five hours 
of debate with questions and comments.  We are now into 10 
minutes, no questions or comments.  Resuming debate, the hon. 
member for Mississauga South. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Maria Minna:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
clarification.  I would just like to know if we are debating the 
Citizenship Act or the Immigration Act.  I am not sure.  The 
opposition seem to be talking about something else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member has 
a question of relevancy. It is always apropos to raise it. It may 
cause people to consider whether or not their remarks are germane 
to the debate at hand. In my opinion the debate so far today has 
been germane to the bill at hand.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to have the opportunity to make a few comments with 
regard to Bill C-63, sponsored by the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, an act respecting Canadian citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member who just raised a point of order is quite 
correct.  I have followed the debate.  I think that the member 
for St. Albert stated that the bill deals with citizenship, not 
with immigrants or refugees.  In fact, Mr. Speaker, prior to your 
entering the chair this afternoon it had reverted to a litany of 
negative rhetoric with regard to immigrants and refugees. It is 
unfortunate that has happened but it is probably a good thing in 
the context that it shows Canadians what the fundamental values 
are of those who are suggesting certain things and making 
representations.  It leads straight to credibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Credibility in this place is a more important asset than any 
other I can think of.  When members rise to speak and to present 
information, their word is on the line.  So I want to address a 
couple of the words that I heard from the Reform Party during the 
last three or four hours of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One direct allegation was that the Government of Canada was 
advertising to bring criminal immigrants to Canada.  I raised it 
with regard to a member who was here during the debate and heard 
the comments and asked that member if he would agree with the 
statement that had been made.  He was given a piece of paper 
which he read into the record which said to the effect that you 
can get into Canada if you have a certain amount of money and 
this is what you do, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statement and the sheet were not prepared by the Government 
of Canada, by the Parliament of Canada or by any of the agencies 
of the Government of Canada.  It was a flyer which was not 
attributed to anybody.  It just happened to be a flyer which had 
these words, yet it was presented to the House of Commons as 
indicating the Government of Canada was advertising for 
criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members who presented that information have not been fair 
with the House by presenting information which is not 
substantiated by the information they have. If they feel that 
strongly about it I would certainly ask that they table the 
document in the House of Commons so that it can be shared by all 
members of parliament and dealt with.  If it is not true, if it 
is a false document and a false allegation, I do not expect a 
document to be tabled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of the Reform Party in expressing their values 
referred often— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The document to which the hon. member has just referred was from 
the publication </I>Latin Trade<I>.  I would seek unanimous 
consent of the House to table the document as requested by the 
hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Does the House give 
its unanimous consent that the document as referred to be tabled? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have the same document in 
front of me.  It refers to an address on Bathurst Street in 
Toronto. It is not a government office.  It is not the Government 
of Canada. This happens to be— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if members do not want to 
listen, I am going to continue to present the facts as I know 
them because I think that the credibility of the issue is 
extremely important.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The document is available to all members.  I see all members are 
reading it now, just to satisfy themselves that in fact all of 
the representations and allegations that have been made today by 
the Reform Party with regard to this document have been totally 
false.  They have been incorrect by attributing them to the 
Government of Canada and it is unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From another standpoint, as I mentioned as I began my comments, 
it is always important to know exactly what the value system and 
credibility level are of speakers in this place.  I think they 
have accounted for themselves very well.  The Canadian people 
will know exactly the credibility index of the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were also substantial references to the auditor general's 
comments regarding 20,000 immigrant applicants who have been 
denied and were ordered to be deported, that 4,000 of them had 
been in fact deported and that there were 16,000 yet to be 
accounted for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party would have us believe that there are 16,000 
people roaming around Canada hiding away when in fact it is 
unquestionably the case that the vast majority of those people 
really are no longer in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  How do you know that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  That is right.  Nobody really knows, but 
people who do not have landed status will not get into the 
country.  They will not wait around until someone decides to 
invite them to leave.  They can do it on their own because they 
have made an application and it was denied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to ask a question of the member earlier when he was 
talking about illegal immigrants.  For the life of me I do not 
know what an illegal immigrant is.  It is a contradiction of 
terms.  It may be an alien who has made application for 
immigration, but someone who would sneak into the country and is 
here as an illegal alien I understand.  That is not an immigrant 
or a refugee.  A refugee as I understand is someone who has come 
to Canada and sought refugee status and made application. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise this issue because when we are sloppy with the 
terminology and we start talking about illegal immigrants and 
illegal refugees, when we are not talking about immigrants and 
refugees in fact, it is a slight against those who have chosen 
Canada to be their home and those who were successful in 
achieving landed status but who still consider themselves to be 
immigrants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for St. Albert was an immigrant.  We have to be 
careful not to slander immigrants and refugees, whether they have 
been successful or not.  We understand that in the vast majority 
of cases people have come here for very honourable reasons.  They 
are looking for an opportunity.  With regard to refugees there is 
no question.  We have a social responsibility to do our share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To slander them and to somehow characterize all those who come 
to Canada for immigration purposes as being somehow illegal and 
all criminals is really unfortunate.  I make those comments 
simply because we have to recognize that they are human beings. 
If anything, the House should recognize that Canada has always 
been recognized internationally as being the champion of human 
rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our process allows for the respecting of those human rights 
regardless of their status.  We have a system in place.  It is an 
honourable system and members should reflect in their comments 
that by and large the majority of the system is dealing with 
human rights issues and they should respect human rights.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to join my fellow members in addressing 
Bill C-63, but I cannot say I am terribly impressed with what we 
have to work with in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has become typical of the government to spend months and 
years responding to a report and then drop a band-aid piece of 
legislation in our laps that it claims to be in great rush to 
push through. 
In this case we have a bill that tinkers with some definitions 
and procedures but completely ignores what really needs to be 
addressed in this country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our immigration system has been in crisis for years.  It is in a 
tailspin.  It has been abused by groups and gangs from around the 
world because they have found they can manipulate our system 
while legitimate refugees and law-abiding new citizens wait in a 
bureaucratic limbo to have their cases heard, reheard and 
deferred for months on end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thousands of known criminals walk our streets with impugnity 
after brushing off the most cursory examination at border points 
while mysterious legions of organized criminals and drug fuelled 
gangs set up shop in our cities, apparently beyond the reach of 
our Canadian securities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the government have to respond to all this?  At least 
these people still have to swear allegiance to the Queen at 
present, but it should be expanded to include Canada as well. 
Since we are here to deal with what little the government has to 
offer by way of a legislative agenda, I will point out where I 
believe the government has gone off the rails. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a woman in this country has a baby then we confer upon that 
child the blessing of citizenship, and that is how it should be. 
However, if a woman comes here from another country to have a 
baby we have a bit of a problem.  The Standing Committee on 
Citizenship and Immigration recommended that the child only be 
considered a citizen if one or both of its parents were a 
permanent resident or citizen.  There should be some leeway for 
refugee claimants who have been accepted, but the idea is that 
for Canadian citizenship to mean anything it should be held up to 
a certain standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should ask people who are coming here to observe our laws and 
accept our requirements.  Simply having a child here, then 
claiming that it would be unfair to be deported because one is 
the mother of a Canadian citizen is nothing but twisted logic and 
an abuse of that child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does Bill C-63 say to that?  It says in clause 4 that the 
government is not prepared to lay down the law but apparently to 
wait for the supreme court to make up the law as it sees fit.  We 
all know where this perverted logic led recently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately where the Liberals do not want the courts to rule 
they put the authority to interpret into the hands of the 
minister.  In a perfect world we could all assume the minister 
and all her heirs would rule with a benevolent hand and never let 
politics or special interests affect her judgment.  Of course in 
a perfect world we would not have people taking advantage of the 
generous nature of Canadians by trading off their children in 
this manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no fewer than 16 paragraphs with a number of 
subparagraphs describing what the minister might arbitrarily 
decide behind closed doors about how this act will work.  Most 
are administrative and no doubt there is a sensible rationale for 
applying them, but I cannot help thinking that the more such 
clauses we have, the more open ended the law is and the more open 
it is to abuse or incompetence.  We know how difficult it is 
already for opposition members and their constituents to get 
satisfaction from a government department after a case has wound 
its way through the labyrinth it must follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a clause in the bill that the minister can 
delegate her authority.  Once again maybe this is necessary to 
keep this creaky thing rolling along day to day.  I do worry, 
though, that the minister saw fit to include the phrase “without 
proof of the authenticity of authorization”.  That is kind of an 
open ended statement.  That comes from subclause 44(1).  I hope 
this is not intended to be some sort of escape clause for future 
screw-ups but it certainly would not be the first time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has given herself the authority in the bill to 
decide what the criterion is for people to have an adequate 
knowledge of our official languages.  There is no definition of 
what adequate is.  It surely leaves open an opportunity for some 
cracker jack immigration lawyer to appeal on those grounds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see a clause that says that potential immigrants cannot use a 
translator to take a language test.  This would be a laughable 
inclusion if it were not so sad that the Liberals never thought 
of this before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has given herself the authority to define what 
constitutes a relationship between a parent and a child for the 
purpose of determining entitlement to citizenship.  We have to 
wonder why this relationship has to be defined at the door when 
we are thinking of letting somebody into the country.  There is 
already a reference to adoption outside the country in clause 8, 
and aside from being the birth parents we are left with a big 
question of how this authority might be applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe subparagraph (i) hints at the many possibilities for 
relationships the minister may have in mind.  She has taken upon 
herself to define who is a spouse for the purposes of this act. 
As is its usual practice, we know the Liberal government has left 
it up to the courts to allow some special interest groups to 
redefine what constitutes spouse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can interpret this subparagraph to be anticipating that court 
case or, if we are generous, we might say that the minister will 
simply decide if a couple is married or not.  I find that a 
little hard to swallow.  This clause is wide open for the social 
engineering which many Liberals favour and of which Canadians 
have repeatedly made clear they are not in favour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's powers are even more frightening when we move on 
to grounds for refusing citizenship. 
Clauses 21 and 22 suggest that the minister can decide 
arbitrarily what constitutes the public interest and having 
disqualified someone under this heading can refuse that 
individual an appeal.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ironically members opposite build their careers on the 
insupportable assertion that this party wants to keep immigrants 
out.  That is not the case.  However this clause puts incredible 
power in the hands of the present minister to do that very thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is not that the minister may keep criminals out, 
something they do not seem to be terribly good at now, but that 
this act does not define what this or any future minister might 
decide is public interest.  Might this one day apply to someone 
who holds opinions contrary to some accepted government wisdom? 
It is not clear here where the guidelines are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is likewise with the term national security which appears in 
clause 11(f).  The minister may grant citizenship to someone who 
has not been convicted of an offence against national security. 
The problem is that there is no specific category of offence in 
the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act or the Criminal 
Code here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is merit in prohibiting people who constitute a risk to 
the country or who have demonstrated that they cannot behave 
according to the laws of this land or any other for that matter, 
but it is weak legislation that leaves this concept open to 
interpretation to abuse.  It leaves the country open to dictates 
by the courts, and that is not why our constituents have sent us 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the flaws in Canadian politics is the difficulty in 
dealing with subjects such as immigration, as if to raise the 
issue itself were tantamount to questioning its benefits, the 
place of immigrants or the value of a certain category of 
immigrants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This kind of unspoken censorship has been a chronic problem for 
politicians for years.  We firmly believe that the government 
must account for the way the objectives of immigration programs 
are being met.  This is in accordance with the rules that allow 
the true exercise of the democratic rights of Canadian citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only then can we restore the public's faith in the management of 
immigration programs.  At the same time we will restore the 
confidence of those who implement these programs and in the end 
all those who elect to settle in this great country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
share with the House a story that I recently heard on CBC radio 
as I was driving through British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It came on in late afternoon.  A doctor was being interviewed by 
a CBC reporter, a doctor who I believe was working in Vancouver 
in an emergency ward in a major hospital.  She was called into 
the emergency room to assist a young man who was having severe 
difficulties.  The young man appeared to the doctor to be in good 
health.  That is the way she related the story.  However, he was 
having a great deal of difficulty breathing and she determined 
immediately that he needed mouth to mouth resuscitation or mouth 
to mouth assistance in breathing if he were to survive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She had made some inquiries before going into the emergency room 
and found out that this fellow was a recent immigrant to Canada 
from Honduras and had only been in Canada for a very short time. 
I think it was in the neighbourhood of about six months. 
Naturally the doctor assumed that being a recent refugee 
Immigration Canada would have checked his health status and would 
have found anything that might have been wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The doctor assumed wrong.  Much to her horror she found out that 
she had made a terrible assumption because, as she later found 
out, this young refugee who was lying in a hospital emergency 
room, who looked and appeared to be healthy and who was a recent 
immigrant to Canada, only having been here a few months, was in 
fact a fellow who had full blown AIDS and active tuberculosis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The doctor made a life and death decision and assisted or 
attempted to assist him with mouth to mouth resuscitation.  She 
found out later the patient was infected with the AIDS virus and 
tuberculosis.  She had herself checked out when she found out 
what the patient's medical history really was.  Thankfully she 
did not acquire the AIDS virus, but she did test positive for 
tuberculosis and now she is very concerned she may develop that 
disease at some time in her life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know members opposite think it is funny, but I do not think 
most Canadians find it funny.  Frankly I know the doctor involved 
did not find it funny at all.

this individual be in Canada with these very serious diseases 
that he had obviously had for a long period of time and 
immigration not even check? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the doctor discovered and what she related to radio 
listeners that day was that immigration does not routinely check 
immigrants for serious diseases as they are accepted into Canada. 
They do not check immigrants to Canada for contagious diseases. 
They do not put public safety as a first priority when accepting 
immigrants into Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something very wrong when Canada does not take these 
kinds of precautions to protect its citizens. Our citizenship and 
immigration department is so caught up with optics, spin and 
being political correct that it is willing to jeopardize public 
safety for the sake of being seen as politically correct.  This 
is apparently the case because I have in my hand an advertisement 
that was recently found in a foreign publication which I will 
read verbatim into the record: “Canadian immigration to Canada 
with the purchase of a Fleet rent a car franchise, total 
investment of $50,000 Canadian, approximately $30,000 U.S.  You 
are guaranteed immigration to Canada even with a criminal 
record”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an ad that was placed in a foreign publication.  How can 
our immigration department be so obviously skewed and so 
incapable of doing its job that Canadians are recognizing that 
there is financial opportunities in attempting to entice 
criminals from other countries to come to Canada and guaranteeing 
them access to Canada if they have the ticket price to pay the 
$50,000 or $30,000 U.S.? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can anyone watching the debate feel the government has as 
its first priority the public safety of Canadians?  How can 
anybody watching this debate believe the government has its 
priorities in order?  Refugees are not screened for serious 
illness and disease.  There are ads to attract criminals into 
Canada. Canada needs to totally revamp its immigration policy and 
put as its first priority the health and safety of Canadians.  In 
both these examples we see the government does not have its 
priorities right and it is not putting the health and safety of 
Canadians as its first priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next priority the government should have with respect to 
immigration is to encourage immigrants who are ready, willing and 
able to make a positive contribution to our economy and to our 
country.  Immigration has always been an extremely valuable and 
positive force in this country from its inception until now.  I 
can speak with a bit of knowledge on this because I come from a 
community in northwest British Columbia, Kitimat. Kitimat was 
largely created during the 1950s when Alcan built a huge aluminum 
smelter and the community and the country at that time were 
accepting refugees from all over the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had at that time people from Portugal, Italy, Germany and 
people from all over the world who came to our community.  It was 
considered a melting pot.  It was considered an exemplary 
community at that time.  At that time we had an immigration 
policy that made sense.  We had an immigration policy that looked 
to potential immigrants in terms of what kind of positive 
contribution they would be able and willing to make to our 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly the priorities of government have changed over time. Sadly 
we have a government that puts as its first—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. I do not like to interrupt the hon. member on debate. 
Unfortunately I have been listening for the last little while and 
I am lost as to the subject matter of the debate.  Are we 
debating the citizenship bill or are we debating the white paper 
on immigration? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> We are debating the 
immigration bill.  During the time I have been in the chair it 
has been a fairly wide ranging debate. The hon. member for Skeena 
was addressing an ad, which in my opinion was relevant. I am sure 
the hon. member for Skeena is cautioned by the intervention by 
the member for Winnipeg North—St. Paul. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Maria Minna:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am sorry to say this to 
you, but you just said we are debating the immigration bill.  We 
are debating the citizenship act which I think would be important 
to everyone.  I do not understand why we are talking about 
criminals constantly.  It seems that is the only thing the 
opposition is interested in.  It is talking about irresponsible 
companies— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The point by the 
member for Beaches—East York is very well made and I would ask 
the hon. member for Skeena to touch on the bill at hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am glad I got their 
attention.  The reason we are talking about criminals, for the 
hon. member's edification, is the fact that we have a government 
and a policy which invite criminals to come to Canada and become 
citizens here.  We have a government— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I think you will find unanimous consent to table the document 
that has been referred to in the debate today, which will show 
clearly that this is not a Government of Canada document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Mississauga South has requested the unanimous consent of the 
House to table a document that has been referred to by both sides 
in debate.  Is there unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I see that we really are 
making some progress here this afternoon and I am grateful for 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is quite right. This is not the Government of 
Canada that is doing the advertising, but it is the Government of 
Canada that is facilitating this charade.  It is the Government 
of Canada's policy that allows Canadians and others to advertise 
in foreign publications and say bring us your criminals. You are 
a bank robber, come to Canada and if you get caught in Canada we 
have a criminal justice system that will not deal with you 
anyway.  It is a haven for criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot understand why the hon. members do not understand.  We 
are talking about priorities.  We are talking about what is in 
the best interest of Canadians and what is in the best interest 
of Canada.  Certainly when we see an advertisement like this in a 
foreign publication we are hard pressed to believe that the 
government's priorities are in the best interest of Canada and 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are hard pressed when we hear this terrible story of this 
doctor working in an emergency ward in Vancouver that the 
priorities of this government are for the health of Canadians. 
This doctor was exposed to a serious contagious disease as a 
result of immigration's failure to screen people coming into this 
country as immigrants, to screen people coming into this country 
who desire citizenship here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is really disappointing to see that from all the noise on the 
other side they still do not get it.  Canadians are not satisfied 
with this.  They want something better. They want a better set of 
priorities. They do not want criminals and people who are 
infected with serious contagious diseases coming into this 
country and threatening the health and safety of Canadian 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish the members on the other side would get it.  Obviously 
they are spending more time talking than listening.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to speak to Bill C-63, an act 
respecting citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation has been a long time coming. For years 
Canadians have been waiting for improvements to the citizenship 
act.  As far back as 1987 the government announced plans to bring 
in needed amendments.

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even when this government was elected in 1993, it announced its 
intention to overhaul our citizenship laws.  It asked for advice 
from the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration and 
its report, “Canadian Citizenship: A Sense of Belonging”, was 
presented to this House in June 1994. This government has now 
taken almost five years to study and consult some more. What do 
we have?  A few of the key recommendations of the standing 
committee.  We have a bill that fails in many respects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know of the difficulty our courts have with the issue of 
children born in Canada while their parents are here illegally. 
Does this legislation put a stop to this abuse by illegal 
immigrants using this loophole to gain entry to the country?  No, 
it does not.  As things stand, we can have terrorists enter this 
country fighting deportation, perhaps even extradition, and 
during their time here they can conceive a child. Under section 
4(1) of the bill the child acquires citizenship at birth if born 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course there are exceptions to the rule but they are limited 
to children of foreign diplomats, etc.  The exceptions definitely 
do not cover the children of illegal immigrants, whether refugees 
or otherwise.  This is fundamentally wrong.  But just why is it 
wrong? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is wrong because it creates a loophole big enough to drive a 
truck through because the child, when born in Canada, 
automatically becomes a Canadian citizen.  That child has the 
right to remain in this country.  The parents may well be in the 
country illegally.  They may even be highly undesirable.  They 
may even be dangerous criminals or terrorists with dark 
objectives either within Canada or elsewhere. But when these 
parents have a child while they are in Canada, they gain an 
important lever toward their fight to remain here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because their child is designated as a Canadian citizen with the 
right to remain in this country, it is extremely difficult to 
deport or extradite the parents and thereby deprive the child of 
those parents.  There is usually and quite understandably much 
public sympathy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of addressing this obvious problem in the legislation, 
the minister has chosen to ignore it and hopes it goes away.  It 
will not go away.  The problem will continue to plague our courts 
and the immigration system.  Besides being a complete abdication 
by this government in its responsibilities, it creates unfairness 
in and severe criticism of our immigration process.   All 
immigrants become tarnished because some are able to beat the 
system and gain entry through this loophole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some potential and highly desirable applicants for citizenship 
have to wait in line or perhaps are denied entry because these 
queue jumpers fill our quotas prematurely.  It makes much more 
sense if we limit citizenship to children born in Canada to 
lawfully landed immigrants.  Those children born to parents of 
questionable status should take the citizenship of their parents 
at least until the status of their parents is resolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now comment on section 6(1)(b) of the legislation.  It 
states that citizenship shall be granted to persons who have been 
lawfully admitted and have been permanent residents residing in 
Canada for at least 1,095 days.  But there is no legislative 
scheme to measure how to determine whether the 1,095 requirement 
has been met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all very aware of various examples whereby immigrants 
enter the country to set up residence only to almost immediately 
return to their country of origin.  They spend little time here 
as they have significant interests in their home country.  They 
merely want to obtain Canadian citizenship to gain all of its 
advantages.  They want to reserve their Canadian citizenship in 
case they eventually wish to take up residence in the country. 
Once again the legislation fails to address this loophole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certain individuals are able to take advantage.  The result, 
once again, is that all immigrants become tarnished by the 
shenanigans of a few.  Once again some immigrants fail to gain 
entry and citizenship because others are able to jump the queue 
with little intention of taking up permanent residence in the 
near future, if at all. Again, this is wrong and the minister has 
closed her eyes to the problem.  She must be held accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In more recent years the courts have been fairly inconsistent 
over this residency requirement.  Some judges held that actual 
physical presence was not necessary.  Applicants only had to show 
a significant attachment to Canada through bank accounts, 
investments, club memberships, driving licences, etc.  Other 
judges held much stricter adherence to actual residency in the 
country. This uncertainty in the law seriously impacted the value 
and validity of our citizenship process.  With respect, the 
amendments as proposed through Bill C-63 do little to address 
this concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak only briefly to section 31 of the legislation.  I 
note that infamous creature known as the governor in council will 
continue to appoint citizenship judges and commissioners. The 
government wishes to retain positions with which to employ 
Liberal party members, benefactors and volunteers.  They must be 
paid off through patronage appointments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The function of a citizenship commissioner is a relatively 
simple endeavour at a relatively handsome remuneration. 
Appointments for a period of up to five years are also very 
attractive.  It almost makes me think about becoming a Liberal 
but in case anyone misheard me, I said almost. 
I will now move on to section 43 of the bill.  Again we see 
powers of the governor in council.  There was once a time that 
members of parliament made the laws of Canada.  We now appear to 
be moving closer and closer to merely authorizing the governor in 
council to take over our responsibilities.  We are also moving 
closer and closer to concealing our laws from our citizens.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Have members ever noticed how much easier it is to research our 
statutes than it is to research the regulations?  Statutes are 
available individually.  They are available through the revised 
statutes.  They are available through the Internet, on CD-ROM and 
they are in most major libraries.  They can be tracked all the 
way through the legislative process to see just how they are 
developed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regulations are another matter.  They come out in the </I>Canada 
Gazette<I> and they can come out at almost any time and as many 
times as the governor in council decides.  They may come out 
without any comment or input from Canadians.  There is not the 
same public disclosure and participation that occurs with 
legislation developed through parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at some of the powers that the minister has reserved 
for the governor in council.  In section 43(b) the governor in 
council can specify who may make an application under this act on 
behalf of a minor.  Surely this could have been set out within 
the statute.  It would likely include the mother, the father and 
it would likely include the official guardian if the parents were 
no longer alive or caring for the child and perhaps it would 
include other family relatives who are acting in place of the 
parents. Why do we leave it to the governor in council to make up 
the rules on who may act on behalf of the child? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In subsection 43(i) it will be up to the governor in council to 
define spouse for the purposes of the act.  Can we not define 
spouse within the legislation?  Do we need it done behind closed 
doors so that the Canadian public does not see just where this 
government has decided to take our laws? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 301 members of parliament with a budget to operate our 
parliamentary system that is quite staggering.  But here we are 
merely reallocating our legislating powers to the governor in 
council.  No wonder judges across this land are often eager to 
step into our jurisdiction and do more than just interpret our 
laws.  When we continually exhibit our disregard for our mandated 
responsibility, should we expect anything different? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 43(j) leaves it up to the governor in council to define 
what constitutes a relationship of a parent and a child for the 
purposes of determining entitlement to citizenship.  Once again I 
have difficulty accepting why we cannot be making this 
determination in parliament.  Why does it have to be reserved for 
the decision of others and why does it end up becoming law 
through regulation, which does not attract the same level of 
public scrutiny, comment and participation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for these reasons that I am unable to support this 
legislation.  We have a citizenship act that has been long 
overdue for change to rectify many of its inadequacies.  This new 
version of the citizenship act does not do that.  It is being 
sold as being new and improved, but I see little in the way of 
addressing our present failings.  The minister should be sent 
back to try again, but that will not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Far too often we in this place continue to follow the dictates 
of the Prime Minister's office and pass legislation that does not 
address the interests and concerns as raised by our citizens, and 
that is a shame because as time goes on the voice of the people 
grows weaker and weaker in this place.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I did not intend to speak on Bill C-63 until I had the somewhat 
unfortunate experience of listening to some of the nonsense that

you would find it unparliamentary to refer to the submissions 
made by opposition members as nonsense.

be debate and not a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, even the points of orders 
seem to be nonsensical.  I rest my case in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the citizenship and immigration committee, we 
spent several months in meetings trying to agree on an agenda 
that we should deal with knowing full well that Bill C-63 was 
coming before the House.  I would add that this is a bill 
entitled an act respecting Canadian citizenship, not immigration, 
not criminal activity and not the kind of fraudulent activity 
members opposite have spoken about.  It is about citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I sit in this place and listen to the fearmongering and the 
absolute unadulterated nonsense being spouted by these people it 
makes my blood boil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me share with this House a couple of facts.  First of all, 
the advertisement the hon. member referred to which stated 
guaranteed immigration to Canada whether you are a criminal or 
not was in a Latin trade magazine in Miami.  The phone number 
listed in Toronto is no longer in service.  How interesting.  It 
apparently is some kind of scam by someone who is trying to get 
money perhaps out of Latin Americans or Cubans who are refugees 
in the United States.  Who knows? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. For the last three minutes I have been listening to the 
member talk about fraud and not the citizenship act.  I would ask 
the member to talk about the citizenship act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Surrey Central has a point of order on relevance.  We would ask 
the hon. member for Mississauga West to touch on the bill at 
hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have spoken more about 
Bill C-63 in about two minutes, having been interrupted twice, 
than all these people all day today.  All they want to talk about 
is things they can perpetrate as being accurate when they know 
full well they are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about the bill.  This is what the Canadian public 
should know about this bill on citizenship.  It is intended to 
give citizenship at birth to all persons born in Canada.  Is the 
Reform Party opposed to that?  The Reform Party does not want to 
allow that to happen.  This bill gives the minister new authority 
to annul, cancel, wipe out citizenship in cases where it has been 
obtained through the use of false identity or where the person 
was subject to criminal prohibitions under the act.  This is 
exactly the point we hear them pontificating about in some 
self-righteous manner to try to paint all immigrants as 
criminals, to try to paint all immigrants as a burden on Canadian 
society.

order. I am trying to hear the comments of the hon. member.  I am 
having difficulty understanding how his comments relate to Bill 
C-63.  Could he address those comments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is quite clear that 
all they want to do is stop me from making these points.  I am 
reading right off the summary.  It is the summary of the 
citizenship of Canada act.  It is not something I am making up, 
unlike members opposite who are talking about disease 
transmission and criminal activity.  It is the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill sets out new prohibitions and offences and increases 
penalties, something the Reform Party wants to happen in every 
facet of life in this country.  It strengthens the integrity of 
the act and addresses more modern issues.  That is relevant to 
the act, unlike the nonsense we have been hearing. It will 
restrict the transmission of citizenship by derivation of first 
and second generation children.

<A NAME="LINK225">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.)</B> moved: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House approves in general the budgetary policy of the 
government. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, on this the first day of the Chinese New 
Year, I am tabling the budget documents, including notices of 
ways and means motions, in both official languages.  The details 
of the measures are contained in the documents and I am asking 
that an order of the day be designated for consideration of these 
motions. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also announcing that the government will be introducing 
bills at the earliest opportunity in order to implement the 
measures announced in this budget. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me begin, on behalf of the government, by expressing our 
appreciation to the Standing Committee on Finance and to many 
committees and caucuses for the valuable work they have done in 
the lead-up to this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me also express our gratitude to the great number of 
Canadians who have come forward to present their views.  The 
sense of civic responsibility they have shown now falls to us to 
respect, to balance the sound perspectives they have advanced, as 
we prepare together for a new century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an inescapable fact of life that a budget always brings 
with it its own special vocabulary.  We talk in the languages of 
rates and ratios, of percentages and decimals, of accounting 
methods and measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What all of this obscures is what budgets should be about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is to make the lives of Canadians better.  It is to improve 
their standard of living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is to build today for a better tomorrow.  For budgets are 
about more than entries in the books of a government; they are 
chapters in the progress of a people. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have always understood that the turnaround from the 
excesses, the high indebtedness of the recent past would not be 
as fast as any of us would like; that the challenges posed by 
rapid change are substantial, and that the bar set by 
globalization is very high. Canadians knew, therefore, that a 
long-term plan was needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Five years ago, we put that plan in place. Today, it is working. 
And thus our responsibility is clear. It is to build on the 
success of previous years. And with this budget, we are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget demonstrates that the finances of the nation are now 
in better shape than they have been in a generation, and that 
further progress lies ahead. It is a budget that acts strongly on 
the highest priority Canadians have, strengthening their system 
of health care for today and tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a budget that continues to equip Canadians to succeed in 
the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And it is a budget that for the first time in many years offers 
tax relief to every taxpayer and it does so without using 
borrowed money.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The past year has been one of extraordinary economic 
uncertainty, a volatility that has demonstrated that no country 
today can shield itself fully from global turmoil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the past year has proven as well that the steps that 
Canada has taken to strengthen its finances and its economy are 
paying off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt we have felt the effect of the storm.  As a 
result of the Asian crisis and its repercussions, our growth 
slowed from the robust pace of 1997 and early 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's west, particularly our forestry, energy and farming 
sectors, has suffered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet it must also be recognized that overall the damage has not 
been as severe as it might have been, as severe as it would have 
been only a few years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, job creation has been very strong.  More than 
450,000 new jobs were created last year, the large majority full 
time and in the private sector, exceeding even the impressive 
pace set the year before.  No other G-7 country, not even the 
United States, has matched our record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This strong job performance has continued in 1999, with 87,000 
jobs created in January alone.  This pushed the unemployment rate 
down to 7.8%, still too high but its lowest level in almost nine 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, job prospects for young people have improved 
significantly.  Over the past 12 months youth employment grew by 
10%, over 200,000 jobs, the best performance in over 25 years. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year, in terms of economic growth, both the IMF and OECD 
expect Canada to be among the top performers of the G-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not to say there are no risks. Very clearly, there are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The world is a long way from having the kind of architecture 
that will prevent or minimize economic crises in the future. We 
may have a global market. But we do not have a global framework 
to make it work for people. For Canada, putting this framework 
in place is a priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At home, the priority is also clear. 
We must equip Canadians to succeed in what remains an insecure 
world. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we continue to implement our plan, it is important to 
reconfirm the principles that underlie it, the values that we 
seek to sustain and strengthen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the government's deficit may be eliminated but we must 
never eliminate frugality from government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be no rewind to the reckless spending of other 
people's money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must and we will govern as if every dollar counts because 
every dollar does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget demonstrates that.  Program spending as a percentage 
of the economy will decline from 12.6% this year to 12% by the 
year 2000-01, its lowest level in 50 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we must never lose sight of the need to be balanced in 
our approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A successful society does not run on one cylinder.  We must 
respond to the reality that success on one front requires action 
on several. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we must never shy away from the need to make choices.  A 
government with too many priorities is a government that has 
none. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why, for example, health care, knowledge and innovation 
constitute fully three-quarters of the new spending announced in 
this year's and last year's budgets, the first two in the era of 
balanced books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, we must set aside any notion that acting in isolation is 
a sign of strength.  It is not.  In today's world, power lies in 
partnership.  Canadians have the right to expect that their 
governments will work together.

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therein lies the importance of the social union framework signed 
by the Prime Minister and the premiers two weeks ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, we must focus on the longer term.  Some of the greatest 
problems of the past arose when governments gave in to short term 
pressures that threw them off course.  If we are not to lose our 
way, we can never lose sight of the far horizon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, and most important, we must always be fair.  If, at the 
end of the day, it is said that the books of Canada are better, 
but the lives of Canadians are not, we will not have succeeded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The test of good government is not to protect privilege for the 
few.  It is to provide opportunity for the many. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our country has finally left the era of deficit financing 
behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last fiscal year, the federal government recorded its first 
budgetary surplus in over 28 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As this fiscal year draws to a close, this March 31, it is clear 
we will again balance the books or better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will mark the first time in almost half a century that the 
federal government will have recorded two balanced budgets or 
surpluses, back to back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, this budget confirms that we will balance the books or 
better next fiscal year and let me announce today that we will 
also balance the books or better in the year 2000-01. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means four consecutive years of budgets in the black.  This 
is only the third time this has happened since Confederation. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of even greater significance, we will enter the new millennium 
as a country no longer saddling generations to come with a 
legacy of ever-increasing debt. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For well over a generation, Canada's debt to GDP ratio rose 
relentlessly.  However, two years ago, as a result of both our 
action on the deficit and an economy that was growing, it began 
to fall meaningfully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year, Canada's debt to GDP ratio recorded the largest 
single improvement in over 40 years, falling from 70.3% to 66.9%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year and next year, we expect it will fall still further 
and by the year 2000-01 our debt ratio will be under 62%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking beyond that, our commitment is to keep it on a steady 
downward track year after year after year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, all of this may well sound arcane, some statistical 
addiction of economists, or perhaps even finance ministers, far 
removed from the day to day concerns of Canadians.  But nothing 
could be further from the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin:</B>  It certainly is beyond those who do not 
understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is Canadians who pay the price when government is forced to 
spend so much of each tax dollar simply to pay the interest on 
the national debt that it is unable to respond to their needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three years ago, when the debt to GDP ratio was at its peak, 36 
cents out of every revenue dollar, more than one-third, went to 
debt interest. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1630"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT78"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT78"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1630
<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was money Canadians could not use to prepare for the future 
because their governments were too busy paying for the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year, with the debt ratio dropping, the portion of each 
revenue dollar servicing the debt also dropped to 27 cents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means the beginning of a new flexibility, a new freedom to 
strengthen health care, to provide needed tax relief, to fight 
child poverty, to protect the environment and to invest in a more 
productive economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, balancing the books means a new strength to build 
today for a better tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But it means as well that we cannot stop the debt fight now. For 
there is something deeply wrong when the largest program the 
federal government has is paying interest on its debt, more than 
$41 billion this year alone.  To put this in perspective, that is 
almost twice the size of our next largest expenditure, pensions 
for Canadian seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the debt repayment plan that we announced in the last 
budget will remain in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we will as we have done again today, present two-year 
fiscal plans based on prudent economic assumptions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we will continue to build into our financial plans a 
contingency reserve, a buffer against the unexpected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, if the contingency reserve is not needed, it will 
continue to go directly to paying down the debt. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, following this course, not only have Canadians 
secured a financial victory that is remarkable by domestic 
standards. They have secured a victory that is remarkable by 
international standards as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The accounting method Canada uses to calculate its debt 
repayment is considered among the most rigorous in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many other major economies measure only the debt that is owed to 
markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that basis, Canada's debt to GDP ratio is around the 52% 
level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year, we paid down $9.6 billion in market debt. This year, 
we expect to pay down a similar amount, for a total of almost 
$20 billion in just two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are one of the few countries in the world that is actually 
paying down its debt. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far, so good.  But does this mean that all of the challenges 
are behind us?  The answer is clearly no.  The deficit may be 
eliminated but our debt ratio still remains the second highest of 
the G-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the Asian crisis remains with us and events in 
Brazil highlight the fragility of the world's economic recovery. 
We are weathering the storm much better than most. However, 
Canada's economists have cut their growth projections 
substantially from where they were at this time last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite these realities, as we prepared this budget, there were 
those who said we should take the risk that things would turn out 
vastly better than anticipated, that therefore we should spend 
more or that we should cut taxes more; in other words that it was 
time to cease being careful, being cautious with the finances of 
the nation and that we should now revert to the habits of the 
past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is our response to those who hold those views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have always believed that the odds of reaching our goals must 
be better than a mere flip of a coin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very reason we are still on track to balance the budget or 
better in each of the next two years, the very reason we are not 
back into deficit despite a degree of global economic turmoil 
that literally no one foresaw a little over a year ago, all of 
this is the result of the cautious approach we have applied to 
our finances from the very beginning. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, our careful approach has also ensured that we have 
the resources to respond to other unanticipated events, while at 
the same time safeguarding our financial health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 and 1997, it gave us the capacity to provide assistance 
to those who suffered from the Saguenay and Red River floods. 
In 1998, it allowed us to respond to the ice storm.  This year, 
it has enabled us to support Canada's farmers who are in 
difficulty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To those who believe we can play Russian roulette with the 
nation's finances, let me simply say no.  We will not squander 
the opportunity Canadians have before them.

<A HREF="#LINKT78"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That speaks to our nation's finances. However, it does not by 
itself speak to our nation's future.  Taking care of the needs of 
our people does not end with taking care of the books. A nation 
is not a corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Markets do many things and they do them well.  But there are 
many things that markets cannot do. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Markets cannot provide quality health care to all of us when we 
are sick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They cannot prevent the gap between rich and poor from becoming 
an unbridgeable gulf. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Markets cannot deal with the root causes of homelessness or of 
violence against women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Markets deal as they should in services and goods.  They do not, 
however, deal with the common good. Therefore, we must. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not here to sit back and simply build up surpluses or pay 
down debt.  Our purpose is not just to build a better bottom 
line.  It is to build a stronger nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why, among other initiatives, we have provided new money 
for the youth employment strategy, expanding it by 50%, an 
initiative that has helped more than 100,000 young people each 
year gain valuable work experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why in this budget we are following through on our 
commitment to implement Gathering Strength, Canada's action plan 
for and with aboriginal peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why in this budget we are devoting new resources to 
overseas development assistance and why we are taking a 
leadership role in the international community to deal with the 
issue of crippling debt in developing countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why in this budget we are devoting significant new 
resources for youth justice, replacing the Young Offenders Act, 
protecting the public from the most violent and introducing new 
community based programs to help others change their behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why in this budget we are improving the compensation and 
the benefits of the men and women of the armed forces. Let it be 
said that the men and women of the armed forces are Canadians who 
put their lives at risk every single day around the world. They 
are Canadians who have demonstrated uncommon dedication here at 
home helping their country cope with a series of national 
disasters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why in this budget we are making the largest, single 
expenditure we have ever made in any area since taking office: 
strengthening health care for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the decades, Canadians have made a series of defining 
decisions.  They were decisions about much more than some 
government program.  They were decisions about what kind of 
country we wanted to be.  They were the decisions that led to 
medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today it falls to us to take the steps necessary to safeguard 
that great legacy, to sustain and strengthen our health care 
system now and for the future. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians do not need to be convinced that health care is a 
priority.  They worry about crowded emergency rooms, about 
understaffed wards, about waiting lists for tests and treatment. 
They worry about the costs of paying for services and drugs that 
are not covered. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The short-term pressures and problems in our system must be dealt 
with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, we must plan for the longer term.  The 
Minister of Health has put it very well “What we must strive for 
is a people-centred system in the truest sense, one that ensures 
the right care by the right provider at the right time in the 
right place, at reasonable cost”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the first major investment we made when it was clear 
that deficit elimination was at hand was to raise the annual 
cash floor of the Canada health and social transfer, the CHST, 
from $11 billion to $12.5 billion. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today with the books balanced we are able to do even more.  As 
the Prime Minister wrote last month in response to a letter from 
the premiers: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our collaborative work on a renewed health partnership and on a 
new social union partnership more generally along with increased 
health funding, will reassure Canadians that governments are 
working together to address their health and other social needs. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are announcing a significant increase in transfers to 
the provinces to support health care and a number of other 
initiatives which strengthen the federal government's 
contribution to Canada's health system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the next five years we will invest an additional $11.5 
billion through the Canadian health and social transfer.  Two 
billion dollars in new cash will be received by the provinces in 
the first year, continuing into the second.  In the third year 
this will rise to $2.5 billion and will remain at that higher 
level for the fourth and the fifth years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that cash transfers under the CHST will increase from 
the current $12.5 billion to $15 billion within three years, by 
2001-02. This will bring the health component of the CHST to the 
level it was before the period of restraint in the mid-1990s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, flexibility will be given to the provinces to 
determine the timing of when they receive these funding increases 
over the first three years to enable each province to best 
determine the particular health needs of their citizens. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1645"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT81"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT81"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1645

<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $11.5 billion in additional cash together with the value of 
tax transfers which will also grow over this period means that 
total CHST transfers will reach a new high by the year 2001. 
Furthermore, while this is a substantial investment it is by no 
means the end of the story.  As our financial flexibility 
increases in the years ahead, health care will continue to be 
very much one of the key priorities for further action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the new funding that we have just announced we 
have worked with the provinces and the territories to renew all 
major fiscal arrangements for five years and to do so on a fairer 
basis. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are renewing and strengthening the equalization program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This program reflects the shared commitment of all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It provides provinces that are less well off with the resources 
they need to provide reasonably comparable public services, 
including health care, to their people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why equalization was one of the few programs left 
totally untouched when virtually all other spending was reduced 
as we grappled with the deficit challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two weeks ago, legislation was tabled to renew the program 
with improvements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the next five years, equalization payments are projected to 
total more than $50 billion. This is considerably more than the 
provinces received over the past five years, in fact, $5 billion 
more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, official estimates at the time of the last 
budget indicated that we would be providing the provinces with 
$8.5 billion in equalization this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the latest 
data indicate that payments this year will now total $10.7 
billion, $2.2 billion more than projected in the 1998 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And next year, equalization payments will be $600 million higher 
than projected. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, as a result of the increased CHST funding and higher 
equalization more money will be available for public services, 
including health care, throughout the country.  For example, from 
now to the end of the next fiscal year, a period of some 13 
months, as a result of the increases in the CHST and the higher 
equalization payments $4.2 billion in new cash will be made 
available to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The continued vitality of equalization depends on the 
willingness of Canadians to share Canada's prosperity.  This 
requires that all Canadians be treated fairly and equally.  In 
1990 the previous government limited the growth in transfers to 
Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia for social assistance and 
social services.  This has meant on a per capita basis the 
residents of those provinces have not received as much as 
residents of other provinces from the CHST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 we began to address this disparity.  Legislation was 
passed that would cut the per capita differences in half in four 
years time. 
Today we are moving much further and much faster than that.  We 
are announcing the full restoration of equal per capita 
entitlement for all provinces, and this will be completed in 
three years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me put today's decisions in context. They are about much more 
than dollars and cents. They are about a fundamental choice that 
Canadians have made about the kind of society in which we want to 
live.  What we must always make clear is that the circumstances 
of the many, not the advantages of the few, will guide our 
decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For each and every Canadian this means good health must never 
become captive to good fortune.  Our health care system is blind 
to income so that its eyes can focus on need.  It must, and it 
will remain so.  The fact is that in response to the health care 
challenge some have said that the answer is easy. Some have said 
eliminate equal access. They have said make wealth status, not 
health status, the ticket to quality health care. For those who 
hold those views let me say on behalf of this government, no, not 
now, not ever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Minister of Health has said, “We spend $80 billion a 
year as a country on health care, and it is astonishing how 
little we know about what we get for that money”.  Canadians 
have the right to know how their health dollars are being spent. 
They have the right to know if the quality of their health system 
is improving. Furthermore, health care providers need the best 
information possible if they are to provide high quality care for 
their patients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments as well need to know what is working, what is not 
and why. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget announces four major initiatives that will 
significantly improve the health information made available to 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These initiatives flow from the understanding on health and 
the social union framework, and will be implemented in a manner 
consistent with both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we are making an investment that will lead to valuable 
annual progress reports to the Canadian people. One will provide 
insight on the health of Canadians. Another will look at the 
health care system itself, for example, the situation with 
regard to waiting lists, the most effective treatments available 
and the best use of resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, this budget provides funding to build a national 
health surveillance network. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This network will be able to identify the outbreak of serious 
illness, from salmonella to flu to tropical diseases, so that 
preventive measures can be taken to manage and minimize their 
impact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the Canada health network is being established on the 
Internet. Canadians everywhere will have direct access to 
objective, reliable and up to date health information across the 
board, from nutrition to breast cancer, Alzheimer's to diabetes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, this budget provides funding for an important 
initiative to apply up to date information technology to the 
delivery of health services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, this will include telehealth, which holds 
extraordinary potential for the ability of doctors and nurses in 
rural and remote areas to communicate with the best specialists 
anywhere in the country. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1655"></A>

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I just mentioned, Canadians who live in rural and remote 
areas face unique problems.  Innovations in community based 
services are being developed across the country in response to 
their needs.  This budget provides $50 million over the next 
three years to continue developing with the provinces promising 
strategies for rural and community health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next, we tend to focus, as we must, on care and cure once we are 
sick.  The question is do we focus enough on the other half of 
the equation, on preventing sickness in the first place.  As has 
been said, health is more than health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget provides $287 million over the next three years for 
several initiatives relating to the prevention of illness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the Canada prenatal nutrition program works to 
improve the health of women at risk to ensure that they have 
healthy babies.  Pregnancies put at risk by alcohol or drug 
abuse, family violence or other factors can have serious effects 
on children's lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are announcing a substantial additional funding for 
this program over the next three years to enable it to reach the 
majority of women at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next, a healthy environment with clean water and safe food is 
critical to our health and well-being.  It is recognized that the 
programs we have in place to deal with toxic substances are far 
from adequate.  This budget provides Environment Canada with the 
resources it needs to deal with that problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also allocates additional resources to help ensure food 
safety in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, diabetes is a chronic health condition facing a great 
many Canadians, in particular aboriginal peoples among whom it is 
three times more prevalent.  This budget devotes important 
resources to addressing this serious situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, health services for first nations will be upgraded 
through a separate $190 million over the next three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Research is at the core of a quality health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Better research is about better health for Canadians.  It is 
about our hope that with improved care and treatment, prevention 
certainly and hopefully a cure, that a mother will overcome the 
tragedy of breast cancer, that a grandfather will be spared 
permanent memory loss, and that a son or a daughter will regain 
nerve functions following a devastating accident or injury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must provide Canadians with the best medical research 
possible for the 21st century, for if we are to improve one of 
the world's finest health care systems, we must be a world leader 
in health research as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This begins with good research infrastructure.  That is why in 
1997 we announced the creation of the Canada foundation for 
innovation, the CFI, whose purpose is to modernize the equipment 
and facilities necessary to develop and test new ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Already exciting projects supported by the CFI are underway. 
For example, at the University of Manitoba researchers are 
working to reduce the 30% rejection for kidney transplants. 
Researchers at Carleton University and the Kingston General 
Hospital are co-operating to upgrade MRI machines so that they 
are able to detect breast cancer earlier than they now can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In only two years the CFI is becoming an essential building 
block for health research in Canada.  Approximately 45% of the 
awards granted in 1998 went to health related infrastructure in 
hospitals and universities.  As we will say later in the budget, 
its funding will be enhanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nurses have borne a great deal of the brunt of the changes in 
the health care system. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT84"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT84"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1700

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are working under tremendous stress.  There are predictions 
of a major shortage, yet it is impossible to imagine a quality 
health care system of the future that does not include a much 
larger role for nurses in the community, in clinics, in hospitals 
and in the home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Nurses Association has proposed that we create a 
$25 million research fund in order to enhance the leadership role 
that nurses deserve to play in the health care system of today 
and tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget does just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the nature of modern health research has changed 
dramatically.  It now spans a wide variety of disciplines, from 
genetics to nutrition, from microelectronics to the social and 
economic determinants of health, each of which can contribute 
greatly to the other.  Based on that reality, over the past year 
Canada's health research community under the leadership of Dr. 
Henry Friesen, president of the Medical Research Council, who is 
in the gallery, has come together to develop an exciting new 
approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have proposed to create the Canadian institutes of health 
research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through a series of networks the CIHR would bring together the 
best researchers, regardless of where they live in Canada, 
specializing in areas such as aging, arthritis, women's health, 
cancer, heart disease and children's health. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The institutes would consist of networks which would draw 
together scientists across the full spectrum of health research, 
from basic science to clinical research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CIHR would build on Canada's strengths, the dedication 
of our biomedical researchers, the leading-edge work of our 
social science researchers, the high quality of our research 
facilities, the excellence of our national health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would transform those strengths into an even stronger 
coherent whole. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Researchers have only been rarely called upon to explore 
solutions together to national health challenges.  Through the 
CIHR, our health research capacity across various disciplines and 
specialities will now be linked more productively to the major 
health issues facing the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the CIHR reinforces Canada's capacity to become a 
world leader in new breakthroughs across the medical spectrum. 
It would begin to reverse the drain of those who leave to seek 
greater opportunity elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, rather than relying on imported discoveries Canada 
would capture new economic benefits, the new jobs that come from 
bringing such breakthroughs to world markets ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore we are setting aside $65 million in the year 2000 to 
support the launch of the new Canadian institutes of health 
research, an amount we are prepared to increase to $175 million 
the following the year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, $35 million has been provided this year to the Canadian 
Health Services Research Foundation to support its participation 
in the CIHR. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to provide immediate new support to advanced health 
research and to bridge the transition, we are also announcing an 
increase of $50 million in each of the next three years in the 
budgets of the three granting councils, the National Research 
Council and Health Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Together, the increased funding for existing federal research 
organizations and the money being set aside for the CIHR will 
effectively make $225 million of new resources available for the 
objectives of the CIHR by the year 2001.

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, the combination of all the initiatives just 
announced is to increase the funding for health research by $550 
million over the remainder of this fiscal year and the next three 
years. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me summarize the resources being devoted to health care in 
this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the next five years, the provinces will receive $11.5 
billion in new cash through the CHST for health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>$6.5 billion of that will be made available over the next three 
years. 
During that same period, an additional $1.4 billion will be 
invested in health research and other means through which the 
federal government contributes to Canada's health system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means almost $8 billion in new resources will be spent over 
the next three years on health care, the largest new investment we 
have ever made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fundamental economic challenge before us is to complete the 
task of putting in place the framework for a stronger economy, 
an economy where incomes are growing, where employment continues 
to increase, where the Canadian standard of living and quality 
of life are on the rise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Prime Minister has said, and I quote “Implementing a 
strategy to achieve a higher standard of living for all 
Canadians always comes back to dealing squarely with the same 
deeply rooted challenge: enhancing Canada's long-term 
productivity”. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Greater productivity is about one thing, how to bring our human, 
natural and financial resources together to produce higher 
incomes, better jobs and an enhanced quality of life for all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is much of our economic challenge can be summarized in 
two words, knowledge and innovation.  These are the new raw 
materials of the 21st century economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are the key to a country that can race forward when the 
global seas are calm and ride out the rough weather safely when 
they are not.  Knowledge and innovation are two sides of the same 
coin, the true hard currency of the future, the sources of 
sustained growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Education is critical, for it equips Canadians with the skills, 
the aptitude and the attitude to seize the new opportunities the 
future has to offer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why in this budget we have invested so much in 
supporting those engaged in post-graduate research. However, what 
we seek is not simply knowledge for the few but for the many. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why in the 1998 budget we launched the Canadian 
opportunities strategy, a seven part plan to improve access to 
skills, training and higher education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me simply describe the results of one of those initiatives since 
its inception one year ago, the Canada education savings grant, 
a cash contribution from the federal government put directly 
into registered education savings plans, established to help 
families save for a child's future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This program has become a huge success in its first year alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 25 years since their inception in 1972 through to 1997 
there was a $2.5 billion net accumulation in RESPs.  However, in 
1998 alone, with the introduction of the Canada education savings 
grant, the total soared to $4 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This and the other measures in last year's and this year's 
budgets are anchored in a very straightforward proposition, that 
every Canadian who wants to learn should have the opportunity to 
do so. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT86"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT86"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1710

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But as we work to develop that opportunity, let it also be clear 
that Canada's challenge begins well before the age of formal 
schooling.  Our children will only seize the opportunities to 
learn if they are nurtured from the very earliest age to develop 
a readiness to learn.  That is why in previous budgets we 
bolstered the community action program for children.  It is why 
we are investing in aboriginal head start.  It is why, in this 
budget, we have expanded the prenatal nutrition program and it is 
why, as we will see later, we are increasing the child tax 
benefit for low and middle income families.  Going forward, we 
must build on these initiatives still further. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, I referred to knowledge and innovation as the flip 
sides of the same coin. Let us now turn the coin over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From lab bench to factory floor, from farm to forest, innovation 
is the engine that creates jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past several years, we have put in place a new 
framework for innovation, a strategy that we have implemented step 
by step in each of our budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That strategy has three parts, the creation of knowledge, the 
dissemination and sharing of knowledge and the application of 
knowledge, its commercialization, getting ideas out into the 
market. 
This budget takes further action in each of those three areas. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the creation of knowledge, breakthroughs do not just 
happen.  They require a sustained investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As mentioned earlier, in 1997 the Canada foundation for 
innovation was created with an $800 million investment whose 
purpose was to fund new and modernized research infrastructure at 
our universities, colleges, research hospitals and not for profit 
research institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through partnerships, the federal investment in the foundation 
will translate into $2.5 billion in world class facilities and 
equipment needed to make world class discoveries, discoveries 
that will open the door to exciting commercial opportunities and 
jobs down the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on its very clear success and the crucial role it is now 
playing, this budget allocates a further $200 million to the 
foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Research and access to knowledge support one another. Therefore, 
building on the increased funding announced in last year's 
budget, the government's granting councils and the National 
Research Council will be provided more than $120 million in 
further support, over and above that announced for health 
research, over the next three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, many believe that Canada has the capacity to become 
even more of a world leader in the field of biotechnology, one of 
the fastest growing of all new technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has huge potential applications ranging from agriculture 
and forestry to manufacturing and medicine.  As a result we are 
committing $55 million over the next three years to support 
biotechnology research in science based government departments. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the dissemination of knowledge, we have set a goal 
of making Canada the most connected nation in the world by next 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to SchoolNet, we are on course to see Canada's 16,000 
public schools and 3,400 public libraries connected to the 
Internet by March 31 this year. Up to 10,000 rural and urban 
communities will be connected through the community access 
program in two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Building on these efforts, and following the advice of a blue 
ribbon panel announced by the Prime Minister last year, this 
budget provides $60 million over the next three years to fund 
smart communities demonstration projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Smart communities use information technology in new and 
innovative ways to empower their residents, institutions and 
region as a whole. Our goal is to establish at least one of 
these projects in each of our provinces, in the North and in an 
aboriginal community.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, this budget provides $60 million over five years to 
build GeoConnections to ensure that Canada stays at the 
forefront of mapping and its applications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This initiative has tremendous potential for a whole range of 
industries and services. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of value added job creation, we must accelerate the 
furtherance of innovative technologies in all sectors of the 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The networks of centres of excellence have been a successful 
part of this endeavour.  They now link more than 900 researchers 
in 60 universities with over 400 companies across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this budget, we are increasing their funding by $30 million a 
year, an increase of more than 60%. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 we established technology partnerships Canada to support 
industry in turning promising ideas into successful products. 
These investments focus on aerospace, environmental 
technologies, and enabling technologies such as advanced 
manufacturing and materials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we are announcing that the funding for technology 
Partnerships Canada will be increased by $50 million per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also providing $50 million to the Business Development 
Bank of Canada to strengthen its ability to lend to small and 
medium size businesses in knowledge-based export fields 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, the measures we have announced today, above and 
beyond health research, amount to a cumulative total of $1.8 
billion in additional resources over the next three years for 
knowledge, innovation and support for youth and other employment 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These investments are all directed toward a single overarching 
goal, and that is to provide Canadians with a more diversified, 
more innovative economy in which to accomplish their goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is, as long as we are too dependent on ideas developed 
in other countries, our economy will remain unduly dependent on 
those countries.  If we are to have a stronger, more innovative 
private sector, we must generate more knowledge and demonstrate 
greater initiative here ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ours must be a country that excels in turning ideas into the 
value added jobs of the future in rural Canada as well as urban 
Canada, everywhere and in everything we do.  Ours must be a 
country that has excellence as its goal for that will be the 
route to a higher standard of living and a better quality of life 
for all Canadians in the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me now turn to the next part of our plan, reducing taxes, 
which is also part of our productivity agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let there be no doubt.  We want to reduce taxes as quickly and 
as broadly as we can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As begun last year, now that the books are in balance, we will 
get taxes down.  We will do so in every single budget, and we 
will do so without prejudicing the soundness of our finances or 
the security of our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our goal and our commitment is to ensure that Canadians keep 
more of the money they earn.  After all, they worked for it.  It 
is theirs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principles of our tax policy are clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, our tax system must be fair.  Tax reductions must benefit 
first those who need it most, low and middle income Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, broad based tax relief should focus initially on 
personal income taxes.  That is where the burden is greatest. 
That is where Canadian taxes are most out of line with other 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, because our debt burden is so high, broad based tax 
relief should not be financed with borrowed money.

<A HREF="#LINKT87"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want tax relief to be permanent, not temporary.  The worst 
thing we could do would be to provide structural tax relief one 
year, only to have to rescind it in the next as a result of the 
country going back into deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our last budget, with deficit elimination finally secure, we 
were able to put in place overall tax relief directed at low and 
middle income Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We said then that we would build on those measures in future 
budgets as resources permitted, that as soon as we could afford 
it tax reductions would be broadened and deepened.  In this 
budget, we are following through on that commitment, building on 
the initiatives taken last year. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, personal tax credits ensure that no tax is paid on a 
basic amount of income. They make the tax system more fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year, we increased the amount of income that could be 
earned before paying one penny of tax by $500 for singles, and 
$1,000 for couples and families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a first step, this measure was targeted to benefit low income 
Canadians. The full amount of the benefit started to be reduced 
at about $8,000 of income and was completely gone at $20,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this budget, effective July 1, 1999, that tax relief is being 
extended to all taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next, effective July 1, we are increasing the amount of income 
that Canadians can receive without paying taxes by a further 
$175. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of these measures, the amount of income all 
Canadians can earn tax-free will now be $675 higher than before 
the 1998 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This more than offsets the effect of inflation on the basic 
credits since 1992. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While all taxpayers will benefit from these measures, the 
largest proportionate benefit will go to low and modest income 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, due to the measures in last year's budget, 400,000 
lower income Canadians no longer pay income taxes. The measures 
just announced will ensure that 200,000 more Canadians will also 
be removed from the tax rolls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1986, the previous government introduced a 3% general surtax, 
a tax on tax, in order to help bring the deficit down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year, with the books in balance, we began to eliminate that 
surtax, starting with taxpayers earning less than $50,000, and 
reducing it for those earning between $50,000 and $65,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year, we complete the job.  As of July 1, the 3% surtax 
will be eliminated for each and every Canadian taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have spoken about the support we are providing low income 
Canadians through reducing their taxes, but there are many other 
ways in which we can provide and are providing assistance to 
families with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the creation of the national child benefit system, the 
federal and provincial governments are embarked on a major 
co-operative effort to support families and reduce child poverty. 
The purpose is to ensure that children in this country are always 
better off when their parents join the workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997, we announced the first federal contribution to this 
national endeavour, $850 million which began flowing last July, 
increasing financial support to over two million children and 
their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1998 budget, we announced that a further $850 million 
would also be allocated, following consultations with the 
provincial and territorial governments.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These discussions have concluded in agreement.  We are 
announcing, therefore, today that the Canada child tax benefit 
for low income families will be increased by a further $350 per 
child beginning July 1, 1999 and July 1, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means, for example, that a family with two children that 
earns $20,000 will receive an increased benefit of $700 for a 
total of $3,750 per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taken together, our two previous budgets provided $1.7 billion 
for the children of low income families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, building on this effort, we are announcing that a further 
$300 million is being allocated to enhance the Canada child tax 
benefit for modest and middle income families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, 100,000 more families will become eligible for all 
or part of the base benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me illustrate the impact of the 1998 and 1999 tax measures 
on typical Canadian families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consider the impact on a middle income family, a family of four 
with two incomes totalling $50,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That family received $183 in tax relief as a result of the 1998 
budget.  This budget provides an additional $373 to that family, 
$189 through the increase in the base credits and $184 in 
increased Canada child tax benefit payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Putting last year's budget and this year's budget together, that 
means $546 more for such families, a 15% reduction in their net 
federal tax, and this does not include consequential reductions 
in provincial income taxes. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consider as well a one-earner family of four earning $30,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That family received $145 in tax relief from the 1998 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of today's budget, that family will receive $353 
more—$169 through the increase in personal credits and $184 in 
increased Canada child tax benefit payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, when the GST credit is included, this means that 
as a result of measures in this and the last budget, such 
families will now pay no net federal income tax whatsoever. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing this section, let me summarize the combined impact of 
the tax measures set out here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax relief of $16.5 billion will be provided over the next three 
years, $7.7 billion of which results from actions in this budget. 
For the two budgets together, that is tax relief of $3.9 billion 
in 1999-2000, $6 billion in 2000-01 and $6.6 billion in 2001-02. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Low and modest income families will benefit the most.  Compared 
to the situation before the 1998 budget, 600,000 additional 
Canadians will now pay no federal income tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, all 15 million Canadian taxpayers will receive tax 
reductions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, as a result of the reduction in employment 
insurance premiums announced in December, employers and employees 
are now paying $1.1 billion less for employment insurance. 
Relative to the premium rates that prevailed in 1994, employees 
and employers are now paying $3.5 billion less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax measures we have announced today are important and they 
are fair.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But our action to reduce taxes will not end here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be clear.  As resources become available, the personal 
income tax burden in Canada will be further reduced.  This will 
occur year after year, each budget building on the progress made 
before. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, when we came into office, the deficit and debt burden 
were rising relentlessly. The finances of the nation were out of 
control. Our response was immediate. We eliminated the deficit. 
Then, last year, we began to get our debt burden down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, in this budget, we have moved to strengthen the 
confidence of Canadians in their health care system and we have 
further strengthened the sinews of an innovative, productive 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we lowered taxes. 
And so, as our financial health has improved, we have moved 
forward, focusing first on those least able to pay. And in this 
budget, tax relief has been provided for each and every Canadian 
taxpayer. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From rising deficits to balanced books.  From an increasing debt 
burden to one that is declining.  From years of difficult cuts to 
an era where needed new investments are being made.  From a tax 
burden that was rising to a time where it is falling.  That is 
the summary of this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking ahead, there are two dangers that a responsible 
government must avoid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, a government that pretends it can be everything to 
everyone is a government that will do nothing for anyone. 
Government must focus on those areas where it can really make a 
difference.  That is what we have done and that is what we will 
continue to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second danger on the other hand is to become fixated on one 
major issue alone and as a result leave every other pressing 
problem to fester. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A focus only on new spending to the exclusion of everything else 
would put us back in the red.  A focus on tax reduction alone 
would leave us unable to respond to the core needs of Canadians. 
A focus on debt reduction alone might make the books look better, 
but it would also make everything else look worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can never lose sight of the need to take a balanced approach. 
For the social and economic needs of our country are not 
separate.  They are not in conflict. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a new century beckons, we can now say with confidence that a 
new beginning is truly at hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are freer than we have been for a generation to chart a new 
course for ourselves. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the early days of this century, Sir Wilfrid Laurier spoke of 
our prospects as a people.  He said that the 20th century would 
belong to Canada.  Some since have scoffed at those words 
pointing to great powers, great empires and great conquests. They 
have said he was wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well, Laurier was right. Not according to the cold calculations 
of might, but because of the quality of our life.  Not because of 
any single value we have pursued but because of the many values 
we have advanced together. The value of tolerance, of fairness. 
The value of working together, the peace we enjoy and the 
openness we show to each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our opportunity today is to see our future as Laurier did, a 
country that refuses to set limits on what it can do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is so much we must continue to build.  There is so much 
that lies ahead to accomplish.  There are barriers we must bring 
down, of circumstance and of privilege, and there are new bridges 
that we can all cross together.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The story of this century may be over.  But the story of Canada 
is not; it goes on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to imagine a day when we have fully met the challenge 
of an aging population, when we have met our obligations to the 
young and when we have met our responsibility to the environment. 
It is time to take the steps now that will take us closer to 
that destination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to take on the world and win. Some may say that this 
is too ambitious.  We say that there is no ambition that is too 
great for this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let there be one thing coming from what this government has 
done.  Let us come together, all of us, and make a pledge of 
common purpose that we will do everything in our power today so 
that the generations of tomorrow are able to say not only that 
Canada belongs to the 21st century, but that the 21st century 
belongs to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>   Hear, hear. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in about three minutes I will formally move adjournment 
of the budget debate until tomorrow.  Before doing so I would 
like to thank the Minister of Finance for his speech and also for 
the improvement in his vocabulary.  After much tutoring from the 
opposition he has finally learned how to say tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Using the words tax relief and delivering tax relief are two 
different things.  If we cut through all the verbiage and the 
spin doctoring, if we cut through the shell game that announces 
modest tax reductions with great fanfare but says nothing about 
all the other federal taxes that are inexorably taking more money 
from the pockets of Canadians, if we cut through the inflated 
announcements about $11 billion in health care spending but 
forget to talk about the $20 billion in health care cuts that 
have been taken— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  The hon. Leader of the Opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if we do all that, if 
we say all the things these members do not want to hear, we get 
to the bottom line and that is that Canadians are paying more and 
getting less.  They are getting less health care and less social 
services.  In a word, this is a pay more, get less budget.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It reminds me of the time in old England when King Richard the 
Lionhearted was away on a crusade.  He left a relative, Prince 
Jean, in charge of the kingdom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To quote a rhyme from that period, “He wanted to be known as 
John the First, but he ended up known as John the Worst”. Why? 
Because with the aid of his henchman, the sheriff of Nottingham, 
he taxed his people to death.  Under his regency the government 
got richer but the people got poorer.  They paid more and got 
less, until a green clad reformer named Robin Hood created the 
united alternative, but that is another subject which I will save 
for another day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I close by suggesting that King Jean and the sheriff of 
Nottingham retire to the castle for a night of revelling while 
Reformers will retire to Sherwood Forest to plot our plans for 
the next day, and that we return here tomorrow to debate the only 
real question this budget poses.  Why should Canadians pay more 
and get less?
