	The House resumed from March 30 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-76, an act to implement certain provisions of 
the budget tabled in Parliament on February 27, 1995, be read 
the second time and referred to a committee; and of the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would like to make the 
House aware that during the next 54 minutes of debate members 
will have 20 minutes to make their speeches which will be 
subject to a 10-minute question and comment period. After the 
54 minutes, the House will proceed to the next stage of debate 
and members will be allowed a 10-minute maximum.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	If I am not mistaken, the last person who spoke yesterday was 
the hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell and we were 
at the question and comment period. Are there any questions or 
comments?
<P>
	Resuming debate with the hon. member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak on Bill C-76. For the benefit of 
those who are watching us at home, let me repeat that this bill 
deals with budget measures, notably the important issue of 
transfer payments to the provinces.
<P>
	I would like to remind them that, when we talk about transfers 
to the provinces, for this past year at least, we are in fact 
referring to three main sets of programs. We are referring to 
three categories of transfers, namely those under established 
programs financing, which the federal government has reduced 
by $21 billion for 1995-96, under the equalization program, 
which the government has reduced by $8.87 billion, and, finally, 
under the Canada Assistance Plan, which the government has 
reduced by $7.95 billion.
<P>
	It is important to remember that transfer payments to the 
provinces are a matter of particular importance in a federal 
system, since, in a federal system, the relationship between the 
federal government and the provinces is absolutely crucial. 
Whenever financial considerations are involved, we must bear 
in mind that a federal system is a system made up or based on 
three components. In any federal system, first of all, you have 
two main levels of government: a central government and the 
so-called subordinate administrations.
<P>
<B>(1005) </B>
<P>
	Depending on the particular system, these lower levels are 
called provinces, or landers, or cantons, but where there is a 
federal system, there are at least two levels of government, each 
of which is supposed to have sovereign authority over every 
areas of jurisdiction prescribed in the constitution. In the 
Canadian Constitution, these areas are listed in section 91. 
Section 91 lists the powers of the central government and 
section 92, the provincial areas of jurisdiction.
<P>
	Finally, the last characteristic of federalism is the 
constitution, which is designed to delineate the respective 
powers of the two levels of government. Why do I feel the need 
to give these elements of historical background and political 
definition? Because, if the Canadian federal system were 
harmonious and responsive to the provinces, a system in which 
the jurisdictions established under the Canadian Constitution 
were respected, we would certainly not be passing or debating a 
bill like Bill C-76.
<P>
	Why am I saying that? Because, in a federal system with two 
levels of government, where each level has specific 
responsibilities, financial equilibrium is understandably a 
matter of great importance. We can appreciate that, when one 
level of government decides unilaterally, without consulting the 
provinces, as this government is doing, to cutback transfer 
payments to the provinces, this is designed to have a 
destabilizing effect. We must keep in mind-and we will have 
an opportunity to say it again during the various debates to 
come-that, for all practical purposes, the federal government 
plans to use this bill to cut transfers to the provinces by $7 
billion.
<P>
	Let us recall the three programs through which funds are 
transferred. First, there is the Established Programs Financing 
for which the federal government plans to set aside $21 billion. 
As you know, Mr. Speaker, the Established Programs Financing 
in place since 1977, is the government vehicle for financing 
health care and  post-secondary education. Of course, we know 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11332"> 11332 </A></B>
<P>
full well that, under the 1867 Constitution Act, these sectors do 
not come under federal jurisdiction. Yet, over time, they have 
interfered in these areas of jurisdiction. So the first vehicle is 
Established Programs Financing.
<P>
	The second vehicle is very well-known because, for a very 
long time, the champions of Canadian federalism told us that an 
original feature of the system was equalization, for which the 
federal government plans to set aside close to $9 billion. 
Equalization was born shortly after World War II. We must keep 
in mind that this transfer system was aimed at giving all 
Canadians from Newfoundland to British Columbia access to 
the same range of services. Equalization saw the light of day 
because Canada is an impossible country, a country of regional 
disparities.
<P>
	Because the provinces do not have the same ability to collect 
taxes, because they do not have access to the same resources, nor 
the same tax base, we decided to develop a redistribution 
mechanism so that funds would be redistributed from wealthier 
provinces with access to a broader tax base to poorer provinces.
<P>
	As you know, Mr. Speaker, the equalization formula is 
extremely complex, involving some 40 factors, so that as we 
speak, since 1989, in fact, the beneficiaries of equalization have 
been Quebec, the Maritimes, Manitoba and Saskatchewan.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
	Again, to make it clear to those who our listening, there is a 
third transfer mechanism, namely the Canada Assistance Plan, 
which was established in 1966 and which is the solution found 
by the federal government to get involved in the financing of 
social assistance. Under the Constitution, as you know, the 
federal government has no business in the financing of social 
assistance programs in Canada; yet, it finances about 50 per 
cent, or half of the welfare costs of the provinces.
<P>
	Why do I point this out? It is, of course, because this bill seeks 
to unilaterally deprive the provinces of some $7 billion.
<P>
	Why did we end up with transfer mechanisms such as the 
established programs financing, equalization and the Canada 
Assistance Plan? It is because there was an imbalance between 
the tax resources of the federal government and the provinces. 
That imbalance must be viewed in an historical context. After 
the first and the second world war, the Federal government took 
advantage of the exceptional crisis situations generated by these 
conflicts to move into direct and indirect taxation.
<P>
	In the fifties, the imbalance became very obvious to the 
provinces, which were considered somewhat like large 
municipalities. Consequently, some mechanisms had to be 
devised to transfer the wealth. These mechanisms are the three 
to which I referred earlier.
<P>
	The federal government was urged to spread the wealth and 
therefore decided to finance sectors which did not fall under its 
jurisdiction. This created a situation whereby the provinces 
would provide services to their population with budgets 
allocated by the federal government. Again, it is worrisome and 
even catastrophic to see that the federal government now intends 
to unilaterally cut $7 billion in the transfers to the provinces.
<P>
	Do you think that the federal government consulted the 
provinces to make sure that this measure would cause the least 
amount of prejudice? Absolutely not. The provinces found out, 
when the Minister of Finance tabled his budget last February, 
that there would be a cutback of $7 billion, that would break 
down as follows: in 1996-97, $2.5 billion would be cut from 
transfers to the provinces; and in 1997-98, something like $4.5 
billion. That is the scenario we are given in Bill C-76.
<P>
	If we consider Bill C-76 and, more specifically, its impact on 
Quebec, we realize that Quebec will have to absorb $650 million 
in forgone revenue for 1996-97 and $1.2 billion for 1997-98.
<P>
	Even more alarming is the fact that the federal government is 
intervening in areas over which it has no jurisdiction. This 
intervention, which has continued to this day, has a long history. 
The provinces have, to a certain extent, remained dependent on 
the federal government for these transfers which were used to 
help develop health care and education services.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	There are not many examples of federalism left in a 
continental country with a low population density and most of 
its population concentrated along the U.S. border. All of a 
sudden, because the federal government is in trouble, because 
this federal government is an impossible government, the 
government, with obvious contempt for federal-provincial 
diplomacy and oblivious to the impact that these cuts may have 
on transfers to the provinces and specific services provided to 
users, decides to cut $7 billion.
<P>
	The federal government, centralist as always, has gone even 
further. It says: There will no more established programs 
financing or Canada Assistance Plan. Instead, there will be a 
new program called the Canada social transfer.
<P>
	However, we do not know what criteria will be applied to 
redistribution of the amounts the CST will contain. Our position 
is that the Minister of Human Resources Development and the 
provinces will have to consider the criteria for redistribution of 
these funds, without necessarily being bound by an agreement.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11333"> 11333 </A></B>
<P>
	The official opposition believes-and as you know, the 
official opposition's predictions tend to be very accurate-that 
the Minister of Finance, the hon. member for LaSalle-Émard, a 
Montreal member, may wish to put on the table a redistribution 
rule that might severely penalize Quebec. We think that 
redistribution of wealth might be based on population.
<P>
	As several speakers have said in the House, the Minister of 
Finance, who has systematically refused to exclude the 
possibility of dividing the Canada social transfer envelope on 
the basis of population, may well decide that Quebec will have 
to absorb 41.7 per cent of the cuts in transfer payments to all 
provinces in Canada in 1997-98, which would mean that in 
1997-98, if that is the basis on which the government intends to 
operate, Quebec will have to absorb not $1.2 billion but $1.9 
billion in forgone revenue. And that is why the Quebec 
government has reacted very negatively to Bill C-76.
<P>
	What is most absurd in this situation is that the federal 
government intervenes in the area of health. Here again, any 
outsider looking in the Constitution Act of 1867 or the one of 
1982, to find the authority, legitimacy or jurisdiction behind the 
government's involvement in the field of health would be 
searching in vain.
<P>
	But everyone knows that there is a Department of National 
Health in Ottawa, Health Canada, which requires about $1 
billion just in order to operate, to pay the salaries of the public 
servants there. This figure does not include the money allocated 
by the Minister of Finance in his budget to run its various 
programs.
<P>
	According to an article published last month in a learned 
publication there were more public servants at Health Canada 
than in the individual provincial departments of health.
<P>
	This is not the least of the contradictions. There is a two tier 
structure, with the result that, even before any thought is given 
to transferring funds to the provinces so they can actually 
provide health care services to the public, funds must go to a 
structure that requires $1 billion simply to operate. This is the 
same sort of absurdity we find in the fight against AIDS.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	The federal government is trying to establish a 
continent-wide health policy, which is impossible, because the 
level of administration in the best position to be effective and 
provide the finest and most useful service to Canadians, cannot 
be the government farthest removed from them. And the 
government farthest removed from them is the government in 
Ottawa.
<P>
	The federal government's attempt to set up a national health 
policy, which aims necessarily at meeting the needs of 
communities from Newfoundland to British Columbia, is just as 
absurd as what it is doing in the fight against AIDS.
<P>
	What happens when the government tries to intervene in the 
health field? Let us have a look at Canada's strategy in the fight 
against AIDS. In the early 1980s, with the appearance of this 
most terrible disease, which will cruelly mark the turn of the 
century, the government decided it should act.
<P>
	Instead of using its tax leverage to mandate the provinces and 
transferring additional resources to them so they could be the 
real agents and fight AIDS intelligently, the federal government 
established a national strategy.
<P>
	It is an extremely loose national strategy, which really lacks 
substance and is extremely inefficient, since we all well know 
that the governments of Newfouland, of Quebec, of Ontario, of 
Saskatchewan would have been better suited than the federal 
government to lead the campaign, given their expertise in the 
area of palliative care and health care.
<P>
	The result is that the government has to maintain an extremely 
cumbersome administration and that situations arise like the one 
that arose last year. The federal government voted in its AIDS 
strategy, and allocated it a budget of $42 million which was not 
spent. The federal government, because it is the government 
level furthest removed from the people and because it has 
nothing to do with health care, is unable to deliver services in 
the field, and the concrete result of this is that it is not able to 
spend the allocated budgets approved by Parliament.
<P>
	I see that this surprises government members, but it is 
nevertheless the case. I will conclude by saying that last year, of 
the $42 million that the government allocated for the AIDS 
campaign, only $34 million were spent, and not in the most 
useful ways. This is why people have gotten the impression that 
the federal government is not the most efficient level of 
government.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened intently to the 
hon. member. I thank him for his intervention.
<P>
	He complained about the transfer payments from the federal 
government to the Quebec government being reduced. I wonder 
if he could share with us how as a country we can reduce the 
deficit and the heavy debt which is plaguing the country. If we 
could balance the books, as six provinces have already done and 
if we could wipe out the public debt, we could put a lot more 
money into such programs as the hon. member is talking about, 
for example, helping people affected with AIDS and so on.
<P>
	Somehow the provincial and federal governments have to 
work more efficiently, more co-operatively to try to avoid any 
duplication. Then we will reach the goals that he wants to reach 
not only for Quebec but for the entire country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11334"> 11334 </A></B>
<P>
	Could he share with us what concrete recommendations he 
and his party have for balancing the books, as the six provinces 
have done, and for reducing the public debt eventually to zero?
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the parliamentary 
secretary for his question. Obviously, it is quite clear to me how 
we should go about balancing the books. Those of us on this side 
of the House are convinced of the need to implement the 
principle of subsidiarity, whereby the mandate to deliver a 
service should go to the level of government in the best position 
to do so. The problem with Canada, and, with all due respect, the 
problem with the government's logic, is that all that is being 
offered is an observation. The observation is made that we have 
a debt of $600 billion, but no questions are asked about the 
institutional structure that led up to this debt.
<P>
	Let us not forget that the federal government used to have a 
department of urban affairs and a department of recreation, and 
that is why we have the debt we do today. It is because of an 
imbalance that allows Ottawa to interfere in areas of jurisdiction 
for which it has no mandate. This is the spending power system. 
Unfortunately, the federalism we are seeing leaves much to be 
desired. This is not to say that federalism could not be 
interesting in theory, but for it to work in the Canadian context, 
it must be centralized. And for it to be centralized, interference 
in the affairs of the provinces becomes necessary.
<P>
	My hon. colleague would be interested to know that before the 
Department of Health even gets around to delivering a service, a 
billion dollars has been set aside by the Minister of Finance for 
its operating expenses. Does my hon. colleague share my 
concern, my disbelief that Health Canada has more employees 
than the provincial departments of health? This is not what we 
should be seeing when it is not even the federal government's 
mandate.
<P>
	The best way to reduce the debt, and I do not know whether 
my colleague will agree with us, is to undertake a political 
reorganization with the goal of establishing an association 
between two nations, two autonomous governments, who will 
obviously have economic dealings with each other where 
interests dictate, because we know that nations must put 
interests ahead of feelings. I think that the best way for Canada 
to reduce the debt is through an extensive political 
reorganization.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Flis:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is contradicting 
himself. He said that to have a healthy federalism we have to 
centralize things more. On the other hand, he is talking about 
two nations.
<P>
	My wife comes from the province of Quebec. She has many 
relatives there, nieces, nephews, and we meet with them quite 
regularly. I am so proud of Canada when my nieces and nephews 
visit us and speak three languages. They speak French, English 
and Polish.
<P>
	Is it not wonderful that in a country such as ours, in la belle 
province, people can grow up fluent in three languages? If we 
nourish this further, we will be the envy of the world. The United 
Nations has named Canada as the number one place on this 
planet in which to live. Why would the hon. member talk about 
two nations? It took us 125 years to reach the level we are at 
now. Now that the world recognizes that we did this properly and 
Canadians have the best standard of living, why would we want 
to dismantle this?
<P>
	I would remind the hon. member also to talk to the 
ambassadors here in Ottawa of the Czech Republic and 
Slovakia. I keep in very close touch with them. They went 
through the same phase. When they were talking about 
separation they were talking about the same currency, no 
obstacles at the border, common defence and so on. The minute 
they separated they had to print their own currency, they had 
very strict custom controls. It was the most painful thing they 
had ever gone through. They are recommending not to let 
happen to Canada what happened to the former Czechoslovakia.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	I am wondering if the hon. member would rethink and answer 
who is representing my nieces, my nephews, my grand-nieces, 
my grand-nephews because they do not want two nations. They 
want to live and grow in this beautiful country as it is now. They 
do not want to move out of la belle province but they will if we 
go the two nation route.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I know that my colleague is a 
generous and intelligent man, so I am disappointed with his 
comparison. I wish to tell him that, since the fall of the Berlin 
Wall, 21 countries have achieved sovereignty and, out of these 
21 countries, it is easy to talk about the economic difficulties 
experienced by Slovakia. On the other hand, I can give him a list 
of 20 countries which, not in the distant past but since the fall of 
the Berlin Wall, have managed their sovereignty successfully. 
We will have the opportunity to talk about this again later.
<P>
	I wish to address one element of my colleague's question. 
What I told the hon. parliamentary secretary is that there are 
several examples of federalism in the world. Canadian 
federalism has two distinctive features. Canada is a continental 
country, unlike the other federalist countries we are familiar 
with. It is a continental country with two nations. Since being 
elected to this House, I have seen that there is a gap between the 
parties. On this side, because we are in touch with Quebec, we 
know that we are a nation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11335"> 11335 </A></B>
<P>
	Prince Edward Island is not a nation. British Columbia is not a 
nation. They are great places in the world, with generous people. 
I spent my vacation in Prince Edward Island and it is a 
wonderful part of the country, but it is not a nation. Again, it is a 
wonderful part of the country. Being a nation involves having a 
distinct language, a distinct legal system, government control, a 
collective will to live together. These elements make us a nation 
under international law.
<P>
	Canada is indeed a great country, and I am able to recognize 
this. But what I said about Canadian federalism is that, although 
Canada is a great country, although I have many friends on the 
other side of this House, including the parliamentary secretary, 
Canada as it now exists cannot allow two nations to achieve 
self-realization. That is why, in the next century-and saying 
this does not show contempt, secessionist tendencies or 
obtuseness-Canada must be redesigned so that both nations 
can enjoy a relationship as political equals and economic 
partners.
<P>
	When my hon. colleague tells me that his niece, of whom he is 
no doubt very proud, speaks three languages, it is something that 
must be applauded. However, the hon. member is confusing the 
collective dimension with the individual dimension.
<P>
	I wish that all members of this House were multilingual. 
Three mornings a week, I get up at seven in the morning to learn 
English so I can discuss with my hon. colleagues. But all this 
does not change anything to the fact that Quebec is a nation and 
must have all the powers, its own country and its own 
government.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
normally, when I rise in this House to participate in a debate on a 
bill, I can say that it is with great pleasure that I speak to the bill 
before us.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This is not a pleasant budget on which to be speaking. For 
many of us it is a very painful budget. For many Canadians it is a 
very painful budget. For us as Liberals it presents some 
decisions we would rather not have to be making.
<P>
	Liberals tend to want to be builders and creators, not to be 
pulling back on progress that has been made and programs that 
have been established. Following the second world war we were 
able to invest in housing, invest in transportation, invest in the 
education of our returning war veterans and yet pay off the war 
debt within five years. That was in the time of an expanding 
economy both domestically and internationally.
<P>
<B>(1035 ) </B>
<P>
	Liberals have been proud to create a package of social 
programs that has offered Canadians a standard of living and a 
quality of living second to none. We have been proud to 
introduce security for workers who lose their jobs. We have been 
proud to introduce security for Canadians who because of 
disability and many other  reasons are unable to support 
themselves. We have been proud to share responsibility for our 
fellow citizens in need.
<P>
	It was a Liberal government that was proud to set as a national 
target approximately two decades ago the elimination of poverty 
among the elderly. We have achieved that.
<P>
	However, these are different times. We now have to look at 
how we can use the very limited resources of the nation and of 
our taxpayers to continue the quality of life the nation has 
enjoyed and to continue progress into the future. We also have to 
face some very hard facts and that is what the budget bill does.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We must realize that 40 per cent of our national debt is held by 
foreign countries and that, when we pay interest on the debt 
every year, 40 per cent or $16 billion are paid out to foreign 
lenders. That is money that does not get back into our national 
economy; it does not work for us to improve our economic 
situation, here, in Canada. This money is paid outside the 
country and, therefore, not subject to Canadian income taxes. 
This is a double loss to our economy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have to face the fact that we are now paying one-third of 
every dollar we collect from Canadians and spend on 
government programs and services just to pay the interest on the 
debt. That proportion is rising year by year. If we continue to 
allow that to happen we will have less and less to do the things 
we want to do for the country and for Canadians.
<P>
	I have sat in this House since 1988 and have heard repeated 
promises of reducing the debt and deficit and that we have to go 
through this pain to get to a certain objective. However, this is 
the first time since I have sat in this House that there has been an 
actual and substantial reduction in the deficit.
<P>
	With the budget we are projecting the fulfilment of our 1993 
campaign commitment to Canadians to cut the deficit by half in 
proportion to the GNP by 1997.
<P>
	I have said this is a painful budget. One does not cut one's 
spending without removing from many Canadians certain 
programs, services and benefits we have enjoyed as a nation. We 
have done the budget in full consultation with Canadians. The 
Minister of Finance has met with Canadians across the country. 
We as members of Parliament have met with our constituents on 
what should be in the budget and asked for their advice and 
counsel in the difficult decisions we had to make.
<P>
	In Ottawa West I was very fortunate to have several hundred 
people come together and assist me in advising the finance 
minister as to what we felt were the important issues to be taken 
into consideration in coming up with the budget. The people of 
Ottawa West told me they were concerned about the debt and 
deficit. They are concerned about the continuing deterioration 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11336"> 11336 </A></B>
<P>
of  opportunities for the future of the country, for its economy 
and for the next generation.
<P>
<B>(1040 ) </B>
<P>
	They also said they did not want to sacrifice hard earned 
progress which made this the best nation in the world in which to 
live for the immediate gains on the debt and deficit. That is a 
difficult balance but it is a balance the budget and the legislation 
implementing it manage to achieve.
<P>
	The people in Ottawa West and all Canadians told us they 
wanted the budget to be fair. They believe no group in society 
should disproportionately bear the brunt of the necessary cuts in 
government spending. We have delivered on that and it is being 
implemented in the budget.
<P>
	Greater fairness in the tax system was the message from my 
constituents in Ottawa West, and also to close some of the 
loopholes. We have done that. We have increased the corporate 
rate of tax so corporations are again starting to pay a fair share of 
taxes. The capital tax imposed on banks is one element of that 
fairness.
<P>
	Through a number of such measures we have avoided an 
increase in personal income tax which Canadians very clearly 
said they did not want because they already feel their dollars are 
stretched to the limit.
<P>
	This is the first time I have had a chance to respond to people 
in Ottawa West on the specific measures they raised with me 
prior to the budget and tell them their voices and the voices of 
other Canadians clearly made an impact. They asked that we not 
tax their RRSP savings, and we did not. They asked that we not 
tax health and dental plan benefits, and we did not. They asked 
that we not touch the income of seniors, and we did not. We did 
say that Canadians living outside of Canada who are earning a 
high enough income should not continue to receive their entire 
old age security. They should be treated the same as seniors who 
are living in Canada and paying taxes here.
<P>
	I can honestly report back to the constituents of Ottawa West 
that the views they expressed to me most strongly have been 
respected in the budget.
<P>
	For a number of my constituents the changes we have made in 
government spending will have a negative impact. These are 
primarily people who work for the public service. It is not easy 
to say that of the 45,000 jobs to be cut in the public service, 
15,000 of those over the next three years will be lost in this 
region.
<P>
	However, through the bill and through other measures the 
government is taking extraordinary steps to make sure the 
number of people who will actually lose a job through this major 
process is reduced to an absolute minimum. We fully expect that 
at least 60 per cent of the downsizing will be achieved through 
the early retirement incentives through regulation and the early 
departure incentives done through the legislation today.
<P>
	Through various training and placement programs that will be 
put in place there will be various flexibilities about how people 
manage their time if they know their particular position will be 
affected. I want to send a very clear message that at the end of 
three years, through all of this, at least 86 per cent of the federal 
public service will still be in place, will still be working. There 
is no question it will be a dramatically changed workplace and I 
hope a dramatically improved workplace as we stop trying to ask 
a shrinking number of people to do everything and accept our 
responsibility as a government of deciding what programs to 
continue and what programs to stop. It will be a very difficult 
three years.
<P>
	Canadians will know exactly where the government is headed, 
what programs we think are important and we will have the 
resources to carry out those programs well on behalf of 
Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1045 ) </B>
<P>
	I express my appreciation to the business community, local 
politicians in the area and many other people throughout the 
national capital region who have come together as a community 
to put in place programs that will assist people, whose jobs in the 
public service are affected, to remain in the community and to 
work in the community.
<P>
	They are one of the great strengths of our region. That very 
talented workforce will provide further economic 
diversification and help to build a stronger economic future. I 
say to them honestly that their members of Parliament and their 
local community are 100 per cent committed to assisting them in 
continuing to be employed here and in continuing to make this 
their home.

<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I listened with great interest to the comments made by the hon. 
member. She said repeatedly that the budget was tough. It is 
very tough indeed. To try to reduce the deficit to pay off our debt 
is very laudable. We must do it.
<P>
	I represent the rural riding of Matapédia-Matane, where I 
recently met with some local groups. In my region, 
unemployment matched with employment security is the norm 
for 35 to 40 per cent of workers. I discussed the budget with 
these various groups. The students did not understand. They told 
me: ``How can we possibly pay more for post-secondary 
education''? They do not accept that.

<P>
	I also met farmers who have herds of 30 to 35 dairy cows. 
They told me that the situation in the region did not make any 
sense. The Liberal member who accompanied me has a herd of 
225 milk cows, which is not quite the same. For farmers, the 
budget means a loss of $5,000 over two years, or $2,500 per 
year, or 15 per cent for two years.
<P>
	I also met unemployed people. A former Liberal member, Mr. 
Bona Arsenault, once said that people were lazy. Let me tell you 
that people in my region are not lazy. They are energetic. They 
want to work. Given the opportunity to do so, they will work as 
hard as anyone. The unemployed are very worried.
<P>
	Why is it that, by contrast, some business people do not seem 
very concerned. The hon. member referred to banks. The 
government will get $100 million from the banks.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I apologize for 
interrupting the hon. member for Matapédia-Matane. I simply 
want to remind him that the period for questions and comments 
only allows five minutes. Unless he is just making a comment, 
the hon. member should put his question if he wants a reply.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Canuel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will ask a very simple question. 
Why is it that the budget did not bother the multinationals too 
much. From what I have heard, the banks are not overly 
concerned by that budget. It is not the rich who are worried 
about it, but the poor.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I can tell the hon. member that, 
in my own riding, five minutes from where I live, many 
residents have the same concerns. Consequently, I can certainly 
relate to what the member is saying.
<P>
	It is for these people that we have to review and redirect our 
programs. We have to make sure that there is a future for these 
people, for women who have a very low income and who want to 
provide a future for their children, for young people who may 
have quit school five or six years ago and now want to get some 
training.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	It is precisely for these people that we must have a strong 
economy which, I hope, we will better control, so that we can 
provide the training programs and the job creation initiatives 
which will give them a good future.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Again I clarify for the 
House that the member for Ottawa West indicated she was 
splitting her time with a colleague. That is why I made sure the 
question and comment period was for a duration of five minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jean Payne (St. John's West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to discuss the budget of the 
finance minister for 1995-96.
<P>
	The budget was about keeping promises: the promise 
contained in the red book to reduce the federal deficit to 3 per 
cent of GDP by 1996-97, the promise made by Liberal 
governments past and present to preserve a sustainable social 
safety net that provides for those who are most in need, and the 
promise to ensure that all Canadians in all regions share equally 
in the necessary burden of reducing the deficit.
<P>
	Through a combination of spending cuts and revenue 
increases the finance minister reduced the deficit for 1995-96 to 
$32.7 billion. This is the second year in a row the deficit has 
been reduced. I am proud to be a member of a government that 
backs up its talk on deficit reduction with action. Unlike the 
previous Tory government and some members of the third party, 
the finance minister realizes there is a purpose to deficit 
reduction and that deficit reduction is not an end in itself.
<P>
	As a result of the huge debt that has been run up by the last 
government, Canadians last year saw roughly 33 cents of every 
taxation dollar go toward paying interest on the debt. This meant 
less money available for services that Canadians deserve and 
respect.
<P>
	The large debt also creates a climate of instability which 
discourages business investment and job growth. The purpose 
therefore of deficit reduction is to guarantee Canadians an 
environment for sustained growth and job creation both now and 
into the future.
<P>
	The government understands and respects its obligations to 
Canadians to stop the practice of borrowing from future 
generations to finance the spending habits of today. Therefore it 
is not with enthusiasm that the government set about reducing 
spending but rather out of necessity.
<P>
	Canadians from coast to coast to coast understand this point. 
In fact a recent poll confirmed it: 69 per cent of Canadians said 
they approved of finance minister's budget, even though a large 
number of those who approved of the budget expected to be 
somewhat worse off under it.
<P>
	I refer to some of the remarks made by my colleague from 
Ottawa West. She said that some of her constituents spoke to her 
about their concerns under the budget but were willing to accept 
the cuts and to live with the budget.
<P>
	Not only is the budget remarkable for the progress it makes 
toward the goal of reducing the deficit. It is commendable for 
the way in which it achieves deficit reduction. Reduction in the 
deficit was achieved largely through expenditure cuts.
<P>
	For the second year in a row the government did not increase 
personal income tax rates. I congratulate the minister on his 
willingness to listen to Canadians and to refuse to take the easy 
way out by raising taxes. While personal tax rate increases may 
have been easy they would not have been equitable.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="11338"> 11338 </A></B>
<P>
	Rather, the finance minister has managed to reach his deficit 
reduction primarily through expenditure cuts. For every $1 of 
revenue increase contained in the budget there are $7 in 
spending cuts. These cuts are reached largely through a 
rationalization and downsizing of government while ensuring 
that the spending cuts do not jeopardize the social programs 
Canadians value so dearly.
<P>
	I should like to comment on three specific areas which the 
budget affects: social programs, small business and changes to 
the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
<B>(1055 ) </B>
<P>
	While many Canadians including myself were encouraging 
the minister not to raise personal income taxes as part of his 
campaign to fight the deficit, equally compelling was the need 
to maintain the hallmark of Liberalism, our social safety net.
<P>
	It was the Liberal government that built the social safety net 
and it is the Liberal government that is committed to 
maintaining our social programs. The problem was to adjust the 
programs to reflect the challenges and realities of the nineties.
<P>
	Too often complaints were heard about how the social 
security system did not aid those most in need. At the same time 
it was becoming obvious that the social safety net was in many 
instances not providing incentives to Canadians to become less 
dependent on assistance.
<P>
	Helping individuals to get back to supporting themselves 
must be a fundamental goal of any social system. In an attempt 
to encourage innovative and timely approaches to social 
security the government has established the Canada social 
transfer. This payment to the provinces will combine payments 
for health, post-secondary education and social assistance into 
one payment called the Canada social transfer. It will allow 
provinces the flexibility to pursue innovative approaches to the 
programs.
<P>
	In conjunction with the transfers the federal government will 
impose national standards on all provinces as a condition of 
receiving funding. It will ensure that our commitment to provide 
for the most vulnerable in society will be maintained. For 
example, the Canada Health Act and its standards of 
accessibility, portability and universality will remain intact. 
Further, the Minister of Human Resources Development is to 
meet with his provincial counterparts to work out a set of 
national standards to govern post-secondary education and 
social assistance.
<P>
	It has been said that the provinces will receive less funding 
under the Canada social transfer than previously. However the 
government has shown its commitment to social programs by 
cutting its expenditures in this area much less than it cut 
expenditures in other areas. Further, by announcing the changes 
in its transfer payments this year to take effect next year, the 
federal government has given provinces plenty of notice of the 
changes so that they may have the time to prepare.
<P>
	Statistics show that under the Canada social transfer total 
transfers including equalization to the most needy provinces-

on behalf of taxpayers.
<P>
	Several months ago I followed the lead of my colleague from 
North Vancouver by inviting interested citizens to get involved 
in the Canada Employment Centre grant process. Since that time 
this committee has been hard at work reviewing grants to 
determine if tax dollars were being spent wisely. This practice 
has resulted in constituents having direct input into the process 
instead of having the MP simply rubber stamp these 
applications, as is usually the case according to a senior official 
at human resources development.
<P>
	Based on the positive results from this committee, I am now 
looking to establish other working groups at the constituency

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the financing of medical care in Canada has 
become a challenging task that the federal government is about 
to make even more challenging. The current federal proposal to 
change the way cash is transferred to the provinces will create a 
patchwork of different delivery systems in different provinces 
across Canada. Fortunately, some provinces have a progressive 
view of health care delivery.
<P>
	Thanks to good economic management, the Government of 
Saskatchewan will introduce this year new and expanded health 
services at the community level. These will include home care 
and increased support for respite beds, and day programs that 
provide some relief for family caregivers when needed.
<P>
	Saskatchewan's health minister, Lorne Calvert, says that 
these and other initiatives represent the most comprehensive 
and people sensitive approach to community based health care 
in Canada.
<P>
	It shows that even in the face of financial difficulties a 
province that cares for people can meet its health challenges. I 
urge the federal government to ensure provincial initiatives such 
as these are not undermined by a shortsighted and poor-

	Early diagnosis and remedial intervention is the key. Children 
with learning disabilities become adults with learning

	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Canadian

As our economic climate becomes increasingly competitive, 
farmers are confronting a growing storm of cutbacks and 
continuing trade wars, especially downward pressure from the 
American export enhancement program.

	At the eye of the storm is the Canadian Wheat Board, one of 
Canada's great institutions. In such a climate the board plays a 
critical role by supporting the principles of orderly and fair 
marketing and in essence works on behalf of farmers.
<P>
	I have received copies of several hundred letters written by 
Canadians from ridings across western Canada who feel the 
same way. All of these letters say the board should remain a 
strong selling agency for the Canadian farmer. Many suggest it 
should be given an even stronger mandate.

	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as the official opposition pointed out during the debate 
on back-to-work legislation for railway employees, the 
Minister of Transport waited until the government had wielded 
its big stick before starting the process of privatizing Canadian 
National.
<P>
	The Minister of Transport, who openly sided with the 
employers and against the employees in the railway dispute, was 
anxious to downgrade the terms and conditions of employment 
at CN so it would be easier to privatize the company.
<P>
	The minister did not even have the decency to wait and started 
his privatization process less than a week after the passage of 
back-to-work legislation. Now more than ever before, it is clear 
to railway employees, and Canadians generally, that the 
arbitration process put in place by the Minister of Labour in the 
railway sector is biased towards the employer. The opposition

	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday an Ontario court justice made a ruling 
that could very well affect the safety of all Canadians.
<P>
	Justice Peter Howden ruled that a section of the Criminal 
Code clearly violates the rights of a criminally insane person 
because the role and powers of the federal Criminal Code 
Review Board are too broad and do not have clear standards.
<P>
	This case centres around a criminally insane person who has 
been convicted of criminal charges on four separate occasions, 
including the beating of his aunt with a rolling pin. However, 
this is only the start, as 1,100 similar people being held on 
warrants wait for lawyers to find loopholes in the criminal 
justice system.
<P>
	The minister has been asked by the Ontario court to step in 
and make changes to the code so that such a judgment would not 
take place. The minister hesitated in dealing with the Supreme 
Court decision in the Daviault case and we all know what 
followed.
<P>
	The minister now has a chance to redeem himself. Canadians 
do not want a second blown opportunity. They want reassurance 
of a safe community and reassurance that dangerous offenders 
will remain in custody.

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, baseball fans are worried about the calibre of play 
this season if replacement players take to the field. If the second 
stringers in the Liberal cabinet are any indication, fans should 
be worried.
<P>
	No one has dropped the ball more than the minister of defence 
playing outfield. He missed the signals on the Bosnia 
peacekeeping play. He misjudged airborne base hits and 
dropped the Fowler ball. He cannot find the bases because he 
keeps moving them.
<P>
	Let us look at some of the other players. The heritage minister 
writes notes during the game. The minister of Indian affairs is 
drafting separate rules for aboriginal players. The health 
minister is headed back to the minors. She swings her bat 
without hitting. The minister for western economic 
diversification hits every ball to the centre fielder, named 
Winnipeg. The justice minister fired a bullet over the pitcher's 
head and was arrested for playing with an unregistered bat. The 
environment minister takes too big a lead off to suit the Prime 
Minister. She will be tagged out.
<P>
	Fans know it is time to get concerned when the star player, the 
Prime Minister, tells the President of the United States that 
Canada has won the world cup of baseball two times in a line.

	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs.
<P>
	At a time when the federal government is bragging about the 
new freedoms it is giving the provinces in the areas of social 
assistance and post-secondary education, Ottawa is getting 
ready to impose new national standards in these areas of 
provincial jurisdiction, actually restricting the freedom of the 
provinces and of Quebec.
<P>
	How can the minister reconcile the statements he made 
yesterday that the 1995 budget in no way shows any readiness on 
the part of the federal government to impose more national 
standards on the provinces, when legislative measures 
introduced since blatantly encroach on the powers of the 
provinces and of Quebec in areas which fall exclusively under 
their jurisdiction?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, no new conditions are set 
out in the omnibus legislation.
<P>
	As the hon. member knows, the Canada Health Act already 
has a series of requirements for the provinces to meet. Those are 
being maintained. There are also requirements under the Canada 
assistance plan about mobility, to ensure that everybody in need 
gets assistance. Those are the conditions which are being put 
forward in the legislation, subject to future discussions and 
negotiations with the provinces to see how we can provide a 
more coherent approach to social programming across Canada.
<P>
	Frankly, the assumption which the hon. member makes is 
simply not the case.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to point out to the minister that he is 
adding conditions. This having been said, how can the minister 
justify that the provinces, to whom the Constitution grants 
exclusive jurisdiction over social assistance and education, will 
only play a consultative role regarding the determination of the 
new national standards?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the proposed transfer 
program is a clear recognition that the provinces can take more 
responsibility for making decisions.
<P>
	We are freeing up and making far more flexible their choices 
of priorities within a broad range of programming on education, 
welfare and health. That is the whole point of consolidating the 
existing transfer system, to give the provinces the freedom of 
choice to look at programming which suits the individual needs 
of their own areas.
<P>
	At the same time, it is a national transfer program. There are 
base conditions and those conditions are already X stamped, as 
we said in the budget itself, such as the five conditions under the 
Canada Health Act and the condition under the Canada 
assistance plan which protect the mobility rights of Canadians 
so they can move from one region to another and still be eligible 
for some form of assistance. Those are the basic conditions 
which were put forward.

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I understand clearly that national standards are here to 
stay.
<P>
	But given the government's policy regarding transfer 
payments, which will ensure that Ottawa will dictate these 
national standards and will reduce the provinces to mere 
administrative branches, are we to take this as another example 
of the flexible federalism so touted by the Liberals?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is obviously trying to use scare 
tactics. The budget makes it clear that fewer strings will be 
attached to the Canada social transfer than was the case for 
transfer payments previously.
<P>
	The conditions to be met in the area of health care remain the 
same, as is explained in the budget. There have never been any 
conditions tied to post-secondary education, particularly in 
Quebec, which has opted out since 1964. All the conditions tied 
to social assistance have been eliminated, excepting the one 
barring any minimum period of residency to qualify.
<P>
	Therefore, it is very clear, and the budget states this, that any 
future federal-provincial agreement will be based on mutual 
consent and, consequently, contrary to what the hon. member 
would have us believe, there are fewer conditions to be met than 
before.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, while it is recognized that social assistance and 
education come under provincial jurisdiction, the federal 
government clearly shows its intention to interfere shamelessly 
in these areas of provincial jurisdiction by imposing its views 
and goals on the provinces through national standards.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
How can the minister reconcile this denial of the provinces' 
exclusive jurisdiction, which leaves the door wide open to 
confrontation with Quebec, and the openness, mutual 
understanding and flexible federalism he is talking about?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, I am hearing the exact same argument being put 
forth again and it is as flawed as it was in the previous question. 
The budget clearly indicates that the requirements attached to 
social transfers will be reduced and that, if social assistance 
programs are subject to standards, these standards will be set by 
mutual consent.
<P>
	This is mentioned several times in the budget. There is no 
mistake about it and I can only conclude that the members 
opposite are, once again, misrepresenting to the people of 
Canada and Quebec facts that are clearly stated in the budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the mere fact of thinking about imposing standards or 
Canada-wide requirements in areas of exclusive provincial 
jurisdiction constitutes in itself interference in Quebec's 
exclusive jurisdiction. That is what the minister just said.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Will the minister acknowledge that explicitly 
linking transfer payments for social assistance, postsecondary 
education and health, which are areas of exclusive provincial 
jurisdiction, to strict compliance with national standards 
imposed by Ottawa looks like a new attack against Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): 
</B>The propaganda effort continues, Mr. Speaker. The Bloc 
Quebecois just keeps stating a position contradicted by facts, by 
the budget and by reality.
<P>
	I can only repeat what I said earlier, namely that the budget is 
clear, that the requirements for social assistance have been 
reduced, that, if any standards are established, they will be 
established by mutual consent. It is very unfortunate that the 
opposition informs the people of Quebec so poorly on such 
major issues.

	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it has been reported today that diplomatic sources and 
federal officials are deeply concerned that Canada's 
peacekeepers will be targeted by the warring factions in Bosnia 
and Croatia.
<P>
	They say Canadian combat troops are entering one of the most 
dangerous conflict zones at a time when tensions are rising and 
fighting is escalating.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	Given the government's expressed concern for the safety of 
our peacekeepers, why are we now sending more troops to 
Bosnia and Croatia?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member knows very well that a variety of 
scenarios can exist on peacekeeping missions, particularly one 
of this nature where the requirements of the peacekeepers are so 
varied and different, whether it is in Croatia or in Bosnia.
<P>
	He also knows that the Canadian forces have a number of 
contingency plans to counter any of these operations. We are 
prepared. We have contingency plans. He also knows that it 
would not be appropriate to divulge the contingency plans on the 
floor of the House of Commons. I see he is nodding, Mr. 
Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government's ad hoc approach to peacekeeping in 
the former Yugoslavia is unacceptable. It is sending our soldiers 
into a war zone with no criteria to judge when that mission is 
accomplished.
<P>
	We are heartened to hear that the military is drawing up secret 
evacuation plans but it should not need to because the 
government should not be placing our troops in danger for what 
looks to be a futile cause.
<P>
	What criteria has the government established to decide when 
our troops are to be withdrawn?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, perhaps if the hon. member had a conversation 
with the hon. member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, who voted 
in favour of our troops in Yugoslavia, he may be enlightened as 
to what it is we are thinking about.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> We still did 
not find out the criteria, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	The last time the government renewed our mandate in the 
former Yugoslavia, the minister said he would reconsider our 
participation if the situation on the ground changed. The 
situation did change. Canadian soldiers were taken hostage and 
the minister was powerless to act. Instead of learning from the 
past, the government is making the same mistake again.
<P>
	Lord Owen is right. Our peacekeepers are the best in the 
world. The government should not be putting them into obvious 
danger. Will it reconsider its decision and move to withdraw 
Canadian peacekeepers now while it has the chance?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, to correct what I said, there was no vote when we 
debated this a few nights ago.
<P>
	The hon. member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca gave an 
eloquent discourse which indicated why he as a member of the 
third party supported our troops in continuing to discharge their 
mandate like the other 34 countries in the United Nations, no 
matter how tough it gets.

<P>
	This morning, we learned that five Airbuses bought in 1992 
by the federal government from Canadian Airlines 
International, at a cost of $250 million, are grounded eleven 
months per year. At the same time, the government has a 
$45-million-a-year contract with that company, to transport

	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

Perhaps I could inform him and the House that the Canadian 
forces cannot afford to buy aircraft both for strategic airlift and 
for normal administrative movement of the troops.
<P>
	The choice is to use either the airbus for strategic airlift and to 
contract out for administrative flights or to reverse it and to 
contract out for strategic airlift and use the airbus for 
administrative flights.
<P>
	The hon. member may not be aware that we cannot rely on 
commercial aircraft for strategic airlift in time of crisis. We 
have decided to opt for using the airbus for strategic airlift, 
humanitarian purposes and for those things for which 
contingency plans are drawn up and may be required at a

	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the biggest economic news since the budget is 
inflation. During the last four months consumer prices rose at an 
annual rate of about 4.5 per cent, well above the target of 3 per 
cent set by the Bank of Canada.
<P>
	In large part this inflation is caused by the depreciation of the 
dollar and the higher prices of imports and exportables it has 
brought.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance admit this inflation if unchecked 
threatens living standards much more than the spending cuts 
needed to balance the budget and to fix the exchange rate?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. 
member knows, one of the main reasons for the increase in 
inflation statistically was the actions of the tobacco factor into 
the new numbers compared with the previous numbers.
<P>
	Inflation must be monitored. The Governor of the Bank of 
Canada has stated there are no inflationary pressures in Canada 
at the present time. However, to anticipate such pressures is 
clearly the responsibility of the Bank of Canada and the 
Government of Canada, and we shall exercise that 
responsibility.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is clear there are different ways of measuring 
inflation. I am talking about the price increases in the last four 
months annualized, not year to year inflation where the tobacco 
increases are important.
<P>
	The minister and the governor have already stated what the 
minister just repeated. However, unfortunately the tightening of 
monetary policy will again push Canada into a recession. It is 
inappropriate since inflation is caused not by excess demand but 
the depreciation of the dollar.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance allow the Bank of Canada to 
precipitate another recession to fight inflation or will he do the 
right thing and stop the decline of the dollar by a new budget that 
eliminates the deficit promptly and decisively?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional

terms of low inflation, while very dearly bought, is also a major 
asset in terms of job creation and it is something we intend to

the minister's gun control measures until it has the assurance the 
criminalization of current lawful firearm owners, such as 
non-compliance with registration, is taken out of the Criminal 
Code.
<P>
	In view of this, will he now consider addressing the two areas 
separately, one that imposes stricter penalties for the criminal 
use of a firearm and one that deals with the regulation and 
ownership of a firearm?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I must slay the hon. 
member's beautiful hypothesis with a brutal fact. Yesterday the 
Canadian Police Association, representing some 35,000 
frontline police officers, endorsed every element of the 
government's firearms package.
<P>
	I shall be happy to share with the hon. member a copy of the 
resolution. It endorsed the government's prohibition on small 
calibre handguns. It endorsed the government's prohibition on 
assault weapons and it endorsed registration of all firearms.
<P>
	In respect of the specific registration system proposed in Bill 
C-68, the Canadian Police Association endorses it subject only 
to two points, that the costs would not be taken from the 
operational budgets in place at present for the police, assurance 
of which I gave readily yesterday, and that some means be found 
by which first offences for non-registration could be dealt with 
on a regulatory rather than a criminal basis.
<P>
	In respect of the second point, I expressed concern about 
achieving compliance. The response given by the police 
association was that perhaps instead of a criminal offence, if 
someone does not register, the first time around their gun should 
be confiscated. My response was that based on that approach 
perhaps we can do business.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have in 
my possession the stand the Canadian Police Association has 
issued. It is clear it has concerns in other areas such as the lack 
of enforcement regulations within the statute and the existing 
Criminal Code.
<P>
	The police association has expressed concern about the 
inadequate enforcement of the present laws, as many of us are 
concerned. In Cornwall last year eight individuals were charged 
with possession of a prohibited weapon, three semi-automatic 
weapons, breach of probation and possession of drugs. They 
were given a $1,000 fine.
<P>
	Given what the police association has said, given the case in 
Cornwall and other similar cases across Canada, what 
guarantees can the minister give us regarding the administration 
of justice? Will it provide for the adequate enforcement of the 
laws he is creating?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the course of the 
CPA's discussions this week on a whole range of justice issues, it 
identified areas where we can do better. There is no question 
there is room for improvement in every part of the criminal 
justice system.

question had to do with enforcement mechanisms for criminal 
law. I assured the Canadian Police Association yesterday and 
throughout the week that we look forward to having its specific 
representations to the committee when it appears before it. If it 
has suggestions about improvements on the enforcement side, 
then working with the provinces, which are responsible for the 
enforcement of criminal law, we should be happy to see to it.

	As a result of an administrative error made by Transport

junkets abroad and patronage appointments, why does the Prime 
Minister insist on doing business the same way Mulroney did, 
especially since the Liberals raised such a big stink on these 
matters when they were on this side of the House?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, with respect to Mr. Berger, what was in the press is 
simply speculation. Unless and until something happens in that 
regard, there is really nothing to comment on.
<P>
	With respect to Perrin Beatty, he is an experienced former 
parliamentarian and minister who held portfolios involving 
national revenue, foreign affairs and communications. It is felt 
he has the necessary skills and experience to handle the position 
of the president of the CBC.
<P>
	I can confirm his salary will be reduced by the amount of his 
pension. Therefore he will not be double dipping. Furthermore, 
since Mr. Beatty sat in the House as a Conservative, it is not a 
partisan political appointment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
patronage is patronage.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
<B>(1145 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Patronage is an appointment or a promotion given 
by a patron to a former patron. Politicians are all part of the same 
old club. It is plums and rewards like this that Reformers want to 
put an end to.
<P>
	I have a supplementary question. With Kim Campbell going 
off to Moscow when can we expect to hear or when can we get 
confirmation that Mr. Brian Mulroney will be singing ``When 
Irish Eyes are Smiling'' from the Emerald Isle?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the law passed by Parliament gives the responsibility 
to the government to appoint the president of the CBC. It is a 
responsibility that has to be carried out in order to ensure that 
vital national institution operates.

	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the chairman of the National Capital Commission, Mr. Marcel 
Beaudry, says that he attended a fundraising dinner organized by 
the Liberal Party of Quebec because this was an activity for the 
No committee. However, the dinner invitation, printed on party 
stationery and signed by Mr. Beaudry, clearly refers to a 
fundraising dinner for the Liberal Party of Quebec, which was 
confirmed by the Liberal MNA for Chapleau, who said she had 
collected $30,000.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Minister of Canadian Heritage. 
Considering these new facts, does the minister agree that Mr. 
Beaudry knowingly lied before the Standing Committee on 
Canadian Heritage last Tuesday?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage,

as well. The Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dupuy:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The other day, when 
similar charges were made, I said that the chairman of the 
National Capital Commission had the right to exercise his rights 
as a citizen during his leisure time.
<P>
	That is what he did. The event took place on a Saturday night. 
I do not expect the chairman to be at his office on Saturday night.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
obviously, the Minister of Canadian Heritage is not prepared to 
act responsibly and do his homework.

	My supplementary is directed to the Acting Prime Minister. In 
the light of these new facts, including the letter signed by

<P>
	What actions will the government be taking to meet the

<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney

Ontario government will be considering the question of whether 
to launch an appeal as it is a party to the proceeding. The federal 
government intervened at the first instance and, if an appeal is 
launched, may well intervene at the appellate stage as well.
<P>
	Second, depending on whether an appeal is taken and 
obviously depending on the timing of an appeal if it is brought, it 
may be necessary to apply for an extension of the six-month 
period which is permissible under the rules of the court. If that 
were to be necessary I have no doubt that such an application 
would be considered and, if appropriate, it would be brought.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley,

	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney

member's continuing concern in this area. I want to assure her 
that I share it and that steps are being taken.
<P>
	We have already announced our intention to strengthen the 
existing dangerous offender provisions in the Criminal Code. 
Two weeks ago the Solicitor General announced the new 
flagging system to make it easier for prosecuting lawyers to 
have information about what people should be subject to such 
applications.
<P>

	The government is working very hard through programs like 
SchoolNet, the community access centres and the senior centre

to all areas of Canada and that rural Canadians can benefit 
equally with urban Canadians.
<P>
	The community access centres program is now being piloted. 
The first official competition will be due in October. We are 
working hard so that the program will be a success and will 
enable rural communities to participate. Members of Parliament

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	The minister is always telling us about the progress he has 
made in the air transport industry and the satisfaction expressed 
by the presidents of the two main carriers. In fact, since his 
international route allocation policy was announced in late 
December, and because of his decisions systematically 
favouring Canadian International in the allocation of 
international routes, Air Canada shares are taking a beating on 
the stock market.
<P>
	My question is this: How can the minister maintain that he 
acted fairly and equitably, when, according to Standard and 
Poor, Air Canada has been hurt by the minister's recent 
decisions giving Canadian International access to the American 
market, Chicago and New York in particular, without any 
compensation for Air Canada?
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, as you can appreciate, the financial situation of any 
company with publicly traded shares is a very delicate subject 
matter.
<P>
	I must, however, tell my hon. colleague that the reason why I 
say that we have acted as equitably as possible in this whole 
matter is that, after years of controversy and difficulties in the 
Canadian air transport industry, the directors of both carriers are 
telling us and stating publicly that we have acted fairly and 
efficiently.
<P>
	My hon. colleague should know, for example, that Air Canada 
decided the day before yesterday to proceed with a $500 million 
share issue and that, throughout this process, Air Canada 
notified Canadians that it had to purchase new planes and hire 
over 600 people. I think that, if we in the House of Commons 
want to be fair and equitable, we should realize that great 
progress has been made. The situation is not perfect, but we 
think that both carriers are about to experience years of growth 
that will be much more interesting than what we have seen in the 
past.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, how can the minister draw a parallel between Hong 
Kong, a route which Air Canada is ready to start servicing in the 
summer, thus creating 500 jobs, and Germany, a route which 
Canadian cannot even start servicing by the end of the year 
because it does not have enough planes?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is very simple how we rationalize the decisions with 
respect to all our cross border and international air travel.
<P>
	If I use the thesis put forward by my hon. friend, we would not 
have attributed all the rights we were able to negotiate with the 
United States. My hon. friend will know that Air Canada has 
orders with major aircraft manufacturers both in Canada and 
outside the country to be able to service the routes we have been 
able to negotiate internationally and with the United States.
<P>
	If it were a question of only attributing routes or making it 
possible for Air Canada and Canadian to fly to areas where they 
have the aircraft for it, there would be a lot of things we would 
not do that we have already done.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

	We are saying to Air Canada and to Canadian Airlines

is why they can go out now and negotiate for the purchase or the 
lease of aircraft to be able to fly to routes that were closed to 
both Air Canada and Canadian Airlines International in the 
United States and around the world.
<P>
	If the hon. member were to be careful and understand what we 
have achieved for airports across the country and for employees 
of both airlines, he would tell us that by the end of 1995 we will 
have done more to improve the situation for both airlines than 
was done in the previous 15 or 20 years in the country.

<P>
	The question concerns refugees who do not intend to buy 
40-inch TV sets as their second or third purchase in Canada.
<P>
	As the minister is aware no other country in the world charges 
a fee of $975 for refugees. He has assured us, however, that 
loans will be available to refugees from poorer countries who 
cannot afford the $975 fee. There is a catch-22 however.
<P>
<B>(1200 ) </B>
<P>
	My question is for the minister of immigration. Will he deny 
entry to those immigrants and refugees who do not meet the 
criteria to repay the loan? Will he assure us that no refugee will 
be denied entrance into Canada even though they cannot pay the 
$975 fee and do not meet the criteria for qualifying to receive a 
loan?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is not true that other 
countries do not charge various processing fees. We have 
decided to charge a landing fee, not a refugee fee, for accessing 
our system for two reasons. The first is so all newcomers to the 
country can join other Canadians in all walks of life in ensuring 
the prosperity of Canada into the future.
<P>
	The second reason we are charging a landing fee is to ensure 
the settlement services will continue. It is the people who the 
member talks about that are in need of the settlement services 
the most. If we were not going to go the route of the fee, my 
impression would be that settlement would become a thing of 
the past. Therefore, we are doing it with the intention of helping 
the neediest coming into our country.
<P>
	On top of that, the Minister of Finance has instituted a loan 
program so they can take out a loan and repay the $975 to ensure 
their future in the best country of the world, just like kids of 
Canadian parents ask for loans of tens of thousands of dollars for 
education so that they too can ensure their future.

payments. At that time the government promised action on the

matter, but there has been a great deal of action. A great deal of 
work has been done over the last 10 months on the subject of 
child support.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11351"> 11351 </A></B>
<P>
	The government is approaching the issue based on three 
principles. First, that there should be guidelines or a formula 
provided by statute to assist the court in determining the amount 
to be paid for child support to relieve the parties of the expense 
and anguish of determining that through litigation.
<P>
	Second, that the tax system should be examined to determine 
that it is fair to both custodial and non-custodial parents in 
providing the best for the children of separated families.
<P>
	Third, that there is an effective national strategy for enforcing 
court orders once they are made.
<P>
	In relation to the first matter, the 
federal-provincial-territorial report with respect to child 
support was published last January. It contains specific amounts 
in a proposed formula that is now under public discussion. We 
are learning from that discussion.
<P>
	Second, in terms of tax, the Minister of Finance has been at 
work in that area and is completing an analysis of the options.

will be announced with the other two elements of the package

	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order because I believe that the Minister of Justice has 
contravened the sub judice conventions of this House.
<P>
	In response to my question on Monday, March 27 he stated, 
and I quote from <I>Hansard</I> page 11065:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The judgment that has been referred to is under appeal because the federal 
government believes at first instance it was simply wrong.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He goes on to state:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We feel in good faith the judgment at first instance in Alberta was wrong. We 
will pursue that appeal with every confidence that we shall win it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Furthermore, on Wednesday, March 29, the minister, in 
response to a question by my colleague from 
Yorkton-Melville, stated, and I quote from page 11193 of 
<I>Hansard</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The fact is that the judgment has been appealed. We are taking the position in 
the Court of Appeal that the judgment was in error.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1205 ) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, as you know citation 505 of Beauchesne's sixth 
edition states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Members are expected to refrain from discussing matters that are before the 
courts or tribunals which are courts of record. The purpose of this sub judice 
convention is to protect the parties in a case awaiting or undergoing trial and 
persons who stand to be affected by the outcome of a judicial inquiry. It is a 
voluntary restraint imposed by the House upon itself in the interest of justice and 
fair play.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Furthermore, citation 506(1) and 506(2) state:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(1) The sub judice convention has been applied consistently in criminal cases.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) The precedents in criminal cases are consistent in preventing reference to 
court cases before a judgment is rendered; however, the convention ceases to 
apply after the judgment is given. Nevertheless, the convention is applied again 
when an appeal is launched.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Applying the sub judice convention, the hon. minister has put 
on the record that the Simmerman case is under appeal and he, 
with respect, has commented on the case. He has stated on more 
than one occasion that the judgment was an error. Mr. 
Simmerman's interests could be negatively affected by the 
minister's comments.
<P>
	The convention covers all members of the House. This 
instance, with respect, also brings the issue of undue influence 
or ministerial interference into play. Ministers must be even 
more circumspect with their comments and actions due to their 
positions. With issues within their sphere of responsibility, they 
must be even more vigilant.
<P>
	Here we have the Minister of Justice not only discussing a 
criminal case which is before the Alberta Court of Appeal, but 
he also stated that the original decision of the Court of Queen's 
Bench was wrong.
<P>
	I suggest that this is where section (2) of citation 506 has been 
contravened, when it states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-the convention is applied when an appeal is launched.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This convention has come to be especially for cases like this. I 
think members of the House will agree that the Simmerman's 
interest of justice and fair play have been compromised by the 
statements made by the minister.
<P>
	I also bring the attention of the House to citation 493 of 
Beauchesne, whereby members are not to make personal attacks 
or censure judges and courts of justice.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice on numerous occasions has stated that 
the decision of the Alberta Queen's Bench was wrong or in error. 
Furthermore, I would like to bring to the attention of the House 
to the case, re Oulette Nos. 1 and 2, cited at 32 Criminal Cases, 
second edition, page 149 whereby the Minister of Consumer and 
Corporate Affairs at that time was held in contempt by the 
Quebec Court of Appeal for making disparaging remarks about a

	Mr. Speaker, I ask that you rule on the minister's comments 
and if he has, in fact, contravened the sub judice convention 
and/or citation 493.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise in response to the 
hon. member's point of order.
<P>
	First, I take very seriously my responsibilities both here in the 
House and outside, to respect the jurisdiction of the court, to 
abide by the sub judice rule and to bear in mind that as minister 
of the crown, I have responsibilities quite different from those 
judges of the courts of the country.
<P>
	I contend as well that nothing I have said here or elsewhere in 
relation to the Simmerman case or its principle has offended the 
rule against commenting on cases before the courts.
<P>
	May I first observe that it is passing strange that the hon. 
member should first ask me about a case in the House and then 
raise a point of order because I commented on the case in 
answering his question. It was in answering the very question 
put by the hon. member that I am alleged to have breached the 
rule. I was simply responding to a question put by the hon. 
member, and doing so in good faith.
<P>
	Second, as I mentioned the other day, when the hon. member 
raised this point in question period, there is a great deal of 
difference between on the one hand commenting on the facts of a 
criminal case which is in process, whether at trial or on appeal, 
in a fashion that might prejudice the party, the accused, by 
indicating what findings should be made or who committed what 
act-that is highly improper-and on the other hand simply 
observing that we take a different legal interpretation of a 
statute which, in fact, is what is at issue in the Simmerman case.
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
	I have said that we regard the legal interpretation put on the 
Criminal Code and the relevant sections at trial as not being the 
correct one. In fact, the Alberta government is appealing. The 
appeal is expected to be heard by the Alberta Court of Appeal in 
about September of this year. The federal government is now 
considering whether it will intervene in the appeal to put its 
point of view before the Court of Appeal.
<P>
	There is precedent for the proposition. I say there is nothing at 
all wrong with a minister saying that we take a different legal 
interpretation of a statute than that put on the statute by a court.
<P>
	It follows that the interpretation relied on by the court at first 
instance is not in accord with our interpretation. I suggest what 
is an issue here is that first we must show proper deference and 
respect to the court and its process and second, nothing must be 
said or done by a minister or a member that would prejudice the 
rights of parties in a pending case with respect to matters of fact.
<P>
	I say that neither of those principles has been offended by 
anything I said or did. This point of order is without foundation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I wish to comment very briefly to add to what the 
hon. minister said.
<P>
	First, in terms of the sub judice convention and citation 505 of 
Beauchesne's, it is obvious its purpose is to protect the parties in 
the case before the court. A member of Parliament has asked a 
question in the House to which the answer was the position the 
government would be taking vis-à-vis a particular case in an 
appeal.
<P>
	It stands to reason that if the government is appealing the 
case, it is appealing it because it feels the original decision was 
in error; otherwise there would be no point in appealing a 
particular decision.
<P>
	Second, the reference to the Oulette case is extremely 
inappropriate; it does not apply to this case. That particular 
issue had nothing to do with a comment made on the floor of the 
House of Commons, as the Speaker will obviously determine 
when he reviews the material surrounding that case.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, finally, you will recall through all cases I 
remember in the House of Commons where the sub judice rule 
has been invoked, it has been invoked and usually ruled on by 
the Speaker to ensure members do not ask questions in the 
House that are sub judice.
<P>
	If there is a case to be made here, it is that the question should 
not have been asked as opposed to should not have been 
answered. Therefore, I am forced to turn the table around and to 
urge the Speaker that if someone is admonished, it should be in 
such a way as to remind the hon. members not to ask questions 
when the questions are sub judice.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to bring two more facts to light with 
regard to this point of order.
<P>
	First, when the question was asked, it was asked with regard 
to orders in councils that had been ruled out of order by this case. 
The question was whether or not the Minister of Justice had the 
authority to continue making those decisions. It was not a 
reflection on the case in Alberta.
<P>
	The second point I would like to make is this. The federal 
government did not have intervener status in the provincial 
court case, so the federal justice minister really had no authority 
to make an intervention in a case that was not under his 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	Those are two very important points that need to be brought to 
your attention, Mr. Speaker.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="11353"> 11353 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I am going to take all of the debate 
under advisement. I want the House to recognize and realize that 
in the case of a convention, it is under the discretion of course of 
the Chair to make whatever appropriate decision there is.
<P>
	I would like to point out to all hon. members that the case of a 
convention is like an agreement, a tradition that we go by in this 
House of Commons.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	Whenever a case has been before the courts, there has been no 
question there cannot be reference to that case in the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	Most of the time this is left in the hands of the members, in 
their good judgment. In the case of a member asking a question 
he or she should take into consideration whether there is any 
infringement on this convention in any way.
<P>
	On the other hand, when a responder is put in that position, he 
or she also must weigh this. Basically it comes down to members 
themselves.
<P>
	With regard to this case, two cases have been put forth. I will 
look at all the interventions put forth. I am sure the House will 
give me the time to review precisely what was said in the 
original statements.
<P>
	If there is need to come back, I will but I would like some time 
to review the whole matter again and perhaps give a little more 
direction to the House as to what direction we should be going in 
the case of a convention of the House.
<P>
	If members would leave this with me, I will get back to the 
House at the earliest time if necessary.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BUDGETIMPLEMENTATIONACT,1995">BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1995</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jean Payne (St. John's West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when 
I was speaking earlier today I was referring to the Canada social 
transfer.
<P>
	By announcing the changes to its transfer payments this year, 
to take effect next year, the federal government has given the 
provinces plenty of notice of the changes so they may have time 
to prepare.
<P>
	Statistics show that under the CST total transfers, including 
equalization to the most needy provinces such as 
Newfoundland, will actually increase in 1996-97 compared 
with 1994-95. Total transfers including equalization to 
Newfoundland in 1996-97 will increase by $28 million 
compared with the 1994-95 levels. This demonstrates the 
federal government's commitment to both national standards 
and equalization among provinces.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	Other initiatives to social security under the budget include an 
announcement that changes are to be introduced in September to 
reform unemployment insurance. These changes are to result in 
a reduction of 10 per cent to the overall size of the 
unemployment insurance program. In undertaking these 
reforms the Minister of Human Resources Development faces 
many challenges and has an abundance of conditions to rely on.
<P>
	This past fall the Standing Committee on Human Resources 
Development undertook extensive consultations with Canadians 
on the topic of social security reform. During these 
consultations witnesses came forward time after time to tell the 
committee unemployment insurance systems often discourage 
people from getting back to work. People tell stories of being 
denied unemployment insurance because they wish to upgrade 
their skills while others get paid to stay home. Others tell of 
declining benefits while individuals whose spouses earn over 
$100,000 a year collect generous benefits.
<P>
	The impetus for any change in the unemployment insurance 
system must be to design a system that has as its underlying goal 
helping people get back to work while providing the limited 
resources available to those most in need.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development will keep 
these goals in mind when he prepares to make the necessary 
reform to the unemployment insurance system.
<P>
	On the scheme of social security reform the finance minister 
has promised to release a paper on the changes required to the 
public pension system in order to ensure its continued 
sustainability as our population ages. The underlining goal 
again in this review will be to ensure those most in need receive 
the limited resources available. Therefore old age security 
benefits will be provided on the basis of family income as is 
currently the case with the guaranteed income supplement. In 
addition, the Canada pension plan will be reviewed this fall to 
ensure its continued sustainability.
<P>
	Another area I would like to address is the impact of the 
budget on small business. Small business is the engine that 
drives our economy. Today over 99 per cent of all businesses in 
Canada employ fewer than 100 people. The small business 
sector accounts for 40 per cent of Canada's GDP. More 
important, it now accounts for over half of all the private sector 
employment.
<P>
	A recent survey by the Canadian Federation of Independent 
Business cited the deficit-debt as its number one concern. The 
finance minister listened to this concern and is maintaining his 
commitment to lowering the deficit, thereby providing the 
environment needed for small business to prosper. A lower 
deficit also means lower interest rates for small business 
borrowers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11356"> 11356 </A></B>
<P>
	The inability to access financing has also been cited by small 
business groups as an area of major concern. To this end the 
government has announced it will be working with the banks 
to devise meaningful performance benchmarks for small 
business financing. It is expected this process will be completed 
by the fall of this year. This will make loans more accessible 
to small business which in turn will generate job growth.
<P>
	The government has further demonstrated its commitment by 
maintaining tax preferences for small business such as the 
$500,000 lifetime capital gains exemption for small business 
shares and a lower tax rate on the first $200,000 of income.
<P>
	These measures in conjunction with measures to reduce the 
paper burden should ensure continued job creation through the 
small business sector.
<P>
	I wish to speak on a topic closely intertwined with my home 
province of Newfoundland, changes the budget will bring about 
in the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	I congratulate the Minister of Finance on maintaining his 
commitment to the TAGS program. Under the budget the total 
funding of the program remains at $1.9 billion over five years, 
including the $1.7 billion of new funding announced last year. 
This funding is to help Atlantic Canadians to adjust to the 
devastation in the ground fishery, a situation over which they 
have no control.
<P>
	Atlantic Canadians are a proud people. Given the opportunity, 
they would much rather work than receive government 
assistance.
<P>
	The funding is meant to help them to adjust to the sad reality 
that the ground fishery has been mismanaged and overfished by 
foreign vessels. Again the minister, through his commitment to 
this funding, has ensured that the most vulnerable in our society 
are protected.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	Other measures such as the merging of the coast guard with 
the Department of Fisheries and Oceans will enable Canada to 
strengthen its conservation efforts even more outside the 200 
mile zone at a time when it is most needed.
<P>
	In summary, I am pleased to pledge my full support for this 
budget. It shows that the Liberal government can do more than 
simply talk about deficit reduction. By setting reasonable 
targets for deficit reduction and then meeting them, this 
government has earned the trust and respect of the people of 
Canada. More important, this budget has managed to reduce the 
deficit largely through expenditure reductions while ensuring 
that those in society who are most vulnerable are protected.
<P>
	While it is not with any great pride that many of these 
expenditure cuts were introduced, it was out of necessity to 
ensure that our economy stays on the road to recovery and our 
social system can remain sustainable in the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
comment and ask a question.
<P>
	Almost all of the Liberal members, including the hon. 
member who just spoke, keep patting themselves on the back for 
having attacked the deficit. Indeed, the announced deficit is 
targeted to go down. However, the fact is that interest rates are 
going up and the total interest payments are going up because 
our total indebtedness is still so very high.
<P>
	Many Canadians do not know that with this budget, total 
government expenditures are actually destined to increase by 
some $2 billion in this budget.
<P>
	We need to lean into the debt and the deficit. It is my opinion, 
which I believe is one shared by most Canadians, that time is of 
the essence. The longer we wait the greater our interest 
payments grow. Even if the Minister of Finance and the 
government of the day meet their goals, we expect the interest 
payments will have reached a minimum of $50 billion per year 
by the time this Parliament is finished.
<P>
	We need to recognize that of that $50 billion per year, a great 
proportion is sent out of the country in the form of interest 
payments to those international lenders who have loaned us 
money. It totally removes that available cash for providing 
government programs.
<P>
	The Liberals keep speaking of providing these programs and 
not wanting to give them up. That is admirable and is a 
wonderful goal, but our interest payments are making it less and 
less possible to continue funding those programs. As a matter of 
fact, if we do not get a hold of it real fast our social funding will 
disappear in deference to the requirements to pay the interest.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to respond to the statement on 
the speed with which we are attacking the deficit. She will 
probably say that they are doing great. But specifically, how 
does increasing annual interest payments from $40 billion to 
$50 billion help our social program funding?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Payne:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question.
<P>
	As the hon. member knows, many factors have influenced our 
budget ever since it was brought down a month ago. These 
factors will continue to have influence. However, he is also well 
aware that over the last two years we have met our budget targets 
through the efforts of the minister. I am sure that effort will 
continue. Yes, we are concerned with rising interest rates. I am 
sure that is no secret to the hon. member as the minister has 
spoken on that a number of times.
<P>
	I do not believe and I am sure the hon. member, based on some 
of the statements he has made earlier in this House, is very well 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11357"> 11357 </A></B>
<P>
aware that we cannot reduce the deficit on the backs of those 
who most need our assistance. They are a very vulnerable group.
<P>
	Perhaps throughout the next year the minister will again need 
to do some readjusting as various factors affect our financial 
position.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before we resume debate, 
I just want to apprise the House that we have now exhausted the 
five hour maximum for the debate. We now go to the next stage 
of debate, which are 10 minute interventions without questions 
or comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to start my remarks on Bill C-76 by recognizing 
that in February 1995 the Minister of Finance brought down a 
budget which departs substantially from normal Liberal 
philosophy.
<P>
	This is the budget that should have been introduced in 
February 1994. Rather than taking firm action then, the Liberals 
just cried and moaned about the mess left by the Conservatives. 
That was the time to really reduce spending and take corrective 
action.
<P>
	Even now, the unrealistic 3 per cent of GDP target chosen by 
the Liberal government is akin to a high jump contest where the 
bar is never raised above two feet. Anyone can clear the obstacle 
because it is not a real test of capability. So the minister's 
crowing about achieving or exceeding his budget goals is 
ridiculous.
<P>
	The aim should have been to present interim targets on the 
way to a balanced budget by the end of this Parliament, along 
with a plan to show how this was to be achieved. But this 
government had neither the political will nor the courage to set 
these realistic goals which are desperately needed if Canada's 
vaunted social programs are to be protected and sustained.
<P>
	There is no question that various special interest groups and 
some Canadians would cry: ``Yes, cut spending, but not in my 
program'', or: ``Yes, you should save money, but not on my 
subsidy''.
<P>
	The Reform Party has established that there is a large 
constituency in our country which recognizes and is ready to 
accept the need for meaningful spending reductions which will 
lead to a balanced budget. Historically, governments, including 
this one, have preferred to take the easier road, making a few 
spending cuts and raising a few taxes but not taking the 
measures really required to balance the books.
<P>
	The federal debt has climbed from $28 billion in 1970 to 
nearly $550 billion today, a 28-fold increase. Among major 
developed countries only Italy has a larger debt relative to the 
size of its economy.
<P>
	I have trouble visualizing a billion. I can come into the picture 
somewhat with a million, but a billion really escapes me. To try 
to put it into context, I converted it into time and used seconds as 
the basis. One million seconds is just under 12 days, 11.82 days 
exactly. A billion seconds is almost 32 years. This puts it into 
some perspective as to how large a billion is.
<P>
	After running up a serious deficit during World War II, 
Canada's debt to GDP ratio gradually declined until the 
mid-1970s. The last federal surplus was recorded in 1970. From 
that point on governments continually spent money they did not 
have and in so doing accumulated the debt burden which saddles 
us today.
<P>
	It took Reform Party insistence and concerned taxpayers to 
convince this government that Canada has a serious debt 
problem which must be addressed not by increasing taxes, but 
rather by reducing spending.
<P>
	Then Moody's rattled the chains. Foreign investors expressed 
their concern that Canada's finances are in serious trouble, 
saying: ``Either put your act in order or we will invest our money 
elsewhere''.
<P>
	With one-quarter of our national debt held by international 
money markets, Canada is hostage to their demands for a good 
return on the buck. Furthermore, while Canada has been an 
attractive place to invest money because of our stable political 
climate, the Quebec problem has put that climate in question and 
thus our finances are subjected to greater scrutiny.
<P>
	As I said earlier, the federal debt is now almost $550 billion 
and provincial and municipal governments owe another $190 
billion. Under Liberal plans, within three years the federal debt 
will increase by $100 billion to almost $600 billion and interest 
payments on that debt will climb to $52 billion. The result is that 
interest payments will account for nearly one-third of our total 
federal budget.
<P>
	In 1981 the share of the provincial debt for each man, woman 
and child was $4,500. When a child is born here today, he or she 
enters Canada owing over $25,000. In fact, everyone pictures a 
baby being born and the doctor holding it up by the heels, 
slapping it on the bottom to get it to cry and start its life cycle. 
That is no longer necessary. All the doctor has to do is hold the 
baby up and say: ``You owe us $25,000 and the baby 
automatically starts to cry''.
<P>
<B>(1240 ) </B>
<P>
	When the Liberals took office, interest charges on our debt 
were $39 billion. Under their projected budget plan, by the next 
election those interest charges will have risen to $52 billion and 
as I said before will comprise almost one-third of our annual 
budget.
<P>
	This means that more than 30 cents out of every tax dollar will 
be devoted to paying the interest on the debt. At that time the 
Liberals still project a deficit of $24 billion. Our debt is 
continuing to rise as will the interest payments we will be forced 
to pay.
<P>
	This Liberal budget fails to deliver. The Liberals have no plan 
to balance the books by the end of their mandate. They have no 
plan to answer the problems rapidly approaching with an aging 
population. The Superintendent of Financial Institutions has 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11358"> 11358 </A></B>
<P>
warned that the Canada pension plan will be exhausted in 20 
years.
<P>
	Despite the added pressure of an ever increasing deficit and 
debt to service, the government must still deal with this 
problem. It is clear the looming interest payments on the debt 
will virtually kill pensions and other social programs. Also, 
transfers to provinces for health, post-secondary education and 
welfare will be lumped into the new Canada social transfer.
<P>
	The deepest spending cuts are left until next year when the $7 
billion in social program cuts begin. Provincial transfers will be 
reduced by $2.5 billion in 1996-97 and $4.5 billion in 1997-98.
<P>
	To what extent will spending cuts be downloaded to the 
provinces? A lump sum payment will be given to them and the 
feds say: ``Find a way to save the money, but you must still live 
by our rules or we will withhold the transfers''.
<P>
	This budget does not place resources and responsibilities in 
the hands of those levels of government closest to the people. It 
does not include tax point transfers which would give provincial 
governments the resources needed to pay for their social 
programs.
<P>
	Without social program reform, the provinces and the 
taxpayer will have to carry the burden. They will be asked to 
streamline programs. However, if the federal government does 
not like the changes, it can withhold the money.
<P>
	Programs to natives, Inuit and Metis will increase. Yet the 
government has not taken measures to clean up what are clearly 
identified as badly managed programs. Despite budget cuts, 
spending will increase by $600 million because of escalating 
interest payments alone. This budget is an example of the 
consequences of not eliminating the deficit quickly.
<P>
	On the other hand, the Reform Party's taxpayers budget would 
eliminate the deficit in three years with spending cuts and no tax 
increases. The taxpayers budget would restore labour market 
efficiency through the reduction of social program dependency. 
It would create an economic climate that would lead to lasting 
private sector job creation.
<P>
	What will it take to ensure governments-this one and those 
that follow-live within their means by not spending more than 
they take in? We can look to Switzerland for an example. The 
Swiss enjoy one of the lowest marginal income tax rates, a high 
standard of living and a generous social safety net. How do they 
do it?
<P>
	The Swiss government is required to go to the voters if it 
wants to raise taxes or spend more money. The government is 
constitutionally bound to live within its means. This has been in 
place for years and it works. Government is accountable to the 
people. Is that not the way democracy should work? It is 
representation by the people and for the people with the people 
having control of the purse strings. I wonder how those fat 
pension plans for MPs would fare if they had to go to the public 
to be approved.
<P>
	The Swiss must also be consulted on any law or regulation. 
Does anyone remember the Liberal red book's promise to scrap 
the GST? In fact, the Swiss government asked the people to 
approve a similar goods and services scheme. Three times the 
voters said no. The fourth time the plan was successful and has 
just been implemented this year. If the Swiss decide they do not 
like the tax, they can rescind it by petitioning government to 
remove it. I am sure every Canadian would approve of tax and 
expenditure limits for their government.
<P>
	This government had the good fortune to inherit a healthy 
economy. If the economy slows, as is expected, added pressure 
will be brought to bear at a time when the deepest budget cuts 
must take place. If we call this a debt crisis today, what will we 
call it then? This budget plan will still add to the debt and 
continue the erosion of social safety nets.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	Our only hope is that the Minister of Finance will not be 
swayed and will continue to find ways to save money and ensure 
that programs are effective in their delivery while providing the 
necessary means to evaluate the programs. If programs do not 
achieve what they were intended to, they should be eliminated.
<P>
	Spending cuts are important, but even more important is the 
acceptance of the need to balance the budget and the 
presentation of a plan that will take us there. Although too little 
and too late the budget was a step in the right direction.
<P>
	The government is now left to do what must be done: plan to 
balance the budget during this term of Parliament and tell 
Canadians how it is going to do it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome the opportunity to speak on the budget. In the week 
immediately following the budget I had two public meetings 
with constituents, two meetings with farm groups, and one 
meeting with the forestry industry.
<P>
	My purpose in holding the meetings was to set out as well as I 
could the facts arising from the budget so that together with the 
constituents in my community we could understand the impact 
in a real sense and manoeuvre and develop policies to address 
the future.
<P>
	In so doing I believe we were able to examine critically the 
budget and to obtain constructive feedback. I will come to the 
feedback later in my remarks. It is no secret that the priority of 
the government is to restore Canada to fiscal health and meet the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11359"> 11359 </A></B>
<P>
target of deficit reduction we campaigned on in the last 
campaign: 3 per cent of GDP by the end of 1996-97.
<P>
	The budget takes strong action to deal with the deficit. It is 
tough and it encompasses painful program cuts. The government 
strategy required savings on government expenditures, program 
review, and some tax changes.
<P>
	In so doing programs that many of us, myself included, hold 
near and dear have been cut. We have attempted as a government 
to be balanced across the regions and across the industries on 
both the social and the tax expenditure sides. Regardless of the 
facts it does not make dealing with tough fiscal measures any 
easier or make the impact on those affected any less.
<P>
	Turning to the meetings I have had with constituents, farmers 
and especially my former organization told me in no uncertain 
terms that they felt the budget was tougher on the agricultural 
sector than on other sectors across the land, especially so when 
the transportation changes are brought into the equation.
<P>
	The loss of ARFAA and MFRA rates within Atlantic Canada 
will impact upon primary producers. We have set aside 
considerable adjustment moneys, $321 million. By providing 
that money to the provinces there was concern expressed that the 
provinces may not address the needs of producers as a result of 
the changes in the budget.
<P>
	We as MPs have a responsibility and must be involved in the 
process. I intend to be involved. At the very bottom line we 
certainly do need to have a national transportation policy in 
place. The loss of the feed freight assistance in Atlantic Canada 
could have a very negative impact on the Atlantic livestock 
industry if we do not provide other compensating policy 
initiatives to the livestock industry.
<P>
	I will lay out the facts. I will not put a spin on them. I accept 
the facts as they are. When the feed freight assistance program 
in Atlantic Canada and the changes to the WGTA in the west are 
combined, the cost of barley in eastern Canada as compared to 
the west will be at approximately a $42 per tonne disadvantage. 
That is the reality. I do not believe we should despair over the 
facts.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	The secretary of state for agriculture and agri-food will be 
setting up consultations with the farm community. Adjustment 
moneys are in place. The secretary of state and the Department 
of Agriculture are certainly discussing with industry and 
looking at new ways of developing the competitiveness of the 
livestock industry in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	In the meetings with farmers I attended in eastern Canada 
some concern was expressed about proposed changes to 
Agriculture Canada, especially in the area of privatizing the 
economic branch. There is a firm belief with which I agree that 
the minister needs a division within the department to do the 
economic analysis and the economic impact studies prior to 
policy changes being made.
<P>
	I am one who firmly believes that we should be holding 
outlook conferences where the department has to put on record 
where it thinks the movement will be in agriculture over the next 
year and then come back and account for its prediction a year 
later.
<P>
	By privatizing the economic branch there will be no real 
savings to farm out to economic consultants. In my mind it 
would be much more preferable to get rid of some of the paper 
pushers at the top, the people who do not really understand 
primary producers in terms of getting their hands dirty in the 
soil and understanding at the primary production level. We need 
some discussion in that area.
<P>
	There is no question the minister had difficult choices to 
make. He will attempt to address the impact through improved 
safety nets, adaptation programs and new policy thrusts.
<P>
	Turning to some other meetings I have had in my riding, on 
the Canada social transfer there were questions raised whether it 
would be an effective vehicle to equally deliver social programs 
such as post-secondary education and health care across the 
country. Questions were raised on what effect block transfers 
would have on the fight against child poverty.
<P>
	I outlined to those in attendance that we had a very successful 
hearing on HRD and social security reform review. Many good 
points came out of the paper from the committee. I congratulate 
it on its work. The committee did good investigative work, held 
hearings and has come up with some sound recommendations 
that the government and members of Parliament can look at in 
terms of future initiatives in the social security area.
<P>
	The debt and the deficit were discussed in great detail. The 
main focus of discussion with respect to the debt and the deficit 
was centred on the percentage of Canada's debt owed to foreign 
investors. I am very concerned about that area. When a few 
speculators basically playing computer games on the stock 
market floor can bring down a country in terms of its financial 
security, we have to look seriously at the issue. Whether it is a 
new Bretton Woods agreement or some other measure we have 
to look at it seriously. I believe the Prime Minister has put the 
matter on the agenda for the G-7 in Halifax.
<P>
	Public service reductions were talked about at the meetings as 
well. Representatives from the public service expressed their 
anxiety with regard to what many public servants are 
undergoing and the demoralizing effect on the workforce. 
Representatives questioned why the compensation, the early 
retirement package, could not be offered to all public servants so 
the resulting vacancies could be filled by surplus workers who 
do not qualify for the package. We will be raising those points 
with the ministers responsible.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11360"> 11360 </A></B>
<P>
	I must speak for a moment on the WGTA. It is widely known 
that I have spent the better part of my life defending the 
so-called Crow rate. I still believe there is an obligation the 
railways have never met in all the discussions and changes over 
the years. Regardless, the change is being made which will 
affect western producers and communities.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	Adjustment measures are in place, the $300 million 
adjustment and the compensation for land prices. I underline the 
fact that the WGTA has been in effect since the turn of the 
century. It was the cornerstone of agricultural policy in the west.
<P>
	I accept the changes but we must recognize the impact. There 
will be impact in areas other than financial areas such as 
highways, car allocations, quality control, the wheat board, et 
cetera. We have to listen to the producers so they can outline to 
us the changes they want.
<P>
	These are different times. We must get our financial house in 
order. The real solutions will be found in the country, in the 
hearts and minds of the people who will be affected. We as MPs 
must continue to consult with constituents to find solutions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, when 
a bad decision is made, nothing could be more justified than to 
try to delay its implementation. That is why the dilatory motion 
put forth by the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot is 
relevant and why I support it.
<P>
	In the next few minutes, I will try to demonstrate how 
appalling the finance minister's budget is as far as the drastic 
cuts to official development assistance it contains are 
concerned. This decision without vision makes it clear why the 
government did not want to make any commitments in early 
February, when the Canadian foreign policy statement was 
released. Also, the excessive focus on trade in this new foreign 
policy is brought to light in the budget tabled on February 27.
<P>
	The early 1990s signalled the end of any measure that would 
have enabled Canada to reach the target of 0.7 per cent of GDP 
for official development assistance. In the 1991 budget, aid 
spending on Eastern European countries and the Commonwealth 
of Independent States was increased at the expense of ODA.
<P>
	In his 1992 economic statement, the Minister of Finance cut 
$50 million in the international assistance envelope. The 1994 
budget called for international assistance to be reduced by 
another two per cent in 1994 and 1995, but what this budget says 
is quite different. Ignoring this commitment to cut only 2 per 
cent, the Minister of Finance decided to cut 21 per cent, or $532 
million, from the development assistance budget.
<P>
	In addition, the cuts announced between now and 1997-98 
represent a shortfall of $1.3 billion for our international 
co-operation programs. As I said, these cuts mean a 21 per cent 
reduction in the total development assistance budget. I would 
point out to this House that the cuts to the Department of 
National Defence represent only 14.2 per cent. Surprising for a 
government that acknowledged the threats to our society in the 
post cold war period come, in large part, from development 
problems.
<P>
	In 1994, the development assistance budget corresponded to 
0.4 per cent of Canada's GNP; in 1997, the figure will drop to 
less than 0.3 per cent. This will make Canada one of the least 
generous of the industrialized countries, because this figure will 
be below the average of the OECD countries.
<P>
	The budget of the Export Development Corporation grew by 
$155 million, whereas the budget of the voluntary sector of 
official development assistance will be cut by $45 million. 
Where is the logic in all this? The cuts to the budgets of NGOs 
lucky enough to still receive support are estimated at about 15 
per cent.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois' position on development assistance has 
always been clear, unlike the Liberals' position in their red 
book. It has remained consistent from the speeches by the 
Leader of the Opposition during the 1993 elections to debates in 
the House and in committee. Should I point out that the Liberals 
had set 0.7 per cent of the GNP as an objective for official 
development assistance?
<P>
	We can understand, in a time of budget restraint, the 
government's making major cuts in the development assistance 
budget.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	However, in light of the work done by the special joint 
committee, that assistance programs for volunteer organizations 
will be hardest hit by these cuts is totally unacceptable.
<P>
	Last Friday, CIDA announced a 100 per cent cut in funding for 
NGOs working in the area of public awareness of international 
development among Canadians. This will take effect on April 1. 
The Bloc Quebecois obviously objects to these measures and to 
the way they were announced, with only one week's advance 
notice. I do not understand this budget measure. The savings the 
cut will generate only account for 0.5 per cent of the total 
official development assistance budget. The consequences and 
the chain reaction that this measure will set off on the 
international solidarity and co-operation network are 
inestimable.
<P>
	One thing we can already be sure of is that the future of close 
to one hundred small NGOs which are mostly located in the 
outlying regions, already raise 50 per cent of their funding from 
other sources and co-ordinate the activities of thousands of 
committed volunteers, is in danger.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11361"> 11361 </A></B>
<P>
	For a few years now a world-wide consensus has been 
emerging that these non-governmental organizations, which do 
remarkable work at little cost, are very efficient. It is in this 
context, and despite the speeches and commitments it made in 
front of international forums, that the Canadian government 
quite unexpectedly cut the funding of close to one half of the 
country's NGOs and is reducing by 14 per cent the funding of the 
remainder.
<P>
	But most of the witnesses heard during the vast consultations 
led by this government on Canadian foreign policy were saying 
the opposite. Following these consultations, the Special Joint 
Committee Reviewing Canada's Foreign Policy recommended 
in November 1994 that public participation be considered a 
priority for official development assistance.
<P>
	After rejecting the joint committee's recommendation, the 
government went so far as to cut this program's funding and 
seems to want to perpetuate the ambiguous mandate of CIDA, 
which is becoming increasingly interested in promoting 
international trade and less interested in accomplishing its main 
mission: promoting sustainable human development in the 
poorest nations of the world. Particularly as Quebecers and 
Canadians are adopting a new world vision of solidarity and 
sharing rather than building up armed defence.
<P>
	It should come as no surprise that the Canadian Council for 
International Co-operation and the Association québécoise des 
organismes de coopération internationale represent more than 
100 humanitarian agencies. These NGOs depend on the 
generosity and dedication of thousands of volunteers who 
donate their time and money to help the poorest and neediest 
men, women and children on this planet. Development aid must 
help reinforce co-operation between institutions and Canadian 
citizens and those in the third world, and the best vehicle to 
achieve that is the NGOs, whose people become part of the 
community they are helping.
<P>
	Are we to conclude that with these new budgetary measures, 
the government has abandoned this network of solidarity 
between Canadians and the people of the third world?
<P>
	Canada's annual budget for National Defence is around $10 
billion; while the budget for development aid is only $2 billion. 
We can assume that the defence industry is anxious to keep it 
that way. However, the Canadian government cannot aid and 
abet these questionable choices indefinitely. To maintain this 
kind of gap between military spending and development aid is 
unacceptable.
<P>
	If they are not prepared to be generous, the political leaders of 
this country should at least realize that development aid can be 
profitable for industrialized countries. In Canada alone, 
development assistance creates 45,000 jobs, supports 2,000 
businesses and provides economic spinoffs for 80 colleges and  
universities. Every dollar invested, and it is indeed an 
investment, directly generates $6.42 in Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise and speak on Bill C-76, an act to 
implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament 
last February 27.
<P>
	The finance minister has put forward a ground breaking 
budget that has struck a delicate balance within fiscal toughness 
and sensitivity to people.
<P>
<B>(1305 ) </B>
<P>
	The response from the Canadian public has been positive. In 
my home city of Winnipeg our largest daily newspaper, the <I>Free 
Press</I>, carried the headline the day after the budget: ``Tough plan 
boosts buck, raises hopes''.
<P>
	A column in the February 28 edition of the Montreal <I>Gazette</I> 
read: ``[The] budget sets the country on a new course, one in 
which the national role of the federal government must be 
rethought, renegotiated and rediscovered. It's a good start''.
<P>
	The <I>Globe and Mail</I> agreed: ``Canadians, and those abroad 
who wish us well, must hope that this brave beginning-will 
now be sustained''.
<P>
	What is this brave beginning? It is the mark of a government 
coming to grips with a cumbersome national debt which 
threatens to foreclose on the futures of our children and 
grandchildren. It is the mark of a government committed to 
ensuring the needy among us from all walks of life continue to 
receive the assistance they need. It is the mark of a government 
that recognizes the need to streamline its own operations, 
eliminating duplication and waste while improving delivery of 
all services.
<P>
	How will the government achieve these ends? First, it will 
realize $29 billion in savings over three years: $5 billion in 
1995-96, $10.6 billion in 1996-97 and $13.3 billion in 1997-98. 
These measures are necessary to ensure that regardless of the 
direction financial markets take in coming years, the 
government will meet its target of reducing the deficit to 3 per 
cent of the gross domestic product by year 1997-98.
<P>
	These tough measures have proven the government is serious 
about reducing spending and doing so only, in contrast to other 
parties, after an exhaustive review of government programs 
aimed at identifying priorities and eliminating waste and 
duplication.
<P>
	World financial markets reacted favourably by sustaining our 
AAA credit rating. The importance of this rating must not be 
underestimated. Had it fallen, interest rates could have risen and 
the interest Canada would have been required to pay on its debt 
would have increased dramatically.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11362"> 11362 </A></B>
<P>
	As crucial as these deficit reduction measures were to the 
1995 budget, Canadians also expected something more. They 
wanted to be reassured that savings would not be achieved 
through deep cuts in Canada's cherished social programs, 
particularly medicare.
<P>
	Indeed, one vital component of the budget provides for 
improved delivery of health care and enhanced research on 
biotechnology as well as retaining funds necessary to ensure 
improvements in the Canada assistance plan and to student 
financial assistance.
<P>
	The introduction of so-called block funding in the form of the 
new Canada social transfer will enable the provinces to exercise 
greater control over how moneys are allocated, thereby allowing 
them the flexibility to fund programs according to local 
demands for services. The delivery of social programs is the 
constitutional responsibility of provinces and that they will 
have. It is also the claim of provinces that they should have this 
flexibility and that they will have.
<P>
	This approach will bring health care closer to communities. 
At the same time, the system allows the federal government to 
continue to uphold the five principles of medicare enshrined in 
the Canada Health Act: universality, accessibility, 
comprehensiveness, portability and public administration. The 
Minister of Finance said that flexibility does not mean a 
free-for-all.
<P>
	These principles of medicare are not subject to 
federal-provincial negotiation. They are not negotiable, as the 
two levels of government implement the agreement on the 
Canada social transfer. Rather they are fundamental pillars of 
Canadian society. They are the foundation on which our health 
care system is constructed.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	The government has vowed in no uncertain terms that the 
Canada social transfer ``will not sacrifice the quality of service 
available to Canadians''. We must remember that it is possible 
not only to maintain our current delivery of health care at the 
current level of funding but to effect improvements. In other 
words, we can do more with as much.
<P>
	Key to this strategy is the practice of substituting equally 
effective lower cost treatment approaches for traditional ones. 
For example, we can make increased use of out-patient care, 
encouraging patients to see family physicians before consulting 
specialists and allowing non-medical health care processionals 
to substitute for medical doctors in defined areas of care.
<P>
	The same flexibility within the new social transfer which can 
lead to improved health care also bodes well for the future of the 
Canada assistance plan or CAP. The incorporation of the CAP 
into the Canada social transfer provides the provinces with the 
freedom and flexibility they require to deliver social programs 
most efficiently and effectively. Again, the goal is to do more 
without increasing actual government expenditures. This is an 
attainable goal.
<P>
	I mentioned earlier that the government has shown 
determination to ensure a sound future for youth. This 
determination is exemplified by the deficit cutting initiatives 
that relieve our children and youth of some of the burden of the 
national debt but it is found in other areas in the budget as well.
<P>
	The federal contribution to university and college funding 
will be rolled into the Canada social transfer, again guaranteeing 
the provinces the freedom to distribute funds according to need 
and using the savings achieved through avoidance of 
duplication.
<P>
	The government's continuing commitment to fund granting 
councils which support the direct costs of university research 
and which support the Canada student loans program as well as 
post-secondary education for Indian and Inuit students all attest 
to the government's commitment to our youth.
<P>
	There is much in the budget to guarantee Canada both a 
prosperous present and an even more prosperous future. Part and 
parcel of that prosperity will be the maintenance of the social 
programs which have served Canadians well in the past by 
keeping our nation competitive and our citizens protected from 
social catastrophe. Under this tough, yet sensitive budget, 
Canadians can be assured that programs will become even more 
responsive to their needs in the future.
<P>
	The government faces a daunting task as it leaves the 20th 
century and enters the 21st century. If government had simply 
slashed spending without due regard for the underprivileged 
among us, it would have turned its back on principle. If it had 
continued to spend without due regard for the future of the 
nation and the future generations it would have turned its back 
on reality.
<P>
	Instead, as has been the case so many times since it took 
office, the government has taken the middle ground approach 
and avoided extremist solutions suggested by the two parties 
opposite. This balance is what ultimately will enable it to 
succeed where other governments have failed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am going to limit my remarks on the budget today to 
transport, which is appropriate since I am the transport critic for 
the Reform Party and the Reform Party being, of course, the 
national opposition party.
<P>
	Generally transport is an area that has great potential in 
reducing government costs and the devolution of government 
services to the private sector. In this area transport is generally 
moving in a direction that I agree with. One item that is being 
changed that I particularly agree with is the privatization of air 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11363"> 11363 </A></B>
<P>
traffic services. This is a good move, especially now that the 
government has more or less agreed to go to the not for profit 
concept, as opposed to the crown corporation concept it was 
initially pushing.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	Airport devolution is a generally good idea although I have 
some concerns about skimming. When I speak of skimming, I 
am talking about when they take all the revenues from 26 
national airports, put them into a group and apply them for the 
most part to their general funding. At the same time they dump 
on to various provinces and regions all the costs of the subsidies 
to smaller airports. In most cases they are much less than the 
revenues the government is realizing from national airports.
<P>
	One big area in the recent budget is the WGTA, the grain 
transportation subsidies. I have always supported the concept 
that they could be reduced and ultimately eliminated, with the 
caveat that the government must deal with many items that cost 
producers money. These are items that do not produce revenue 
for the government but take money out of the pockets of 
producers. I speak specifically of things like rail car allocation 
and labour disruption.
<P>
	In a document the Minister of Transport put out coinciding 
with the budget he explained and recognized a problem with rail 
car allocation. He said it was something they would look into but 
that they would not do anything with at this time. It cost 
Canadian grain producers a tremendous amount of money. It is 
not a cost factor for the government but it should have been dealt 
with in conjunction with the reduction and elimination of the 
WGTA.
<P>
	Likewise we have labour disruptions; the shutting down of 
ports, particularly the port of Vancouver; and rail strikes. We 
had a strike in the port of Vancouver last year. The government 
legislated the people back to work but did nothing to deal with 
future problems.
<P>
	We had another one this year. Again the government 
legislated the people back to work but did nothing about a long 
term solution. Immediately on the heels of the Vancouver strike 
this year we had a national rail strike. Again the government 
legislated people back to work but did nothing about a long term 
solution.
<P>
	These are matters that cost Canadian taxpayers and citizens 
money but do not provide any revenues for the government. 
These are matters the government should not be ignoring, which 
has unfortunately been its method of dealing with them.
<P>
	I turn to the subject of Pearson airport. It will be a great 
surprise to many people that I would talk about it. Pearson 
airport has major ramifications on this year's budget. A bit of 
misleading information is coming out with regard to it and to the 
budget.
<P>
	The government is currently looking at putting in a new 
runway, at a cost of something in the vicinity of $150 million. 
On top of the cost of the runway a possible lawsuit is in the 
works by the council on concerned citizens. It is concerned 
because building the runway is in direct contradiction to the 
findings of the Environmental Assessment Review Panel. It is 
entering into a lawsuit and the government will have the cost of 
dealing with the action, over and above the cost of the runway if 
it is built. In addition we have the development contract 
regarding terminals 1 and 2 at Pearson airport.
<P>
	At minimum it will cost about half a billion dollars in 
combination of cancellation costs and court costs dealing with 
the cancellation. Even after it is all over with we still have to 
rebuild terminals 1 and 2, which two years ago was to cost the 
private consortium $750 million. We can be assured that if the 
government built it at the same time it would cost more and now 
we are talking two years later. We are talking of a minimum in 
the vicinity of $1 billion for that aspect. In total we are talking 
about an expenditure at Pearson of some $2 billion. It is 
interesting that none of that money is in the budget.
<P>
	Let us talk in terms of the Liberal budget. Is it good? Is it bad? 
Does it do enough? We have to consider what it said and what it 
should be saying. This covers a couple of items in the transport 
portfolio alone. If the same type of misleading information 
applies with all other departments in government, what other 
surprises lie ahead of us? We have not seen the full picture. 
Unfortunately Canadian taxpayers will not get the rest of the 
facts until it is too late.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	The budget does not explain the true situation in Canada. It 
does not deal with the true problem in Canada. As a result there 
will be further problems ahead that have not been spoken as yet.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on second reading of Bill C-76, an 
act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled on 
February 27, 1995. For my constituents the bill should be known 
as an act to kill the Crow or an act of unfairness to the prairie 
economy.
<P>
	Bill C-76 is the legislation that will allow for the payment of 
compensation to the owners of farmland in the absence of the 
Crow benefit. I quote National Farmers Union President Nettie 
Wiebe:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The federal budget delivers a double hit to Canadian farmers. They are 
increasing farmers' costs by cutting transportation subsidies and then hitting us 
with fewer funds for farm safety nets, less money for dairy subsidies and 
reducing the budget overall.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I will direct my remarks to two points. First, I will look at the 
principle of withdrawing federal support from grain 
transportation. Second, I will address the specifics of the 
payment of the $1.6 billion outlined in the legislation before us.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11364"> 11364 </A></B>
<P>
	I have said previously in questions in the Chamber, in 
comments to other speakers and in response to inquiries from 
the media that the elimination of the federal financial 
commitment to the transport of grain destined for export is the 
single most devastating element in a very difficult budget.
<P>
	On February 27 the federal finance minister announced the 
elimination of the transport support program which, just two 
years ago, was providing $720 million a year. The grain on the 
prairies is grown on land that is farther from port than in any 
other export oriented grain growing country in the world.
<P>
	I have been consulting with farmers and community leaders in 
areas supported by the farm economy. During the consultations 
we took out our pencils and calculators and looked at the 
implications of the elimination of the Crow benefit in real, 
personal and community terms. The only word to describe the 
implications of the federal government measure was 
devastating, the word I used earlier.
<P>
	In the province of Saskatchewan the loss of the Crow benefit 
will mean that delivery costs from virtually every delivery point 
in the province will increase by about $1 million a year. 
Producers who deliver grain to local elevators will have 
additional freight costs deducted at the elevators equalling 
collectively about $1 million a year. With reduced incomes of 
some significance there is a net community loss that is unlikely 
to be made up elsewhere.
<P>
	That is the point the federal government failed to address in 
the budget. The withdrawal of federal support will have an 
immediate effect on countless communities, most of which will 
have neither the resources nor the ability to make up the lost 
funds.
<P>
	In spite of my questions and the questions of others, the 
federal government has not produced a single page of study, 
evaluation or analysis to indicate or prove the contention of the 
finance minister that the elimination of the financial support 
will lead to greater crop diversification or enhanced value added 
production capacity in these communities.
<P>
	I draw attention to the speech yesterday of the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Finance who talked in glowing 
terms about the elimination of the subsidy encouraging the 
development of value added processing and the production of 
higher value goods. He said that the elimination would result in 
a more efficient grain handling and transportation system. He 
said that the elimination of the Crow benefit would help 
maintain our market access for grain sales in foreign countries.
<P>
	No evidence has ever been produced to prove these 
contentions. What is there? What analysis has been made to 
substantiate these claims? Absolutely none. Not one shred of 
evidence has been produced to give us any confidence that the 
investment to replace the lost income from increased freight 
costs will magically materialize. Every delivery point in 
Saskatchewan must find $1  million a year in new revenues just 
to remain where they are today. How many more peas can we 
grow? How many more pigs or cows can we produce? How many 
new flour mills, ethanol plants or breakfast cereal plants can we 
build by this time next year to replace the $1 million per 
community that is being taken out of our province by this single 
move in the budget?
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	There are a lot of unanswered questions which deal with the 
future of my province and even the uncertain future of the 
Canadian Wheat Board that are not being answered. Yet the 
government is proceeding with great abandon to ensure that the 
Crow benefit is gone before the end of the crop year. It is sheer 
madness.
<P>
	On virtually every other issue the Liberals talk about their 
election promises, the red book promises, the guide to direct 
them in policy matters, but nowhere in the red book do we see a 
promise to get rid of the Crow benefit and bankrupt agricultural 
communities with such swiftness. I quote the red book: ``Our 
goal is reducing input costs to make farming more valuable''. 
What have the Liberals done? They have increased costs, not 
reduced them as promised in the red book.
<P>
	I have asked the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-food and 
the Minister of Finance to postpone any actions on the 
elimination of their commitment and responsibility to the west 
until the long term implications are well known, thoroughly 
reviewed, and mitigating measures are outlined and debated. It 
is absolutely crucial that we look at what the long term 
implications will be before the decisions are taken in the 
Chamber by the members who are sitting here today.
<P>
	In the legislation before us the government is barrelling ahead 
with the decision to kill the Crow without knowing what it will 
mean to those most affected. The legislation gives the 
government the authority to make a transition payment to the 
owners of farmland in western Canada in lieu of the Crow 
benefit. Once the legislation is passed and the process of making 
the payments is in place, it will be very hard, indeed it will be 
impossible to go back and assess how bad the damage will be. 
We have to defeat the legislation if we are to make the proper 
assessments.
<P>
	At the same time it is important to look at the specifics of Bill 
C-76. There are three main problems with which I would like to 
deal: the principle of the idea, the payout, and the process of 
regulations. In principle the idea of providing $1.6 billion in a 
payout is wrong. First, as I said, it should not be done. Second, if 
the government insists on making the payout obviously it is very 
inadequate.
<P>
	Every member of the Chamber is aware that the Crow deal 
was originally a condition of building the railway in return for 
being given a lot of land on which they have made a lot of money 
over the years. In return for the government building the railway 
itself, the railway companies promised to ship grain from the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="11365"> 11365 </A></B>
<P>
prairies to  the port. It was a very simple condition. It can almost 
be called a condition of Confederation for western Canada.
<P>
	Many farmers are very upset the government came along and 
out of the blue announced the deal was no longer in effect. The 
farmers have to pay once again for a service that was paid for 
long ago, and the railways once again get off scot free. In 
principle that is grossly unfair.
<P>
	The $1.6 billion is an arbitrary figure that means virtually 
nothing. ``Where did the government get this figure from'', 
farmers ask. The prairie pools have made their calculations. 
They said if the Crow benefit were to be eliminated and replaced 
with a fair payout to farmers the bill should be providing 
authority to pay $7 billion rather than the inadequate $1.6 
billion which will do very little to compensate the landowner or 
the shipper, no matter how we look at it.
<P>
	Another problem with this section of the legislation is the fact 
that it proposes to pay the $1.6 billion to landowners rather than 
to producers. It seems the Liberals think that compensating for 
the loss of land value, which they acknowledge will result from 
the loss of the Crow benefit, is more important than 
compensating farmers for the additional costs associated with 
increased freight rates. Paying money to landowners means that 
about 40 per cent of the payout destined for Saskatchewan will 
go to the banks and other financial institutions such as the Farm 
Credit Corporation.
<P>
	Although the Liberals say that these institutions should pass 
along the payout to those who lease land from them, there is no 
guarantee, no certainty that anything will get passed on. At the 
same time the legislation makes the payout to landowners 
including the banks tax free; but money that finds its way to 
farmers who lease their land, if the money gets to them, becomes 
taxable. Obviously this means that the Liberals seem to have 
much more sympathy for the poor banks than they do for the 
poor farmers.
<P>
	Third and last in this section, the legislation before us leaves 
virtually all the details about how this is going to be handled to 
the regulations. All the questions about who qualifies, what kind 
of land will be paid for, when the cheques will be written and 
mailed and so on will be decided in the minister's office. The 
specifics will be settled in the regulations. The decisions are left 
to the bureaucracy and there is virtually no public input through 
this Chamber and members of Parliament.
<P>
	In conclusion, there is much wrong with this idea. This 
legislation should not be supported by the members of this 
House.
<P>
	I once again appeal to the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food. I ask that all this stuff relating to the elimination of 
the Crow benefit be put off until such time as a complete 
evaluation of the consequences has been written and reviewed. 
We cannot afford to abandon the farm economy and the 
communities that depend on that economy.

	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North, Lib.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should move with speed to 
adopt legislative measures aimed at stopping the spread of hate propaganda via 
the electronic information highway while simultaneously preserving legitimate 
use of the freedom of speech and expression.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, the motion before us appeals to our core 
Canadian values: respect for dignity, respect for self-worth, and 
respect for the equality of all individuals. These values are 
pillars of Canadian society. They are the glue that holds the 
Canadian mosaic together. They are tools of harmony. We are 
therefore fiercely proud of these values. They are the foundation 
of this private member's motion.
<P>
	The motion raises two fundamental questions: What is the 
interrelationship between the information highway and the 
freedom of speech and expression? How can we as a people 
protect our core societal values without impinging on the core 
area of the freedom of expression? Before I address these 
questions Mr. Speaker, permit me to give an overview of the 
information technology revolution and what it means for 
Canadians and Canada in the world.
<P>
	Indeed, we as peoples of the earth have entered the 
information age. Information technology has reached a level of 
progress which now gives people the ability to communicate 
with others around the world via a network of computer systems 
popularly known as the information highway or superhighway. 
Although the phrase comprises many aspects, the computer 
network most nearly synonymous with it is the Internet.
<P>
	The Internet revolution started in the 1960s when the U.S. 
defence department linked its various sites. By the late 1970s 
this had expanded to universities around the globe. The real 
turning point came within the last couple of years with the 
introduction of the World Wide Web. Now the Internet 
encompasses more than 30,000 networks and 2.5 million 
computers. There are as many as 35 million users in more than 
100 countries. Today one needs only a personal computer, a 
modem 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11366"> 11366 </A></B>
<P>
and a telephone line to gain access to this amazing new 
information highway.
<P>
	Three basic services are available: electronic or e-mail, news 
groups also known as bulletin boards, and files. With these 
services anyone in the world can send a message at minimal 
cost, post and look for messages on almost an infinite range of 
topics and can also pick up information in the form of files 
which contain text, images, data, and even sounds. Indeed, 
Internet puts an incredible wealth of information at one's 
fingertips.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	It is a source of pride for Canada that some of its corporate 
citizens such as Northern Telecom, Unitel, Stentor, Videotron, 
Rogers Communications and Bell Canada, have played 
continuing leadership roles in the advent and growth of the 
critical technologies, chief of which are digital communication, 
wireless communication and fibre optic transmission. Canada 
stands to gain from these technologies which have the power to 
narrow the physical distances of our natural vast geography.
<P>
	The new technologies are utterly revolutionizing the way 
Canadians work, learn and interact with one another. It is in 
recognition of this reality and of the benefits that can ensue from 
it that the Canadian Network for the Advancement of Research, 
Industry and Education, also known as CANARIE, a seven-year 
$1.2 billion project, was launched by the government in 1993.
<P>
	The project aims to develop the communications 
infrastructure that will enhance Canadian competitiveness in all 
economic sectors and thereby result in job creation and quality 
of life for all. A nationwide high speed telecommunications 
backbone is essential to making Canada's competitiveness in the 
world economy that much more secure. Economic prosperity 
means jobs for people which can only enhance self-reliance in 
our citizens and our country and strengthen our national 
identity.
<P>
	Let me now address the two questions raised by my motion. 
What is the interrelationship between the information highway 
and the freedom of speech and expression? How can we as a 
people protect our core societal values without impinging on the 
core area of freedom of expression?
<P>
	As with any tool of economic prosperity, the information 
highway presents new social challenges. One such challenge is 
to ensure that the information highway does not become a 
highway of hate, does not become a vehicle of harm.
<P>
	The <I>Globe and Mail</I> recently reported that notorious 
Holocaust skeptic Ernst Zundel plans to spread his vicious 
campaign of lies and deceit via the Internet. Neo-Nazis 
worldwide are already using the Internet to spread their racist 
ideology. More recent examples of postings on the bulletin 
boards were threatening messages from the Ku Klux Klan. One 
has only to look at news groups such as alt.skinheads, 
alt.politics.nationalist.white, or alt.politics.white-power to  see 
the continuing and increasing presence of such hateful 
electronic words.
<P>
	Persistence of hate messages on the Internet certainly should 
invite the attention of government to move in and regulate. The 
ability to reach a wide audience via the Internet without 
regulation has resulted in the proliferation of speech which 
many Canadians find hurtful and which, if published or 
broadcast through traditional media, would likely have attracted 
prosecution.
<P>
	Let me reiterate my motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should move with speed to 
adopt legislative measures aimed at stopping the spread of hate propaganda via 
the electronic information highway while simultaneously preserving legitimate 
use of freedom of speech and expression.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	My motion calls on this House of Commons to exercise its 
will and urges the government to act and to act now. I trust all 
colleagues in the House will endorse this motion. My faith lies 
in my belief that no one member of Parliament would oppose 
halting the spread of hate propaganda, that no one member of 
Parliament would insist that there cannot be limits to freedom of 
expression. I submit that nothing, not even freedom, is absolute.
<P>
	First, what constitutes hate in our judicial system? The 
Supreme Court of Canada defines hate as:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-an emotion of an intense and extreme nature that is clearly associated with 
vilification and detestation. It is an emotion that, if exercised against any section of 
the public distinguished by religion, colour, race or ethnic origin, implies that those 
individuals are to be despised, scorned, denied respect and made subject to ill 
treatment on the basis of group affiliation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	The spread of hateful propaganda is now covered under 
section 319 of the Criminal Code. The code identifies two ways 
by which offences can occur. One is by incitement, that is, by 
communicating in a public place words likely to lead to a breach 
of the peace. The other is by wilfully promoting hatred against 
an identifiable group through the communication of statements 
other than in private conversation.
<P>
	It therefore appears to me that section 319 of the Criminal 
Code could be applied to prohibit the kind of high tech hate 
propaganda this motion seeks to eliminate.
<P>
	Certainly accessing the Internet involves communicating by 
telephone or visible means via the computer which is essential 
to the definition of communicating in the code. Certainly also 
the Internet could be considered a public place because it is a 
place to which the public has access, if not by right at least by 
invitation expressed or implied since one could buy in via a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11367"> 11367 </A></B>
<P>
service provider. Certainly also the messages on the Internet 
constitute statements since the code's definition of statements 
includes ``words recorded electronically''.
<P>
	At this juncture, may I note in this House that I do not know of 
any criminal prosecution in Canada, despite repeated postings 
of hate messages on the Internet. Neither has there been any 
prosecution under section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act 
where case law has documented the applicability to this issue.
<P>
	Why has there not been any prosecution of the electronic 
posters of this century? Is the difficulty related to the 
determination of exactly who may be held liable: the network, 
the operator, or the author of the hateful message? Is the 
difficulty related to tracing the exact authorship or the point of 
origin of the message? Is the difficulty related to authors being 
beyond the jurisdiction of Canada? Is the difficulty due to lack 
of interest on the part of local police and provincial attorneys 
general? Or does the difficulty reflect the complexity of day to 
day and moment to moment monitoring of the Internet?
<P>
	Be that as it may, the Canadian public wants to know. I 
acknowledge that the Information Highway Advisory Council 
established by the federal government last year has identified a 
regulatory role for the government to play. I quote: ``It supports 
the principle that freedom of expression be preserved on the 
information highway consistent with Canadian law''. I 
underscore the phrase consistent with Canadian law.
<P>
	This private member's motion is therefore consistent with 
that recommendation of the council. The council has further 
identified that it is in the midst of reviewing the capacity of 
existing laws to address this situation. I will certainly defer to 
the observation of the council on this particular point, 
acknowledging that I am not a member of the legal provision.
<P>
	I submit that if current hate laws do apply, we need to 
implement them. If current hate laws cannot apply, we need new 
measures. What then do I mean by ``adapt legislative measures'' 
in my motion? I have used this term in a generic sense. It implies 
passing new measures on the assumption that current hate laws, 
for whatever subtleties of legal interpretation, may not be fully 
capable of coping with the issue before us.
<P>
	I envision that new measures could include a variety of 
approaches. I will mention a few.
<P>
	Parliament, for example, could legislate a national code of 
ethics or conduct to govern Internet service providers. This 
could include a mandate for the creation of a complaint body 
that would enforce the code through a predetermined process for 
resolution.
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
	Parliament could set aside a modest budgetary item to launch 
a public education campaign to inform and advise Internet users 
and service providers as well as parents, school children, 
teachers and the public at large about proper use of the 
information highway, about the privilege it offers and the 
responsibilities we must bear.
<P>
	The government, through Parliament, could also consider 
setting aside funds to help facilitate the development of 
technologies such as adaptive software filters, which homes and 
families could use to prevent hate messages from being seen.
<P>
	To address the issue of source beyond our borders, Canada 
must ensure the obligations under international convenants and 
agreements against hate propaganda are met and that other 
signatory states are equally reminded of their obligations. If 
need be a new global treaty could be drafted, as has been 
advanced as an idea by the Solicitor General as one possible 
approach to address the issue. There could be other approaches. 
We must explore them.
<P>
	At this point I would like to return to the part of the motion 
that deals with freedom of expression. The Supreme Court of 
Canada ruling on two recent cases has identified the purpose of 
this essential guarantee, namely: ``to permit free expression to 
the end of promoting truth, political or social participation and 
self-fulfilment''.
<P>
	Mr. Justice John Sopinka of the Supreme Court of Canada, 
speaking November 1994 at the symposium on free speech and 
privacy in the information age said: ``These values lie at the core 
of the freedom of expression''. It is in this spirit that both 
section 319 of the Criminal Code and section 13 of the Canadian 
Human Rights Act have been ruled constitutional by the 
Supreme Court of Canada.
<P>
	The court has deemed that these legal provisions constitute a 
reasonable limit on the freedom of speech and expression since 
the freedom is only minimally impaired when weighed against 
the sufficient importance of the legislative objectives, namely, 
to respect the dignity, self-worth and equality of all individuals.
<P>
	The government must act quickly. Technology is advancing at 
a rapid pace but we know that the task we face is a daunting one. 
We must also acknowledge that the problem is not unique to 
Canada, nor is the search for a solution.
<P>
	The United States Congress is also now in search of one. It has 
before it the communications decency act of 1995, which would 
impose a $100,000 fine on anyone who uses computers to 
``annoy, abuse, threaten or harass''.
<P>
	The Canadian Information Highway Advisory Council, in its 
recent report, describes Canada's goal for the information 
highway this way: ``The vision is to establish a network of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11368"> 11368 </A></B>
<P>
communities around the globe in  the fullest pursuit of 
individual expression, creativity, learning opportunities and 
entrepreneurship. Its essence is to provide a medium for us to 
achieve our goals as individuals and as a nation''.
<P>
	These are noble goals. The mission can only be accomplished 
if all Canadians are made to feel welcome in cyberspace. It can 
only be accomplished if hate and intolerance are not part of the 
emerging language of the information highway.
<P>
	I urge all members to take the opportunity to speak out for the 
sake of our common future. Whether the information highway is 
to become a highway of hate or a highway of harmony rests in 
our hands.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Motion 
M-384 put forward by the hon. member for Winnipeg North 
brings to our attention one of the concerns which modern 
technology arouses among the population.
<P>
	Allow me to read this motion for the benefit of those who are 
listening to us:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should move with speed to 
adopt legislative measures aimed at stopping the spread of hate propaganda via 
the electronic Information Highway while simultaneously preserving 
legitimate use of the freedom of speech and expression.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	Before moving on to the substance of this motion, I would like 
to take a few moments to explain simply and succinctly to this 
House and the public what is this information highway which 
has been the subject of increasing media coverage lately.
<P>
	I will address not only the problem presented by Motion 
M-384 but also several related problems. Finally, I will share 
with you the results of my research on this subject and my 
conclusions. If I go beyond the 10 minutes allocated to me, I will 
then ask for the indulgence of the House in allowing me to 
conclude my remarks.
<P>
	As everyone knows, the information highway is essentially a 
figure of speech designed to help us understand a reality. Let us 
take a look at it.
<P>
	What this is is a system comprised of various means of 
electronic communication, such as telephone lines, television 
cable, optic fibres, radio and television antennas and towers, 
cellular phones and waves transmitted by satellite.
<P>
	All these technical means of communication are in common 
use today. They are the channels through which information 
travels in various forms: telephone for voice, television for 
images, fax for documents.
<P>
	These channels are very useful but also very slow. Indeed, 
when large amounts of information need to be transmitted at 
once, electronic channels get clogged up or jammed. That is why 
major communications companies  are putting into place more 
powerful systems so that large volumes of information can be 
transmitted.
<P>
	A single optic fibre can transmit as much information as 
thousands of telephone lines. Two satellites in orbit above the 
United States presently handle 200 television channels at a time. 
These new channels are called highways because they are larger 
and more powerful than traditional channels.
<P>
	Let me say a few words about the major Canadian companies 
involved in the development of these electronic highways. Bell 
and other telephone companies are grouped under the mane 
Stentor. There is also the Unitel group and the Sprint group. 
Cable operators are also represented. Vidéotron and Rogers for 
instance are very much involved in the process. Two groups, 
PowerDirectTv and ExpressVu, want to broadcast television 
programming directly via satellite. These are the expressways 
of the future.
<P>
	On the slower routes available today, there is a global network 
that already provides convenient information transmission 
through the telephone system. I am referring to Internet. The 
transmission of documents, images, voice, music, films-in 
fact, any form of communication is possible on this network.
<P>
	This network works like a telephone system. You can dial the 
number of your correspondent and write or even speak to him; 
you can have a conference with several correspondents; you can 
leave messages with an automatic answering machine, a kind of 
900 number, and the public can read these messages by dialling 
the 900 number. The numbers are referred to as addresses, and 
the services that provide access to these messages are called 
Mosaic and Netscape.
<P>
	This network has an additional feature. You can leave 
information on a bulletin board, or take part in a discussion 
group. This is a kind of 900 number where everyone can enter 
information and read information entered by others.
<P>
	We are now ready to deal with the substance of motion 
M-384. The problem referred to in the motion is that some 
Internet users leave hate literature in discussion groups, on 
bulletin boards or in any of the documents accessible through 
Netscape or Mosaic.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	Although the hon. member for Winnipeg North does not refer 
to this in his motion, there are other problems such as obscene 
literature, photographs and films. Hate literature and 
pornography are not that widespread and are in fact a rarity on 
Internet.
<P>
	There are other problems we must consider as well, because 
they are more widespread and have a greater impact, not only on 
Internet but also for instance, on DirecTv, and I am referring to 
the satellites that send us television signals from space.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11369"> 11369 </A></B>
<P>
	What we are talking about here are crossborder sales of goods 
and services in contravention of the law, tax laws among others, 
through which capital is illegally siphoned off to foreign 
countries. We are also talking about the violation of copyright, 
through which a lot of capital is drained from Canada to foreign 
countries.
<P>
	We should also stress the fact that Canada's Internet network 
is funded by the public through grants to universities, for 
example. This means that the whole population is paying for a 
service that is only really available to a very select few. 
Currently, this network is contributing to the emergence of two 
classes of citizens, those with access to information and those 
without. I am not saying that there are no solutions to these 
problems, I am sure that one will be found, I am just saying that 
these problems exist.
<P>
	Let us return now to Motion M-384 which I have researched 
thoroughly. First, I sent the following message to several 
discussion groups on Internet: I would like to have your 
comments on the government's motion regarding the 
information highway, soon to be debated in the House of 
Commons. This was followed by the text of the motion.
<P>
	Allow me to read extracts from three of the many responses I 
received.
<P>
	So, from the Computer Science University of Manitoba:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``The answer to this one is in my mind very clear and simple, 
don't''.
<P>
	From Industry Canada, probably, an employee said: ``If the 
wording of the proposed legislation said `forbidding the spread' 
rather than stopping the spread, then the full force of the law 
could be brought down on anyone who used the info highway to 
spread hate propaganda, with that the notion implying that some 
technical mechanism is needed is probably undoable anyway''.
<P>
	Finally, a lawyer answered: ``What precisely does this motion 
intend to accomplish and why is it necessary? There is already a 
section in the Criminal Code which applies to the publication of 
hate propaganda. As I read this legislation, it is capable of 
applying to information distributed on the information highway 
as well as to any other medium of communications''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, from these few reactions, it appears that the 
``internauts''-and that is how they are called-are in tune with 
our present discussions. As an ``internaut'' myself, I am happy 
to say that ``internauts'' do not hesitate to put those distributing 
hate literature in their place. Thus, the Freenet message from 
Columbus, Ohio, offering subscriptions to a magazine intended 
for, and I quote, ``all the whites in the world'' received two 
responses. They are both in English, and I will probably elicit a 
few beeps in reading them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``Get your racist [bell] out of the Internet and yes I am white''. 
Another message: ``Get the [bell] out of Canada. Take the racist 
Canadians with you to your garbage-infested world. I too am 
white''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	What I want to say is that, thanks to these electronic means, 
people who see the system is being abused literally flood the 
abuser to the point of blocking his system.
<P>
	I also did some research in the Criminal Code. Section 163 
concerns obscenity. It provides that anyone who produces, 
prints, publishes, distributes, circulates, sells, exposes to public 
view or possesses any writing, picture, model, record or other 
obscene item is committing an offence. Section 163.1 refers to 
mechanical or electronic means.
<P>
	In terms of hate propaganda, section 318 of the Criminal Code 
provides that anyone making a statement in a public place 
inciting hatred is committing an offence. Furthermore, the 
Criminal Code defines ``communication'' as words spoken, 
written or recorded by electronic or electromagnetic means.
<P>
<B>(1400) </B>
<P>
	Yes, Mr. Speaker?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I was listening attentively 
to the hon. member's remarks at the beginning of his 
intervention when he expressed the desire to go beyond the 
ten-minute maximum.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
It is nevertheless my duty to intervene since the ten minutes are 
up. Is there agreement in the House to allow the hon. member to 
conclude his remarks?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> For how long?
<P>
	<B>Mr. de Savoye:</B> Two or three minutes at most.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is the hon. member 
allowed to go on for two or three minutes?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hon. member for 
Portneuf may continue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. de Savoye: </B>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. With respect to hate 
propaganda, section 318 of the Criminal Code indicates that 
anyone who, by communicating statements in any public place, 
incites hatred is guilty of an offence. The Code defines 
``statements'' as words spoken or written or recorded and 
``public place'' as any place to which the public have access as 
of right or by invitation, express or implied.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11370"> 11370 </A></B>
<P>
	As can be seen, what makes a statement characterized by hate 
or obscenity criminal is the fact that it affects the public. What 
goes on between two individuals or in a private group of 
individuals concerns them alone. But as soon as a statement 
becomes accessible to anyone at all, it is deemed to be in a 
public place.
<P>
	Understandably the law must be implemented fairly and 
consistently. Thus, if the law prohibits certain actions, persons 
committing those actions should be dealt with in the same 
manner, whether the actions were committed in a business, in 
the street or on a telecommunications network. But we must not 
confuse the messenger with the message, with the initiator of the 
message, and think that the networks are responsible for what 
they carry, any more than we should hold the telephone 
companies or Canada Post responsible for the nature of the calls 
or mail they transmit.
<P>
	Is it possible to identify where these documents originate? 
Not only is it possible, but it is quite easy, because each 
document is preceded by the destination address and the 
originating address. Of course, some organizations offer the 
possibility of anonymity. But in the case where a criminal act 
has been committed, they can reveal the sender's address.
<P>
	Therefore, in Canada we are able to deal with these concerns. 
The problem is that most of these statements come from abroad. 
I did some research and it appears that Canada signed several 
international treaties dealing with hate propaganda: the 
Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of 
Genocide; the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights; and the International Convention on the Elimination of 
all Forms of Racial Discrimination.
<P>
	Consequently, Canada should make arrangements with the 
other signatories to ensure that each of these countries will, at 
the request of another signatory, deal with the source of hate 
propaganda, obscene items, or with the sale of goods or services, 
on its own territory, which contravene its laws or the laws of the 
country making the request.
<P>
	Although the motion tabled by the hon. member for Winnipeg 
North deals only refers to these issues indirectly, I understand 
that its object is to ensure that the law is applied consistently and 
that it is not more or less stringent when electronic means are 
used. This is why I will support motion M-384.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I congratulate my hon. colleague for Winnipeg North 
for the intent and thrust of the bill.
<P>
	The introduction of a private member's bill in the House is the 
start of a long and torturous journey before the motion may 
become law and it may be amended before it gets there. What we 
are talking about today is the general intent of what we should be 
striving to achieve, for the kind of society which we want, what 
we  find decent in our society and what we intuitively recognize 
and know as wrong and indecent.
<P>
	Earlier we had a very difficult circumstance to wrestle with, 
the infamous killer cards. About this time last year we were 
being inundated with petitions from outraged Canadians from 
coast to coast asking why we allow this kind of trash to be 
distributed in Canada. There has not been one word spoken 
about it in recent times because Canadians, by and large, are 
pretty decent people. We recognize something which has no 
value. If it has no value it will not be supported and the normal 
market forces will cause the demise of whatever should not be 
around. That is exactly what happened with killer cards. They 
have fallen from the national agenda.
<P>
<B>(1405 ) </B>
<P>
	The point is just because that happened does not give us the 
freedom to say it is a perfect world and we do not have to worry 
about people who would spread hate and spread propaganda and 
sow the seeds of dissension and hurt in our society.
<P>
	That is what this bill is all about. That is the intention. It is the 
general intention we support.
<P>
	I do not believe it is possible to legislate morality. I do not 
think it is possible to legislate good taste. I do not think it is 
possible to write legislation that will keep hate propaganda or 
distasteful things we do not like to see off the information 
highway.
<P>
	We should make our general intent very clearly understood so 
when the courts are adjudicating on a particular issue they know 
full well where Parliament stands representing the citizens of 
Canada.
<P>
	We should stand shoulder to shoulder against the pernicious 
spread of hate propaganda and things that would hurt our 
society. We also have to stand shoulder to shoulder in protecting 
freedom of speech. Here we have these two conflicting ideals. 
How do we go about rationalizing and resolving these two 
conflicting ideas?
<P>
	We have to use the whole notion of responsibility. We have to 
ensure anyone can get on to the information highway. We cannot 
prevent it in any event and so why bother trying? The 
information highway has grown from a year ago of 25,000 
networks to 70,000 networks. The growth is exponential.
<P>
	We should think of the information highway as the world's 
largest library with no librarian and no index. To try to put a 
handle on it will not work.
<P>
	We should be working toward ensuring that when our courts 
have to make a decision based on the freedom of access to 
Internet that it comes back to personal responsibility. We have to 
ensure that everyone who gets on to the information highway 
recognizes they will be held accountable and responsible for 
what they do, just as it is done in our daily lives today.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11371"> 11371 </A></B>
<P>
	All of us have and enjoy freedom of speech. It is part of of our 
culture. It is us. We also recognize that with freedom comes 
responsibility. We have the responsibility to use that freedom 
responsibly. That means I cannot go into a crowded movie 
theatre and yell ``fire''. I cannot do that with impugnity.
<P>
	I can go outside and yell ``fire'' and people would think I am a 
nut. If I did the same thing in a crowded movie theatre where my 
actions put other people at risk I would be considered a criminal.
<P>
	That is the distinction and the whole notion of personal 
responsibility. That is why it is so important this debate take 
place and that the intention of Parliament is very clear to the 
Supreme Court. The Supreme Court at least in recent years 
needs some clear direction.
<P>
	I do not think our Supreme Court gets up every morning 
wondering how to best represent the people of Canada. In my 
opinion in recent years the Supreme Court has been getting up in 
the morning wondering how to push the limits of tolerance of 
ordinary citizens to the expansion of these charter ideals until it 
drives everybody crazy.
<P>
	This debate is of extreme importance. It should not be taken 
lightly. We are not, at least I think I speak for most people in the 
House, in any way constricting the right of freedom of speech. 
We are sending a very clear message that one had better be 
prepared to accept responsibility for what one does.
<P>
	Earlier my hon. colleague and friend from Portneuf 
mentioned that the Internet is by and large self-policing. Those 
who have used Internet will notice if anybody does or says 
something outrageous on Internet it does not take very long 
before they are overwhelmed by a response from other people on 
the Internet saying it is not right.
<P>
<B>(1410 ) </B>
<P>
	I do not think we should dismiss the potential and strength of 
self-policing. For instance, when people in a bar having a beer 
together are spreading these ideas and reinforcing each other's 
ideas it is very different than putting an idea across the Internet 
and being responded to by an avalanche of people saying: 
``You're crazy, you're wrong'', just as my hon. colleague from 
Portneuf mentioned.
<P>
	We need to put this into perspective as well. There have been 
some particularly good articles written about smut on Internet. 
An article which appeared in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> recently made 
the suggestion that everybody who was on Internet was an 
oversexed teenager. That is not the way it is.
<P>
	That certainly is part of life but I defy anybody to go to a 
corner store and buy a quart of milk without passing a magazine 
rack. We do have choices in our lives and we have to make them. 
We can either stop and buy a smut magazine or we can pass them 
by. It is a personal choice and a personal responsibility.
<P>
	Using the same analogy, these magazines are now, as a result 
of pornography laws in Canada, not displayed where kids can 
get at them. They are displayed high up and many of them are 
covered. What do we do in a situation in which we have the 
expansion of the information highway through which young 
people are far more familiar with the mechanics of it than we 
are?
<P>
	This poses a fairly difficult problem. How do we go about 
keeping our children from scanning some of these very 
offensive things like Deathnet and others and still keep this 
freedom of information and freedom of speech alive? It is kind 
of like a lockout. Parents have to take responsibility for their 
children. It goes back to personal responsibility.
<P>
	I think of the people in Edmonton waging this lonely but very 
valid and important war. Their son committed suicide and their 
concern is that his suicide was as a result of depression which 
was enhanced because of his addiction to listening to CDs of 
Nirvana and death music and that sort of thing.
<P>
	It is part of our society and it is incumbent on us as members 
of Parliament to do what we can to get at root causes of problems 
and try to make the extra effort so that we keep our society the 
kind of society it is by and large today, the kind in which we want 
our children and our families to grow up.
<P>
	Again I congratulate the hon. member for Winnipeg North for 
bringing this to the House. It will be a difficult and torturous 
journey but it is certainly worth it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in support of the motion put forward by my 
colleague from Winnipeg North.
<P>
	The idea of the propagation of hatred, regardless of whether it 
is through the computerized bulletin boards and the Internet, is 
morally repugnant and has been acknowledged as such in 
Canadian law.
<P>
	Under the Criminal Code of Canada anyone who by 
communicating statements other than in private conversation 
wilfully promotes hatred against any identifiable group is guilty 
of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for up to two 
years. It is also a violation of the Canadian Human Rights Act.
<P>
	It is the government's responsibility to ensure public spaces, 
whether cyberspace or not, are free from incitements of hatred 
against any particular group in society. We must be vigilant. It is 
not enough to be against racism, we must also be willing to fight 
it.
<P>
	We cannot fall into the trap of only fighting when it is simple, 
easy and clear. Sometimes it is not easy. Questions of freedom of 
speech and freedom of academic expression enter the debate but 
we cannot hedge because we find the issues difficult. We must 
bring tolerance and societal rejection of racism to bear entirely 
in that debate.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11372"> 11372 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1415) </B>
<P>
	I quote from the Canadian Bar Association, 1984: ``Canada 
has never recognized the concept of unlimited freedom of 
expression. In order to prevent harm to others, Canadian 
legislators have imposed a number of reasonable limits on 
freedom of expression''.
<P>
	Laws in Canadian society which limit the ability of 
individuals to communicate hate are based both on international 
standards and on the the specific character of Canadian society. 
Canada has signed two international conventions which require 
us as citizens of the world to prevent the spread of hate 
propaganda.
<P>
	The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the 
Crime of Genocide was ratified by Canada in 1947 and 
reinforced by article 20 of the United Nations International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Canada ratified in 
1976.
<P>
	Further it should be noted that the Canadian Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms does not necessarily guarantee an unlimited right 
to free speech. Section 27 of the charter states: ``This Charter 
shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the preservation 
and enhancement of the multicultural heritage of Canada''. 
Thus, one may argue that hate propaganda has no place in the 
political discussion of a multicultural society.
<P>
	The information highway is currently being used by over 40 
million people. It can be an instrument of good or an instrument 
of evil. For example, information can instantly be shared 
between a university library in Germany with an online 
university in New Brunswick. It compresses time and distance 
like no other technology yet developed.
<P>
	It creates a truly global village in which we can all profit from 
the gains in knowledge in countries halfway around the world, 
simply with the click of a button. On Parliament Hill and in 
federal departments, this technology is being introduced and 
used.
<P>
	Since the government is actively promoting the use of the 
technology, we have a responsibility to guard its innocence 
because it is not only a tool used for good, but also for evil. 
Organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan and Holocaust deniers 
have news groups that propagate their messages of hate and 
intolerance toward minorities over the Internet. These messages 
are fully accessible to the public.
<P>
	I have read some of these messages and they are filled with 
racial slurs and disgusting language. Not only are they using the 
Internet as a conduit for their messages of intolerance, but I am 
advised pro-Nazi groups have recruitment programs in which 
they go to schools and encourage young people to embrace their 
ideologies.
<P>
	These postings on the Internet can easily be found by 
children, who many would agree, and as my colleague has 
mentioned, are among the most knowledgeable about this 
technology. Many use the info highway in schools and have 
greater understanding of it than their parents.
<P>
	The child can easily be one step ahead of the adult, leaving the 
parent powerless in monitoring the child's activities and open to 
these postings. These messages have a powerful impact on 
young minds. Herein lies the difficulty of parental control and 
why it is important for the government to be engaged in this 
exercise and to enact legislation that would actively prohibit 
this kind of message from being sent in the first place.
<P>
	Because of the complexity of this problem, it is important for 
the government to establish a centre of responsibility to deal not 
only with this question, but with questions of trade, copyright 
issues and education, either by establishing a minister for this 
technology or designating responsibility to an existing 
department, or beyond that, it should be done by the Minister of 
Industry.
<P>
	We could follow the model of New Brunswick, where there is 
already a secretary of state responsible for the information 
highway. There has been considerable debate in my own 
constituency of Fredericton-York-Sunbury around the 
propagation of hatred on the Internet. It is my intention to strike 
a committee that would make recommendations through me 
both to the Minister of Industry and his advisory committee and 
to Parliament on how some of these issues should be tackled. It 
is a new problem and there is a need for broad input.
<P>
	However, there must be a balance. We cannot let our efforts 
here lead to incidents of excessive restrictions on speech. It is an 
important right that cannot be ignored. There are laws against 
the enticement of hatred against certain groups and they also 
must be upheld, improved and their values applied to new 
realities.
<P>
	As a government we must promote the truth. We must also be 
aware of those who are promoting another agenda. It is my 
personal belief that within all of us is the instinct for tolerance, 
fairness and compassion. It is only out of fear, misinformation 
and insecurity that we turn to emotions that are less generous.
<P>
	This is a global problem. If Canada were to adopt legislation 
that would screen out certain messages, there is nothing 
stopping someone from simply clicking to another country and 
signing on from there. They would have access to everything. 
That is why we need to work with other nations in formulating 
guidelines for the information superhighway. The Group of 
Seven meeting this summer in Halifax would be an ideal event at 
which to engage our fellow member countries in the discussion.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	If we could agree on a vision for the future of this technology, 
it would be a great step forward. We are a fair-minded, 
resourceful and enlightened population and our resolve should 
not be diminished by the magnitude of the task. I am confident 
that a solution will be found which will ensure that everyone, 
regard-
<P>

<B><A NAME="11373"> 11373 </A></B>
<P>
less of ethnicity or lifestyle choice, will be able to use the 
electronic highway free from fear of harassment and verbal 
abuse.
<P>
	I am pleased to second the motion of the hon. member for 
Winnipeg North. I call on all members to say no to the 
propagation of hatred, regardless of the medium.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a great pleasure for me to support the bill of my 
friend and colleague from across the way on this very important 
and much ignored aspect of the late 20th century.
<P>
	Freedom of speech is something which we in our country have 
held in the highest regard. It is a pillar of a truly democratic 
society and, as such, sets us apart from the restrictive, abusive 
and undemocratic societies that we have seen about us in the 
past, such as those in Nazi Germany and in China. We have seen 
repression where freedom of speech has not been recognized. In 
fact, not having freedom of speech has enabled the few to stifle 
the many.
<P>
	However, like most rules we have in this world they are 
inviolable. They too are subject to perversions, but when 
common sense and logic are applied to them they bear no 
resemblance whatsoever to what was the intended rule. Freedom 
of speech is no different.
<P>
	We live in a world today which our forefathers could not have 
imagined and which those individuals who constructed the 
aspects of freedom of speech as being a pillar of democracy 
could not have imagined. They could not have thought or 
dreamed of the challenges which we face today. As such, they 
could not imagine the ways in which people could use free 
speech as a shield or as protection to blatantly incite hatred, 
violence and prejudice against other individuals. They could not 
have imagined this because they could not have imagined 
something like Internet.
<P>
	I will give the House some examples of what has occurred on 
Internet recently. In my region of Vancouver Island, in the city 
of Victoria, something called a deathnet has occurred. 
Specifically, it caters to teenagers and children. It is a program 
on how to commit suicide. It tells them how to do it with plastic 
bags, glue, knives, ropes and chemicals.
<P>
	We have lauded the aspects of freedom of speech and freedom 
of choice. As adults we presumably have the experience and the 
knowledge to make informed choices. However, where this falls 
apart is when we are dealing with children. All of us in the House 
will recognize that one of the aspects of children is that they do 
not have the maturity, the knowledge and the experience to make 
informed choices. Where the Internet differs from the magazine 
racks in our local corner stores is that in the corner store children 
do not have a choice to make because the material is too high. 
They are also monitored by the individuals who work in the 
stores. That is not so with Internet.
<P>
	Internet is basically a free-for-all. One of the sectors of our 
society that is the most literate in computers is youth. Many 
youths are more facile with computers than many individuals in 
the House, myself in particular.
<P>
	We also have hate mongering by the KKK and other groups 
whose main intent has been to put forth abusive, hateful, spiteful 
information on the deathnet for no good cause whatsoever.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	This cannot continue. That is why my colleague who is a 
physician and a very concerned person has put forward this 
initiative. He has experience in these matters as a pediatrician. 
He knows full well the dangers of allowing very impressionable 
children to be subjected to this type of information. As I have 
said before, adults are a different matter altogether. They have 
choice but that does not necessarily apply to children.
<P>
	There are laws which apply to the wire media, the print media. 
There are rules and regulations which apply to hate mongering, 
child pornography and such. There is no logical reason that 
these reasonable rules cannot also be applied to the Internet. 
There have been concerns that no, it is not possible to do this 
because there are too many access points and there are too many 
people logged on.
<P>
	This country has proven to be a world leader in so many areas. 
We can continue to do so by taking that leadership role on the 
Internet. We can show the world we are not prepared to have hate 
mongering within our country.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that the United States Congress and 
Senate also have a bill relating to the proliferation of this type of 
information on the Internet. It is a worthwhile endeavour. 
Perhaps through my colleague's initiative we as a country can 
work with our neighbours to the south to push for this worthy 
cause.
<P>
	Just because it is difficult does not mean to say it is 
impossible. A few other concerns exist on the Internet. I am sure 
they will rise in the course of the prolonged discussions which 
will come out of this initiative. They also involve personal 
privacy and security of information.
<P>
	Many of us in this House are aware that a number of recent 
cases have come up of people's security and personal 
information which are protected under the law but violated 
through the Internet. Cyberspace is a free for all. Freedoms are 
good but when they are abused against the common good, it is 
intolerable and unacceptable to Canadian society.
<P>
	I will close by giving my wholehearted support to my 
colleague for this initiative. It is worthwhile. We should not buy 
the argument that freedom of speech is something that is 
inviolable. Like all rules, it can be subject to exceptions.
<P>

	The main reason for doing this is not so much for the adults 
because of the freedoms we have but primarily for the children. 
It is impossible, no matter how hard we try, to prevent children 
from logging on and seeing the stuff.
<P>
	For their betterment and for the betterment of Canadian 
society, I hope this House will take it upon itself to support the 
initiative of my colleague.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. 
Pursuant to Standing Order 93, the order is dropped to the 
bottom of the order of precedence on the Order Paper.
<P>
	It being 2.30 p.m., this House stands adjourned until Monday 
next at 11 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24.
<P>
