	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I call upon all Canadians to recognize and congratulate the 
900 million people of India for completing what is the largest 
democratic voting exercise in the history of our world.
<P>
	As a Canadian MP I want to restate the support of Canadians for 
the growth and evolution of the democratic electoral process in all 
countries. We believe that this is the best way to develop our 
political futures.
<P>
	During the Indian election campaign there were some terrorist 
incidents but the people have prevailed. I condemn those who 
would offer us bombs and bullets instead of voting ballots and 
those responsible for the murders and maiming that occurred in

	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we seem to spend a lot of time in this House arguing and 
disagreeing about legislation. Later on today I will be introducing a 
bill to strengthen property rights  in federal law. Debate on this bill 
should find more agreement than disagreement between Liberals 
and Reformers.
<P>
	Property rights is an issue which transcends partisan politics. 
Property rights were first protected in Canada by John Diefenbaker 
with the passage of the Canadian bill of rights. Both Pierre Elliott 
Trudeau and our current Prime Minister argued forcefully without 
success to have property rights included in the charter of rights and 
freedoms. As it now stands there is very little protection of a 
person's right to own, use and enjoy property.
<P>
	My bill strengthens property rights in the Canadian bill of rights 
and therefore only applies to the activities and laws passed by the 
federal government. My bill does not intrude into areas of 
provincial jurisdiction and avoids the concerns raised by some 
provinces and interest groups that argued against including 
property rights in the charter of rights and freedoms.
<P>
	This bill should unite us rather than divide us when it comes 
before the House for debate.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Beauce, Ind.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the reform 
proposed in the federal budget relating to the old age pension has 
upset the plans of those who have been saving for years for their 
retirement.
<P>
	As well, some of the provincial governments are not being too 
kind to their seniors. The ones feeling the effects are not the rich 
but the middle class, who are finding the substantial sum of $1,000 
to $5,000 lopped off their incomes, a considerable blow to their 
standard of living. The ones who will pay for this reform are not the 
privileged members of society, but the people who have planned 
ahead for their retirement.
<P>
	Can the government make adjustments so as to encourage people 
to save, rather than discouraging them? Couples who have made 
preparations for retirement, who have put money aside, particularly 
in RRSPs, instead of spending it, would lose their pension, while 
others with the same income would not.
<P>
	I do, however, approve of the more well off not receiving the 
pension anymore, since they have to pay back what they have 
received when they file their income tax return.

<P>
	This centre would employ some 650 people processing toll free

while we believe and make that statement, some do not enjoy a 
highly prized Canadian freedom, that is the freedom to work, to 
produce goods and to sell those goods in a free open market.
<P>
	Canadian grain farmers are forbidden their maximum benefit 
because they must market through a government appointed,

choose where, when and how their product will be sold nor choose

of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	In the light of very strong reaction by all political commentators 
and by organizations like the Canadian Jewish Congress, for 
example, who reacted strongly to the minister's remarks, and now 
that he has had the time to reread what his minister said, will the

remarks-yes, or no? We await a reply.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr.

all Canadians consider he ought, does the Prime Minister realize 
that his entire government is associated with the unacceptable and 
discriminatory remarks of the Minister of Human Resources 
Development?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when I see members of the Bloc Quebecois getting upset 
over words considered unacceptable, I hope they in turn will ask 
their mother house to apologize for having said a few weeks ago 
that Canada was a prison. The ultimate proof that Canada is not a 
prison 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3125"> 3125 </A></B>

lies in the fact that a member who came here as an immigrant and a  
refugee can support their party in Canada. This is a far cry from a 
prison, it is freedom at its finest.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, you will understand I am surprised to find the Prime 
Minister indignant over the opposition's distress when a new 
Canadian member is told to go and find another country.
<P>
	The opposition's indignation, I remind the Prime Minister, is 
echoed unanimously by all commentators in Quebec and 
throughout Canada.
<P>
	The very day of a momentous event in the history of Canada's 
Parliament and with this morning's praise of the quality of 
democracy and the freedom of expression in Canada, how can the 
Prime minister let one of his ministers tarnish, by his unspeakable 
remarks, the image of all those who sit or have sat in this 
Parliament?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if we had to ask the members of the Bloc Quebecois and 
of the Parti Quebecois in Quebec City to apologize each time they 
want to tarnish Canada's reputation, perhaps they could ask 
Minister Landry to withdraw his description of Canada as being 
``more authoritarian, intolerant and close-minded than the former 
totalitarian communist governments''.
<P>
	We need no lessons from anyone. The member is entitled to 
work for the separatist party; we have nothing against that. He is 
entitled. The minister said he does not agree with what the member 
is doing. Disagreement is permitted in this House.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	He exercised the right to speak. The member expresses his point 
of view. Another member of this House, an Acadian, who belongs

entitled to express a point of view different from that of the 
member who spoke before him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, does the Prime Minister realize that, by accepting and 
even supporting the comments of his minister, he is sending 
immigrants and Canadians by adoption a message unworthy of this 
Parliament?
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister realize that he is telling these men and 
women that they do not have the same rights as other Canadians, 
that freedom of political expression does not exist for them, unless 
they happen to think like him and his minister?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, freedom of expression exists in this House. I could make a 
list of completely unacceptable statements that attack the 
fundamental values of this nation which have been made by 
members on the other side day after day.
<P>
	For a member who is an Acadian to get up and tell another 
member that he is a refugee who is trying to destroy the country 
which gave him the freedom that he did not have in the country he 
is from is acceptable in a democracy. Mr. Speaker, you felt it was 
part of fair debate. A member of Parliament has the right to be a 
separatist, but we have the right to combat the separatists in 
Canada.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the Prime Minister feels that some comments made by 
Bloc Quebecois members are unacceptable, it is his duty to 
condemn them. Let him do it and let him do it when it is 
appropriate to do so.
<P>
	When the Prime Minister heard the comments made by members 
of the Reform Party, he took exception, but the Reform Party leader 
did take action. The Prime Minister is right when he says 
federalists can oppose separatists, but not at any price, not at the 
expense of dignity and democracy.
<P>
	I call on the Prime Minister's common sense. Will he demand 
his minister's resignation, or will he support the unsupportable?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it has 
been well documented that the defence minister gave his campaign 
pals over $150,000 in questionable public contracts out of his 
ministerial budget. Stephanos Karabekos, one of his campaigners, 
received $100,000 to help soothe feelings in the Greek community 
in the minister's Don Valley East riding.
<P>
	Instead of coming clean with Canadians, the minister and the 
Prime Minister have chosen to defend this patronage saying that it 
was really good value for the money. It was good value for his 
money, but the Canadian taxpayers are paying the bill.
<P>

dollars in public contracts specifically and explicitly to his former 
campaign workers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am glad at my 
first opportunity to be back in the country to deal with these very 
troubling issues which have reflected on my reputation.
<P>
	Yesterday the President of the Treasury Board outlined the 
general response to this question. As members of the House of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3126"> 3126 </A></B>
<P>
Commons we have budgets to  hire staff. We hire them either as full 
time employees or for project work. That goes for the members of 
the Reform Party as well as other parties. Similarly ministers have 
budgets that can be used for project work or for exempt staff.
<P>
	In the case of the arrangements that were referred to in the 
House, as the President of Treasury Board has stated, those 
arrangements were made within Treasury Board guidelines.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
easy to talk about Treasury Board guidelines, but I want to talk 
specifically about project work. A ministerial budget is one thing, a 
member of Parliament's budget is another.
<P>
<B>(1425 )</B>
<P>
	The Canadian public that is paying the bill for this wants to know 
why in the world this soothing of the Greek community is always 
happening in his riding. Surely there are enough communities 
across the country from which he can hire people to do the work for 
him out of his ministerial budget.
<P>
	It seems ironic that every time a name comes up it is someone 
specifically from his constituency. The Liberals railed against this 
when the Mulroney government was in power. Now they are saying 
that they are proud of it, that everything is okay.
<P>
	Will the defence minister admit that he is guilty of the same 
Mulroney-like patronage that he and his colleagues criticized while 
in opposition? Will he repay the $150,000 spent on these unethical 
contracts?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we had better 
get our facts straight.
<P>
	The hon. member accused me of unethical behaviour. I hope she 
withdraws that before I give the answer to the question.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate your rulings on these things, not those of the minister.
<P>
	I grant what we are talking about here is a tender issue for the 
minister. It is so tender that every contract more than $30,000 is 
literally supposed to go out to tender and this has not happened.
<P>
	Stephanos Karabekos has received more than three contracts, 
every one of which should have gone out to tender. When it is split 
up, then it looks okay because it is under $30,000.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you can call that unethical, I can call it unethical, I 
know the Canadian public thinks it is unethical. It is deplorable. 
Why has the minister allowed this contract splitting to take place? 
Why has he allowed this to become such a tender issue?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is not a tender 
issue. It is a factual issue.
<P>
	The hon. member says this is unethical. I am surprised that 
language is allowed to stay, but I obviously respect your ruling on 
that, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	What she is saying by extension is that the officials in my 
department, the assistant deputy minister of finance who said that 
these contracts were within the guidelines, the Treasury Board 
officials who said that these arrangements were within guidelines, 
are also unethical.
<P>
	It seems that when the Reform Party casts its net, it casts it

<P>
	The federal government announced that it was cutting off its 
annual $7.2 million contribution to the tokamak project. By 
withdrawing from this project, the government is adding to the 
huge research and development deficit and jeopardizing the

Mr. Speaker, as I believe I have made clear in the House on a

government, some very difficult choices had to be made. It is not 
possible for the government to continue to do everything it had

Veterans Affairs, except to say that what the hon. member said is 
absolutely and totally false.

leader how he hires and retains the services of people. Does he have 
people just as full time employees or does he have people who are 
hired on project work.
<P>
	As to the propriety of this, the fact is that these particular 
arrangements are within Treasury Board guidelines. It was stated 
by the President of the Treasury Board, gone over by the various

broken the guidelines. Canadians can see that there is no value for

	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday the 
Minister of Justice acknowledged that a senior official of his 
department inappropriately tried to influence a chief judge of the 
Federal Court. What the minister did not reveal was that the 
meeting between his assistant deputy minister, Ted Thompson, and 
the chief justice took place on March 1.
<P>
	Who within his department authorized the meeting and why has 
it taken him three months to acknowledge and respond to this 
obvious violation of judicial independence?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the meeting was held, according to 
the chief justice, at the request of the chief justice. The meeting 
was for the purpose initially of discussing concerns with the pace 
of litigation generally in the Federal Court.
<P>
	As I said yesterday, we have also acknowledged that it was 
inappropriate for the meeting to discuss specific cases without 
notice being given to counsel in those cases and an opportunity for 
those counsel to participate.
<P>
	In specific response to the point raised by the hon. member about 
the timing, I can tell him that it was Mr. Ted Thompson who 
brought to the attention of the department the fact that the meeting 
had taken place. He brought the correspondence to the attention of 
the department. We then brought that to the attention of counsel in 
those cases.
<P>
	In the weeks since March 1 our focus has been on the litigation. 
Lawyers for the parties involved in the three litigation cases have 
brought a motion, to which we have responded. We have been in 
the courtroom resisting their application for stay.
<P>
	At this point it is appropriate for me to make a statement. I 
propose to do that. I will address in that statement the response, 
internally, of the department to these circumstances.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Chief Justice 
Isaac of the Federal Court, in my opinion, should never have met 
with Mr. Thompson to discuss this matter in the first place.
<P>
	In 1990 the current Tory leader resigned as minister of fitness 
and amateur sport after it was revealed he had called a judge. That 
particular judge was not implicated in that case because he had the 
integrity to hang up on the minister.
<P>
<B>(1440 )</B>
<P>
	I ask the Minister of Justice if he has laid a complaint before the 
Canadian Judicial Council to have Chief Justice Isaac's 
participation in this matter dealt with.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> No, Mr. Speaker. Our focus has been on the 
litigation and now internally with respect to the appropriate 
response to Ted Thompson's conduct.
<P>
	The instances to which the hon. member has referred involved 
either ministers or members of government communicating with 
judges directly, and that is not what happened in this case.
<P>
	What happened in this case is an instance of a long serving and 
excellent lawyer with the department who at the request of the 
chief justice participated in a meeting which eventually turned to 
subjects that were more appropriately dealt with on notice to 
counsel involved in those cases and with their involvement.
<P>
	We acknowledge that was inappropriate. Our focus has been on 
resisting motions to stay those cases in the court and now on how to 
deal with Mr. Ted Thompson internally in the department. That has 
been the focus of our attention.

will respect our international commitments concerning drug 
patents.
<P>
	I believe that even the hon. member asking the question wishes 
us to respect the 20 year principle, that is the lifetime of a drug 
patent. The question with the link regulations is to ensure that, as 
soon as a patent runs out, the generic companies have the 
opportunity to manufacture the product.
<P>
	This is the reason the regulations are a means of balancing the 
life of a patent and access to an expired patent. Moreover, we are

	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, for a month now 
Reform has urged the government to reverse the current policy on 
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and grant immediate 
diplomatic recognition to this country.
<P>
	I ask the Minister of Foreign Affairs if he is now willing to grant 
diplomatic recognition.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as the hon. member knows, about three or four weeks ago 
I was in the Balkans area and we had a number of discussions. We 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3132"> 3132 </A></B>
<P>
are holding similar discussions in Canada with affected groups. I 
hope to be making some decision on that matter within the next 
month or so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the decision to 
grant diplomatic recognition to the former Yugoslav Republic is 
long overdue.
<P>
	In 1995 Greece recognized its independence and yet last month 
the Minister of Foreign Affairs was still writing letters saying 
Canada could not recognize it because of its dispute with Greece. It 
seems the minister does not really know what is happening in this 
case.
<P>
	The UN also recognized this country. Still the government 
delays and evades the issue. I would like the minister to give me 
one reason why Canada cannot now recognize and give diplomatic 
recognition to this country.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member knows there were some very major 
complications. We are dealing with two very important allies in the 
NATO system. It had to do with names of countries and the nature 
of the recognition that would be taking place.
<P>
	I just told the hon. member we are not ignoring it, we are not 
delaying it. We are actively pursuing it. We have been talking to the 
parties involved. We will be looking at the options we have. I just 
told the hon. member we will be making a decision within the next 
month. I think that shows quick and ready action.

	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is to the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Canadians are quite amazed that the federal government has 
stood by and allowed Hollinger Incorporated to acquire over 53 per 
cent of all Canadian newspapers.
<P>
	The 1981 Kent commission recommended that no one company 
should control more than 20 per cent of Canadian circulation, as it 
threatens freedom and democracy. Yet Hollinger now controls over 
42 per cent. By any definition this is an alarming development.
<P>
	My question to the Prime Minister is what further threats to 
freedom and democracy will there have to be before the 
government takes action to ensure competition, freedom of speech 
and the public's right to know?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a little hard to follow the premise of the member's 
question and connect it to the conclusion he has drawn.
<P>
	When freedom of speech prevails in Canada in very clear and 
legal ways he criticizes the ownership of newspapers at a time 
when we are surrounded not only by newspapers but by other 
media and means of exchanging information.
<P>
<B>(1500 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> What are you going to do about it?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manley:</B> The member for Winnipeg Transcona seems to 
think he has lost his voice in this House, largely because they did 
not elect enough members in the last election. That is why he does 
not get his chance to make those comments.
<P>
	The competition law deals with the economic impact of 
acquisitions, such as that which is proposed by Hollinger, that will 
be reviewed by the director of investigations and research as to 
whether there are anti-competitive reasons that the director should 
intervene in the transaction. He has done that. He has concluded 
that is not the case. But that does not deal with future behaviour. He 
will continue to monitor the behaviour as a result of this 
acquisition. If it is anti-competitive, he will act.

	<B>Mr. Bernie Collins (Souris-Moose Mountain, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food.
<P>
	In the last two budgets the government has implemented big 
changes to Canadian agriculture, including the reduction or 
elimination of previous subsidy programs. The government has 
also committed itself to adaptation measures to ease the process 
away from subsidization.
<P>
	What is the government going to implement to commit itself to 
help farmers adapt to the new reality?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is correct to say 
that for fiscal, trade, diversification, innovation and efficiency 
reasons a number of former subsidy programs have been brought to 
an end. In every case appropriate transitional measures or gradual 
phase out measures or other adaptation measures have been put in 
place to smooth the process of transition equitably all across the 
country.
<P>
	The hon. gentleman comes from Saskatchewan and might refer 
specifically to the end of the WGTA subsidy. Part of the adaptation 
in that case is the WGTA adaptation fund with $300 million over 
the next couple of years to help smooth out the process of changing 
the freight pooling system, to assist the alfalfa dehydration and 
compressed hay industries and also to help enhance rural 
infrastructure like rural roads which are of critical importance in 
the prairie region.

<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, in the last short while one of our 
former parliamentarians has passed away. I refer to the former 
member for Burlington, Mr. Bill Kempling. His wife is with us 
today.
<P>
	We are going to have tributes. I will recognize the hon. member 
for Sherbrooke, the leader of the Conservative Party.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THELATEWILLIAMKEMPLING">THE LATE WILLIAM KEMPLING</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
behalf of my colleagues in the Senate and the hon. member for 
Saint John, as well as a colleague who worked with him, the hon. 
member for Beauce, I rise to pay tribute to Hon. William 
Kempling, an esteemed parliamentarian and a member of the 
Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.
<P>
	Bill Kempling, as we knew him, was an outstanding 
parliamentarian. He was an exceptional Canadian and a great man.
<P>
	As I rise today I cannot help but think that the timing of our 
tribute could not have been better planned. This is the day the 
House has chosen to commemorate the memory of the men and 
women who have served in this place from its very beginning in 
1867 to this day. If we had to choose one person, one single 
outstanding example of a member who had served his country, we 
could not have chosen a better example, a better person than Mr. 
Bill Kempling.
<P>
	Mr. Kempling was tested early on in his life. This is not known 
by a number of people. Very early on in his life he was affected by 
polio, as were a number of Canadians of his generation. This was a 
great challenge for him.
<P>
	I learned last week at the religious service in his honour that he 
had come to know his present wife Muriel, who is honouring us 
with her presence in the gallery today, by being introduced by a 
young boy on the street next to his who equally was suffering from 
polio. I will refer to this later. However, this would be, as we can 
imagine, one of the first great tests of this young man's life.
<P>
	At the age of 19, Mr. Kempling went on to serve as a flight 
lieutenant in World War II with the Royal Canadian Air Force. He 
served in Burma in an exceptional capacity. He was part of a group 
of soldiers who were flown behind enemy lines to raid the 
installations of the enemy. He flew on these exceptional and very 
dangerous missions.
<P>
	He was among a group of soldiers who not only fulfilled the 
mandate they were given, but also had a great deal of difficulty 
surviving. One of these encounters resulted in a six month trek 
through jungles and across mountains before he would finally 
reach peaceful territory and rejoin forces with the allies. This 
exceptional and outstanding service in Burma was only a prelude to 
what he would offer to Canadians in his later life.
<P>
	In 1964 Mr. Kempling founded a business in Hamilton, Ontario. 
As a businessman he was also concerned about government, the 
way it operated and its accountability. He went on to found a truck 
body equipment association to lobby government so that he could 
bring about some changes. As his experience increased, so did his 
dealings with government.
<P>
	Mr. Kempling had a fervent desire to represent the interests of 
small business and of the constituents of Burlington. In 1972 he 
successfully ran as a Progressive Conservative candidate. As a 
parliamentarian he spent over two decades in the House of 
Commons. He was considered by many as a father figure in this 
House.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3134"> 3134 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1510 )</B>
<P>
	I first ran into Bill Kempling in 1984 as a member of the 
Canada-U.S. Interparliamentary Association. I have a very fond 
memory of Mr. Kempling carrying the brief on steel and steel 
issues at a meeting of this association. In my first experiences, I 
was faced with exceptional parliamentarians from both countries, 
on the American side very experienced congressmen and senators. 
I remember being very, very proud of the performance, of the 
arguments and of the force of knowledge Bill Kempling brought to 
this file as he defended the interests of Canada's steel industry with 
our American counterparts. In fact I would venture today that Bill 
Kempling, with regard to the steel caucus that he formed in this 
House, has not been replaced since 1993.
<P>
	His lengthy parliamentary service included chief government 
whip in 1979 and the chief opposition whip from 1980 to 1983. He 
was appointed deputy finance critic in 1983. He also served as 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Public Works and 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Employment and 
Immigration. He served as Parliamentary Secretary to the President 
of Treasury Board until his retirement in 1993.
<P>
	Just recently I had the pleasure of meeting with Bill. He reflected 
upon how satisfied and proud he was with the more than 20 years 
he had dedicated to serving the people of Canada. His integrity, 
generosity and honesty are benchmarks that Canadians will strive 
to uphold. As a fellow parliamentarian and an upstanding Canadian 
citizen, Mr. Kempling was a true friend and also true to his word in 
his forthrightness.
<P>
	He will be missed by a number of us but we are honoured today 
by the presence of his wife Muriel who was, in every true sense of 
the word, his partner through his political career. Everywhere Bill 
went Muriel would accompany him serving the people of 
Burlington and the people of Canada. I also want to recognize the 
service of his sons Angus and Bruce and his daughter Jane who also 
made a great contribution to his public life.
<P>
	In my opening remarks I referred to Bill's bout with polio and 
what a challenge that must have been for this young boy. At his 
funeral service his brother-in-law told a story of how Bill had been 
challenged by his parents to walk to the end of their backyard 
where there were animals. They hoped that this young boy, who 
they were told may never walk again, could learn how to walk and 
survive this bout with polio. We can all imagine the young man 
walking a step and falling, getting up and walking another step and 
falling and getting up and walking, until the day he reached his 
objective and his destination.
<P>
	There was in that episode of his life a great metaphor for all of 
our lives. Bill Kempling represented the best that this House of 
Commons has to offer. In the end, I think he offers the best that 
Canada has to offer to the world.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
join in the tribute that was so eloquently given by the member for 
Sherbrooke, the leader of the Conservative Party, for our old friend 
and colleague, Bill Kempling.
<P>
	Bill served in this House for 21 years. I was privileged to serve 
with him for 10 of those years. He was chief government whip from 
1980 to 1983. I really got to know him well because at that time we 
were going through the very emotional debates on the Constitution. 
Mr. Speaker, I know you remember them as well. They were 
difficult, they were emotional, they were very partisan but Bill 
Kempling, despite being partisan in the Chamber, as most of us are 
when we feel very strongly about issues, was the perfect gentleman 
and a friendly colleague in the lobby.
<P>
	Bill was well prepared for the rough and tumble world of politics 
because he enjoyed a successful career as a businessman. Other 
than overcoming the physical challenge that has been mentioned, 
the real test for him came as a member of the Royal Canadian Air 
Force during the second world war.
<P>
	Bill Kempling's distinguished wartime career is one that should 
be remembered. He joined the RCAF in 1941 at the age of 20 and 
went on to fly in virtually every theatre of war, from England and 
northwest Europe to the Mediterranean and southeast Asia. He 
showed enormous courage and determination in the face of danger.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	On one occasion, he took part in a daring mission in which allied 
forces landed behind enemy lines in Burma to blow up bridges and 
railways. It took six months before the men returned to India and 
freedom. The region's dense jungle and rugged mountains were 
formidable obstacles, but that did not mean much to Bill Kempling 
and his determination.
<P>
	The campaign in southeast Asia was tough by any standard. Mr. 
Kempling was one of the many Canadians who had to face not only 
a battle-hardened enemy but also the natural elements that showed 
little mercy. The climate was harsh and the living conditions were 
often appalling but the Canadians persevered.
<P>
	Bill left the air force in 1945, having achieved the very 
distinguished rank of flight lieutenant.
<P>
	Bill Kempling served his country with pride and commitment in 
the second world war. He overcame numerous challenges and 
hardships and for nearly four years performed this duty whenever 
he was called on. Because of men and women like Bill Kempling, 
Canada and the Royal Canadian Air Force made an important 
contribution to allied victory in the second world war. His wartime 
record reflects the skill and bravery of all RCAF personnel during 
that long and bitter conflict.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3135"> 3135 </A></B>
<P>
	Bill Kempling knew the meaning of sacrifice. He risked his life, 
like thousands of others, so that future generations could live in 
peace and freedom. Not content to serve his country once in the 
field of war, he offered himself for public life.
<P>
	For many in public life, we often feel that it is war because it is a 
fight for ideals, for values and for the essence of being Canadian. It 
is our perspective in being a Canadian. Bill Kempling certainly had 
his views on what Canada meant.
<P>
	He was strongly partisan. He had a love for this country. He was 
an active small businessman. He was a man who was 
knowledgeable about economic policy, but I remember him as a 
man with a hearty laugh that could enjoy some fun once we left the 
intense confines of the Chamber.
<P>
	On behalf of the Prime Minister and the members of my party, I 
would like to offer my condolences to Muriel and to the other 
members of his family along with his friends at this difficult time. 
All members of the House share in their sorrow.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on my own 
behalf and on behalf of my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois, I 
would like to say a few words in memory of Bill Kempling, the 
former Conservative member for the riding of Burlington, Ontario.
<P>
	Mr. Kempling was already an experienced parliamentarian when 
I met him in 1984. He first became a member of the House of 
Commons in 1972 and was re-elected without interruption until 
1993, when he took well deserved retirement.
<P>
	He was the chief whip of the government under the Right Hon. 
Joe Clark, who was Prime Minister at the time. He was also a 
parliamentary secretary under the Right Hon. Brian Mulroney.
<P>
	Despite this distinguished career in politics, we would be remiss 
in not mentioning his achievements in the Royal Air Force in 
southeast Asia during the World War II, where he was a Japanese 
prisoner of war. Despite this event, which marked his life, he was 
never bitter toward his former enemies.
<P>
	Bill Kempling told us that one Japanese died in his arms during 
the war. He said he gathered up some of the man's personal effects 
thinking that one day, perhaps, he could return them to his family. 
He told us that he had had the opportunity as a parliamentarian to 
travel to Japan and had managed to reach the young man's family. 
He gave them the young man's effects personally. He was very 
moved by this.
<P>
	He always encouraged young people to join and take part in the 
world of politics. He was also an inveterate collector of old books, 
which he adored and he liked to read in his leisure time.
<P>
	I offer my sincere condolences and those of the Bloc Quebecois 
to his family, his friends and his former colleagues.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too 
rise for a few moments on behalf of my caucus to pay tribute to the 
memory of the late Bill Kempling. It is appropriate that today we 
are honouring former parliamentarians because he was one of 
them.
<P>
	Mr. Kempling's military accomplishments and his 
accomplishments here in the House of Commons as parliamentary 
secretary and government whip have already been mentioned.
<P>
	One young man, who is now working for our caucus, worked for 
Bill Kempling some years ago in the House. He has this memory of 
Bill: ``The only thing he told me when he hired me was `this is hard 
ball we are playing here and don't forget it'''. I believe that is good 
advice for anybody who comes here as an MP or works on the Hill.
<P>
	Bill Kempling was the Conservative whip who refused to come 
down the aisle, causing the famous 14-day bell ringing incident. 
The Table is nodding. I am sure they remember that all too well. 
Charles Turner, the government whip at the time, was reported to 
have camped out in the government lobby. He had his pillow and 
blanket there waiting for Bill to come to the House. He eventually 
did show up brandishing his whip. Those are just some really 
personal memories.
<P>
	It was mentioned earlier that he won six elections. It is just 
incredible that anyone would sit in this House for that length of 
time.
<P>
	I want to quote the Toronto <I>Star</I> of May 2, 1993 when Bill 
Kempling announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He 
said: ``I have so many other things in my life and I am going to do 
them with all the strength and vigour that I have''. He was 72 at the 
time.
<P>
	It is one thing to run in six elections and win them but it is 
another thing to know when to go out gracefully. He did that in 
May 1993. I am sure his family members were very grateful when 
he retired from politics because they had two and a half years to 
enjoy his company. I am sure those are memories they will treasure 
forever.
<P>
	I extend our sympathy to his family, Mrs. Muriel Kempling, her 
children and grandchildren. I believe she is here today in the 
gallery. We want to pay tribute and thank her and her family for the 
sacrifice they gave. God bless you.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
behalf of the NDP, I would like to join with other members of the 
House who have already paid tribute to the Bill Kempling. I served 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3136"> 3136 </A></B>
<P>
in the House with Mr. Kempling for 14 of the 21 years that he was 
here. I  certainly have very vivid memories of Bill in the House, 
particularly as the whip. I see him in my mind's eye proceeding to 
the Table.
<P>
	I also remember the time, as the member for Beaver River just 
mentioned, when Bill did not come in and we were subjected to 16 
days, I believe, of bell ringing.
<P>
	I remember Bill as a partisan member of Parliament. He could be 
very direct and even harsh. He was impatient with things that he 
did not agree with. However, like the minister of defence said, he 
also had the ability to put all that aside and to be a good colleague 
all at the same time outside of the Chamber and in various other 
joint pursuits that members of Parliament are called on to 
participate in.
<P>
	This may say something about the humility of Mr. Kempling, but 
I knew nothing of the struggle he had with polio in his early life. He 
was not the kind of fellow to talk about those kinds of things, I 
presume, although I never worked with him directly.
<P>
	However, I did know about his war record and we all honour him 
for that. We also honour him for his personal struggles with disease 
in his youth, particularly polio. We honour him for his service here 
in the House of Commons. We extend our condolences to his 
family.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my 
honour to rise and pay tribute to William Kempling, the former 
member of Parliament for Burlington and the former riding of 
Halton-Wentworth.
<P>
	Bill Kempling passed away on May 27 at the age of 75 and will 
be remembered by all as a dedicated public servant. I think it is 
interesting, on this day of tribute and at the funeral service on 
Friday, that we learn so much about all of the work that he has 
done, the people he mentored, some of whom are here today, 
Shirley Martin and Barbara McDougall, and how great he was for 
newly elected members. It is unfortunate that all of us work so hard 
and constituents and the general public do not hear about that work 
and so it is terrific to be here to pay tribute to Mr. Kempling.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	The Kempling family sacrificed a lot of their time with Bill so 
that he could serve Canadians. And serve he did. Together the team 
of Muriel and Bill Kempling worked hard from 1972 to 1993.
<P>
	A true survivor, as we have heard, Bill Kempling survived 
childhood polio to serve as an officer in the RCAF and was a 
successful business person prior to his election. As a 
parliamentarian he served as the party whip to Prime Minister 
Clark and as parliamentary secretary to several ministers. He 
inspired loyalty and dedication among his staff and I have heard 
nothing but terrific stories from them.
<P>
	Mr. Kempling worked hard for the Canadian steel industry as 
chair of the all party steel caucus. He was very active in the 
Canada-Japan interparliamentary group. He was a history buff and 
he left me very large shoes to fill.
<P>
	In their retirement Muriel and Bill Kempling faced another 
challenge which they survived with strength and dignity but they 
could not beat. Post-polio syndrome claimed a true parliamentarian 
on May 27. It also claimed a husband, father, grandfather and a 
friend to many.
<P>
	My prayers and thoughts are with you, Muriel, Jane, Bruce and 
Angus. God bless.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, rather than going into the business 
of the day I understand that the hon. Minister of Justice and the 
critics from the other parties are going to be making statements. I 
wonder if we might suspend for a few moments while we wait for 
the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod so that we can go for royal 
assent to a bill.

	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36(8), I have the honour to table, in 
both official languages, the government's response to eight 
petitions.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">*  *  * </H4>

	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to report to the House 
on a matter that involves the management of the Department of 
Justice for which of course I am responsible.
<P>
	My reference is to the communications that took place recently 
between Assistant Deputy Attorney General Ted Thompson and 
Chief Justice Julius Isaac of the Federal Court of Canada.
<P>
	The communications related to a number of citizenship 
revocation cases that are pending before the Federal Court. The 
circumstances in which those communications took place have 
raised concerns that require an appropriate response.
<P>
	Canada has one of the finest judicial systems in the world. Its 
strength is derived in great part from the principle of judicial 
independence and from the confidence of the public in the integrity 
of those who administer the system.
<P>
	Canada's Department of Justice has a special responsibility to 
ensure that judicial independence and the integrity of the system 
are maintained. As Minister of Justice and Attorney General of 
Canada, I, in turn, am answerable for the department and for its 
officers.
<P>
	I can tell the House that in its dealings with the courts and with 
other counsel, the Department of Justice takes its responsibility in 
this regard very seriously. And so do I.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This brings me to the particular matter. I want to note at the 
outset that as soon as the department became aware that Mr. 
Thompson and Chief Justice Isaac had met, and as soon as the 
correspondence between the two came to light, the department 
provided copies of that correspondence to the lawyers acting for 
the three persons involved in the revocation cases pending before 
the Federal Court.
<P>
	The communications in question are now the subject of litigation 
before the honourable Mr. Justice Cullen of  the Federal Court. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3138"> 3138 </A></B>
<P>
Court must now decide whether the communications between 
Chief Justice Isaac and Mr. Thompson justify staying the 
proceedings in the three revocation cases.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Accordingly, it would not be appropriate for me to argue the 
details of that issue in the House but hon. members should know 
that justice counsel are opposing the motion for a stay. Our counsel 
have formally acknowledged in court that this meeting between 
Ted Thompson and the chief justice ought not to have taken place 
without other counsel being present.
<P>
	Counsel are arguing that staying the proceedings is not the 
appropriate response. Quite apart from the court proceedings, I 
have a larger responsibility to ensure that appropriate steps are 
being taken internally to evaluate the conduct of my own officials 
in the matter and to respond as required.
<P>
	In that regard, I want to inform the House of three developments. 
First, Mr. Ted Thompson has, on his own initiative, written to the 
Law Society of Upper Canada to inform them of this incident. He 
has asked the Law Society, which is the governing body for lawyers 
in this province, to decide whether his actions constitute 
professional misconduct.
<P>
	He has agreed to make himself available to the Law Society to 
answer all questions and to produce any documents that relate to 
these events. This is the right thing to do. I would have expected no 
less from Ted Thompson, who is an excellent and an experienced 
lawyer and has served the Department of Justice long and very 
well.
<P>
	Second, the deputy minister of justice has retained the services 
of the Hon. Charles Dubin, the former chief justice of Ontario who 
has particular expertise in these matters to review the facts 
surrounding Ted Thompson's communications with the court and 
to determine whether his conduct or that of any others in the 
department departed from the standards expected of a departmental 
employee.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	I believe that within the Department of Justice the principles 
governing the relationship between the courts and judges on the 
one hand, and justice officials on the other, are well known and are 
broadly understood.
<P>
	Notwithstanding that, we have also asked Mr. Dubin to suggest 
any steps that he thinks I should take, or that my officials should 
take, to ensure that in our dealings with the court, the department 
does nothing to harm the independence of the judiciary, or to 
reduce the public's confidence in the integrity of the justice system.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Dubin has been asked to provide his advice as soon as 
possible. Once Mr. Dubin's advice is in hand, the deputy minister 
will discharge his responsibility to decide what steps, if any, should 
be taken as a result of it.
<P>
	I will advise the House of the deputy minister's actions and the 
reasons for them at an appropriate time, having regard to the 
proceedings that are pending.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Third, I should tell the House that Ted Thompson has decided to 
take leave of his current position as assistant deputy attorney 
general until Mr. Dubin reports to the deputy minister.
<P>
	I conclude by emphasizing that I take this matter seriously. 
Allegations of impropriety against officials of the Department of 
Justice are quite exceptional. It is precisely because the department 
has a deserved reputation for understanding and maintaining the 
principles of judicial independence and impartiality, and for 
respecting the highest standards in its dealings with other parties in 
the courts, that I have felt it necessary to address the House today.
<P>
	I will, of course, keep the House informed as to the ultimate 
resolution of the matter.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
outraged at the way the Minister of Justice is dealing with the Ted 
Thompson issue.
<P>
	This is a case of a senior official from the federal justice 
department interfering with the judicial process. An assistant 
deputy attorney general, Ted Thompson, tried to influence the 
Chief Justice of the federal court to speed up the proceedings of a 
case involving the federal Department of Justice. This is why I am 
outraged.
<P>
	Even more disturbing is the fact that Mr. Thompson threatened 
to make a reference to the Supreme Court if proceedings were not 
accelerated. Threats were made. Given such a blatant case of undue 
interference on the part of one of his senior officials, we expected 
the Minister of Justice to take quick, energetic and decisive action. 
However, the minister is doing just the opposite.
<P>
	First, he sets up a non public inquiry which must report at the 
earliest opportunity, but with no specific date set. Given the 
seriousness of the incident, the public has a right to quickly know 
all the circumstances surrounding this matter. It is unacceptable 
that such a serious incident be investigated behind closed doors.
<P>
	The minister must pledge to release the full report of the inquiry 
that will be conducted by Mr. Justice Dubin, a report that will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3139"> 3139 </A></B>
<P>
undoubtedly condemn the action taken in this case. Let us hope that 
the Minister of Justice will have the decency to make the results of 
this report public when the House is sitting, and not at some quiet  
moment, as the government has unfortunately taken to doing 
recently.
<P>
	Furthermore, it is difficult to see how the minister can fail to 
address in his statement the threat made by his assistant deputy 
minister to take a reference to the Supreme Court. It is completely 
unacceptable that the Department of Justice of Canada can hold 
this authority as a threat over courts of first instance.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	The minister has a responsibility to reassure the public about the 
integrity of his department and to state clearly that the threat to 
exercise authority to take a reference to the Supreme Court is 
completely intolerable, and instead of trying to cover for his 
official, he should have expressed his disapproval and dismissed 
him immediately.
<P>
	Of course, Mr. Thompson has decided to take leave of his 
position while awaiting the results of the investigation. However, 
the minister cannot shirk his responsibilities by hiding behind his 
investigation. Furthermore, he himself admits in the statement he 
has just made that he is answerable for the actions of his 
department and its officials.
<P>
	In addition, before the court, lawyers from his own department 
admitted that Mr. Thompson had approached the chief justice. So 
what more is the minister waiting for? On the very face of it, it is 
clear that the deputy attorney general has committed a serious error 
that the minister must indicate his disapproval of through an 
immediate dismissal. This he refuses to do, instead singing the 
praises of Mr. Thompson in his statement.
<P>
	Another fundamental point is completely absent from the justice 
minister's statement. Two Federal Court judges, one of them the 
chief justice, have demonstrated a flagrant lack of impartiality and 
integrity in their task as guardians of justice. In fact, instead of 
showing Mr. Thompson the door, the judges complied with these 
requests, thus violating their duty to remain neutral and impartial. 
The presiding judge, Mr. Justice Jerome, even had to remove 
himself from the case as a result of this incident.
<P>
	I would remind the minister that, as he himself pointed out in his 
statement, responsibility for ensuring the independence of the 
judiciary rests with him. The two judges in this case, Chief Justice 
Isaac and Associate Chief Justice Jerome, have obviously not 
fulfilled their duty of integrity. What is the minister waiting for to 
refer these two cases to the Canadian Judicial Council?
<P>
	In conclusion, the Bloc Quebecois is outraged by the 
insignificant and not very convincing actions taken by the justice 
minister in response to such a serious case of undue interference in 
the judicial system. The minister is clearly shirking his 
responsibilities as watchdog of the integrity of the judicial system. 
We are asking the minister to launch a public inquiry, to take 
immediate  action against Mr. Thompson, and, in particular, to file 
complaints about the actions of the judges in this matter.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I respond 
today to the statement made by the justice minister regarding the 
communications which took place between Assistant Deputy 
Attorney General Ted Thompson and Chief Justice Julius Isaac of 
the Federal Court.
<P>
	This is an extremely serious matter. Many questions have not 
been answered and we must get to the bottom of this whole 
situation before we can rest assured that the independent integrity 
of the justice system is in place and working.
<P>
	I agree with the statement of the Minister of Justice that 
Canada's Department of Justice has a special responsibility to 
ensure that judicial independence and the integrity of the system 
are maintained. We must have a very distinct line between those 
who create the law and those who enforce it. That is a very firm 
principle on which we all stand, including the Reform Party of 
Canada.
<P>
	The minister said that the justice department provided the 
defence attorneys acting for the three persons involved in the 
revocation cases with copies of the correspondence between Mr. 
Thompson and Chief Justice Isaac as soon as it was aware of the 
situation.
<P>
	The minister did not disclose today when the information 
regarding this judicial interference was brought to his attention. 
The meeting between Mr. Thompson and Chief Justice Isaac took 
place three months ago. Did the minister just recently learn of the 
March 1 meeting, or has he had knowledge of it for months? This 
question remains unanswered. If the minister wishes to clear this 
matter up we must know who knew about Mr. Thompson's 
intervention and when. This must include the minister. We must 
know when he first became aware of this matter.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	Editorials appeared in both the <I>Globe and Mail</I> and the Ottawa 
<I>Citizen</I> on May 23. The <I>Globe and Mail</I> made this observation: 
``Nobody seems to be paying much attention to the attempt by a 
senior justice department official to influence a judge''.
<P>
	The <I>Citizen</I> stated: ``Allan Rock and Federal Court Chief Justice 
Julius Isaac owe the public an explanation about the latest and 
potentially worst official blunders, and they owe it right away, 
because the independence of Canada's courts has been 
jeopardized''.
<P>
	In view of these recent editorials it is rather suspect that the 
minister has just now, three months after the fact, publicly stated an 
internal departmental investigation is taking place.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3140"> 3140 </A></B>
<P>
	Many other questions remain unanswered, questions the 
minister has not made reference to today. It must be determined 
who authorized Mr. Thompson's private meeting with the chief 
justice. If the Minister of Justice did not authorize this meeting, 
nor did the deputy minister, was Mr. Thompson acting on his own? 
If it is determined that Mr. Thompson was acting on his own, on 
how many other occasions that have not been made public has the 
assistant deputy attorney general interfered in judicial 
proceedings?
<P>
	The minister said he has the responsibility of ensuring that 
appropriate steps are being taken to evaluate internally the conduct 
of officials in the matter and to respond as required. In my opinion 
the only appropriate response is for the minister to ask for the 
immediate resignation of Mr. Thompson. The evidence is quite 
clear. Mr. Thompson crossed the line, which is absolutely 
unacceptable. Chief Justice Isaac crossed the line as well.
<P>
	The minister made absolutely no mention today that any action 
be taken against the chief justice of the federal court in this regard. 
The minister has not laid a complaint with the Canadian Judicial 
Council, which is the only appropriate course of action.
<P>
	I leave the House with the 1986 landmark decision of then Chief 
Justice Brian Dickson: ``No outsider, be it government, pressure 
group, individual or even another judge, should interfere in fact or 
attempt to interfere with the way in which a judge conducts his or 
her case or makes his or her decision. This core continues to be 
central to the principle of judicial independence''.

them for their hard work and expert assistance. I also thank those 
members of Parliament who jointly seconded my bill.
<P>
	My property rights bill amends the Canadian bill of rights and 
adds two new sections to the Constitution Act of 1867, thereby 
strengthening property rights in federal law.
<P>
	If passed, the bill would specifically guarantee that every person 
has the right to the enjoyment of that person's property and the 
right not to be deprived of their property unless the person is 
accorded a fair hearing, is paid fair compensation, the amount of 
that compensation is fixed impartially, and that the compensation is 
paid within a reasonable amount of time.
<P>
	Every person's property rights would be guaranteed in every law 
of Canada unless it is expressly declared by an act of Parliament

the attention of the House that managing the family home and 
caring for preschool children is an honourable profession which

the Income Tax Act discriminates against traditional families that 
make the choice to provide care in the home for preschool children, 
the chronically ill, the disabled or the aged.
<P>

initiatives to eliminate tax discrimination against families that

disabled, the chronically ill and the aged.

and other alcohol related birth defects are 100 per cent preventable 
by avoiding alcohol consumption during pregnancy.

Canadians primarily from the provinces of Saskatchewan and 
Ontario who draw to the attention of Parliament that there are over 
100,000 therapeutic abortions performed each year in Canada at a 
cost of over $50 million. Since Canadians deserve a say in how 
their scarce health dollars are spent and which health care 
procedures they consider essential, these petitions call on 
Parliament to support a binding national referendum to be held at 
the time of the next general election to determine whether 
Canadians are in favour of federal government funding for abortion 
on demand.

Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario who are opposed to 
the inclusion of the term of sexual orientation in the Canadian 
Human Rights Act. These petitioners feel homosexuals are already 
protected by law and that the inclusion of the term of sexual 
orientation would only lead to special rights for homosexuals. 
These special rights would in turn infringe on the fundamental 
rights of Canadians such as freedom of religion, conscience and 
belief. I am pleased to present these petitions.

COMMERCIALIZATION ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.)</B> moved 
that Bill C-20, an act respecting the commercialization of civil air 
navigation services, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I consider it a privilege to rise 
today to speak at third reading of Bill C-20, the act  which will 
provide the legal means to transfer the air navigation system 
currently operated by Transport Canada to a private not for profit 
corporation, Nav Canada.
<P>
<B>(1615 )</B>
<P>
	As members know, the bill carries out the decision which was 
taken by this government to commercialize the air navigation 
system announced back in February 1995 in the federal budget. In 
December 1995 an agreement in principle was reached for the sale 
of ANS to Nav Canada for the purchase price of $1.5 billion. Now 
that is a very significant contribution to the government's deficit 
reduction efforts.
<P>
	I am pleased to highlight that on April 1, 1996 the Minister of 
Transport along with Nav Canada representatives signed the 
agreement to transfer which will allow this transaction to proceed 
to closing, subject to a number of conditions of course. Key among 
them are the approval of this legislation by Parliament and Nav 
Canada's ability to raise the required $1.5 billion purchase price for 
this not for profit entity.
<P>
	Bill C-20 has received the benefit of thoughtful consideration by 
the members of the Standing Committee on Transport who, in 
addition to carrying out their own review and analysis of the 
legislation, also heard from a number of important national and 
regional witnesses representing, among others, industry, labour, 
government and community groups. A number of written briefs 
were also submitted. For all of these efforts we want to extend our 
appreciation.
<P>
	A number of the witnesses demonstrated strong, unconditional 
support of the bill, recognizing the desirability and necessity of 
commercialization. Some of these were the Air Transport 
Association of Canada, the Aerospace Industries Association and 
Air Canada, the Nav Canada Bargaining Agents Association, 
including the Canadian Air Traffic Control Association and the 
Canadian Airline Pilots Association.
<P>
	Other witnesses expressed a range of concerns, some of which 
were outside the scope of the legislation. However, I believe the 
government was well able to address many of these concerns.
<P>
	There was a concern that Nav Canada might not continue to 
operate the ANS in a bilingual environment. In fact, the bill is very 
clear that the Official Languages Act will apply to Nav Canada as if 
it were a federal institution. It ensures the use of both official 
languages in communications with the public and the language of 
work. This is entirely consistent with established practice and is 
reflective of the national nature of Nav Canada activities. In the 
same context, Nav Canada has already enacted bilingual bylaws.
<P>
	Another concern involved what some believed was an absence of 
regional representation. I want to reassure the House that this is 
simply an unfounded concern. In fact,  the make-up of Nav 
Canada's board of directors and its newly appointed advisory 
committee, about which I will speak in a minute, have been 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3143"> 3143 </A></B>
<P>
designed to bring a wide range of regional and other perspectives to 
the Nav Canada decision making process.
<P>
	What is more, the two national trade associations, the Air 
Transport Association of Canada and the Canadian Business 
Aviation Association, have member groups of all sizes appointing 
directors to the Nav Canada board. They are drawn from all 
provinces and territories. These members are likely to account for 
more than 90 per cent of the current ANS revenues to be generated 
by Canadian operators.
<P>
	The testimony of all the witnesses who appeared before the 
Standing Committee on Transport provided a very useful and 
timely perspective on their diverse interests. This has been helpful 
in setting the broadest possible context, moving the legislation 
forward in support of the further streamlining and modernizing of 
Canada's transportation industry.
<P>
	Before going further, I would like to take the opportunity to 
commend the members of the Standing Committee on Transport, of 
which I am also a member, for their judicious handling of the 
legislation and the whole legislative review process to date, and for 
enabling this precedent setting bill to progress to this stage in the 
parliamentary process.
<P>
	Let us look at the legislation for what it is. The bill represents a 
careful balancing of the commercial interests of the new ANS 
entity and the interests of the Canadian public. The bill will give 
Nav Canada the commercial freedoms it needs to develop and 
maintain a safe, efficient, cost effective and technologically 
advanced air navigation system while at the same time looking 
after the public interest by imposing certain operating conditions 
on Nav Canada and establishing a regulatory framework. For 
example, the bill ensures a continued high level of system safety by 
clearly establishing the supremacy of the Aeronautics Act and 
regulations made pursuant to the act.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	Canada, perhaps more than any other country in the world, with 
its geographical uniqueness is dependent on air transportation that 
must be reliable, safe and competitive. The network of air traffic 
control services, flight information services, aviation weather 
services and navigational aids which comprise the ANS provide for 
this necessary safe and expeditious movement of aircraft in 
Canada.
<P>
	For over 50 years Transport Canada has managed the safe 
provision of these air navigation services to the industry and to 
meet the needs of the travelling public. However, government 
realized that it does not need to own or operate the air navigation 
service to ensure that  the public interest is met. Legislation, 
regulation and other means can accomplish this.
<P>
	ANS commercialization is therefore a very visible 
demonstration of this commitment. It is yet another example, along 
with a host of others such as the commercialization of federal 
airports, ports and harbours and Canadian National, of initiatives 
that will move Canadian transportation into the 21st century. It will 
also move Transport Canada away from being the operator of the 
system toward a more policy and regulatory role, but I stress with a 
continued priority on safety. This government remains committed 
to streamlining and moving away from activities that can be 
operated more efficiently by the private sector unfettered by 
government processes.
<P>
	Although internationally, commercialization of aviation 
facilities and services is progressing steadily, Canada is the first 
country to establish a commercial air navigation system entity 
without government ownership. This is an important precedent 
setting milestone.
<P>
	A few words about Nav Canada's not for profit organization 
model are in order at this point to provide another context for 
understanding the uniqueness of this particular transaction. This 
model was the choice of an advisory committee of users, unions 
and other stakeholders who, over the course of several months, 
studied various commercialization options.
<P>
	Since the time of its incorporation in May 1995, Nav Canada has 
carried out the necessary extensive due diligence process 
associated with purchasing the entity, and which contemplated the 
overall negotiation process leading to the $1.5 billion agreement in 
principle with Transport Canada in December 1995, and the 
signing of the larger agreement to transfer on April 1, 1996.
<P>
	Nav Canada is also proceeding to establish itself as a responsible 
corporate citizen such as with the appointment of a board of 
directors, the naming of a president and chief executive officer and 
in other tangible ways that will ensure prudent corporate 
governance, including the articulation of a code of conduct and 
conflict of interest guidelines. Its unique structure with board 
members appointed by user associations, unions, government, as 
well as independents, will ensure that the corporation receives the 
benefit of a wide range of stakeholder views to guide its operations.
<P>
	At its first annual meeting held in Ottawa in April 1996, which 
was open to and very well attended by the public, it announced the 
appointment of an advisory committee of 15 members from a broad 
range of groups, including Quebec, B.C. and Saskatchewan 
regional associations. This, along with the broad representation of 
the board of directors, should provide a further measure of 
reassurance regarding the opportunity for the inclusion of 
Canadians regionally and nationally in Nav Canada decision 
making.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3144"> 3144 </A></B>
<P>
	Nav Canada through its annual report has highlighted four 
corporate priorities it will pursue as the operator of the ANS: 
people, safety, technology and service. Of particular importance to 
the government and public interest of course is Nav Canada's 
commitment to safety as the core of every operating policy, 
procedure and activity performed by Nav Canada. Nav Canada also 
recognizes the role which Transport Canada will continue to play in 
the establishment and monitoring of safety regulations and 
standards.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	The point here is that Nav Canada is demonstrating that it 
understands only too well the critical mandate it will have as the 
operator of the system and the priority it is placing on successfully 
meeting these challenges.
<P>
	I will now very briefly reiterate some of the key provisions of 
Bill C-20 which continue to be the cornerstones of this legislation.
<P>
	Safety will continue to have the highest priority for Transport 
Canada. Safety regulations will be in place before ANS is 
transferred. Transport Canada will monitor and enforce compliance 
with these regulations as it does now in the case of airlines. The 
Aeronautics Act which sets out the regulatory framework to 
maintain the safety and integrity of the aviation industry will 
prevail. I point out to members of the Bloc that it will prevail over 
the ANS Act.
<P>
	The transfer will see approximately 6,400 public servants being 
offered positions with Nav Canada with equivalent working 
conditions and benefits. During the transition period until Nav 
Canada reaches its own agreements with the employees, the current 
collective agreements will continue to apply and bargaining agents 
will be granted successor rights. This tripartite employment 
agreement reached in support of this transfer was a major 
accomplishment in that Nav Canada, Transport Canada and the 
bargaining agents worked together very successfully. We are 
pleased that the bargaining agents and the employees themselves 
continue to be strong supporters of Bill C-20.
<P>
	All of the assets used by Transport Canada in the provision of air 
navigation services will form part of the transfer, including land, 
equipment and other items required to ensure its continued 
effective and safe operation.
<P>
	The act grants certain powers to Nav Canada as well as imposes 
certain operating obligations on the corporation. For example, it 
obliges Nav Canada to provide public notice of any contemplated 
changes in services or facilities that are likely to affect a significant 
group of users in a material way. In addition, a process has also 
been established in the legislation to ensure public input to 
decisions by Nav Canada in respect of the introduction, increase, 
termination or even reduction of services and of course the closure 
of facilities.
<P>
	The government must also monitor the performance of Nav 
Canada as a monopolist. There are many safeguards against
<P>
possible use of arbitrary power. These start with the nature of Nav 
Canada itself which, as a not for profit entity without share capital, 
does not have a financial incentive to abuse its monopoly position.
<P>
	The act establishes an economic regulatory framework in respect 
of user charges based on requirements for public notice and 
consultation. A set of charging principles is established in the 
legislation and there is an opportunity for users to appeal new or 
revised charges.
<P>
	The charging principles address issues such as transparency, 
safety, impact, equity and international obligations. The act also 
provides an opportunity for users to appeal new or revised charges 
to the National Transportation Agency. The legislation prohibits 
Nav Canada from generating revenues reasonably and prudently 
projected from exceeding Nav Canada's current and future 
financial requirements for the provision of civil air navigation 
services.
<P>
	Through the board of directors and advisory committee, users of 
the system will now have more opportunity to determine their 
future in the way the corporation and the system will operate. For 
example, stakeholders in the industry will have meaningful input 
into the use of ANS revenues, setting of fees, long term 
expenditures and service standards.
<P>
	The government also ensured that the special transportation 
needs of isolated communities would continue to be recognized in 
a commercial environment. This act preserves air navigation 
services to northern and remote communities, including a process 
which will involve provincial and territorial governments should 
possible service reductions be proposed by Nav Canada at any time 
in the future.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	In summary, here are the highlights of Bill C-20, which will 
allow the air navigation systems transaction, one of the largest and 
most precedent setting commercialization initiatives which the 
federal government has undertaken to proceed for the benefit of all 
Canadians.
<P>
	For taxpayers, it will make a $1.5 billion contribution to 
reducing the federal deficit.
<P>
	For the industry, it will maintain safety while increasing the 
system's ability to respond to changing demands and new 
technologies.
<P>
	For the users, it will provide more efficient and cost effective 
operations.
<P>
	For the air navigation service employees, it offers the 
opportunity to continue to contribute in a new and challenging 
work environment.
<P>
	For Nav Canada, it sets the stage for it to operate one of the best 
run and safest air navigation systems in the world.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3145"> 3145 </A></B>
<P>
	Bill C-20 is yet another initiative by the government to ensure 
that the Canadian transportation industry meets the demands of 
our ever changing economy. This legislation, once passed, will be 
a milestone not only for Canadians but internationally, and 
something in which we should all take enormous pride.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the question to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment is as follows: the hon. 
member for Lévis-Quebec bridge.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this bill 
at the third reading stage.
<P>
	I became a member of the Standing Committee on Transport 
when we were at the final stages of the bill. We looked at the bill as 
a whole, and the amendments moved. I could see that the 
committee members had put a lot of work into it, and that there was 
a desire to correct a situation that had existed in the past, namely 
the problem of controlling the costs of air navigation.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois also saw, however, that the situation was a 
bit like a pendulum, having gone from one extreme to the other 
with no stop in the middle. The bill could, in our opinion, have 
turned into something worthwhile and acceptable. Its purpose was 
to create a not-for-profit organization in an attempt to involve 
representatives of the entire industry, with everyone having the 
opportunity to sit on the board. It seems, however, that the small 
carriers will not have a say, despite their expectations.
<P>
	This is one of the negative aspects of the bill, and one which has 
not been corrected along the way since it was introduced. No 
amendment in this connection has been made, despite the 
numerous representations made about it.
<P>
	Today, however, at the third reading stage, what I would like to 
tell the government is that, if it were to agree to modify the bill to 
give precedence to air safety instead of the financial stability of 
Nav Canada, this bill would have the potential of becoming an 
acceptable one, in our opinion.
<P>
	That is what is missing from the bill at present, and our concerns 
have grown because of the government's refusal at other points, for 
example, to add a preamble to the bill which would satisfy the need 
for giving precedence to air safety. This is a very important aspect 
because of its considerable human impact. We have just had an 
example of this with the recent U.S. crash, with the loss of many 
lives, and all of the personal and economic aspects of it.
<P>
	Canada has, in the past, acquired a reputation for air safety, since 
we have not had an undue number of  accidents. From that point of 
view we have had a good reputation; our problem lay more, as I 
have said, with controlling costs.
<P>
	By trying to settle the problem of controlling costs, we are 
leaving the door open to the creation of a new air navigation 
problem: safety. In its present form, the bill does not address that 
aspect satisfactorily.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	This is why we want to ask the government once again to 
consider the question and, if possible, accept an amendment from 
us that would make the bill acceptable to the official opposition.
<P>
	Why does so much importance need to be given to safety? Well, 
this is an area where mistakes are fatal. Newspapers regularly carry 
reports of events that have taken place. In this area, for both 
equipment and people, the most important thing in getting the job 
done is safety.
<P>
	We were told in committee, particularly by the spokespersons 
for the Air Canada pilots' association, by those who came to talk 
about the use of French in the air and by representatives of the 
general population, the users of air services, that this was an 
important consideration and that the government's responsibility 
should be carried out by Transport Canada.
<P>
	This distinction is not in the bill. Why is the government not 
agreeing to include this request on safety in Nav Canada's 
mandate? The question arises when we look at the make-up of the 
board of directors. All the representatives of the industry are there, 
people who are obviously in an industry aimed at making money. 
The major carriers, like Air Canada and Canadian International and 
others, are in the air transport business to make money, obviously, 
and this is perfectly normal.
<P>
	These people are on the board of Nav Canada and will have to 
ensure the services they receive from Nav Canada are charged at an 
acceptable level and that they, after calculating their own costs, 
will be able to declare a profit.
<P>
	So when they arrive on the board of directors, their first concern 
will be to look at the effect of the decisions on their own 
companies. As for public protection, as it appears in the legislation 
establishing Nav Canada and in the mandate defined there, we will 
see whether the members of the board of directors in fact do abide 
by acceptable standards of safety.
<P>
	Except that the mandate establishes no such requirement. There 
is no provision for anyone in Canada to refer to, in the event of an 
accident or for prevention purposes, saying: ``In a certain airport, 
in a certain situation, Nav Canada decided not to provide a certain 
sort of equipment or service, and we would like it to do so for 
safety reasons''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3146"> 3146 </A></B>
<P>
	The legislation as it stands contains no provision for appeal or 
consultation and certainly no legal clout making such arguments 
possible. So, as far as safety is concerned, there is some anxiety.
<P>
	The method of financing Nav Canada is also worrisome. Let us 
take a brief look at how it will work. There are some very large 
carriers who will bring in a significant amount, who will provide a 
lot of money to finance Nav Canada, because of the frequency of 
use of equipment and of Canadian air space, while use by others 
will be considerably less.
<P>
	Accordingly, when the time comes for the board of directors to 
make budgetary choices, when decisions have to be made about 
what equipment to invest in, certain individuals will have a greater 
say than others. I am speaking of those who control air 
transportation.
<P>
	What, however, will happen to small carriers, as well as people 
living in remote areas, for instance? I do not necessarily mean the 
Far North, which the bill covers quite adequately by making 
provision for special rules, but regional airports. I could mention 
the Mont-Joli airport, in my region, or the one in Sept-Îles, or any 
other regional airport in Canada. If Nav Canada decides not to add 
a particular piece of equipment to their airport so that a particular 
plane can land, that would have an important regional economic 
impact. This is a reality communities will have to live with. We 
have a very telling example, the situation now being experienced in 
the area of Montreal and Mirabel, with ADM.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	You will recall that this was an organization created by the 
former Conservative government to manage Montreal's airports. 
We have here the same financial objective as Nav Canada's. There 
is a decision to turn the management of the airports over to the 
private sector, just as the question of air navigation services is 
being turned over to the private sector, through Nav Canada. In 
both cases, the organization created will have a phenomenal 
amount of leeway and will not necessarily have to be truly 
accountable for its actions.
<P>
	In the case of ADM, we now see what this leads to. Without in 
any way saying whether the choice of Dorval or of Mirabel is right, 
what can be said with certainty is that the public is not now in a 
position to judge the best possible decision. They must pretty much 
rely on ADM, which is not accountable for its actions to either the 
Government of Quebec or the federal government.
<P>
	Even if the federal government owns these airport facilities, 
even if there is a lease between the federal government and ADM 
for the management of the Dorval and Mirabel airports, the 
government has not left itself any position from which it could say 
to ADM that the decisions it takes will have a major impact, a 
direct economic impact on air navigation, as well as on the tourist 
industry, the industrial sector, and all sorts of  other impacts. Again 
today, during question period, the federal government, through the 
responsible minister, could not tell us anything other than that 
ADM is autonomous and can do what it wants.
<P>
	I give this example because, in the case of Nav Canada, it seems 
to me that there is a risk that we will find ourselves in exactly the 
same sort of situation in the years to come. There will be quite a 
heated battle in certain regions for safety equipment 
accommodating particular types of planes and people will 
practically be begging Nav Canada for this equipment.
<P>
	No appeal mechanism is provided by which a community, 
citizens, organizations or users can be heard and can obtain rulings 
reflecting the economic impact of these decisions.
<P>
	At the same time, I would also like to make a comparison with 
what happened with Canada Post Corporation. This is a Crown 
corporation with considerable leeway, which was given a mandate 
of becoming cost effective. Because this corporation was showing 
deficits, the only criterion was to require it to be cost effective. 
This led to a policy of brutally closing down post offices, with the 
determining factor being quite simply the age of the postmaster. It 
had nothing to do with the number of clients served.
<P>
	It took a political decision, a moratorium by the present 
government to stop this operation. The same mistakes are being 
made, as though we were in some sort of neo-Liberal model, 
where, when we see the pendulum swinging back, we say: ``Before, 
we interfered in everything and it was costing too much, because 
we were doing it badly. Now, we will not interfere in anything and 
we will give people free rein''. But between these two extremes, a 
balance must be sought, and in the case at hand, it is the issue of 
safety.
<P>
	This raises another problem as well, and that is the question of 
transparency. Even if Nav Canada makes the best decisions in the 
world, for them to be accepted by the regional communities 
involved, public debate must be possible. Certainly public debate 
brings about delays on occasion, but the time spent in public debate 
is often shorter and more profitable than that spent in legal 
wrangling.
<P>
	We need only think of what is happening with the ADM, in the 
case of the Montreal airports, Dorval and Mirabel. Since we are not 
allowed access to all of the studies on this, we are now faced with 
citizens who want to institute legal proceedings, and unacceptable 
delays may result. The bill we have before us now will not solve 
this problem of transparency.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	Let us just look at the question of the small carriers. In Canada, 
there are carriers that can be identified as major carriers with high 
volume and a heavy influence on air travel markets. There are, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3147"> 3147 </A></B>
<P>
however, also many small  carriers. These are found just about 
everywhere in Canada.
<P>
	There are, for example, tourist carriers which take southern 
hunters or biologists to the north. There are many of these in the 
west, and many also in northern Quebec. There are also small 
charter companies. These are not companies that do a lot of 
business, but they will be considerably hindered by the fee scales 
set by Nav Canada.
<P>
	Setting fees in this way will not impact only on the economic 
survival of the small carriers. The rates set could well have only a 
minimal effect on the major carriers, but a considerable one on the 
smaller ones.
<P>
	The way the board is set up, small carriers will not have enough 
representation to make themselves heard. I believe that Nav 
Canada could, in good faith, take decisions that are not intended to 
hurt the small carriers but will in fact do so. There will be a 
negative impact, and that is the first consequence of the fee scale.
<P>
	There is another. Obviously, because there is more air traffic 
between major centres, the small ones, the small airports will find 
it harder to defend their arguments for obtaining relevant 
equipment.
<P>
	As small carriers are the ones using small airports, a sort of 
vicious circle is created. We have people who are not represented 
on the board of directors-small carriers-and small airports with 
limited traffic, providing essential services to the smaller centres. 
In the end, this could even lead to lessening economic activity in 
certain regions. The effects of the choices made will be felt in two, 
five, ten or twenty years with the small carriers being shifted to the 
larger airports or simply eliminated. These are some of the effects 
of Bill C-20.
<P>
	Despite the government's best intentions, despite the work in 
committee, the finishing touches are lacking. There is one element 
that was not given sufficient consideration. Accordingly, if there 
are no amendments, the official opposition will be unable to vote in 
favour of this bill, because some things need to be changed.
<P>
	Let us consider for a few minutes the various decisions that will 
have to be made by Nav Canada and that may have negative effects 
because of this lack of concern for safety.
<P>
	For example, Nav Canada could decide to set up new 
navigational equipment in an airport. As the bill now stands, the 
cost of the aircraft will be reviewed, as well as all the charges for 
the whole country, but not the issue of whether this equipment is 
really needed in this or that airport to ensure adequate safety. There 
will be no advisory committee to warn us of an inadequate level of 
safety in a given sector.
<P>
	This is not an area in which things can be fixed afterwards. In air 
navigation services, any mistake that causes the death of people or 
that has a major economic  impact is very harmful to all of society. 
You may appoint as many inquiries as you like, but all it takes is 
one or two major accidents to have bitter regrets about not making 
safety a top priority right from the start.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	Another decision that can be made by Nav Canada is to 
redistribute the equipment. For example, if air traffic in eastern 
Quebec was down, it could be decided that the facilities in 
Mont-Joli are no longer be needed and some of the equipment 
could be transferred to the national capital region, for instance. 
There is no control, no requirement to inform the regions 
concerned that part of their equipment will be transferred to 
another airport or to tell them about the possible consequences. 
This bill does not provide any mechanism for appealing decisions 
or consulting the communities affected.
<P>
	Several amendments to that effect were put forward during 
consideration of the bill at report stage. Those amendments were 
rejected.
<P>
	Now that we are at third reading, we would like the government 
to at least pay attention and realize that making safety a priority 
would have a direct impact on such decisions. Through this bill, the 
government could prompt Nav Canada to take into consideration 
the security of any given airport when moving equipment. We do 
not feel this was emphasized enough in the bill.
<P>
	Generally speaking, this bill will no doubt make the whole cost 
control issue easier. I hope we will see a marked improvement. At 
the same time, it seems to us that it has deficiencies in terms of 
safety, by not making safety the first consideration. This is 
something we feel the government should reconsider before giving 
this bill the force of law.
<P>
	In the coming years, we will live through the situation I 
described earlier and already experienced by other organizations, 
where the federal government has relinquished so much 
responsibility that it does not even have the nub to pull the door 
shut with. One, two or three years from now, it will not be able to 
tell Nav Canada that its decisions do not meet an acceptable 
minimum level of safety.
<P>
	It is all interconnected. It does not allow citizens or users to 
request information about Nav Canada under the federal 
government's Access to Information Act because it has been 
decided that this act would not apply to this particular organization.
<P>
	All the more proof that this bill is only about economic and cost 
effectiveness considerations. But what we are dealing with is not a 
cannery or some private sector enterprise where safety is not that 
important. This is an area where the federal government must 
always have some responsibility over safety, air safety and related 
regulations. It must give the organization it is establishing and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3148"> 3148 </A></B>
<P>
which will be in operation for many  years to come the mandate 
to give top priority to safety. The bill does not contain anything 
to this effect.
<P>
	That is why I move the following amendment:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word ``That'' 
and substituting the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``this House declines to give third reading to Bill C-20, an act respecting the 
commercialization of civil air navigation services, because the bill does not 
give the safety of passengers, airline personnel and the public priority over 
all other considerations in business decisions made by Nav Canada.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	I move this amendment, which I have signed, seconded by the 
hon. member for Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, hoping that the 
House will debate it and see that it can help ensure that the final 
product meets all public requirements in that respect, so that the 
bill is acceptable to all members of this House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am in favour of this bill. I think it is the best of all 
possible outcomes. That is not to say there are not some 
weaknesses and flaws in it. In honesty, what bill does not have 
something in it that could be improved?
<P>
	I begin by making a few comments on the speeches by the Bloc 
members. I am sure these things were said with great sincerity. I 
noticed they member focused on various parts of Quebec. That is 
not unreasonable for a single province or regional party to do.
<P>
	However, because I have a much broader spectrum, being the 
national transport critic, I have looked at the potential problems 
and concerns of the bill from a more national perspective.
<P>
	Any time a change or something new is introduced it is only 
natural that it would make some people who are affected by it 
nervous. The member for the Bloc talked about no representation 
for airlines, even small airlines. He was speaking from Quebec's 
perspective, as he should.
<P>
	Mr. Jenner is the head of a large airline organization in Quebec, 
representing mostly small airlines, the very people the member was 
concerned about. I am sure the member knows Mr. Jenner was 
offered a seat on the board of directors of Nav Canada and turned it 
down. Also, the head of the Canadian Owners and Pilots 
Association, small aircraft operators, was offered a seat on the 
board of directors of Nav Canada and turned it down.
<P>
	I would not want him to leave the impression that Nav Canada is 
trying to bully these small companies and have a little clique of 
selected people. That is not the case.
<P>
	The member also mentioned there would be no public 
consultation if Nav Canada decided it wanted to take a particular 
piece of equipment out of an airport and move it elsewhere. I do not 
know of any procedure that requires Transport Canada to have 
public consultation if it wishes to move a particular piece of 
equipment from one airport to another.
<P>
	I have seen some of the old equipment that Transport Canada 
operated a decade or two ago. If there were public consultation to 
finally move this rather decrepit equipment it would be cause for 
celebration and rejoicing.
<P>
	When the bill was first introduced there were a number of 
possible ways of divesting Transport Canada of its air navigation 
system. A variety of things were looked at, including profit 
companies, a mixture of private sector businesses working 
together. Some sounded a little wild but were considered because, 
wild or not, they should at least be looked at because maybe there 
was a portion merit.
<P>
<B>(1700 )</B>
<P>
	However it was very quickly narrowed down to just two 
particular aspects, one being a crown corporation and the other 
being the not for profit corporation which is what we have ended up 
with. As near as I can see, the government to its credit did not 
appear to be pushing any one scenario. The same thing cannot be 
said for the bureaucrats who were falling all over themselves trying 
to make sure it was a crown corporation while they were busy 
jockeying for position to ensure they got all the key positions in 
this new crown entity.
<P>
	Fortunately, industry got its act together and the users and the 
various employee groups got together. They quickly recognized 
what was happening and that what was good for industry and the 
travelling public was the not for profit concept. They did an 
excellent job of not saying one at a time: ``I want it and I can work 
with him''. Rather they said: ``We the industry, we the users, we the 
operators, we the employee groups, we the bargaining agents are all 
sitting together and we have agreed how to do this jointly''. Thus 
was born Nav Canada. It was a very good collaboration by industry. 
People put together the best possible outcome for the divestment of 
the air navigation system.
<P>
	The price was mentioned by the parliamentary secretary to the 
minister. Nav Canada was ripped off. I must make that comment 
because Nav Canada will not make it. Nav Canada negotiated with 
a gun at its head. They were the only obvious buyers and it was in 
their own best interests to ensure that they were the ones to take 
over this operation. They did not want somebody from outside with 
no expertise, with no concern about the users, the bargaining agents 
and all the internal people that make up Nav Canada to come in and 
take over. And they certainly did not want it to remain with the 
government because it was hardly an efficient or effective system.
<P>
	They were the only buyers but they were also in need of getting 
the system and it had to come from the  government. Therefore 
they had to pay whatever the government asked. I think they paid 
too much, in part to bail the government out of a problem contract 
it got into and perhaps also to pay off some other bad investments. 
One example is the microwave landing system. It was not that this 
concept was bad but government inertia makes it difficult to let go 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3149"> 3149 </A></B>
<P>
of something when its time has passed. The government continued 
with the MLS long after it should have been abandoned, when other 
industrialized countries had dropped it.
<P>
	We heard concerns and fears from some of the northern 
operators, even some remote regional operators, as the Bloc 
mentioned. I am a commercial pilot and I was an air traffic 
controller for 22 years. I have a lot of background in the specific 
issues people were concerned about. I have looked closely at what 
this bill contains and the risks. It is not a perfect bill, but what bill 
is? I am satisfied it contains the necessary protections and has the 
right intent with Nav Canada moving forward.
<P>
	It is only natural that some operators should have some fears. 
That is to be expected. If there is any fault here it is that the 
government and perhaps even the committee, of which I am a 
member, did not do a good enough job of selling the idea and 
convincing the people that they were protected.
<P>
	There is one area which came to the fore and troubled me a bit: 
general aviation and recreational aircraft fees. It is only natural for 
people to object to fees when they have been getting something 
essentially for free and which will now have a cost. Instead of a 
regular user fee for this category of aircraft there has been talk 
about a general flat annual fee. The amount that has been discussed 
is in the range of $500 but there is nothing in the bill. It is a Nav 
Canada charge.
<P>
<B>(1705 )</B>
<P>
	I have heard a lot of objections from different operators and 
owners of aircraft along with their representatives such as the 
Canadian Owners and Pilots Association. They proposed an 
alternative, not that they do not want to pay and I am sure they do 
not want to pay. Who does?
<P>
	However, it is reasonable that a system is there. They will have 
to call flight service to get weather briefings and flight information 
and to file flight plans. Maybe they are not flying on instruments 
but many people who have the equipment-and many do-still 
tune in and use the airway as a navigation aid for themselves. They 
talk to air traffic control whenever they go into a controlled airport. 
Some of them fly on instruments and make use of the area control 
centres. It is not unreasonable that they pay something for the 
service.
<P>
	One of the suggestions they brought forward was the idea of 
paying for the service through an excise gas tax. I hasten to point 
out that they pay a significant gas tax  already. It could be some 
portion of the amount that is already paid dedicated to go to Nav 
Canada instead of the fee, or even possibly a bit of that combined 
with a very nominal, and I stress very nominal, increase in the 
gasoline component of the aviation fuel tax. A pilot who flies 50 
hours a year, which many private aircraft owners do, would pay 
based on his 50 hours. An operator or an owner who flies 500 hours 
would pay that much more in a similar type of aircraft because he 
potentially is making 10 times the use of the service.
<P>
	I am not proposing that at this time. However this is enabling 
legislation, and is not a finely detailed, carved in stone type of 
legislation. I will continue to look at that proposal. I will continue 
to consult with the various groups and individuals this is going to 
impact on to see if that would have real favour. I will confirm with 
Nav Canada that it is something it would look on favourably if that 
were to be the type of system that was put in.
<P>
	I move next to labour disputes. This is something that has not 
been overlooked by the committee. I brought it up. Again, it was 
something that came up. It is a very overwhelming issue. The bill 
moved through far too quickly. It would be a long delay to try to 
address this issue and would hold up a bill that should move ahead.
<P>
	A lot of the bargaining agents are critical of the operation of the 
entire air transport system of this country, the total transportation 
system. The work of the air traffic controllers, flight service 
people, the licensing people has to continue. When it stops, the 
entire system stops. The government has introduced something and 
it is jury-rigged and a poor way of doing it.
<P>
	I am not talking about this government, I might add, before I get 
its dander up for no reason. I do it often enough for reason so I 
certainly do not want to do it for no reason. I hear kind comments 
coming from the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands. Of 
course, those are the only comments I get from him.
<P>
	What happened is a right to strike was given. I will use the air 
traffic controllers as an example. They are not the only group, but 
they are the ones I am most familiar with.
<P>
	In the late 1960s they got the right to strike. In a contract dispute 
in the early 1970s when a settlement could not be reached between 
the Air Traffic Controllers Association and Treasury Board, the air 
traffic control system was shut down. The controllers went on 
strike and air transportation in this country stopped. After a week 
and a half in the dead of winter, the government legislated the 
controllers back to work. Mandatory arbitration was the settlement 
dispute.
<P>
	Some time later, a contract dispute came up again. Once again it 
looked as if we were headed toward a strike. This time the 
government in advance of a strike taking place legislated the 
controllers so that they could not go out on strike and legislated the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3150"> 3150 </A></B>
<P>
settlement. In other words, it completely revoked not only their 
right to strike but even their right to bargain.
<P>
<B>(1710 )</B>
<P>
	During the time when the strikes took place, the controllers had 
agreed and worked with the government. There would be a number 
of designated employees who would go in to ensure that safety was 
still maintained.
<P>
	If there was an aircraft still up and in distress the controllers 
would handle it. If there was a medical emergency, the controllers 
would handle it. They would handle flights that reprovisioned 
remote communities in the north and air defence flights. All these 
types of things were still handled. It amounted to about 15 per cent 
of the control staff. The controllers did this willingly and the 
system was fine.
<P>
	Sometime after the second piece of legislation, the government 
came out with a new list of designated employees. It pertained to 
everybody who controls aircraft. It came out with a list of 
designated duties which contained everything the controllers did. 
This was appealed and taken to court all the way to the top and the 
government prevailed.
<P>
	From that day forward and for approximately the past 20 years 
air traffic controllers have had the right to go on strike, but when 
they go on strike every one of them has to report to work and they 
have to do all the duties they normally do. No other dispute 
settlement was put in place. The only dispute settlement is to strike 
when in fact they cannot strike. It has been a very unsatisfactory 
system for the past 20 years.
<P>
	Now controllers and other bargaining agents in similar situations 
are once again getting back the right to strike. They are no longer 
covered by this legislation because they are no longer in the public 
service. They are now private sector employees covered by the 
Canada Labour Code.
<P>
	I say in all sincerity that air traffic controllers are very 
conscientious and sincere people. They are interested in flight 
safety and in doing a good job. In fact, if controllers as a whole did 
not do a little more than the system even expects them to do or 
expects them to be able to do, the system probably would not work 
very well at all. They are very conscientious people but they are 
also people who have had a bad deal for 20 years. If there ever was 
a problem in negotiations between any of these bargaining agents 
and the new Nav Canada employer, we would have a major 
problem in this country.
<P>
	The government had to legislate back to work the dock workers 
in Vancouver. I agreed in doing that. It causes severe economic 
problems in this country when the port of Vancouver goes down. 
The government legislated back to work the national rail system 
when it went on strike and I supported that as well. I believe it had 
to be done. But those two things pale in comparison to the 
economic  impact of the air transport system of this country being 
shut down.
<P>
	I say to the government that it should have a heads up on this 
problem. I want to make sure it understands that the problem 
exists, that we rely certainly on good faith bargaining between the 
various bargaining agents and Nav Canada, but at the same time the 
government should be aware that this potential problem is there. It 
may be necessary at some point in time for the government to do 
something about it and it should start putting some thought into it.
<P>
	I will now move on to committee practices particularly with 
respect to this bill. I begin with the Canadian Transportation Act, 
specifically section 27.2.
<P>
	When legislation starts in the House and goes to committee, I 
have to assume it goes to committee for a reason and not just 
because a piece of paper says that is the procedure. There has to be 
a reason for it to go to committee. I am told by the government that 
legislation goes to committee so we can discuss it openly, so we 
can hear witnesses, hear what problems might exist with the 
legislation, and address the concerns the majority of witnesses 
bring forward and find ways to deal with these problems.
<P>
	There were many witnesses on that piece of legislation. Most of 
the people who came forward said: ``Get rid of 27.2. It is a disaster 
for us''. They quoted chapter and verse where all the problems 
were. On the other side were representatives of the National 
Transportation Agency, the government body. I asked them about 
section 27.2, which started as a significant prejudice and later 
became substantial commercial harm. What did it mean? They 
gave us a spectrum. Maybe it was a small loss or profit or, to the 
other extreme, maybe bankruptcy and anything in between. 
Lawyers will argue this for ages and precedents will eventually be 
set.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	The government ignored that completely. It refused to do 
anything significant about section 27.2 or, more appropriately, 
remove it. Why were there all these hearings? Why was the bill 
sent to committee if the government was going to ignore what the 
public said? It then came back to this House.
<P>
	A new minister is now responsible for this bill. A lot of the 
shippers began last minute consultations because there was a new 
minister and a new chair of the committee. They said they were 
really concerned about section 27.2. The minister said that he was 
also concerned, that he had just read it and had a lot of concerns 
about it. He asked for some time to look at it because he felt 
something would have to be done about it. This was nothing more 
than a ruse.
<P>
	I offered the minister every opportunity to do something about 
section 27.2 without involving politics. I told him that if he wanted 
some co-operation to take it  back to committee and do it in an 
all-party, relatively non-partisan way, no feet to the coals and no 
saying ``I told you so, I'm right you're wrong''. I told him it should 
be done because it was the right thing to do and that he had my total 
co-operation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3151"> 3151 </A></B>
<P>
	As soon as it was time for the vote they said they did not want to 
do anything. It passed and section 27.2 is still in the bill.
<P>
	We then moved to another transport area involving the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans or, more appropriately I guess, 
the department of oceans because in order to have a department of 
fisheries there has to be fish. The user pay concept is commencing, 
the coast guard recovery fees.
<P>
	I attended the committee meetings of that department and 
listened to the witnesses talking about user pay. They recognized 
that they needed to pay and they were willing to pay. However, they 
thought the government was being a bit premature. There had been 
no cost rationalization of the coast guard and no impact study to see 
how this was going to affect them and the whole marine shipping 
strategy.
<P>
	The minister was sure that the fees were going to have an impact 
and maybe cause some traffic to be diverted to the United States, 
but he felt that after the bill was implemented an impact study 
would be done to see how much damage it had caused. That is a 
pretty bizarre way of doing it. Again, it ignores everything that 
happened in the committee.
<P>
	We now get to Bill C-20. At committee the government's 
privacy commissioner told us that he had a serious concern about 
the bill. At the present time the Privacy Act covers all the activities 
of Transport Canada in the operation of the air navigation system 
and when it is transferred to Nav Canada, a private corporation, 
that will not be the case.
<P>
	There is also employee privacy which may possibly be dealt with 
in other ways. Almost everybody who takes to the air, except for 
some local flights, and who has to file a flight plan with particular 
information, is covered by the Privacy Act now. However, they will 
not be covered under Nav Canada as it is a private corporation.
<P>
	The privacy commissioner said that it would not cost a dime and 
that the bill should include that the Privacy Act continue to apply to 
Nav Canada as if it were a crown corporation. This is the exact 
same wording that the parliamentary secretary bragged about 
tonight for the official languages. It was stated that Nav Canada, as 
a private company, still has to operate for the purposes of the 
Official Languages Act as if it were still a crown corporation.
<P>
	I put in an amendment stating exactly that. I just extended 
what it said for the Official Languages Act. I wanted NavCan to 
be covered under the Privacy Act is if it were still a crown 
corporation. It passed. That is what a  committee is supposed to 
do. It is supposed to consider these matters, listen to the 
witnesses and vote. Matters that are defeated are defeated and 
the matters that are passed are passed. My amendment passed 
and became part of the bill.
<P>
<B>(1720 )</B>
<P>
	Democracy does not live well in committees. Certain parts of the 
committee, not sitting on this side of the House, did not like that. 
Democracy be damned, so they waited until the bill came to the 
House and put forward a motion to remove the amendment that the 
committee passed in response to the witnesses that came forward. 
That is not a very good system. It does not speak well of what the 
government does in committees.
<P>
	I would like to turn now to what the Bloc said it its amendment. 
The amendment is that the bill not be read the third time because 
the air navigation system will not be safe with Nav Canada.
<P>
	I worked in the navigation system for 22 years. For all those 
years we wanted to get out of government control because it would 
be far more efficient and more technologically advanced. We could 
respond quicker to changing needs through the use of technology 
and changing conditions.
<P>
	Contrary to what the Bloc says, I believe that the system will be 
at least as safe as it is now. I do not wish to suggest for a moment 
that it is not a safe system now. However, it is not in any kind of 
danger with regard to safety whatsoever. It will be a much more 
efficient and safe system once Nav Canada takes over. Therefore I 
will not be supporting the Bloc motion.
<P>
	It will also enhance the air industry's viability. The air transport 
industry in this country is in trouble. Everyone knows about the 
clash between Air Canada and Canadian Airlines and how both of 
them are writing a lot of red ink. Perhaps that is why the 
government relates so well to them with its red ink book. They are 
in trouble. With open skies they get a lot of pressure from 
American competitors. They need to find ways to operate more 
efficiently.
<P>
	If Nav Canada can operate the system, which is made up of users 
and operators, and operate it more effectively and more efficiently 
than the government does, then that is going to save money for all 
the people involved in the industry and it will enhance that 
industry's viability.
<P>
	It will also give enhanced service and value to the travelling 
public. If NavCan can keep its costs down, better compete against 
foreign competitors, offer better fees and better opportunities to 
travellers and travel to more places, the travelling public has to 
benefit.
<P>
	Finally, it is good for the general public. The government has 
been running this system for years at a significant loss. Most 
recently with some new initiatives added toward the end of the 
system being under government control, the government was 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3152"> 3152 </A></B>
<P>
losing something in the range of $200 million a year. This adds to 
the deficit and all the associated costs that go with that.
<P>
	This is a good bill. There are some bumps in the road which the 
government could have handled a little better. If I had been in the 
government's place handling it, some things could have been done 
better. We have to move ahead. We have to recognize that the 
government needs to get out of business. The government's sole 
responsibility is regulation. It has retained all the regulatory 
controls. It will still monitor safety. It will still set standards. It will 
still ensure that those standards are kept up.
<P>
	The government has brought forward several bills in the 
transportation sector. With one exception, the Pearson airport, they 
have been relatively good bills. It is only the implementation that 
has suffered.
<P>
	I hope the government will continue to learn. I hope it will 
continue to listen, as the member for Kingston and the Islands is 
mostly doing, which is rather gratifying. When the government 
does I will be pleased to support it.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We will now move to the 
next stage of debate where members will be able to speak for 20 
minutes subject to 10 minutes of questions or comments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my speech will be quite similar to the one I made at 
second reading, since the bill before us is more or less the same, 
considering that all our amendments were defeated.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	Again, we agree with the principle of privatization. However, we 
will oppose the bill because the government did not take into 
account certain principles which we felt were important and 
rejected our amendments.
<P>
	One of these amendments had miraculously been accepted by the 
Standing Committee on Transport and we thought it would go 
through. It was an important amendment, since it provided that Nav 
Canada should, like the government did before, agree to comply 
with the Privacy Act.
<P>
	The amendment had been adopted by the committee, but the 
government tabled another amendment to counteract ours. 
Therefore, the minister rejected the recommendation of the 
transport committee, even though his party has a majority in that 
committee.
<P>
	Even so, we submitted other amendments that were all defeated. 
Let me quickly explain again what the issue was, to show the 
importance of the principle involved, and to explain why, in spite 
of our agreement in principle regarding privatization, we will have 
no choice but to vote against the bill.
<P>
	First, there is the issue of privacy which we felt very important 
and regarding which our amendment was rejected. We also asked 
that further information be provided regarding the media and other 
means of communications that Nav Canada would use to inform 
the public about its intention to change, restrict or cancel its 
services, so that interested parties can react.
<P>
	We felt it was important to specify which media should be used 
and how widespread the information should be, to ensure that 
everyone would be well informed. It would have been only natural 
to support this principle, but such was not the case. We also felt it 
was improper to have private users of Nav Canada's services pay 
for national defence, which is exempt from having to pay the fees 
involved. This situation is not reasonable. We tabled an 
amendment, but it was rejected.
<P>
	More importantly, we wanted to emphasize the spirit of this 
legislation in a preamble. This is a private organization providing a 
public service, and we wanted the preamble to say that service to 
the public should always take precedence over financial interests. 
Even this principle, which would have been stated in the bill to 
ensure better service to the public, was rejected.
<P>
	My colleague, the member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, 
drew a parallel between Nav Canada and ADM. We did not get 
together on this, but I am going to do the same thing, because the 
similarities and analogies are striking. ADM and Nav Canada were 
created by the government, more specifically the Minister of 
Transport. They are private organizations, both providing public 
services. What is now happening with ADM does not augur well 
for what may happen with Nav Canada.
<P>
	I remind members that ADM recently took a decision, the 
principle of which I will not comment on here, but I protest against 
the fact that ADM, because of the status the government has given 
it, has no obligation to release to the public the information on 
which it based its decision.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	Just a while ago, in response to a question, the minister said: 
``Yes, but there is SOPRAM''. SOPRAM has 21 members. Of 
these, seven are on the board of directors that took the decision. 
Even this organization, which is, in short, the only avenue by which 
the public may examine ADM's decisions, even the members of 
this organization are not entitled to take out the studies that ADM 
says it used in reaching its decision. They must consult them on the 
premises. So much for the public's right to information.
<P>
	So the parallel is obvious. The ability to make decisions in both 
these organizations is enormous, and the obligation to be 
accountable to the public, and to explain those decisions, is nil. It is 
therefore fairly easy to predict what might happen with Nav 
Canada. Just think  about what has just happened with ADM. I 
would imagine that Nav Canada, with the enormous powers it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3153"> 3153 </A></B>
<P>
possesses, will make the decision to do away with this service or 
that service, when it does not seem sufficiently profitable.
<P>
	As the law requires, it will publish its intention to do so in 
certain newspapers of its own choosing, according to criteria that 
are far too broad. Then, if there is no reaction, or even if there is 
one, since what is required is only to give notice, the situation will 
be judged and Nav Canada will take the decision it wanted in the 
first place, making its intentions as little known as possible and 
possibly without releasing the studies and other documents on 
which the decision was based.
<P>
	In both cases, then, we are dealing with organizations that do not 
provide the public with the services it would have received when 
the government was providing them. Privatization, in one case as 
much as the other, has the effect of cutting back on services to the 
user, a lesser view of what service is, in one case as much as the 
other. That is what we cannot accept. Needless to say, I shall be 
supporting my colleague's amendment.
<P>
	That, then, is what I had to say. Unfortunately, we cannot support 
this bill because it contains too many serious shortcomings to be 
acceptable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in the debate on this bill because it concerns the representation 
of small carriers, the subject I have given greatest consideration to. 
We were told that the small carriers were represented.
<P>
	I have here a series of facts. I have letters here. Those who are 
not familiar with the bill must understand that the government said 
it was going to privatize air services. No problem so far. For those 
who are not really familiar with air services, here is what that 
means. When a plane takes off from an airport, it must 
communicate with a control tower. Then there are the instrument 
flight rules and the pilot is in contact with other controllers whose 
job it is to direct aircraft according to the various weather 
conditions.
<P>
	The government decides to privatize these services. So far so 
good. With the state of public finances at the moment, there is 
reason to think this is very appropriate. Then the government said it 
would appoint a competent board. Given that the government does 
not necessarily know everything in this area, it appointed a board to 
look after privatizing services and then set the charges for air 
services to users. When the time came to decide who would sit on 
the board of Nav Canada, discussions were held. My remarks will 
concern the persons on this board.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	The people deciding the type of charges are probably experts in 
the area of aviation. The real problem is that, if these experts-as I 
said-are major carriers, the charges  will probably favour major 
carriers over small ones. This is my fear.
<P>
	Coming from a remote region, I can confirm that small carriers 
in such regions encounter major difficulties. Travel by air is 
important if you want to go from the Lac-Saint-Jean region to 
Montreal. Air transportation is vital for business and economic 
development in remote areas; it also creates jobs. Given the need to 
provide a high level of service despite the fairly low number of 
passengers, costs are prohibitive. Ask most of the people in my 
riding and in all the regions from Vancouver to Newfoundland and 
they will tell you that plane tickets are very expensive.
<P>
	This was the subject of a study. Every time the cost of tickets 
goes up by $1, there is a corresponding $1 drop in annual sales for 
the airline. Other modes of transportation are slower, but those who 
cannot afford to fly take the bus or the train even if it takes longer. 
But in business, time is important, time is money.
<P>
	One chamber of commerce-I think it is in Matane but I am not 
sure-asked the Quebec government whether it could give remote 
areas a subsidy allowing them to reduce their costs. As I was 
saying, air service is a key factor of economic development.
<P>
	This brings me to the squabble that surrounded the creation of 
the Nav Canada committee. As you know, sometimes it does not 
take much to provoke an outcry, but there may be cases in which 
such an outcry is justified. There are cases in which questions 
should be raised, but the issues are too complicated. That is one of 
the problems in this case; what happened is extremely complicated. 
People find it quite confusing.
<P>
	I will try to explain the situation as best I can. The people in the 
Quebec air transport industry got together. As you know, I worked 
in that sector for three years so I am quite familiar with the 
difficulties faced by small airlines. Quebec set up an association of 
small airlines called AQTA or Association québécoise des 
transporteurs aériens.
<P>
	We would have liked AQTA to sit on this committee for two 
reasons. First of all, because AQTA represents mostly small 
airlines and, second, because it represents the French fact in 
Quebec and Canada and also because it represents Quebec. I think 
it would have been important. There was a debate. They told us 
they invited us but we did not come.
<P>
	I will quote from a few articles, including a letter of opinion 
published in <I>Le Soleil</I>. This letter, from Mr. Jenner of the 
Association québécoise des transporteurs aériens or AQTA, read as 
follows: ``The privatization of Canadian air navigation services is 
turning sour. The Air Transport Association of Canada or ATAC 
has taken control of the new corporation''.
<P>
	It is important to understand that the current president of Nav 
Canada is also the president of ATAC. The acronyms are confusing, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3154"> 3154 </A></B>
<P>
but the thing to remember is that ATAC stands for the Air Transport 
Association of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	So this association is bragging, saying: ``Look, do not say that 
small carriers are not represented. Not only does ATAC have a 
representative on Nav Canada's committee, but he is the 
chairman''. The problem is, and I will come back on this later on, 
that ATAC and the AQTA are quite different in terms of 
representation.
<P>
	The article reads on: ``Ottawa has set out to privatize the entire 
Canadian air navigation system, which employs nearly 7,000 
Canadians. A non-profit organization called Nav Canada has been 
created to eventually take over the administration of this operation 
on behalf of the industry. When the users committee responsible 
for incorporating the new company was formed, AQTA stepped 
aside to let the president of ATAC represent all users. This was too 
good to be true. As soon as the incorporation committee submitted 
the first draft of the letters patent, the fighting started'', Mr. Jenner 
told the members of his association, who were gathered in Quebec 
City yesterday for their 20th annual congress.
<P>
	The article reads on: ``ATAC's president was holding the pen on 
our behalf but the fact of the matter is that he just wrote whatever 
he wanted to. He has betrayed us'', Mr. Jenner told <I>Le Soleil</I>, 
adding: ``Consequently, regional carriers are complaining about 
being completely excluded from the decision making process. 
Thus, any recommendation they may have made concerning the 
selection of board members came to naught. The president of 
AQTA had asked that Nav Canada's statutes and letters patent be 
bilingual, so as to recognize both official languages as equal, 
arguing that this was the practice in all legislation in Quebec and 
Canada. It was requested that the mission statement include a 
commitment to promote the use of the French language in air 
operations. The committee came back a week later, having settled 
the language issue. Only the company's name and corporate logo 
are bilingual''.
<P>
	So much for Canada being this great bilingual country. But this 
is another story, that I may get to debate in my future career.
<P>
	According to Mr. Jenner, ``such an attitude jeopardizes the 
headway made over the past 20 years in the fight for the use of the 
French language in the air transportation industry. What kind of 
quality of life and quality of service can we expect from Nav 
Canada's French speaking employees if management has a total 
aversion to our language?''
<P>
	Sure, it is a bilingual service, except that only the logo is. But 
that is another issue.
<P>
	Brian Jenner is concerned that small carriers are not represented 
on Nav Canada's board, particularly since the decisions that will be 
made will directly impact on the already exorbitant transportation 
costs in the regions.
<P>
	The article goes on: ``The costs of privatization are going up. 
Originally, there was talk of selling the service for an amount 
somewhere between $800 million and $1.3 billion. Now, the figure 
mentioned is $1.7 billion, possibly more. The budget of the whole 
operation was also scaled up, as well as the anticipated deficit. In 
the end, the expected savings will give way to increased operating 
costs''.
<P>
	According to Mr. Jenner, ``if regional airports are asked to be 
financially self-sufficient, it could really hurt air transport outside 
large centres. It is obvious that the Sept-Îles airport cannot 
self-finance itself; however, closing its control tower is not an 
obvious solution. There is a limit to the ability of small and 
medium size businesses to pay''.
<P>
	One problem is that if authorities find out that little use is made 
of a control tower in Sept-Îles or in northern 
Saskatchewan-because I am not merely talking about the interests 
of Quebecers but those of all small carriers in every remote 
area-if they find out you are not using your on-board 
equipment-I will spare hon. members the aviation jargon-they 
will decide to close it down because of the high costs involved. 
This is what privatization is about. If you want to keep your 
services you have to pay. How do you expect a small carrier to do 
that?
<P>
	This was a letter published in <I>Le Soleil</I>, but I have another 
article, this one from the magazine <I>Circul-Air</I>, which is a Quebec 
publication on air transportation-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, please. I would like to 
take this opportunity to remind the member for Lac-Saint-Jean that 
members may not use catalogues or other props. I would ask the 
member, if he wishes to quote from texts, to do so without a lot of 
fanfare, if I may put it that way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean):</B> My apologies, Mr. Speaker. I 
will see that it does not happen again.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	In the editorial in <I>Circul-Air</I>, Édith Fournier, the general 
manager of Air Satellite and president of the council of the 
Association québécoise des transporteurs aériens, or AQTA, said 
the following: ``In the course of the negotiations leading up to the 
privatization of air navigation services, we have heard some pretty 
strong language. John Crichton, the president of ATAC, the Air 
Transport Association of Canada-which I mentioned earlier-on 
the op-ed page of the January 4, 1996 issue of <I>Le Soleil</I>, took the 
contempt of regional bodies to new heights''.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3155"> 3155 </A></B>
<P>
	First of all, Mr. Crichton, from his lofty new perch as president 
of Nav Canada, took it upon himself to cast doubt on the accuracy 
of remarks made by Mr. Jenner, the president and CEO of AQTA 
at the association's 20th annual conference. In his article in <I>Le 
Soleil</I>, he said: ``Let us be very clear: the bitter words of Mr. 
Jenner concerning the privatization of air navigation services say 
it all. Furthermore, they are an accurate reflection of the opinion 
of AQTA, which feels that ATAC stole control of Nav Canada 
away from small and medium size businesses in the air 
transportation sector.''
<P>
	As for Mr. Crichton's remarks about breaking solidarity, of 
greater importance to members of AQTA, there is a preoccupation 
with the almighty buck, a value completely foreign to AQTA. No 
one member is more important than another in our association. I 
will explain. Furthermore, it is because of scrupulous respect for 
this principle that AQTA rallied over 50 per cent of all Quebec air 
carriers, an unheard of level of support. ATAC cannot teach us 
anything about representativity, then, with its meagre 10 per cent of 
Canadian air carriers.
<P>
	And here is where the problem lies. ATQA has more than 50 per 
cent of all carriers, whereas ATAC, which boasts that it is 
representative of all carriers, in fact represents only 10 per cent of 
them. They say ATAC is far larger. When one has on one's board 
members such as Air Canada and Canadian, which generate big 
bucks, one is capable of financing associations such as ATAC. The 
little guys are not necessary.
<P>
	That is not the case with AQTA. In AQTA, whether you are a big 
or a small carrier, it is not the amount of your dues that counts. 
What counts is that you will be defended, and your membership is 
wanted.
<P>
	Still quoting Mr. Chrichton, it appears that Mr. Jenner was the 
only one opposed to ATAC's highjacking of Nav Canada. In reality, 
there was generalized opposition by the commercial airline 
associations, so much so that they formed the council of air carrier 
associations, or CATA, another four letter acronym to add to the 
confusion. There were some air carriers in Canada who did not 
agree and who formed an association called the council of air 
carrier associations to defend themselves against the privatization 
which had been decided upon with the greatest of insensitivity to 
the opinion of small and medium size businesses.
<P>
	Through AQTA and other regional associations, the majority of 
small and medium size businesses chose to be represented by this 
CATA. Let there be no confusion. Democracy and fairness require 
that choice to be respected and not denigrated. Mr. Chrichton still 
has a long way to go in that respect.
<P>
	So that is about where the situation stands. I would have liked to 
talk of other things, including the letter from ATAC to Mr. Jenner 
inviting him to sit on the Nav Canada committee. I also have a 
letter from the AQTA, from Édith Fournier, the editorialist I have 
just referred  to, expressing great pleasure, saying: ``Yes, Mr. 
Jenner is in agreement, despite our not always agreeing on the
<P>
principle of Nav Canada, but since there was no other choice left, 
yes, we will get involved in the Nav Canada committee''. A letter 
of acceptance.
<P>
	I also have a third letter from ATAC, where the Nav Canada 
representative writes: ``unfortunately, your candidature could not 
be accepted. Thank you for your offer, but unfortunately we cannot 
take you''. And that is the end of that.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I apologize for interrupting 
the hon. member. He can go on when the subject comes back to the 
House. If he wishes to complete his remarks, he will have two or 
three minutes at most. This is at his discretion.
<P>
	In the meantime, it being 5.49 p.m., the House will now proceed 
to the consideration of Private Members' Business as listed on 
today's Order Paper.

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider amending 
the Income Tax Act to provide a caregiver tax credit for those who provide care 
in the home for preschool children, the disabled, the chronically ill or the aged.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, over the past two years I have presented a 
petition to the House of Commons which basically states that 
managing the family home and caring for preschool children is an 
honourable profession which has not been recognized for its value 
to our society. The petition also states the Income Tax Act 
discriminates against families that choose to provide care in the 
home to preschool children, the chronically ill, the disabled or the 
aged. The petition therefore calls on Parliament pursue tax 
initiatives which would do just that.
<P>
	Motion No. 30 is a votable motion of the House of Commons 
which asks the House of Commons and the government to consider 
the advisability of this motion and to provide a caregiver tax credit 
to those who choose to provide care in the home to preschool 
children, the chronically ill, the disabled or the aged.
<P>
	I will give a bit of background. Last weekend I had the 
opportunity of attending a wedding of my cousin. As they 
exchanged vows I began to consider what family really meant to 
me. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3156"> 3156 </A></B>
<P>
This is a young couple starting their lives together. I wondered 
when they exchanged their vows did they automatically become a 
family. I looked around the church and I found there were many 
children there and I realized even more that family means children.
<P>
	As I looked at my family members and relatives I saw an aunt 
whose husband had been disabled, chronically ill, and she had to 
leave her work to care for him. Tragically he passed away.
<P>
	I saw a sister who is married but who decided not to have 
children. I saw my brother who has daughters, but both he and his 
wife decided to continue their careers because a parent lived next 
door to them who could care for their daughters during their 
formative years.
<P>
	I saw my grandmother who is now 95 years old, who after my 
grandfather passed away had to leave her home because she was no 
longer able to care for it. Then she stayed with my mother. After 
some time as she needed more and more care it was evident she 
needed institutionalized care. I also saw a cousin who presently 
lives common law and who has no children.
<P>
	Then I looked at my own family. My dear wife and I will 
celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary this year. We have three 
lovely children. My wife took 13 years off from her career to help 
raise those children to be fine young people.
<P>
	The issue surrounding Motion No. 30 is family responsibilities. 
They are lifelong responsibilities, from cradle to grave. They 
reflect family values and social norms and values and choices 
related to children and other family members who may be 
chronically ill, aged or disabled
<P>
	I quote Dr. Benjamin Spock: ``Children are made to love. Parents 
love children because they remember being loved so much by their 
own parents. Despite all the hard work, taking care of children and 
seeing them grow up to develop to be fine young people gives most 
parents their greatest satisfaction in life. To reflect on children we 
se that this is creation, this is our visible immortality''.
<P>
	Dr. Penelope Leach is the author of <I>Children First</I>, a wonderful 
book which states that if couples are contemplating having 
children, one thing they must understand is they must be prepared 
to put the interests of their child ahead of their own. This is very 
difficult and in many cases not possible in today's society.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	What is the current situation in Canada with regard to families 
and children? I come across many cases in which people have said: 
``Both of us are working. We have our children in child care spaces 
but after child care expenses, after income taxes, after the cost of 
employment, my net take home pay is so small I really do not know 
why we are doing this''.
<P>
	We have a situation now in which the drop-out rate in high 
school is around 32 per cent. We have growing concern about 
young offenders and crime in general. We have concern about the 
literacy rate in Canada, which is presently at about the grade six 
level.
<P>
	In 1968, 68 per cent of families with preschool children had one 
parent staying in the home and caring for those children. 
Twenty-five years later in 1993 that reduced to only 12 per cent.
<P>
	We have social agencies everywhere for behavioural, learning 
and social skills. Schools even have full time psychologists now. 
Families are having increasing difficulty parenting their children.
<P>
	The Standing Committee on Health is presently studying 
preventive strategies for the good health of children. We heard a 
number of witnesses. I refer to a couple of the points raised.
<P>
	There was the point that quality day care cannot be provided or 
delivered without government subsidy, the reason being the 
salaries paid to qualified caregivers averages somewhere around 
only $21,000. That was presented to us by Martha Friendly of the U 
of T child resource centre. She confirmed that the demand for 
subsidized child care is much greater than the availability.
<P>
	Families are different. Choice and options are essential and 
desirable. Dr. Fraser Mustard of the Canadian Institute for 
Advanced Research also came before the committee. He told us 
about research that clearly shows there are factors occurring during 
the first three years of life that have a significant impact on the 
likelihood of positive outcomes of children, cognitive skills, social 
skills, behavioural skills, coping skills, mental and physical health.
<P>
	We also had Dr. Marc Genuis of the National Foundation for 
Family Research and Education. He told us about a meta-analysis, 
a analysis of all the studies done on this subject matter.
<P>
	He told the committee that if a child had more than 20 hours per 
week disruption of the secure attachment with the caregiver, there 
was evidence of increased likelihood of negative impact on 
socio-emotional development, behavioural bonding, consistent, 
secure attachment to an adult.
<P>
	The <I>Globe and Mail</I> April 22, 1996 reported on a U.S. study, the 
most far reaching and comprehensive dealing with the first 15 
months of infancy. It said the likelihood of a troubled mother-child 
bond can be increased by child care that is of poor quality, that 
changes several times or that extends to more than 10 hours per 
week. It also said that after the mother as primary caregiver, child 
care centres were ranked lowest in quality whereas fathers, 
relatives or other caregivers in the family home were ranked the 
highest.
<P>
	This is not a situation of black and white. This is a situation of 
probabilities. We can have many situations turning out different 
ways but we are talking about the likelihood of outcomes. It is 
important for us to ensure there are high likelihoods of positive 
outcomes for the development of our children.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3157"> 3157 </A></B>
<P>
	As legislators our job is to provide optimum flexibility to 
families to choose options suited to their situation and to their 
values.
<P>
	What if more families to could afford to provide direct parental 
care? In the short term, it would free jobs possibly for those on 
welfare or for those who really need the jobs. It would free the 
demand on child care spaces and institutionalized care spaces. It 
would reduce stress on the family and, most important, it would 
recognize the value of work in the home.
<P>
	In the recent census we included a question to get information 
about the amount of unpaid work. In the long term health, social 
and criminal costs to Canada would decrease significantly because 
of the more positive outcomes of our children.
<P>
	It would create healthier, happier families. It would allow 
families to better discharge their lifelong duties. It would be an 
investment in the healthy outcomes of our children and it would 
constitute a significant saving to the Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
<B>(1800 )</B>
<P>
	The viability of M-30 needs to be assessed not from a financial 
perspective, but from a balanced perspective, taking into account 
both social and fiscal realities. The finance minister said to the 
House in his very first speech: ``Good fiscal policy makes good 
social policy and good social policy makes good fiscal policy''.
<P>
	Now is the time to recognize that reality. Now is the time to stop 
defending the status quo based on soft mathematics. Now is the 
time to have tax reform which restores fairness and equity to all 
Canadians. Now is the time to reflect social priorities in our tax 
policy.
<P>
	The recent bill on the employment insurance program showed 
some movement on behalf of legislators in Canada to recognize the 
value of work in the home and the importance of caregiving in the 
home. That reform showed this by recognizing and offering for the 
first time training assistance and wage subsidies to parents who 
have taken parental leaves to provide that parental care.
<P>
	In October 1994 I had a private member's Bill C-256, which 
proposed income splitting between couples so that one could stay 
at home and care for preschool children. During the debate on the 
bill the finance department spokesman came before the House and 
dismissed it on the basis that the idea was too costly and because 
we had already provided many tax breaks to the family. In my view, 
no assessment of the social realities was given, no recognition to 
long term benefits and no mention of anything other than it being 
simply too costly.
<P>
	Parents know intuitively that direct parental care is optimal. In a 
recent Angus Reid survey 70 per cent of parents, where both were 
working and had preschool children, said that if they could they 
would choose to  have one stay at home to provide direct parental 
care for their child.
<P>
	I am not naive on this issue. The pie is not getting bigger. We do 
not have more money to spend. That means that we have to work 
smarter with what we have. Therefore, we need to reassess the 
propriety for existing deductions, tax credits and other tax benefits 
incorporated into the Income Tax Act. We need to establish 
whether tax breaks will be given on the basis of need and family 
income, such as is done with the old age security, the age credit and 
the new seniors' benefit which was announced in the last budget. 
We need to consolidate existing resources and allocate them to 
where we get the optimum benefit for all Canadians.
<P>
	These changes will result in stronger, healthier families. I 
believe that if the family is strong the deficit would be gone.
<P>
	The financial arguments against M-30, to provide a caregiver tax 
credit, take the narrow view of fiscal expediency and dwell on why 
we cannot rather than on how we can. I would like to give some 
examples to the House.
<P>
	The child care expense deduction in the Income Tax Act 
provides for preschool children a deduction of $5,000 per child. 
That is not available to a stay at home parent. It is only available to 
someone who actually incurs the cost and pays someone else to 
care for their child.
<P>
	What is worse is that a deduction is worth more to a high income 
earner than to a low income earner. As an example, someone who 
makes $60,000 a year and pays $5,000 for child care space receives 
a refund cheque from the government of $2,600. However, if 
someone makes only $30,000 and incurs the same $5,000 cost, 
their refund is only $1,800. That is an $800 difference when both 
taxpayers incurred the same expense for child care costs.
<P>
	I have Bill C-240 before the House which proposes to convert 
that deduction to a tax credit so that it will be equitable and fair for 
all Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	Another example would be the supplement to the child tax 
benefit, which is $213 per year, or a working income supplement, 
which could be up to $500 a year. However, these are quite 
insignificant. They would represent something like about $12 to 
$13 a week. That kind of additional assistance to couples who want 
to choose to provide direct parental care simply does not facilitate 
that choice.
<P>
	Also there is the disability tax credit, which can accumulate 
savings of some $720 to the taxpayer who is caring for a disabled 
relative or dependant. The reason that they get the savings is that 
the disability credit is transferable to the relative that is taking care 
of them. Again, this represents a very small amount of money, 
some $20 a week.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3158"> 3158 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	If Canadians were forced to provide care because they could not 
afford the cost of institutionalized care, this modicum, this very 
minuscule amount of dollars certainly is not going to deal with a 
situation that is imposed on a family. The family has that 
responsibility. Canadians want to be able to provide that kind of 
care in those situations for their family members.
<P>
	The medical expenses credit provides a 17 per cent credit for 
expenses in excess of the lesser of 3 per cent of net income or 
$1,614. This is available to all Canadians. What is not available to 
all Canadians is that those who are employed, who have employer 
paid plans, have all of their expenses covered subject to possibly 
certain deductions and there are some uninsured costs. Those 
uninsured costs then can be covered when they file their income tax 
return to claim the additional amount of the credit. Therefore, those 
who have insured plans have a better opportunity to recoup a 
greater proportion of medical expenses. That is not available to 
families who make the choice to provide care in the home to a 
family member.
<P>
	We should have a special benefit. I proposed to the finance 
minister that there should be at a point special rules for uninsured 
Canadians so they do not have to have a deductible of the first 3 per 
cent of their net income and that every dollar of medical expenses 
incurred by families that are uninsured be covered in the Income 
Tax Act.
<P>
	There is also an infirm dependant credit which could generate 
savings for a family of up to $400; again, some $8 per week.
<P>
	The finance department in the past, and I suspect today, will 
characterize the existing benefits as significant assistance to the 
family. I characterize these benefits as inadequate in the extreme.
<P>
	By investing in families through meaningful tax breaks which 
facilitate care in the home to preschool children, the chronically ill, 
the disabled or the aged, the savings to Canada in the long term 
would far outweigh the costs.
<P>
	Motion M-30 is not a simple solution to a complex problem but 
rather an opportunity for all hon. members to ask themselves 
whether we can do better. I believe that we can.
<P>
	Tax reform is an issue which I have talked about substantially in 
the House on a number of private members' bills and motions. I 
have also prepared a report which I sent to the finance minister 
before preparation of the last budget. I believe that the finance 
minister is open to suggestions on tax reform. A blue ribbon 
committee has been established to deal with the corporate 
taxation issue. I know the minister was very receptive to a 
number of the changes proposed. I am sure that the kinds of 
things that we are talking about are progressive and should be 
looked at very carefully.
<P>
	Tax reform is not an option, it is an imperative. Therefore on 
behalf of the traditional family I ask the finance minister to heed 
his own words when he said that ``good social policy makes good 
fiscal policy and good fiscal policy makes good social policy''.
<P>
	Now is the time for tax policy to reflect good social policy and 
the best interests of the Canadian family.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if you were to seek it I believe you would find unanimous 
consent for the following motion. I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That should any vote by recorded division be requested on this bill today that 
it be deferred until next Monday, June 3 at 9.30 p.m.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on first reading 
of this private member's motion, there seems no reason to oppose 
it. If I may, I will read it again, simply for those who did not hear it 
the first time.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	It reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider amending 
the Income Tax Act to provide a caregiver tax credit for those who provide care 
in the home for preschool children, the disabled, the chronically ill or the aged.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The initial reaction to this motion is to think, yes, but, if we 
support this motion, do we not run the risk of having the 
government use it as an opportunity to limit or change the benefits 
this group of persons already enjoys to ensure their quality of life?
<P>
	There is the risk that, with this measure, by granting a tax credit, 
the government will reduce old age pensions or cut certain family 
allowances currently paid for small children.
<P>
	In granting the tax credit, the government might also take away 
certain benefits accorded dependent individuals considered 
disabled.
<P>
	Our first reaction was to say that we do not want the government 
to use this as a pretext to change the situation. After due 
consideration, however, we decided it was better to support this 
motion, which has the best of intentions, by proposing an 
amendment, which I will present to you in a few minutes at the end 
of my speech.
<P>
	The purpose of this motion is not to improve the economy 
indirectly. We are not looking for ways to improve the lot of the 
unemployed or to reduce the deficit, although it would be nice to 
kill two birds with one stone.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3159"> 3159 </A></B>
<P>
	The main purpose of this motion is really to find other ways 
to assist those who have been in dire need of such help for several 
years. We are thinking in particular of preschool age children, of 
those in early childhood, as the teachers and child psychiatrists 
who deal with them like to say.
<P>
	According to the experts, it is before the age of three that 
children acquire almost all the psychological baggage they need for 
their own development.
<P>
	Some experts say that the baggage received by children during 
the first three years will reflect on the rest of their lives and 
influence all other behaviours.
<P>
	That being the case, it is important for children in that age group 
to have beside them people they can trust. These people are usually 
the mother or the father. But, when there is no mother or father 
available, there should be another adult in whom the children can 
confide, on whom they can rely every day to help in their 
development.
<P>
	The government should have recognized this a long time ago and 
taken steps so that these children can get the help and support they 
need. Unfortunately, nowadays, financially strapped couples often 
have to place their children in institutions, which, as well-meaning 
as they may be, can never replace the love of a father, mother, big 
brother, big sister, uncle, aunt or grandparents who would be 
willing to raise these children but cannot do so for lack of financial 
resources.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	A cure-all it is not but, in such cases, the tax credit could 
probably ensure that a larger number of can afford the time to do 
so. It could be that a person is looking to work outside the home to 
increase his or her self-esteem. Money is not always the only 
motivation.
<P>
	But when people want to work outside the home but are 
penalized, either because their spouse will end up paying more 
taxes as a result or because they cannot find a job they like in a 
given field, there are instances where-as the hon. member who 
spoke before me pointed out-a cousin, uncle, aunt or other family 
member, provided they are not penalized, would take on this task, 
all the more readily if a tax measure were put in place to help them 
out.
<P>
	Given a equivalent tax credit, some people may give up looking 
for a job outside the home paying $5,000, $6,000 or $10,000 a year 
to look after children.
<P>
	The same could be done for seniors. How many families are 
currently forced, again for economic reasons, to send a grandfather, 
a grandmother, a father or a mother to a seniors residence or a 
nursing home, because they do not have the time to look after 
them? Why do they not have the time? Because they must spend all 
their time earning a living to make ends meet, to provide for their 
family's needs.
<P>
	If a tax credit could be applied to the family income, that is to the 
income of the working spouse, it would enable the other spouse to 
spend some time with an older person who, instead of being sent to 
a seniors residence, would live with the family.
<P>
	The older person would not only be better off in terms of health 
care, but also in terms of his or her quality of life and psychological 
needs. Indeed, the emotional needs of seniors are met when they 
live with those they love and raised, and to whom they gave the 
greater part of their life. I am convinced that many seniors would 
then live longer because they would be in a better environment in 
terms of their emotional needs.
<P>
	For these reasons, I feel it is important to support the motion of 
the hon. member for Mississauga South. However, I would like to 
propose an amendment to ensure that, after making such a change, 
the government would not be tempted to cut other benefits already 
enjoyed by these people. As you know, a government always means 
well. However, sometimes, when faced with difficult conditions, it 
tries to make up for what it gives by taking the necessary money 
elsewhere.
<P>
	I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by adding after the word ``aged'' the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``without curtailing the assistance already provided to those individuals and to 
those groups affected by the aforesaid motion''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This amendment is seconded by the hon. member for Abitibi. I 
submit this amendment to the House, in the hope that it will 
support it, to improve the motion brought forward by the member. 
The proposed amendment takes nothing away from the motion, 
quite the contrary. It simply allows the House to have a guarantee 
that all those we want to help will be helped without curtailing 
benefits they already enjoy.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The amendment by the hon. 
member for Joliette is in order.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to address the motion put forward by the member for Mississauga 
South.
<P>
	He points out this would contemplate changes to the Income Tax 
Act which would refocus available resources to those in need. 
Additional savings would be realized by reducing demand on child 
care spaces or institutionalized services. Cutbacks at both the 
federal and provincial levels necessitate that we look for creative 
ways to provide options or more choice to families.
<P>
	Although the intentions are honourable, I feel the motion as it 
stands is vague. I missed the first part of his speech because of 
standing committee work. Unless it was pointed out earlier, it does 
not outline the amount of  the tax credit he refers to so one can 
compare it to the existing redistribution of tax dollars that we now 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3160"> 3160 </A></B>
<P>
apply to families in need, the disabled and all the people he wishes 
to assist in a greater fashion.
<P>
	From his comments, I feel there is not enough of a cost benefit 
analysis. The motion talks of the need for people to have more 
money, to have more access to funds and it is a feel good motion. 
We all want to do the things this motion puts forward.
<P>
	On a caregiver tax credit, I thought long and hard about what is a 
caregiver. A caregiver is somebody who earns money and who pays 
the bills. That is a caregiver. Whether they give the care to 
themselves as a single person, whether they give the care to a 
family of whatever size, a caregiver is someone who pays the bills. 
The existing system takes care of caregivers now because we do 
have a lot of exemptions, deductions, incentives and loopholes 
within the current system.
<P>
	However, with the vagueness in the motion it seems the member 
for Mississauga South wants to give a bigger tax credit. He lists all 
the things this bigger credit would do, if it is a bigger credit or just 
a reshuffling. It would recognize the value of work in the home. It 
would free up jobs. It would free up child care spaces, spaces in 
long term care facilities for the handicapped and the aged, provide 
the option for direct parental child care, promote financial 
independence of the spouse in the home and enhance the quality of 
life for families.
<P>
	It seems to do an awful lot of things but we do not know how 
much more we have to spend to achieve all those things. It sounds 
like the speeches I give when I talk about the flat tax and how that 
is the cure all and the end all for all our problems in this confusing 
complicated taxation system. It seems a caregiver tax credit will 
solve all our problems.
<P>
	There is no question there are some issues the member is 
seriously trying to address, and I respect his efforts to do so. We 
both had private member's bills before the House in which we were 
concerned about the discrimination against stay at home parents. 
There is no question our system encourages, forces, begs, pleads 
and wants families to have both spouses working outside the home.
<P>
<B>(1825 )</B>
<P>
	There is incentive to work outside the home. If parents each earn 
$30,000 with two children at home versus a family that chooses to 
have one spouse work outside the home making $60,000 and the 
other looking after the children and providing the care in the home, 
the difference in the family situation, same family size, same 
salary, is about $6,000 or $7,000 in taxes.
<P>
	There is discrimination against stay at home parents. In order to 
solve the problem I presented a private member's bill which would 
provide a $5,000 child care deduction for children up to age 7 and 
$3,000 between  the ages of 8 and 13. The finance department 
quickly calculated that number and the Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Minister of Finance gave a nice speech and said ``although the 
suggestion of the member for Calgary Centre is honourable and 
great, it will cost the taxpayers another $6 billion more and 
therefore we cannot do it''. So much for helping to eliminate 
discrimination against stay at home parents.
<P>
	The member for Mississauga South also put forward a bill in 
which he looked at income splitting. I believe that suffered the 
same fate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> It was not votable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> It is obvious the member is trying to find a way to get 
more money into the pockets of Canadians so they can look after 
the essentials of life, their children, the disabled and the aged and 
have more disposable income.
<P>
	The solution is not by increasing the caregiver tax credit. The 
member also hinted that the solution is tax reform. He talked about 
the blue ribbon commission which will come up with a pink ribbon 
prize, I am sure. He is encouraging the finance minister to look 
further.
<P>
	I support his efforts to eliminate discrimination against stay at 
home parents. This motion is too vague. It does not give any 
amounts and it will probably get shot down the same as my private 
member's bill did even though they both tried to do the same thing.
<P>
	He is absolutely right about the tax reform angle he talked about. 
We have to create a tax free zone and allow the first $8,000, $9,000 
or $10,000 of a person's income to be tax free. We should also 
allow that same amount for a spouse, whether or not that spouse 
works outside the home. It would be the best way to develop good 
social programs by leaving the money in the hands of the people 
who earn it.
<P>
	Currently the Reform Party is working on a simplified tax 
system in which the first $8,200 would be tax free along with 
another $8,200 for a spouse, for a total of $16,400, and $2,000 for 
each child up to age 16, which would be deductible as well. That 
would total $20,000 for a family of four which would be zero 
taxed. Anything above that 21 per cent would be revenue neutral 
and all the other exemptions and deductions for the wealthy and the 
loopholes would be gone.
<P>
	The income would be redistributed from this system of taxation 
which features a single rate through direct government spending, as 
is done through the Departments of Transport, Health or HRD. 
There would be better accountability and visibility of spending. 
That way we would get to a balanced budget faster and then we 
could decide how much more money to leave in the hands of the 
people who are suffering, the people who have specific needs for 
disabled. If they happen to be low income we could decide how 
much more we could help them. We could do it through direct 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3161"> 3161 </A></B>
<P>
grants. Social  workers in the field could find out where those 1 
million starving children are.
<P>
	We spend $9 billion on this complicated, confusing, convoluted 
tax system we have now. Through five different programs we spend 
$9 billion on children, subsidizing single parents, child care 
deductions, day care centres and there are a million children 
starving? This does not make sense to me.
<P>
	I respect the efforts and the intent of the motion. However, 
because of its vagueness and lack of a cost benefit analysis I will be 
voting against it. It must be more specific. I really believe we 
should have a system in which the money is directly given to those 
people identified as being truly in need through direct spending 
instead of this mirage of the Income Tax Act. Change it, replace it 
with a simplified flat tax. That is how we could truly solve our 
social problems and create more hope, growth and expansion in the 
economy.
<P>
<B>(1830 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, with all this talk from the member 
opposite about shooting down bills I am proud to be part of a 
government that brought in gun control.
<P>
	I am pleased to address private member's motion M-30. It asks 
the government to provide a child caregiver tax credit for those 
who look after preschool children, the disabled, the chronically ill 
or the aged in the home.
<P>
	The motion implies that the Income Tax Act somehow 
discriminates against families that make the choice to provide care 
at home for the categories of people mentioned earlier. In support 
of his motion, the member for Mississauga South implied in his 
remarks that the government does not care about families as much 
as he does. I know that is not the case.
<P>
	The motion appears to target the provision of the Income Tax Act 
which disallows the deduction of child care expenses by one 
income earner couples. The purpose of the child care expense 
deduction is to recognize for tax purposes the child care expenses 
that taxpayers must incur in order to earn income, to attend a 
recognized educational institution full time or to take an eligible 
vocational training course.
<P>
	This deduction provides a way for the tax system to 
acknowledge that those taxpayers have a lesser capacity to pay 
taxes than others with an identical income who do not have child 
care expenses. This deduction ensures up to a limit that income 
used to pay for child care expenses is not taxable.
<P>
	In order to assist parents who choose to remain at home to raise 
their preschool aged children, the federal government introduced a 
supplement to the child tax benefit. The supplement is a benefit to 
low and middle income families that have preschool aged children 
but do  not have deductible child care expenses. This year the 
supplement is $213 for each child six years old or younger and is in 
addition to the regular benefit of $1,020 per child.
<P>
	The federal government provides additional assistance to low 
income families through the working income supplement. This is a 
component of the child tax benefit. The working income 
supplement directs assistance to low income families with children 
by providing an additional annual non-taxable benefit of up to 
$500. It supplements the employment earnings of families with net 
incomes below $25,921.
<P>
	As indicated in the budget presented to the House of Commons 
on March 6, assistance to low income families will be enriched 
through a two step doubling of the working income supplement. 
The maximum annual benefit will be increased from $500 to $750 
in July 1997 and to $1,000 in July 1998.
<P>
	Recall for a moment that the motion suggests tax assistance 
should be made available to families that provide in home care for 
elderly relatives or relatives with disabilities. This already 
happens. Tax assistance for people with disabilities and for families 
caring for elderly or disabled relatives at home is provided by a 
number of existing tax measures.
<P>
	For example, significant benefits are provided to those with a 
severe and prolonged mental or physical impairment through the 
disability tax credit. This credit reduces the federal tax of claimants 
by about $720 and is equivalent to an exemption of $4,233 for 
those in the 17 per cent tax bracket.
<P>
	Where the disabled individual has little or no income, the unused 
amount of the credit may be claimed by a supporting relative. The 
ability to transfer the disability tax credit recognizes that people 
with disabilities and low incomes are often supported and cared for 
by family members.
<P>
	I will focus on another provision of the act to further indicate 
things the act already provides for the categories of people 
mentioned by the hon. member in support of this motion. The 
medical expense tax credit is another such provision. It provides 
tax relief to those with extraordinary medical expenses by 
providing a tax credit for medical expenses in excess of a certain 
percentage of a taxpayer's net income.
<P>
	The medical expense tax credit reduces the federal tax of a 
claimant by 17 per cent of qualifying unreimbursed expenses that 
exceed 3 per cent of net income or up to $1,614.
<P>
<B>(1835 )</B>
<P>
	Among the many expenses that qualify for this credit is up to 
$5,000 in respite or part time attendant care expenses. This is 
specifically intended to assist families caring for elderly or 
disabled relatives at home. Tax  assistance is provided for part time 
or temporary attendant care. Families caring for elderly relatives or 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3162"> 3162 </A></B>
<P>
relatives with disabilities may also benefit from the ability to claim 
unused amounts of the credit.
<P>
	Individuals supporting relatives with a disability may also claim 
the infirm dependant credit. This credit was significantly enriched 
in the budget presented to the House on March 6, 1996.
<P>
	According to the income of the dependant, this credit reduces the 
federal tax of a supporting relative by up to $400 and is equivalent 
to a deduction of as much as $2,352 for those with incomes in the 
17 per cent tax bracket.
<P>
	Through all of these measures, the federal tax system provides a 
significant amount of tax assistance to families that decide to 
provide care in the home for preschool aged children, the disabled 
and the elderly.
<P>
	I have given the House this evening a great deal of information 
about various programs which are already contained in the Income 
Tax Act. An hon. member opposite asked about cost. Let me state 
for the record that the programs I have outlined already provide 
$1.4 billion in support to families that decide to provide care in the 
home for preschool aged children, the disabled and the elderly. 
These are substantial amounts of money available to families that 
support the disabled and the elderly. One of the problems with the 
hon. member's motion is that we do not know what it would cost.
<P>
	I urge the House to withhold support for private member's 
Motion No. 30.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President 
of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure this 
evening to speak to Motion No. 30. I welcome the opportunity to 
speak to the motion which was put forward by my hon. friend, the 
member for Mississauga South.
<P>
	The motion asks the government to provide a caregiver tax credit 
for those who provide care in the home for preschool aged children, 
the disabled, the chronically ill and the elderly. The tax system 
already provides a significant amount of assistance to families that 
provide care in the home for their dependants.
<P>
	For parents with children, the child care expense deduction helps 
those with modest incomes with child care expenses they incur 
while at work, attending school full time or taking an eligible 
vocational training course.
<P>
	The supplement to the child tax benefit helps parents who choose 
to remain in the home to raise their preschool children. It provides 
assistance to low and middle income families that have preschool 
aged children but do not have deductible child care expenses.
<P>
	This year the supplement is $213 for each child who is six years 
old or younger and is in addition to the regular benefit of $1,020 for 
each child.
<P>
	The working income supplement, the WIS, a component of the 
child tax benefit, helps low income working families meet some of 
the extra costs related to earning employment income, such as child 
care and transportation to work. It is a non-taxable benefit of up 
to $500.
<P>
	Changes introduced in the 1996 budget will double this 
supplement to $1,000 by 1998, increasing the benefits to more than 
700,000 working families by an average of $350 a year. While the 
WIS is available to two-income families, it is also available to the 
single earner families where one spouse stays at home as a 
caregiver.
<P>
	For people with disabilities and families caring for elderly or 
disabled relatives, the disability tax credit provides significant 
benefits to those with a severe and prolonged mental or physical 
impairment. The credit reduces the federal tax of claimants by 
about $750 and is equivalent to an exemption of $4,235 for those in 
the 17 per cent tax bracket. The unused amount of the credit can be 
transferred to the supporting relative to recognize that people with 
disabilities and low incomes are often supported and cared for by 
family members.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	The medical expense tax credit provides tax relief for those with 
extraordinary medical expenses by providing a tax credit for 
medical expenses in excess of a certain percentage of a taxpayer's 
net income. Among the many expenses that qualify for this credit is 
up to $5,000 in respite, or part time attendant care expenses. This is 
specifically intended to help families caring for elderly or disabled 
relatives at home by providing tax assistance for part time or 
temporary attendant care. Families who care for elderly or disabled 
relatives can claim the unused amounts of the credit.
<P>
	Individuals supporting relatives with a disability can also claim 
the infirm dependant credit which was significantly enriched in the 
1996 budget. Depending on the income of the dependant, the credit 
reduces the federal tax of a supporting relative by up to $400 and is 
equivalent to the deduction of up to $2,353 for those with incomes 
in the 17 per cent bracket.
<P>
	Through all these measures the federal tax system provided $1.4 
billion in tax assistance in 1996 to families with preschool aged 
children, the disabled and the elderly.
<P>
	My colleague's motion to introduce a caregiver tax credit does 
not indicate how much such a credit would cost taxpayers, nor are 
there sufficient details to estimate the proposed cost. If the 
proposed credits were to cost more than the current level of tax 
assistance, the government would have to reduce spending on other 
programs in order to avoid an increase in the deficit.
<P>
	For these reasons the government cannot support private 
member's Motion M-30.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3163"> 3163 </A></B>
<P>
	On another note, there is no question that all of us would like 
to have a perfect family situation. We would like to have children 
reared in an environment that is caring and nurturing, where they 
get all the tools they require to become good citizens. The 
government works on many fronts. There are moneys in the 
Department of Health. There are moneys in the HRD department. 
There are income tax benefits. All of these are used collectively 
to try to improve the situation of Canadian families.
<P>
	Where children are reared properly with a lot of nurturing and 
caring there is certainly a good community. If we travel around this 
world and see an environment where people are doing well, where 
there are many jobs and the environment is good there is less 
crime. When a country is functioning properly children are treated 
properly. They get the correct nurturing, they get the correct 
education and they develop. A country's chief resource is its 
people. It is people and ideas. It is not physical structures.
<P>
	I like the general objectives of the motion of my colleague, the 
member for Mississauga South but obviously there are 
mechanisms currently within the system. After the deficit is looked 
after we may be able to look in that direction in the future.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is the House ready for the 
question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
<B>(1845 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The question is on the 
amendment. Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the 
amendment?

	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="QUEBECBRIDGE">QUEBEC BRIDGE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on April 30 I put a 
question to the Minister of Transport about the Quebec bridge. As 
the reply did not satisfy me or the people of the Quebec City area, I 
hope that I will receive a better answer today from the minister or 
his representative.
<P>
	Members will remember my question. In earlier replies, the 
minister kept repeating: ``The Quebec bridge belongs to CN, and 
CN is now a private company. Since it is a private company, I, as 
the Minister of Transport, have no responsibility''.
<P>
	This is precisely what we want to challenge. In my question, I 
referred to the bridge between New Brunswick and Prince Edward 
Island, in which the federal government has invested $2.1 billion, 
although it is being built by a private enterprise, a consortium. We 
were trying to show that there was a double standard. After all, the 
Quebec City area has six times the population of Prince Edward 
Island.
<P>
	Today, I would like to argue my point, since we have a few 
minutes. Why should the federal government continue? It cannot, 
in our view, invoke the transfer of responsibility to CN because of 
privatization for the following reasons.
<P>
	CN was to receive in exchange for one dollar lands worth $30 
million for reconstruction and architectural restoration of the 
Quebec bridge, according to an agreement entered into in July, 
1993. Earlier this year it was learned that Jocelyne Bourgon, of the 
Privy Council, the highest public servant in that body, had stated in 
a December 1993 letter to the Quebec deputy minister of transport, 
Mr Lalande, that the land would be fully transferred to CN only 
over a five year period.
<P>
	In addition, the grant deed was signed only on November 7, 1995 
by the federal Minister of Transport. This means, therefore, that the 
lands will not be fully deeded over the CN before November of the 
year 2000. The considerable neglect of the bridge occurred during 
the time that the federal government was still the owner.
<P>
<B>(1850)</B>
<P>
	By 1998, the federal government will have invested, and I give 
you these figures just as an example, $250 million in the 
Champlain bridge and the Jacques-Cartier bridge, both located in 
the province of Quebec. So, we think the federal government 
should do the same for the Quebec bridge.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3164"> 3164 </A></B>
<P>
	Contrary to what the minister stated, the Government of Quebec 
has indicated that it was ready to reopen the agreement concerning 
vehicular traffic on the bridge, provided the federal government 
also makes a commitment within an agreement with both the CN 
and the Quebec Department of Transport.
<P>
	The Quebec Department of Transport is ready to provide $1.5 
million a year, over the next 16 years, even if its current 
contribution is only $25,000. Also, earlier this year, the Quebec 
bridge was designated a historic national landmark by the Minister 
of Canadian Heritage. Soon, Unesco will be designating the bridge 
as a world heritage site.
<P>
	Under these circumstances, I do not think the federal 
government can argue that it is no longer its responsibility, as I said 
at the beginning, since it has yet to meet all the commitments it 
made to the CN.
<P>
	Therefore, I would ask the representative of the minister not to 
give us the same arguments the minister used to turn down my 
request and to tell us if he has found the time, since the last time I 
asked a question on this issue, to meet with the Quebec Minister of 
Transport, who I know is very willing to do something about this 
whole situation.
<P>
	I think the argument he used in his answer was also suitably 
addressed. So, can the federal government tell us what it intends to 
do about repairs to the Quebec bridge?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I consider it a privilege to address 
the question from the hon. member for Lévis concerning the 
government's responsibility for the Quebec bridge. I have had the 
occasion to drive over the magnificent structure and I have had the 
opportunity to be on a boat and pass under this historic landmark.
<P>
	The hon. member for Lévis can ask the question time and time 
again, but we cannot change the facts. The Quebec bridge has been 
conveyed to CN along with other entrusted properties. In return, 
CN accepted a number of commitments, including as the new 
owner of the bridge, responsibility for a major maintenance 
program. CN is also committed to the 1993 agreement which 
transfers to it approximately 78,000 acres by July 1998 and not the 
year 2000 as was suggested by the hon. member for Lévis.
<P>
	Despite the fact that the lands are located in six different 
provinces and jurisdictions, I am pleased to report that CN has 
made significant progress. Close to 20,000 acres have already been 
transferred.
<P>
	Let me remind the hon. member that CN as owner of the bridge 
must restore this magnificent structure in order to ensure its long 
term viability. I reiterate that the bridge is CN's responsibility and I 
am confident it will fulfil its commitment as owner. CN has issued 
tenders  already for more than $1.5 million worth of work which 
will be undertaken this summer. There will be other significant 
expenditures by the company in the future.
<P>
	As the hon. member is aware, the deteriorating physical 
appearance of the bridge is due in large part to the thousands of 
vehicles, the vehicular traffic that uses it daily. The hon. member 
should urge his provincial colleagues to acknowledge that the 
bridge's main purpose is a highway linking the north and south 
shore. He should urge his provincial counterparts to sit down with 
CN to negotiate an accelerated maintenance program that will see 
the main users pay a fair share.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The motion to adjourn the 
House is now deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, this 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.55 p.m.)
