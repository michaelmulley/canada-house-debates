from the hon. member for Sarnia-Lambton and I propose to hear 
that before we proceed with any other business.

	<B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise this morning on a question of privilege concerning the 
cancellation of private members' hour today.
<P>
	I learned yesterday afternoon that the member for Vancouver 
North, whose motion appeared at position number one for today, 
had notified the office of Private Members' Business that he would 
not be appearing. I spoke with the hon. member this morning and in 
fact he had notified that office at the opening hour, 9 a.m. yesterday 
morning.
<P>
	Prior to that I had a bill put on the order of precedence, as 
published yesterday in the Order Paper at No. 28. It was submitted 
to the private members' office at 5.55 p.m. Wednesday evening. I 
advised the clerk that if a substitution was to be made that I was 
looking for one. The next morning at 9 a.m. the clerk was advised.
<P>
	Standing Order 94(1) states that ``the Speaker shall make all 
arrangements necessary to ensure the orderly conduct of Private 
Members' Business, including ensuring that all members have not 
less than 24 hours' notice of items to be considered during private 
members' hour''.
<P>
<B>(1005 )</B>
<P>
	As of yesterday morning at 9 a.m., notice had been given. In fact 
on the evening prior, at approximately 5.55 p.m., notice had been 
given of a bill on the Order Paper that was published yesterday. At 
no time did I receive from that office an opportunity to be 
substituted or to be placed on the Order Paper for today. I 
appreciate that the rules also say that a member will give 48 hours' 
written notice.
<P>
	I want to suggest to you, Mr. Speaker, that is one test. However, 
there are other tests. Certainly the office had more than 24 hours to 
contact other people and to ensure that the orderly conduct of 
private member's hour would continue.
<P>
	Although 48 hours is one point, 24 hours is another point. 
Somewhere in that 24 hour interval there was opportunity. The 
office did know I was looking for a substitution. Had I been offered 
that place, it would have meant the rules requiring that 24 hours' 
notice be given and would have been published yesterday at 6 p.m.
<P>
	I would suggest that as a result of this that my rights and my 
privileges have been usurped. In fact it is within your authority, Mr. 
Speaker, to do one of two things. Either to cancel the continuation 
of government business at 1.30 p.m. today, or to add a private 
member's hour following that one hour that has been apparently 
removed at this point.
<P>
	I should point out that the bill to which I am referring has passed 
through the House, has passed through the Senate and only needs to 
come back on the Order Paper here. Notwithstanding the fact that 
the 48 hour notice has not been complied with in the sense of 
Standing Order 94(2)(a), that the orderly conduct of business could 
have continued. The 24 hour notice provision would have been 
complied with.
<P>
	The 48 hour notice is not a precedent in the sense that a member 
must give written notice. I am advised that often members will call 
from distant places and say: ``By the way I am not going to be 
there''. Someone may call on a Monday from some remote place in 
the world and say he or she is not going to be here and not be able to 
provide written notice to the clerk, who on many occasions has 
acted. They have I understand also acted in terms of this window of 
opportunity being the point between 24 and 48 hours.
<P>
	It is on that basis that I suggest to you, Mr. Speaker, that my 
privileges have been usurped and I ask for this extension or 
substitution of government business from 1.30 p.m. to 2.30 p.m.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think 
the hon. member for Sarnia-Lambton has raised a very important 
point in his question of privilege. Private Members' Business is a 
when we bring material to this House which we take very seriously.
<P>

<P>
	The fact that I cancelled my appearance today on a private 
member's bill was actually done as a form of protest because my 
bill is non-votable.
<P>
	The member for Sarnia-Lambton has a votable piece of 
material, and notwithstanding the Standing Orders and a ruling that 
you might make in connection with that, I would also like to 
suggest that perhaps in the process that is going on here we may be 
able to get unanimous consent of the House to do a substitution and 
to meet the needs of the hon. member.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I take it as part of my duties as your Speaker to 
ensure that there is a reasonable continuation of business in the 
House.
<P>
<B>(1010 )</B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Sarnia-Lambton has quoted the passages 
in the rules which are germane to this point of privilege. The hon. 
member puts forward in his argument that he was not contacted24 hours prior to the period or surely he would have agreed to have 
his bill brought forward. I believe this is in Standing Order 94(1). If 
I am off on the number the clerks will correct me.
<P>
	In Standing Order 94(2) of the rules of the House, which were 
established by us together in concert, it is quite clear that the 
Speaker should have notice some 48 hours prior to making any 
move. The reason the Speaker is given the 48 hours is so that he 
will be able to contact the member at least in the next 24 hours to 
have this member bring forward his bill.
<P>
	The hon. member argues that sometimes written notice is not 
given. In my short experience here and because of the faxes that we 
now have, when a member calls to say he or she cannot bring 
forward a bill, we usually ask that a fax be sent and usually that is 
done.
<P>
	Be that as it may, the rules are quite explicit. They state that 
notification should be given to the table officers, who will then 
inform the Speaker, so that there can be an orderly procedure in 
Private Members' Business.
<P>
	I would rule that the Speaker did not get the 48 hours' notice and 
therefore I did not order the clerks to give the hon. member 24 
hours' notice.
<P>
	The hon. member for North Vancouver is here. He also confirms 
that he did not give the Chair 48 hours' notice.
<P>
	What I find interesting in this whole matter is that you and the 
hon. member for North Vancouver are both here and you both seem 
to agree that this would be acceptable to the two of you. The 
suggestion put by the hon. member for North Vancouver might be 
the way to get around it. I will not take it upon myself to rule that 
your particular bill be ordered, but if you would care to put forward 
a request for unanimous consent that your bill be debated today, I 
would be interested in receiving such a request.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gallaway:</B> Mr. Speaker, I ask the House for unanimous 
consent to have a private members' hour today from 1.30 p.m. to 
2.30 p.m.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Does the hon. member have the permission of the 
House to put forth the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> There is no agreement. Therefore, we will not 
proceed with this point.

	The House proceeded to the consideration of Bill C-92, an act to 
amend the Income Tax Act, the Income Tax Application Rules and 
another act related to the Income Tax Act, as reported (with 
amendments) from the committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Zed:</B> Madam Speaker, I understand there is unanimous 
agreement that the third reading stage of Bill C-92 may be 
considered as soon as the second reading stage is completed.

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Is there 
unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.)</B> moved that the

<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to 
debate Bill C-92, the Income Tax Budget Amendments Act, 1996.
<P>
	When I last addressed the House on Bill C-92 it was to 
recommend that it be sent to committee prior to second reading. It 
is important to note, therefore, that the House finance committee 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9921"> 9921 </A></B>
<P>
recommended 13 amendments when it reported on the bill. All of 
them were technical in  nature and were the result either of 
consultations or improvements in the wording of the relevant 
provisions. For example, there were some wording changes 
relating to labour sponsored venture capital corporations and 
resource properties.
<P>
	There were also two amendments in the area of child support to 
help ensure that payments made after April 1997 were subject to 
the new system in accordance with the policy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would now like to make some observations about the context in 
which the proposed tax measures are situated.
<P>
	In the present era of global changes, which have left many 
Canadians feeling insecure, the 1996 budget introduced measures 
in a number of areas that were designed to safeguard the future of 
Canada.
<P>
	First were measures to safeguard our financial future, with 
guarantees that we would reach and even exceed our goals for 
public finances; in the same breath, we defined a role for 
government that meets the needs of the modern economy and of the 
federation.
<P>
	We also took action to ensure the preservation of our social 
programs, including the old age security system and the offer of 
stable federal funding for programs administered by the provinces.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We invested in the future by reallocating money to priority areas 
for future jobs and growth, priorities like youth, technology and 
international trade. In the area of taxation perhaps the most 
noteworthy point is what we did not do. Despite the enormity of the 
fiscal challenge that faced us, a challenge we have continually 
handled with credibility and success, we did not increase tax rates 
in the budget, not personal, not corporate, not excise.
<P>
	The government recognizes that taxes in Canada are higher than 
any of us would like. Fiscal turnaround is vital so that we can free 
up resources to ease the tax burden when it is responsible to do so. 
In the interim the government has made it a key priority to meet or 
better its fiscal targets without increasing personal income tax rates 
in any of the four budgets it has brought before the House.
<P>
	Taxation is not only about generating revenues. It is also a matter 
of economic efficiency and fairness. That is why the 1996 budget 
undertook a number of important tax initiatives to enhance the 
fairness of the system and to ensure that it operates as effectively as 
possible.
<P>
	Let me briefly outline a number of measures we are proposing in 
the bill before us today. In the area of personal income taxation 
several important changes concern the system for providing tax 
assistance to retirement savings. Specifically the budget proposed 
three measures affecting registered pension plans, RPPs, and 
registered retirement savings plans, RRSPs.
<P>
	As the finance minister said at the time of the budget, Canada's 
retirement assistance program is effective and the government is 
firmly committed to its preservation.
<P>
<B>(1020 )</B>
<P>
	The proposed changes will help to ensure the sustainability of 
the program by limiting its costs while at the same time better 
targeting assistance to modest and middle income Canadians.
<P>
	First, RRSP limits are to be frozen at $13,500 through the year 
2003 and then increased to $14,500 in 2004 and $15,500 in 2005. 
To provide comparable treatment to define benefit pension plans, 
the maximum pension limit for these plans will be frozen at the 
current level of $1,722 per year of service until the year 2005.
<P>
	This change will keep the cost of the tax deferral for retirement 
savings in line and more fairly targeted. The federal revenue cost of 
this assistance is significant, amounting to nearly $16 billion in 
1993.
<P>
	Even with the changes the system will remain a generous one 
extending to twice the average wage. This means that only 
individuals with incomes over $75,000 a year will be affected in 
any way.
<P>
	The second measure relating to retirement savings is the 
reduction in the age limit for maturing RPPs and RRSPs from age 
71 to 69. In other words, individuals will not be able to contribute 
to RRSPs or accrue pension benefits after age 69 and will have to 
start drawing income out of these plans by the end of the year in 
which they turn 69. This change will help move the maturation age 
for retirement savings and pension plans closer in line to the ages at 
which most Canadians are retiring.
<P>
	I pause here to say that contrary to the assertion that some have 
made about this change, it does not remove incentives to save in 
RRSPs, private pension plans or other retirement income vehicles. 
Canadians will always be better off saving for their retirement and 
using these vehicles as one way to do so.
<P>
	Third, the bill proposes the elimination of the seven-year limit 
on carrying forward any unused portion of maximum allowable 
RRSP contribution. I am sure most of us can relate to the fact many 
younger Canadians have difficulty making significant RRSP 
contributions, especially during the years when they are raising 
families. This proposed change will improve the opportunity for all 
Canadians to benefit from the RRSP system. People will now have 
an unlimited time, within age limits of course, to make up for years 
of lower contributions. That is an important change.
<P>
	The bill addresses another vital area for saving for the future, 
registered education savings plans or RESPs. Canadians know that 
a better education means a better job and the Government of 
Canada knows that to prepare Canadians for the 21st century we 
must support their efforts to secure a good education. Hence in both  
the 1996 and 1997 budgets the federal government increased tax 
assistance to students and their families. RESPs are an important 
mechanism that assists parents or grandparents to save for 
children's education. They do so by exempting the growth of assets 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9922"> 9922 </A></B>
<P>
within the RESP from taxation. Eventually this growth is 
distributed to students who are typically taxed at a low marginal 
rate.
<P>
	The bill before us proposes to increase the annual contribution 
limit from $1,500 to $2,000 per beneficiary. It will increase the 
lifetime limit from $31,500 to $42,000.
<P>
	As most hon. members will recall, the 1997 budget proposed to 
enhance tax assistance delivered through RESPs further still, 
notably by doubling the annual contribution limit to $4,000 per 
beneficiary and by improving the potential flexibility of these 
plans.
<P>
	Two further elements of today's legislation recognize the 
increasing importance in the cost of education. First, the bill 
proposes to increase the amount on which the education tax credit 
is calculated from $80 to $100, an amount that the 1997 budget has 
proposed to increase still further.
<P>
	Second, the bill will increase from $4,000 to $5,000 per year the 
limit on the unused tuition fees and education amounts that 
students may transfer to spouses or parents. Once again this 
measure would be enhanced by the proposals of the 1997 budget 
which would allow students to carry forward those unused 
amounts.
<P>
	Many of the individuals who need training or retraining to make 
the most of the opportunities in today's economy already have 
young families to care for. For many of them, especially single 
parents, school is not an option without day care for their children. 
That is why today's bill proposes to broaden eligibility for the child 
care expense deduction by allowing parents who are full time 
students to claim the deduction against all types of income.
<P>
	I should mention that the bill would also raise the age limit for 
children for whom child care expenses may be claimed from age 14 
years up to age 16 years, thereby providing increased tax savings 
for families with older children.
<P>
<B>(1025 )</B>
<P>
	A further measure in the bill that will benefit taxpayers with 
children is the change to the rules governing child support. 
Specifically the bill provides that child support paid under a court 
order or written agreement after April 1997 not be deductible by 
the payor or included in the recipient's income. This change 
reflects the widely held view that the old system of deduction and 
inclusion was not working to benefit children.
<P>
	I remind my hon. colleagues this tax measure is one element in 
the larger child support package which recently received 
parliamentary approval. In addition to  the tax changes in the bill, 
the package includes guidelines to set fair and consistent support 
awards, new measures to enforce child support orders and, as 
announced in the 1997 budget, an enrichment of the child tax 
benefit. Education and child care are important components of the 
economic and social infrastructure for tomorrow.
<P>
	I will now turn to to another keystone of Canadian society, the 
charitable sector. That sector is playing an increasingly important 
role in meeting the needs of Canadians. The government 
recognizes the importance of giving charities the tools they need to 
accomplish their important work. For that reason the 1996 budget 
increased from 20 per cent to 50 per cent the annual limit on the 
amount of taxpayer net income eligible for tax assisted charitable 
savings. Once again I remind hon. members that the 1997 budget 
has gone further, substantially increasing tax incentives for 
charitable giving.
<P>
	I will skim over some of the other major measures included in 
the bill beginning with labour sponsored venture capital 
corporations. These funds sponsored by labour organizations help 
improve access to capital for small and medium size businesses 
and thereby contribute to job creation. Generous federal and 
provincial tax credits have helped LSVCCs attract large amounts of 
venture capital, so large in fact that by the time of the 1996 budget 
they had a more than three-year supply of capital. Given this level 
of capital accumulation, measures were warranted to keep the level 
of special tax assistance in these funds in line with current fiscal 
realities.
<P>
	Consequently today's bill proposes reducing the federal LSVCC 
tax credit from 20 per cent to 15 per cent, reducing the maximum 
purchase eligible for the credit from $5,000 to $3,500 and not 
permitting a taxpayer to claim the federal LSVCC credit for three 
years after he or she has redeemed an LSVCC share.
<P>
	The bill also includes important measures for the energy and 
resource sectors, for the oil, gas and mining industries. The bill 
modifies rules relating to the resource allowance thereby resulting 
in a more stable and consistent tax structure. For the oil, gas and 
mining industries the bill proposes significant improvements to the 
flow through share regime.
<P>
	Flow through shares are an important mechanism for financing 
exploration and development programs in these resource 
industries, as they can be used to accelerate deductions for such 
expenses. Companies issuing flow through share which incur 
exploration and development expenses within the first 60 days of a 
calendar year can renounce those expenses which are then treated 
as having been incurred by the flow through share investor in the 
previous calendar year.
<P>
	Consultations with the industry have indicated that the 60-day 
limit was too restrictive and encouraged  corporations to make 
economically inefficient decisions. Accordingly the bill would 
allow the issuing company a full calendar year to incur and 
renounce the exploration expenses. In return for this accelerated 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9923"> 9923 </A></B>
<P>
deduction, however, the issue will be required to pay a monthly 
financing charge to the government.
<P>
	Among the other provisions of the bill is a change to the 
accelerated cost allowance rules for new mines including oil sands 
which will ensure that all types of oil sands recovery projects are 
treated more consistently. The bill also includes measures to 
designed to promote sustainable development of energy resources 
by providing an essentially level playing field between certain 
renewable and non-renewable energy investments.
<P>
	One measure is to create a Canadian renewable energy and 
conservation expenses category in the tax system. The second 
measure is to extend the use of flow through share financing 
currently available for non-renewable energy and mining and 
similar costs for certain renewable energy and energy conservation 
projects.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	With this, I will conclude my overview of the measures 
addressed in the bill under consideration today. These measures are 
equitable and will make it possible to improve the effectiveness of 
the tax system. Several of these measures, by their very nature, 
eliminate constraints, and many Canadians have already benefited 
from the provisions of this bill.
<P>
	These measures will help Canadians prepare for the future in a 
world that is constantly evolving, by stimulating job creation, 
education and charitable donations, among other important sectors 
of activity.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	The measures in the bill under study reflect the values and 
expectations of the Canadian people. As their elected 
representatives, it is our responsibility to respect these values and 
expectations.
<P>
	Accordingly, I have no hesitation in urging my colleagues to 
support this bill in its entirety and to give it speedy passage.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, essentially, Bill C-92, which is aimed at 
amending the Income Tax Act and the Income Tax Application 
Rules, is intended to bring the Income Tax Act into line with the 
decisions in the 1996 budget.
<P>
	In both the 1996 and the 1997 budgets, there is, essentially, 
nothing new. In fact, just recently, we learned that the anticipated 
$19 billion deficit will actually be far lower than that, after 11 
months of operation. The deficit is, in fact, less than $8 billion, 
which means that the Minister of Finance will have an enormous 
amount of money to work with in the coming months.
<P>
	Where does this come from, one might wonder. The announced 
objective of the cuts in government spending,  in operating 
expenditures, not having been met, where does this enormous sum 
we are speaking of today come from?
<P>
	We know that there are, essentially, two sources: the $4.5 billion 
in cuts in transfers to the provinces, or in other words $4,500 
million, and the $5,000 million they garnisheed from collective 
wages via the unemployment insurance account. We know that 
these two, the cuts to provincial transfer payments and the lifting of 
wages from the unemployment insurance fund, essentially account 
for 84 per cent of the deficit reduction. So it is the unemployed, the 
sick, the welfare recipients and the students who will bear the brunt 
of this deficit reduction.
<P>
	With reference to the cuts in transfers to the provinces, we will 
remember the commitments made by the Prime Minister on 
<I>Canada AM</I> on October 20, 1993. I am translating what he said in 
English, which we can presume means the same in French. Here is 
what he said on October 20, 1993: ``We said in our platform we do 
not intend to reduce the transfer payments. What I said in the 
program, and I intend to keep my word, is we do not intend to cut 
further''. That was said less than a week before the last election.
<P>
	A few months after the election, on April 19, 1994, the Minister 
of Finance told the <I>Toronto Star</I> that the next federal budget would 
include drastic cuts to assistance to the provinces for such things as 
health, welfare and education. This is exactly the opposite of what 
the Prime Minister had said.
<P>
	There will be an election shortly. I hope people will remember 
that, when this government makes promises, even just a week 
before an election, it has no intention whatsoever of keeping them. 
The cuts to the transfer payments to the provinces mean, for 
Ontario as well as for Quebec, that drastic cuts are now being made 
in health care, payments to welfare recipients, and education.
<P>
	It must be clearly understood that these cuts are inevitable, and 
are the result of cuts to transfer payments from the federal to the 
provincial governments. I know that some of my fellow Quebecers 
are still saying: ``Yes, but the federal government gives us money''. 
There have been no cuts in federal funding, for what the federal 
government is doing with its transfer payments, in actual fact, is 
returning to us part of what we send to the government in Ottawa, 
$30 billion annually.
<P>
	As well, the government dips into the unemployment insurance 
fund to the tune of $5 billion, when it contributed not one red cent 
of that.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	As you know, the money in the unemployment insurance fund is 
basically the money put into the fund by workers and their 
employers. There is not one cent of the government's money in the 
fund. However, $5 billion was taken out of the unemployment 
insurance  fund to balance the books, and that is why the Minister 
of Finance now has this extraordinary flexibility. That flexibility 
exists at the expense of the little guy, the sick, people on welfare 
and the unemployed, the unemployed whom the Prime Minister not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9924"> 9924 </A></B>
<P>
so long ago described as useless beer drinkers sprawling in front of 
the TV. And the result has been to create massive poverty in 
Canada and Quebec.
<P>
	They know perfectly well that thousands of people will no longer 
be eligible for unemployment insurance and will have to go on 
welfare. But before they go on welfare, they have to exhaust all 
their resources, everything they have, until they have nothing left. 
This is now happening to thousands of people in Canada and 
Quebec. This wage grab and cuts in transfers to the provinces have 
caused poverty levels to rise dramatically.
<P>
	Meanwhile, the government is doing nothing to reduce tax 
expenditures. Nothing was done in 1996 and nothing has been done 
in 1997. Perhaps I may explain, as I did recently, what a tax 
expenditure is.
<P>
	Obviously, if tomorrow the government decided to send a 
cheque for $100 million each to 10 different companies, people 
would hit the roof. There would be headlines in the newspapers, 
and the public would know the government is doing something that 
makes no sense at all.
<P>
	A tax expenditure occurs when instead of sending a cheque for 
$100 million, $50,000 or whatever to a company, the government 
tells the company it owes so much in taxes but does not have to pay 
them. It amounts to the same thing for the company, which will 
save $50,000. And it amounts to the same thing for the 
government, which instead of receiving a cheque for $50,000, will 
have a shortfall of $50,000. However, there will not be the same 
public outcry.
<P>
	Sure, if the government wrote cheques to companies every day, 
it would be in the headlines. But if it is a tax deduction on a 
company's more or less confidential tax return, the public does not 
see that. In other words, tax expenditures represent money that is 
not collected, although it should be, from companies or the public.
<P>
	The Auditor General of Canada gave a good example of a tax 
expenditure not long ago when he revealed that a family trust went 
to the United States with the blessing of Revenue Canada under 
very dubious circumstances. The Auditor General said at the time, 
very diplomatically, that the company and those who made the 
decision to let the trust go, had, as it were, frustrated the intent of 
the legislator. In other words, they were breaking the law. That was 
the opinion of the Auditor General of Canada.
<P>
	So a family trust left the country with $2 billion on which no 
income tax was paid. It is estimated that between $400 million and 
$500 million in taxes should have been paid. Of course, if the 
government had written  a cheque for $400 million or $500 million 
in this country and sent it to this family trust or to the two trusts 
which, in fact, belong to the same person, the public would have 
been outraged. The Auditor General explained how this happened, 
the details were published, it was in the headlines for one day, but 
no one talked about it again. Why? Because tax expenditures are so 
complex.
<P>
	You may recall certain tax commitments in the red book. On 
page 19, we read:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A number of government programs and tax expenditures-some of which have 
been identified by the Auditor General-are inefficient, poorly managed, or driven 
for purely political reasons. Just as we are proposing new measures to grow the 
economy, we will examine such programs with the objective of reducing waste and 
inefficiency and promoting economic growth.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That was the commitment.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	And then there was the report of the auditor general on family 
trusts and the Liberals' reaction in the finance committee. Each of 
them took a turn sniping at the auditor general for having criticized 
the fact that the trusts had hot footed it out of the country without 
paying taxes.
<P>
	That is precisely the role of the auditor general. He is the public 
watchdog. When we criticize the government, we are partisan, 
clearly. When the auditor general does so, we can assume generally 
that he is non partisan. The Liberals took pot shots at the auditor 
general for criticizing the family trusts I referred to earlier.
<P>
	So, as we realize, there is no deficit problem in Canada. We are 
reducing the deficit far faster than we had anticipated in our 
objectives. The Minister of Finance has a lot of manoeuvring room. 
We therefore have no deficit problems in the short term. We even 
expect to bring the deficit to zero by the year 2000. However, there 
is a question of fairness, since it is the middle class that is paying 
off the deficit. It is becoming increasingly poor. The government is 
creating huge poverty in Canada, leaving untouched those who are 
in a position to benefit from the tax laws. It is the middle class that 
is getting it.
<P>
	That is why the Bloc Quebecois decided in November 1996 and 
February 1997 to table two studies on taxation: corporate taxes, 
first, and personal taxes, second. This sort of study has never 
before been prepared by the official opposition.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance reacted to our first study by saying: 
``The Bloc Quebecois tabled a sober report yesterday. I consider it 
a very professional one. I thank the Leader of the Opposition and 
the members here for their work. There are many things in the 
report we agree with'', and I quote him exactly. Yet, it was shelved 
and will probably gather dust there for a number of years. It  is 
some one hundred pages long and was prepared with the means 
available to us, because the official opposition has far fewer means 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9925"> 9925 </A></B>
<P>
available to it than the government. This is the first time such a 
thing has been done, up to now.
<P>
	The last time the tax system was totally revamped was in 1962, 
as a result of the Carter Commission. According to the Carter 
report, tax criteria had to be followed. The system had to be fair 
and different incomes taxed the same way, regardless of source or 
recipient. That, basically, was the philosophy of the Carter report.
<P>
	Many of the report's recommendations were never implemented 
in the Income Tax Act, which was to be expected, but we used the 
report as a reference work in terms of both principles and approach. 
It covered the whole Income Tax Act and was 2,575 pages long. It 
was six years in the preparation, and its recommendations were 
never fully implemented.
<P>
	In 1966, the Liberal government, which had been given the 
report, decided not to use it. It asked the Minister of Finance to 
produce a white paper on taxation-this government's usual 
solution is to produce white papers or red books as appropriate- 
and a watered down version of the Carter report led to the 1971 
amendments to the Income Tax Act.
<P>
	We had to wait until 1981 for the next changes. However, the 
Minister of Finance at the time, Allan MacEachen, underestimated 
the resistance of the financial community and had to back off on a 
number of amendments he had wanted to make to the Income Tax 
Act. The final tax reform was Michael Wilson's in 1987. He too 
had to retreat on some of the reforms, because of major pressure 
from lobby groups to limit the extent of reforms.
<P>
	The principles underlying the Bloc's two reports on taxation are 
those found in the report of the Carter commission, principles 
everyone can understand, principles of fairness, efficiency, 
neutrality and stability.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	Under the principle of fairness, the tax system must ensure a fair 
distribution of the tax burden among taxpayers. We appreciate that 
everyone should pay taxes. The taxation system must not only be 
fair but also be perceived as such, that is to say, people should feel 
that everyone is paying their fair share.
<P>
	We can assess how equitable a tax is by one of two yardsticks: it 
must either reflect the ability to pay of those who are subject to 
it-that is what we call vertical equity-or match the benefits to 
the taxpayers, a principle called horizontal equity. The 
implementation of a progressive tax system is consistent with the 
principle of vertical equity.
<P>
	In a vertical equity analysis, one has to use the concept of 
diminishing returns John Stuart Mill described in his  book, clearly 
defining it in terms of a single taxpayer's equivalent sacrifice. This 
is taken, of course, from <I>Principles of Political Economy with 
Some of Their Applications to Social Philosophy</I>. I think it is not 
widely known, but the majority of leading economists in the early 
days were in fact philosophers preoccupied with ethical concerns 
or wondering why, and the question is still valid today, there was 
such a huge gap between the rich and the poor.
<P>
	This means that each taxpayer does not pay the same amount of 
taxes proportionally to make an equal marginal sacrifice. It would 
clearly not be as much of a sacrifice to pay $2,000 in taxes for 
someone earning $500,000 per year as for someone earning 
$12,000. That is why, in the interest of equity, there is a so-called 
tax progression.
<P>
	But the facts tell quite a different story. Just think of family 
trusts that were transferred to the U.S. tax free. Clearly, the public 
realizes there is nothing fair about that.
<P>
	Think of the Liberal member for Gander-Grand Falls, who, 
every 12 or 18 months-he must spend most of his time at Revenue 
Canada-issues the list, withholding names of course, of dozens of 
millionaires who not only never pay tax but actually receive money 
from the Government of Canada in the form of additional tax 
deductions. They actually receive money from the Government of 
Canada. In fact, I think the hon. member for Gander-Grand Falls 
does a fine job. What I find extremely distressing in all this is that, 
the next day, it is all but forgotten.
<P>
	Think also of the strong public belief that the current system is 
not fair, that the poor keep paying while the rich manage to get out 
of it.
<P>
	The second principle on which these reports on the tax system 
were based is the principle of efficiency. To be efficient, any 
taxation system must be kept as simple as possible. It makes it 
easier to enforce, and the taxpayers waste less time making sure 
they have complied with the various tax regulations.
<P>
	In addition, a simpler taxation system results in lower 
government management costs. When income tax time is upon us, 
we realize that, for most of us, it is no simple task to fill out a 
personal income tax return. As for corporations, we know they do 
not just file a regular income tax return. They have tax experts who 
dig into piles, three or four feet high, of tax documents. They go to 
great lengths to avoid paying tax.
<P>
	All this to say that this is a very complex system. When we meet 
tax experts, whether at the Standing Committee on Finance or 
elsewhere, that is the first thing they tell us: the tax legislation is 
extremely complex and we lay people need their help to understand 
it. It is a fact that one needs very complex training to sort it all out. 
In a nutshell, the current taxation system lacks efficiency.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9926"> 9926 </A></B>
<P>
	The third principle is that of neutrality. The taxation system 
must be neutral. This means that companies should make 
investments based on economic and financial considerations and 
not on tax considerations.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	Yet, we are well aware that many companies make major 
decisions which are not based on economic or financial interests, 
but on the impact that these decisions will have on the amount of 
taxes they will have to pay. So, the system is not neutral.
<P>
	The fourth principle is the principle of stability. A tax system 
must produce stable revenues over the years for the government, so 
that it can make consistent economic forecasts. Stability provides 
for a certain continuity in the level of revenues and expenditures.
<P>
	Such stability currently does not exist, given that the government 
was forced to cut $4.5 billion in transfers to the provinces-which 
is not a source of revenue-and to garnish workers' wages by 
taking $5 billion out of the unemployment insurance fund, so it 
could reduce its deficit. This shows that the tax system is not 
stable.
<P>
	All these principles, developed by the Carter commission and 
reiterated by Bloc Quebecois members with the very limited means 
available to them, show that a tax reform is in order. This is one of 
the reasons why such a reform is necessary, but there are many 
more.
<P>
	As regards corporate taxation, our first document was essentially 
tabled because we realized that, over the years, corporations have 
been paying less and less taxes. I will show you figures which I 
already mentioned in the House, but which bear repeating every 
day. Let us take a look at the gap between taxes paid by 
corporations and individuals since 1951. I will show that gap for 
every 10-year period, that is for 1952, 1962, 1972, 1982 and 1992. 
Here are the figures.
<P>
	In 1952, corporations contributed 51 per cent of the taxes paid to 
the government, compared to 45 per cent for individuals. In 1962, 
10 years later, corporate taxes amounted to 36 per cent of the total; 
in 1972, it was 20 per cent; in 1982, it was down to 18 per cent, and, 
in 1992, it was a mere 7.6 per cent. We can see that, over the past 40 
years, corporate taxes have steadily gone down, while personal 
taxes have increased.
<P>
	So, over the past 40 years-and this is the second reason why we 
are asking for a comprehensive tax reform-the tax burden in 
Canada, has been supported less and less by corporations and more 
and more by the middle class and the poor, through cuts affecting 
services provided to them. This is the second good reason for a tax 
reform.
<P>
	The taxation principles stated by the Carter commission are no 
longer being complied with. Moreover, for the past 40 years, 
corporations have been paying less and less taxes, while 
individuals have been  paying more and more. Under the 
circumstances, it would be in order to go back to the conclusions of 
the Carter commission.
<P>
	The third principle is a bit of a myth. It has always been said that 
corporate taxes should not be substantially increased, because 
corporations in Canada may already be paying too much tax, 
compared to companies in other countries. According to statements 
made by succeeding governments, both Liberal and Conservative, 
corporations pay too much tax in Canada. However, the figures 
show just the opposite.
<P>
	I am referring to the figures from the OECD, which compared 
the corporate tax rates in various countries. We are talking here 
about corporate tax revenues, that is the taxes paid by corporations 
in relation to the country's gross domestic product. Let us look at 
the years 1965, 1975, 1985 and 1993, since the data for 1995 is not 
available. Let us see how Canada fares.
<P>
	According to these figures, in the United States, for the year 
1965, 6.48 per cent of tax revenues came from corporations, 
compared to 4.7 per cent for Canada, 12 per cent for France,7.23 per cent for Germany, and 5.81 per cent for Japan. In 1965, 
Canada, along with Spain and the United Kingdom, was the 
country with the smallest proportion of tax revenues being paid by 
corporations.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	In 1975, ten years later, the percentage for Canada was 6.38, and 
for the United States, 7.16. On might expect lower taxes in the 
United States, but the opposite is true. Corporate taxes are higher in 
the United States. The same is true in France, Germany and Japan, 
all of which have corporate taxes several points higher than 
Canada's.
<P>
	In 1985, it is even worse, and in the final year, 1993, Canada 
looked to corporations for less than 6 per cent of its revenue, the 
United States, 7.25 per cent, and Japan, almost 10 per cent. Japan is 
not a third world country. It looked to corporations for almost 10 
per cent. Internationally, therefore, Canada is not facing impossible 
competition. It is even one of the countries-and we are talking 
about industrialized countries-with the lowest corporate taxes.
<P>
	The same analysis can be done for tax revenue, but this time 
compared to overall revenue. Here again, Canada ranks lowest 
among all other industrialized countries, including the United 
States. We therefore see that Canada is one of the OECD countries 
with the lowest corporate taxes compared to individual taxes.
<P>

<P>
	This was recently demonstrated at a Small Business Info Fair 
which I hosted in my constituency of Dauphin-Swan River. I was 
pleased to see that so many of the participants were women 
entrepreneurs.
<P>
	Did members know that women make up over one-third of 
independent business people in Canada, that Canadian women 
operate more than 700,000 firms employing 1.7 million Canadians 
and that half of women entrepreneurs started their businesses with 
less than $10,000?

fact, it is predicted this will be the worst flood situation since the 
mid-19th century. Thousands of people will be forced from their 
homes, and while local governments are better prepared than ever 
before, we could be entering into unknown territory according to a 
natural resources spokesman.
<P>
	Manitobans would like assurance that the federal government 
will work quickly and co-operatively with the provincial and 
municipal governments to provide emergency relief for families 
and financial compensation to repair flood damage.
<P>
	I hope Manitoba flood victims will not have to experience a

infrastructure program ``with an eye to the coming election 
campaign''.
<P>
	The facts show who is really delaying the infrastructure 
program. The federal government has already signed agreements 
with eight provinces and one territory. The federal government is 
ready, willing and able.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	The extended infrastructure program could create more than 
6,500 new jobs in Ontario. Ontario is the only province that has not 
concluded an agreement. I would like Mr. Eves to tell the 
constituents of Simcoe North why Ontario is stalling on creating 
new jobs.
<P>
	In many other files, the federal government has shown its 
unequivocal desire to move ahead. Who is stalling on harmonizing 
the GST in Ontario? Who rebuffed the Prime Minister's efforts to 
amend the Constitution? Who is delaying an agreement on labour 
force training for Ontarians? The provincial Tory government of 
Mike Harris, that's who.

<P>
	Today Vistajet, headquartered in my riding of London West, 
announced an expansion of its operations to better service 
passengers flying between Toronto, Windsor and Ottawa. Vistajet 
has already hired 55 new people and hopes are soaring that the 
London based jet airline will create employment for at least 200 
more within a year with the addition of new routes.
<P>
	The company aims to become a national carrier offering value 
conscious leisure and business travellers the convenience of flying 
at a rate comparable to driving or taking the train.
<P>
	It has been the Liberal government's management of the 
Canadian economy that has enabled companies like Vistajet to 
expand. During four consecutive budgets, the Minister of Finance 
has adopted policies that have reduced interest rates to historic 
lows and fostered a competitive economy, laying the foundation for 
the private sector to create new jobs for Canadians.

possibility of extending the Canada infrastructure works program 
for another year. Since that offer, nine provinces, except Ontario, 
have agreed to continue this successful program to build 
infrastructure and create jobs in their communities.
<P>
	The Canada infrastructure works program allows municipalities 
to set priorities for projects. It is a grassroots approach to 
government which involves local elected officials who know what 
is best for their communities.
<P>
	Our government and the provinces respect the municipalities as 
equal participants in the program.
<P>
	As a former mayor, I encourage the Government of Ontario to 
involve local governments in the decision making process. The 
issue is jobs and the enhancement of community life. I hope that 
the Government of Ontario will not let this opportunity go.

	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the fishery has 
never been in such poor shape as since the Liberals came to power 
in Ottawa.
<P>
	Successive fisheries ministers have managed only to lower 
fishing quotas, shorten seasons, reduce the size of fleets, slow 
down processing plants, and manage the resource to the advantage 
of fishermen from Newfoundland, the province from which, 
furthermore, all the Liberal Party's fisheries ministers have come.
<P>
	I am not asking this government to bring back the missing fish, 
but to reverse the power play by which the Liberal government 
took over management of the fishery from Quebec in July 1983. 
Quebec had handled this responsibility perfectly well since 1922. 
Quebec's fishermen will never be well served by Ottawa, which 
takes no account whatsoever of their opinions and their needs.
<P>
	I am certain that, until such time as it attains sovereignty, 
Quebec has all the expertise necessary to handle this responsibility 
successfully.

the truth is out. Rather than fulfilling its red  book promise to 
provide honest, more accountable government, Liberal patronage 
is alive and well, in fact, working overtime.
<P>
	While armouries across the country are being considered for 
closure, the Prime Minister's canoe museum in Shawinigan will 
now be matched by a government funded hotel and a large new 
armoury.
<P>
	Nor will the Deputy Prime Minister miss out on Liberal election 
largesse. Hamilton will receive a new naval reserve building. Not 
to be outdone when it comes to pork-barrelling, the health 
minister's Nova Scotia riding receives a new naval reserve 
complex.
<P>
	Our reserves play a vital role in the military and social fabric of 
Canada and deserve our support, but is it not strange that all six 
new armouries or naval reserve facilities are going to Liberal 
ridings?
<P>
	The shutdown of the Somalia inquiry to prevent scrutiny of high 
level defence involvement, the buying of political favour with 
taxpayer money and a host of broken red book promises prove that 
the Liberals have not and will not provide honest, good

	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Quebec's maple syrup industry has modernized its image and set its 
sights on outside markets.
<P>
	Quebec alone accounts for 90 per cent of Canadian production, 
of which 80 per cent, it is estimated, is consumed outside the 
country. Last year, the industry exported over 20,200 tonnes of 
maple syrup, 4 per cent more than in 1995, to 32 countries.
<P>
	During the same period, the value of these exports jumped to $97 
million, a 20 per cent increase, and in just four years the value of 
exports has almost doubled, rising to 84 per cent, an average annual 
increase of 22 per cent.
<P>
	These results are attributable to the revitalized methods being 
adopted by longstanding producers, and the emergence of a series 
of new and very dynamic enterprises, with different approaches 
and products, that are targeting a much broader range of niche 
markets than ever before.

<P>
	The Corival construction company, of which Liberal Senator 
Pietro Rizzuto is a minority shareholder, has been fined $56,000 by 
the Quebec Court for major fraud. A Revenue Canada investigation

expenses for tax purposes.
<P>
	This is not the first time that Pietro Rizzuto, the Quebec

involved in some funny business. During the 1993 election, he had 
promised jobs to all defeated Liberal candidates. Three and a half 
years later, 40 of those former Liberal candidates or MPs have jobs 
in the Chrétien government. It is therefore obvious what clout this 
man of few principles wields in a party that thumbs its nose at

	If speed or too much traffic is the problem, surely we could 
restrict the speed limit or the number of vehicles going through the 
Bow Valley Parkway each day. That is the way it is being done in 
the Grand Canyon national park.
<P>
	On behalf of the regular users of the park who alerted me to this 
problem, I urge the heritage minister to please reject any complete 
closure of the Bow Valley Parkway. While she is at it, could she 
please confirm whether there is any truth to the rumour that she is

	<B>Mr. Simon de Jong (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, with each passing day, ownership of Canada's daily 
papers and private television and radio stations are controlled by 
fewer and fewer people. Today, entire regions of the country get the 
news from daily papers owned by one large company. Conrad 
Black's Hollinger Incorporated now controls 60 per cent of 
Canada's daily newspapers and 43 per cent of Canada's coast to 
coast circulation. The consequences for democracy are severe.
<P>
	When Conrad Black bought control of all Saskatchewan 
newspapers, 171 jobs were lost and specialized reporting on 
agriculture, health and civic politics fell 20 per cent of their 
previous levels.
<P>
	The reaction of Liberals was to sit on their hands on the grounds 
that no commercial interests had been harmed. The silencing of 
dissenting voices, the limits on what we counted on as news did not 
trouble them.
<P>
	But highly concentrated media ownership limits the free 
exchange of ideas and information among Canadians. What we 
need in this country are new rules to limit the concentration in the 
media and protect democracy. We need a Canada-

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="LINGUISTICSCHOOLBOARDS">LINGUISTIC SCHOOL BOARDS</A></H3>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs.
<P>
	On the subject of linguistic school boards in Quebec, the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs insists he now supports the 
Quebec government's request. So far, however, his own 
government has refused to start the procedure for adopting the 
constitutional amendment as requested.
<P>
	Why has the minister, although he says he agrees with the 
amendment requested by the Quebec National  Assembly, not 
tabled a notice of motion that would make it possible to start the 
debate in the House? What is he waiting for?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we are very pleased to support the amendment we 
received from the National Assembly which will help modernize 
the Quebec school system in a way that has found support among 
all groups in Quebec society.
<P>
	We received this proposal barely 48 hours ago. We intend to 
proceed without delay, with due respect for parliamentary 
procedure.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I asked the minister a straightforward question. I imagine 
when his students asked him questions, he had some answers. Why 
does he have no answers now that he is in the House? What kind of 
teacher is he?
<P>
	I will repeat my question. He decided that hearings would be 
held. We agreed. However, he must first table a motion in the 
House. Let us stop being hypocrites, here.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> I know I am not 
supposed to say that, but I said it.
<P>
	Last Monday, they came to ask us when we would be ready to 
proceed. We said: ``The Government of Quebec will proceed 
Tuesday, we will be ready Wednesday''. At the time, they were 
talking about going ahead on Monday.
<P>
	The minister knows as well as I do-perhaps he does not because 
he told us the other day he was not very knowledgeable on the rules 
of procedure-but in any case, when does he intend to table this 
notice of motion? Ask the House leader, but when are you going to 
table your notice of motion?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
I think the acting opposition House leader forgot that her party and 
the Reform Party agreed that on Monday we would, I hope, pass the 
anti-gang bill. Did she change her mind? Does she want to renege 
on her commitment?
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	Because of a previous agreement we cannot start with the 
resolution on Monday, but as we say in Parliament, the hon. 
member may rest assured that we intend to start consideration of 
the resolution as soon as possible after Monday.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, with all due respect for the hon. member and his career as 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9932"> 9932 </A></B>
<P>
a parliamentarian, first of all, I  am not the acting House leader but, 
as far as I know, the official House leader.
<P>
	Second, we agreed on an agenda until next Thursday. Does this 
mean that the House will adjourn on Thursday? Does this mean the 
government has no intention of tabling the motion? Is that what it 
means?
<P>
	In one of those end-of-session deals, we also suggested an 
approach that would meet both the government's objectives and 
ours. With the unanimous consent of the House, we asked the 
government to proceed today with debate on the motion so that 
Monday, the constitutional amendment could be referred to the 
Senate and then to the joint committee for 48 hours of hearings, and 
after that the amendment would come back to the House so we 
could vote on it before the House adjourns. Is the government 
prepared to accept this deal in its entirety, yes or no?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the Quebec government waited at least two years to table its own 
resolution, and the National Assembly took three weeks to adopt 
the resolution after it was tabled. Why should the hon. member 
expect us to consider this very important constitutional motion 
within a shorter time frame than the National Assembly?
<P>
	Second, the hon. member does not like the word ``acting'' 
connected to her position, and I apologize for the fact that I forgot 
she is leader of the acting official opposition. I may remind her that 
we are all here in an acting capacity, to a certain extent, and this is 
especially true of the present official opposition party.

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we now know this is a government delaying tactic. If I 
were the leader, I would not be too worried about our return.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.
<P>
	As we speak, a family from Belgium seeking to immigrate to 
Quebec is in prison. The father, the mother and the three children 
aged 9, 13 and 14 are at the Laval detention centre. The entire 
situation is based on a bureaucratic mess arising from 
misunderstanding, and false and erroneous information.
<P>
	It appears that Mr. Truzewicz is being held on account of a 
robbery committed 18 years ago in Belgium. He however has 
shown that it was not he who committed the robbery, but someone 
using his car.
<P>
	Is the minister prepared to examine this matter immediately so 
that Mr. Truzewicz and his family are accorded fairer treatment? A 
little understanding, please.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I looked into this matter 
personally, but the Quebec privacy act precludes my commenting 
publicly on the facts of this case, and I think we should protect 
people's privacy as a matter of course.
<P>
	If I have anything to say to the family today, it is to suggest that 
they comply with Canada's laws. That is the best approach, if they 
want to return some day.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what is not a matter of course is our treating these people 
as if they were criminals, when they are not. This family is being 
treated like criminals. The parents and the three children have been 
thrown into prison.
<P>
	Until the situation is clarified, could the minister arrange to 
release these people who are accused of nothing so that we can at 
least stop aggravating the situation these innocent people are 
facing?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would ask the member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve to stop making political points with a 
human situation that is difficult for all concerned.
<P>
	Clearly, everyone must obey Canadian law. I would hope the 
Bloc members would do the same in this country.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TOBACCO">TOBACCO</A></H3>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the ink 
was barely dry on the anti-tobacco legislation before they started 
changing and watering it down.
<P>
	In public the Liberals talked a really good line about not caving 
in to the tobacco lobby and protecting the health of our young 
people. They seemed concerned then but then in private the health 
minister could not backtrack fast enough on tobacco sponsorship. 
In fact he became the host of ``Let's Make A Deal'' with the 
tobacco lobby. Tough on tobacco, I do not know. I am not sure.
<P>
	Why did the Liberals cave in to the tobacco lobby, or was it 
always part of the pre-election plan? Who is going to answer that 
one?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member ignores one very 
basic important fact.
<P>
	Bill C-71 passed from this place to the other place and passed in 
the other place without any amendments. The bill still maintains all 
its integrity. It has all its objectives which the House supported, 
notwithstanding the reluctance of some members opposite.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9933"> 9933 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the fix 
is in. The government has already passed the legislation and it 
talks about the other place. It is already talking about amending 
it again. It is absolutely ridiculous and it proves the Liberals are 
shameless.
<P>
	They ought to be saying to the Canadian public that the only 
thing the Government of Canada cares about at the moment is the 
political fortune of the Liberal Party of Canada. How ironic this 
should be on the eve of an election.
<P>
	First there was the Somalia inquiry. Then there was a $260 
million payout for Pearson and Airbus, airports and Airbuses. Then 
came salmon, cod and now the anti-tobacco bill.
<P>
	Why is the government so concerned about losing votes that it is 
willing to compromise its conscience?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the only thing that is shameless is the 
poor attempt to try to score political points by distorting the facts.
<P>
	The facts are still as follows. Bill C-71 went from the House to 
the other place and from there into the public domain with clear 
health objectives that remain as they were when they left this place.
<P>
	We had already considered all other ramifications of the bill. 
Those ramifications are included in some amendments that were 
accepted here, for example that we would have an implementation 
period following which there would be consultation with all 
stakeholders and a review of some of those implications in the 
context of Health Canada's health objectives as stated in the bill.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
great to hear them talk so eloquently about the fact that they really 
care about young people and smoking, and then they say they are 
making these changes. I do not think the Canadian public cares 
what House it has been through. It is seeing the Liberal government 
caving in to the tobacco industry on labelling.
<P>
	He did not mention that the Liberals were planning to cave in to 
the tobacco lobby after the bill was passed and amended in the fall 
with the arrogance of assuming that they will be here to make those 
changes. He did not mention the Liberals differentiated between a 
tobacco ad on a billboard and a tobacco ad on a race car.
<P>
	Why should Canadians vote for a government that talks tough on 
smoking and then puts a Liberal logo on a race car?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if we were to put a Liberal logo on a 
race car I am sure we would get all kinds of support. The hon. 
member knows full well that all the articles of the bill indicated 
that we would have restrictions on sponsorship. There was never 
any question of anything else.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	I might add for the member's edification that we would have an 
opportunity to get people to understand the objectives. There were 
restrictions but no bans. We said here are the health objectives and 
we carried those out.
<P>
	The legislation went through the House with the health 
objectives in place, consistent with the Supreme Court decisions 
that generated this and consistent with all consultations we had in 
the field leading up to the legislation.
<P>
	Nothing has changed, absolutely nothing. Canadians are pleased 
the Canadian government could get the legislation out of the 
Commons, into the Senate and into the public. She should applaud 
it.

	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, one can 
tell there is an election in the offing. That is why the President of 
the Treasury Board and member for Hull-Aylmer would like to 
see the public service pay equity issue resolved, in his interest and 
that of his colleagues in the Ottawa area.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois strongly urges the government to stop 
stalling over this issue and show respect for its 80,000 employees, 
who have been waiting for 12 years. Otherwise, the campaign trail 
might be bumpy, especially in Hull-Aylmer.
<P>
	On this issue, the minister chose to make an offer via the <I>Toronto 
Star</I> rather than directly at the bargaining table. Why did he take 
this disrespectful approach to labour relations?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
naturally, I have no intention of negotiating in this place something 
that should be negotiated between the employer, namely the 
Treasury Board, and its employees.
<P>
	On Monday April 21, we will be putting on the table an offer 
regarding pay equity for the public service employees' union to 
consider. At that time, the details of the offer will be released, I 
guess, by the union itself.
<P>
	People will be able to see for themselves what our position is. As 
far as we are concerned, we want both parties to negotiate in good 
faith, and we would not want to prejudice either the employees' 
position or that of the employer by discussing the matter in this 
House.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Treasury Board has called a meeting with PSAC for April 21 
without providing an agenda for the meeting.

	Will the President of the Treasury Board confirm that he plans 
to put an offer on the table to resolve the issue, or is this just 
another stalling tactic because an election is coming?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I 
just indicated, we will be putting on the table, on Monday April 21, 
an offer regarding pay equity. These matters have already been 
negotiated with the unions.
<P>
	A settlement has already been reached with one of the unions, 
the one representing professional employees, and we hope not only 
that a settlement can be negotiated in good faith but also that it will 
be fair to both taxpayers and employees.

Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I wonder why the Reform Party is supporting the program of a 
party it says it opposes, namely Brian Mulroney's Conservative 
Party.
<P>
	Why does the Reform Party want the taxpayer to spend $5 
billion to $6 billion on helicopters that do not meet Canadian 
requirements? Why does the Reform Party want the taxpayer to 
spend $600 million instead of $60 million on an airport deal that 
was strongly criticized by Canadians across the country?
<P>
	Are Reformers turning into a new set of Mulroney Tory clones?
<P>
<B>(1135 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the people know Liberal-Tory, same old story. We are not 
the ones paying out taxpayer dollars for all these things.
<P>
	It is now painfully obvious to every Canadian except Liberal 
MPs that infrastructure programs and other big government make 
work projects only produce short term jobs. Real job creation will 
only come through smaller  government, balanced budgets and 
across the board tax relief.
<P>
	Has the Prime Minister finally learned this, or does he still 
believe, as he said during the CBC town hall, that if Canadians 
cannot find a job they should simply move to where there is work, 
to where his government is spending their tax dollars, to 
Shawinigan?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is certainly a lot more to do in terms of helping Canadians 
who want to work find jobs, but we have made a very good start 
with a very good basis.
<P>
	Some 700,000 new jobs have been created since the government 
took office. A further program of action was outlined in the very 
effective budget of my colleague, the Minister of Finance. We have 
laid the groundwork for further progress that I am sure will be 
achieved.
<P>
	I wonder why my hon. friend on the one hand says that things 
have to be done at the local level, at the community level, but he is 
rejecting the successful infrastructure program which was 
designed, worked out and supported by the Canadian Federation of 
Municipalities.

of mayors and reeves across the country and they will not forget it.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
spring, hundreds of owners of satellite dishes will lose the last 
analog signal in French, that of Radio-Canada. While technological 
progress may be a good thing, these people should have been 
informed of that change, before investing over $1,000 in satellite 
dishes that will no longer work.
<P>
	Why does the industry minister not conduct a real information 
campaign on this issue, so as to reach people, particularly those 
who live in rural areas, instead of merely publishing a brochure 
distributed by the sellers of satellite dishes, who do not always 
have an interest in telling the truth to their customers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, we said on several occasions in this House that it is the 
objective of Industry Canada to ensure that all consumers are 
informed and that the purchasing of satellite dishes should be made 
with the knowledge that the technology is changing.
<P>

<HR>

<P>
	We recently issued a licence to Telesat Canada to provide DTH 
services to Canadians. I believe these new services, including 
LMCS and the cable broadcasting service to be introduced by 
telephone companies, will result in many technological changes 
all consumers should be informed of.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Broadcasting Act provides that Radio-Canada's signals must reach 
the largest possible audience.
<P>
	Given that the satellite broadcasting industry is still in its 
infancy, will the minister ask Radio-Canada to put off its decision 
to eliminate its analog signal for at least one year, so as to give 
consumers time to adjust to the technological changes he just 
mentioned?

income took place. Since we have taken office it has stabilized. If 
one takes a look at the projections of most economists, it is that it 
will be going up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find this 
funny. I said since 1993 this is what has happened. It has nothing to 
do with the Conservatives. When they were over here they blamed 
the  Conservatives. Now that they are over there, they blame the 
Conservatives. Liberal-Tory same old story.
<P>
	I have a concern that the finance minister is basically using the 
UI fund as a surtax on his deficit cutting promises. He has said that 
if the cuts to the Canada health and social transfer are $7.5 billion, 
he would cut program spending by $9 billion. Revenues in the UI 
fund will hit $7 billion by the end of this fiscal year and revenues 
from personal income taxes are up by $4 billion after only11 months, and that is from the <I>Fiscal Monitor</I>.
<P>
	If the finance minister has not raised personal income taxes, if he 
claims that he has not touched personal income taxes, why are tax 
revenues from personal income up by $4 billion? We have the time 
to handle this and answer it properly, so just take your time and 
answer it.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there are a number of answers to the hon. member's question.
<P>
	I think the hon. member would be interested in knowing that in 
1966 the real net worth per household rose 2.7 per cent. What that 
means is that households have more assets, more money and are 
better off. Canadians are better off. I am sorry, 1996. When you are 
talking to the Reform Party you are lucky to get the century right.
<P>
	Let me simply say that the reason our personal income tax 
revenues are up is that in the private sector there are 850,000 more 
Canadians working. That is why, that is the way it should be, and 
that is good news.

	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question was for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	This morning we learned that the CBC is toying with the idea of 
privatizing <I>Bon Matin</I>, a news broadcast now under the 
responsibility of Radio-Canada's news service. This represents yet 
another step on the road to abandoning great Canadian cultural 
institutions like Telefilm Canada and the CBC to the private sector, 
where the rules of ethics and accountability are not the same as 
those found in the public sector.
<P>
	Would the Minister of Canadian Heritage agree that her 
government is responsible for dismantling Canadian cultural 
institutions and abandoning them to the private sector?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
through its protection of Canadian cultural institutions in recent 
budgets, I think the Canadian  government has shown that it values 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9936"> 9936 </A></B>
<P>
them greatly and that it intends to continue to protect them in the 
future.
<P>
	Whether we are talking about Telefilm Canada, Radio-Canada or 
the CBC, the federal government has stated its objectives, and we 
intend to continue to serve the Canadian people, including the 
people of Quebec, in such a way as to promote the development of 
culture in Canada through strong and sustainable institutions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the idea of starting to privatize the news broadcast by 
Radio-Canada is the direct result of Liberal cuts to the CBC. 
Instead of providing decent funding for the corporation, the 
Liberals diverted the money to the Copps fund, administered by the 
private sector and by Heritage Canada.
<P>
	Why are the Liberals doing everything they can to weaken 
Radio-Canada and Telefilm Canada, instead of strengthening 
Canadian culture?
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
when we are putting more than $1 billion annually into supporting 
our cultural institutions, there is no doubt that our government is 
showing that it wants to give effect to the principles of which we 
spoke and to continue to defend our cultural institutions.
<P>
	As for the privatization of <I>Bon Matin</I>, I would like to remind the 
hon. member that the CBC is an autonomous agency in which we 
do not interfere. It is precisely because we do not want there to be 
any political interference that we are allowing the CBC to take 
decisions such as the one it may eventually take regarding <I>Bon 
Matin</I>. Opposition members would be the first to complain if there 
were any political interference. In this case, we are not interfering, 
so how can they complain?

with other members of the House from all parties, especially the 
parliamentary secretary to the House leader, for their work in 
raising the awareness of Canadians on this issue.
<P>
	What we have seen since they began to raise this issue is that 
consumer awareness in Canada has increased significantly of the 
fact that low rate cards are available, as well as new low rate cards 
that have come into existence; five new ones in the last few 
months. Now consumer awareness of these cards has increased 
from 30 per cent to 60 per cent, a very important contribution to the 
ability of consumers to make the choices that are in their best 
interests.
<P>
	In addition, Industry Canada continues on a monthly basis to 
make available to the public full disclosure of information on the 
comparative rates and other costs associated with credit cards. As 
well, we have recently instituted on our web site, Strategis, the 
ability for consumers to use a credit card calculator. Inputting their 
own consumer practices, we can calculate for them which credit 
card is the best one for them to use.

	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the minister of agriculture.
<P>
	In the last three and a half years this government has messed up 
every agriculture policy it has touched. It killed the Crow subsidy 
without having a competitive and efficient grain transportation 
system in place and as a result farmers have bins full of grain that 
cannot be moved.
<P>
	Full grain bins and empty pockets have been Liberal and Tory 
policy for the past 130 years. How does this government expect 
farmers without cash to put in this year's crops?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, over the last 
several weeks we have been asked by many people to work on this 
situation and to put out a committee to look at it.
<P>
	We feel that is not the direction to take. We feel the minister is 
working with the rail companies, with the product groups in the 
west trying to move this question forward as quickly as possible.
<P>
	There is no question that grain has moved very slowly off the 
prairies this year. There was an avalanche which slowed things 
down for a week. We understand there was a major wash-out of rail 
lines a week ago which caused another huge slow down.
<P>
	We sympathize with all the producers in the west. There is no 
question we want to see this move forward as quickly as possible. 
We are involving all the stakeholders and we are working with 
them to make certain these problems are clarified and sped up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this government has to realize if farmers had been given a 
marketing choice, as the Western Grain  Marketing Panel recom-

mended, they would already have resolved the transportation 
problems.
<P>
	But because the minister arrogantly refused the 
recommendations of his own panel, the whole exercise was a waste 
of millions of taxpayer dollars.
<P>
	How do the minister and the government plan to compensate 
farmers for his arrogance and negligence?

	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

the member's question is totally wrong. In absolutely no way has 
the minister, in any of the judgments made, done anything to cause 
delays in the transportation of grain on the prairies.
<P>
	The member knows very well that the cause is due to problems 
within the rail companies. We are working with the industry and 
everyone in the industry knows we have been working with them to 
resolve the problem.

	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	On February 28, in response to a letter from Quebec Minister of 
Cultural Affairs Louise Beaudoin, the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
stated that there was no question of Quebec artists being excluded 
from funding programs on political grounds.
<P>
	If this is so, will the minister confirm that he has altered the 
objectives of his financial assistance program for touring 
companies by withdrawing the criteria linking departmental 
subsidies to the promotion of Canadian unity?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, with regard to the new policies, we made it clear that 
decisions on individual artists would be based on each person's 
artistic merits. There is, therefore, no change.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, that is not an answer to the question. I have asked the 
minister whether he had changed the criteria in the law, rather than 
in promises. We all know what happens to promises. We were 
promised that the GST would be scrapped, and it was not.
<P>
	If the Minister of Foreign Affairs has not changed the criteria of 
his program, how then can he write Minister  Beaudoin saying that 
the political opinions of Quebec artists will not be taken into 
account when his department awards funding to artists?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wrote to Madam Beaudoin to ensure we cleared up the 
total misinformation that was put forward by members of that party 
suggesting that political views would be taken into account. Never 
at any time was that the case. It was only in the minds of the Bloc 
Quebecois members. They attempted to exploit it as a way of trying 
to drive a wedge. Never was it part of our guidelines.
<P>
	All we said was that we wanted to ensure that when we promote 
the opportunity for Canadian artists to go abroad that it be the 
widest possible range of artists, young people, aboriginal people, 
people representing the various cultural groups. Never were 
political beliefs taken into account.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois must apologize to the Canadian public for 
creating that kind of perception.

	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, just days 
before a needless federal election call the Liberals are spreading 
money around the way farmers would spread fertilizer. They 
obviously did not learn from the fact that Trudeau's 1984 patronage 
binge cost them the election. What a flip-flop from the days in 
opposition when they criticized the Tories for their pork-barrelling.
<P>
	While it still has time, will the government commit to cutting 
taxes so that real jobs can be created?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
the last budget we brought in over $2 billion worth of selective tax 
cuts, which will take effect over the next three years, for Canadians 
with disabilities, for students and for low income families. We 
brought in a series of targeted tax cuts directed where the impact 
will be the greatest.
<P>
	Given that the government has reasonably restricted financial 
resources, that is the option which any reasonable government 
would take. The alternative recommended by the Reform Party is 
to bring in a broad based tax cut which would benefit the wealthy of 
this country. It would be paid for by cutting services which low and 
middle income Canadians desperately need.

	Let me quote exactly from false start: ``The federal government 
contributes about $3.5 billion each year to provincial welfare 
programs through the transfer payment known as the Canada health 
and social transfer. A Reform government will eliminate these 
payments''. That is a direct quote; 3.5 billion out of the pockets of

	We are all quite aware of Canada's longstanding tradition of

of Canadian troops in UN peacekeeping operations in Cyprus.

special ambassador, Mr. Michael Bell, to be the envoy for Canada 
in Cyprus and to work closely with the United Nations and to work 
with other countries. We think it is at the right moment with the 
proposed admission into the European Union. We hope that Canada 
continues to play the constructive balanced role that we played 
during peacekeeping in Cyprus. Now we can provide a constructive 
political and diplomatic initiative. If we can do that, we can help

question is directed to the President of the Treasury Board.
<P>
	One of the recommendations of the Bloc Quebecois on tax 
reform concerned the Governor General's salary of $97,400 on 
which he does not pay a cent of income tax. Of course, the Minister 
of Finance did nothing about this.
<P>
	Although all taxpayers must do their fair share to help the 
Minister of Finance fight the deficit and even the Queen of England 
now pays income tax, what justification does the minister have for 
the fact that her representative in Canada, with a salary of $97,400, 
does not?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
accountants could go on about this at length. Is it better to pay him 
the salary of a Deputy Minister, around $140,000 or $150,000, so 
that he will have a net income of $97,000, or to pay him his salary 
tax free, because technically, the Crown cannot tax the Crown? 
That is a choice accountants have to make, and one way or another, 
it will not have much of an impact on the future of this country.

	<B>Mr. Simon de Jong (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Human 
Resources Development. A Statistics Canada study shows that poor 
children are three times more likely to be in remedial classes than 
children from the richest families.
<P>
	Since the government was elected the number of children living 
in poverty have increased while the transfer payments to provinces 
for social support programs and education have been slashed. The 
opportunity of getting out of the poverty cycle has been reduced.
<P>
	Is this an example of the new Liberalism that oversees the 
entrenchment of a permanent underclass?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member 
should be aware it is obvious that child poverty is the number one 
issue on the minds of all Canadians.
<P>
	Therefore the agreement that we made with the provinces and 
the new child tax credit are intended to help alleviate the concern of 
all Canadians. To suggest that somehow any member of Parliament 
on any side of the House would not see this as a major challenge is 
quite disgusting, to say the least.
<P>
	We are trying as governments to deal with child poverty. They 
are not interested on all sides of the House in having any underclass 
in our country.
<P>
	That is the NDP philosophy. That is why people do not vote for 
the NDP. It tries to split people into interest groups. We try to deal

<P>
	The Canada infrastructure program created tens of thousands of 
jobs across Ontario. As we approach round two the Ontario 
government has proposed to exclude municipalities from the 
project approval process. To add insult to injury, it is rumoured that 
the amount of money  to be allocated to the greater Toronto area is 
disproportionately low.
<P>
	Will the President of the Treasury Board guarantee that before 
the program goes ahead with Ontario the municipalities will be 
given a meaningful role?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
early February I indicated to Minister Eves of Ontario that we were 
ready to have an agreement on the basis of the current guidelines.
<P>
	Mr. Eves then proposed an approach where the province of 
Ontario selected all the projects and subsequently presented the 
federal partner with a list. This is a very substantial change from 
the current guidelines where the municipalities had the 
responsibility to identify and select the projects.
<P>
	I cannot in good conscience agree the municipalities which pay 
one-third of the cost of the program would have no voice in 
deciding where the projects are.
<P>
	It is true, according to the current list developed by Ontario that 
has not been fully revised by federal officials in particular, that the 
counties of Muskoka, Haliburton and Parry Sound received 
disproportionately high benefits relative to population. 
Coincidentally and to our great surprise, this is Minister Eves' 
riding.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The hon. 
member for Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies has 13 minutes 
remaining.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I will not be taking my 13 minutes. I have been 
asked to be brief because a number of my colleagues wish to take 
part in this debate, as we know, and there is not much time left 
today.
<P>
	I would just like to sum up what I have said. The government has 
had an excellent opportunity in the past two years, with the 1996 
and the 1997 budgets, to completely rework the Canadian taxation 
system, to ensure that the rich people in this country pay their 
taxes, which is not now the case, as well as to reduce the gap that 
currently exists between the middle class and the rich.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	For the past two years, the government has opted not to revise 
the taxation system, on which the Bloc Quebecois has already done 
some in-depth research. Instead, it has preferred to dump almost 
the entire deficit reduction effort on the sick, on welfare recipients 
and students and on the unemployed, by chopping $4.5 billion from 
transfer payments to the provinces, much of  which goes to welfare, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9941"> 9941 </A></B>
<P>
hospitals and education, and taking $5 billion from the 
unemployment insurance fund.
<P>
	The Prime Minister will most certainly be calling an election in 
the next few days, and will be wooing the votes of all those 
unemployed people in Canada whose benefits he has just cut 
drastically and who will find themselves without any benefits this 
fall after the election is over.
<P>
	I would just like to close by wishing him good luck. In many 
parts of Canada and Quebec he is really going to need it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I was 
expecting the Bloc member to make a few more comments and he 
caught me by surprise.
<P>
	This budget implementation bill is obviously important. We 
certainly have to take a look at the financial status of the 
government and what is happening in Canada today.
<P>
	There has been a lot of talk that very shortly the finance minister 
will be announcing a much lower deficit than he projected in 
February of this year when he said that the budget would come in at 
about $19 billion.
<P>
	When we analyse the latest <I>Fiscal Monitor</I> put out by the 
Department of Finance two months in arrears, we see some 
interesting financial information. The Department of Finance 
releases this document which enables everyone to see what is 
happening on an ongoing basis. It is a very worthwhile and useful 
document.
<P>
	Reform researchers have analysed it and have found some 
interesting information. Last year the government was able to 
predict a deficit overshoot by extrapolating final fiscal figures from 
the monthly series. The presentation I make today will show a bit 
about how the government is able to make its projections and 
predictions and keep telling Canadians where it stands.
<P>
	Since the <I>Fiscal Monitor</I> is released with an average of a 
two-month lag, the most recent figures are from the February issue. 
It covers 11 months of the previous fiscal year, from April 1, 1996 
to February 1997. The deficit at the end of February stood at $7.8 
billion or $15.5 billion lower than the same period in the previous 
year of 1995-96. The improvement comes from increased revenues 
of $9 billion, reduced transfers to provinces of $4 billion, reduced 
public debt charges of $1.7 billion and reduced departmental 
spending of $400 million.
<P>
<B>(1215 )</B>
<P>
	The Liberals will overshoot their deficit target by about $10 
billion, mostly as a result of stronger than expected revenue 
growth, an international trend toward lower interest rates and large 
reductions in health and education transfers to provinces.
<P>
	If members will recall, the finance minister projected a $24 
billion deficit for year ending March 31, 1997 and then it was 
revised recently to $19 billion. This $10 billion overshoot is from 
the $24 billion down to about $14 billion instead of the $19 billion 
that he had projected.
<P>
	The finance minister's department seems unable to make 
accurate forecasts. That generally reduces the level of confidence 
with which people view any of their forecasts.
<P>
	During the Mulroney years, which was referred to today in 
question period, the department was always wrong in that it always 
overstated revenue growth. Now the department errs in the other 
direction, constantly understating revenue growth with the 
implication that taxes remain high as a result of this 
understatement.
<P>
	It is just as bad to be wrong one way as it is to be the other. If a 
deficit is projected at X and it is exceed because certain things 
happen negatively in the economy, we have an excuse. If a deficit is 
projected at of X and it is lower, then it depends on what program 
we are trying to push.
<P>
	I maintain that the finance minister is trying to preserve and 
protect the EI fund, which has now reached $7 billion, as a surtax 
on his deficit. Rather than making the program spending cuts that 
he projected and said he would, he is using this extra revenue from 
UI to cover off his and his department's slow progress in making 
the cuts that they promised to make.
<P>
	Perhaps the minister would have faced more pressure to cut 
taxes had the department been more accurate in its forecast. This 
type of poor forecasting sets a dangerous precedent and calls into 
question its credibility. The one thing the Department of Finance 
should be serious about guarding is its credibility in making 
forecasts.
<P>
	However, one never knows what happens with the Department of 
Finance, the cabinet and the finance minister. Perhaps there is some 
political pressure. Perhaps there are instructions to shape, present 
the numbers, present the worst case scenario and be overly 
conservative on revenues so that the pressure can be kept up to 
make the cuts. In either case, there is a variance that is never 
accurate.
<P>
	Nobody says the forecast has to be within a billion dollars. 
However, if it cannot be within 15 per cent or 20 per cent of the 
projected number, whether it is a deficit or a surplus-let us say 
that a 20 per cent variance is acceptable either over or under-if it 
is exceeded then the fundamentals that are being used to achieve 
those budgetary projections, especially given that they are revised 
on a quarterly basis, have to be seriously questioned.
<P>
	If it actually does go from $24 billion as was forecast a year ago 
February down to $14 billion, some people would say that was 
great. This is what the Liberal  government says. However, I am 
submitting that is bad. It is just as bad as the Conservatives when 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9942"> 9942 </A></B>
<P>
they projected a $20 billion deficit and it ended up at $38 billion, 
$18 billion higher. That is more than 20 per cent the other way.
<P>
	What we need is a Department of Finance that will not get brow 
beaten by any finance minister regardless of political party, that 
will present the facts as it knows them to be because it is the one 
constant from government to government. The officials who work 
in that department have a handle on the revenue stream. Unless a 
government decides to spend a bunch of money somewhere else, it 
is able, given the variance in the economy, to conservatively and 
within a 20 per cent variance predict the revenues. However, it is 
off big time.
<P>
	Never before have I seen a government make so many 
fundamental changes in the way it does the financial statements 
and present the government's balance sheet. The government has 
moved things around. It has redefined certain types of spending. 
This has allowed the government basically to redefine program 
spending and claim that it is sticking to the percentage cuts that it 
predicted of 18 per cent when it is really only 8 per cent or 7 per 
cent. It has taken some program spending out and put it over into 
other areas, off balance sheet spending and it ends up claiming that 
it has met its targets when that was not the intent.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	The government was supposed to cut $9 billion and to date it has 
only cut $4 billion. We are going to go into an election. Is it going 
to promise to do the rest a year from now? The implication of bad 
forecasting is just as bad if one is better than expected rather than 
worse than expected.
<P>
	If we take a look at the difference and review the components of 
the deficit reduction, we see from the ``Fiscal Monitor'' that the 
revenues of the government increased by $8.964 million. The 
government reduced the transfers to persons by $349 million. It 
reduced transfers to provinces by $4 billion. Departmental 
spending went down by $400 million in the last 11 months and the 
debt charges were less than projected at $1.7 billion. That is a 
variable that is out of the control of the government.
<P>
	When things get really bad the government will say: ``Interest 
rates are not really something that we can control directly. 
Indirectly, yes, we can, by running a prudent government''. Interest 
rates are a factor of the global economy and how our dollar 
compares on an exchange rate basis with currencies of other 
countries. Therefore, to that degree it can have a huge variance and 
a huge swing and the government cannot be held accountable 
totally for that.
<P>
	We notice that this comes to $15 billion. That is the total decline 
in the deficit. Of that $15 billion, the  increased revenue as a 
percentage of these reductions is a 58 per cent component. The 
transfer to persons is at 2.3 per cent. The transfer to provinces is at 
26 per cent. The departmental spending is only 2.6 per cent.
<P>
	Wait a second, were the transfers to provinces not to be equal to 
the reduction in departmental spending? That is what the 
government said. It was going to lead by example. It was going to 
cut $9 billion out of program spending to justify the $7.5 billion 
reduction in transfers to provinces for the Canada health and social 
transfer. It does not seem to me that the government is on target for 
that. The debt charges as a percentage of the $15 billion 
improvement is11 per cent.
<P>
	To sum up, according to our table, increases in revenue and 
reductions in transfers to the provinces made up a full 84 per cent 
of the improvement. Increased revenues through taxation, 
reduction in the transfers to provinces represent $13 billion out of 
$15 billion in improvement which is 84 per cent. Yet the 
government claims that 94 per cent of it is through growth in the 
economy.
<P>
	Cuts in the federal government's own back yard make up only a 
2.6 per cent paltry reduction. It is important to note that the tiny 
contribution of cuts to departmental spending correspond with 
what the Reform Party's earlier findings were, that the government 
has missed its cuts in departmental spending by as much as 50 per 
cent. We brought this out two or three weeks ago in question 
period, when we said that the evidence is that the government has 
only cut by $4.2 billion and it promised $9.5 billion.
<P>
	It is important to note that the surplus in the employment 
insurance account is running at $6.8 billion after 11 months. Let us 
just round that out to $7 billion for the sake of discussion. This 
surplus represents a regressive form of deficit reduction tax and in 
question period today in quizzing the finance minister I referred to 
this as a deficit surtax.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	The government should set EI premiums on an annual basis to 
match the funds required, within a tolerance level. If the 
government would set the premiums to match the benefits, the 
deficit would be $14.6 billion rather than $7.8 billion and it would 
be right on target.
<P>
	I will give the finance minister some constructive criticism 
which will help to improve the economy. It will help to keep 
Canada competitive. It will help to keep interest rates as low as 
possible without outside interference. The $7 billion surplus in the 
EI account should come under general revenues. It should be 
applied against the deficit to reduce it.
<P>
	If the government were to lower the premiums from the current 
$2.95 or $2.90 per hundred of insurable earnings up to $39,000 
down to $2.20 and leave that money in the hands of the wage 
earner, their take home  pay would increase. That would also 
reduce by 28 per cent what the employer has to pay. It leaves more 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9943"> 9943 </A></B>
<P>
money for the corporations to hire people, to invest and to expand. 
It will help to stimulate the economy.
<P>
	There is the argument that EI and CPP are not payroll taxes, that 
they are investments. Regardless of what they are, the money is 
taken away from workers and corporations by the government. The 
rate at which the money is taken away is set by the government. If 
it is compulsory it is a tax. If it is voluntary, like an RRSP, if it is an 
inducement to invest, it is an investment.
<P>
	Nevertheless, if the taxpayer was able to keep the money, I 
submit that more jobs would be created. More money would be 
spent. More money would be invested and more money saved. That 
would benefit a lot of Canadians.
<P>
	I am not the only person who thinks that way. I am a 
businessman and I have thought this way for a long time. Wherever 
possible, keep taxes as low as possible and set the tax rate at the 
level required to pay for the programs which Canadians want.
<P>
	In today's <I>Financial Post</I> is an article written by the business 
economist Dale Orr. He wrote: ``What is really happening is that 
Ottawa is using the present annual surpluses of $5 billion or so in 
the EI fund as a form of deficit reduction surtax''. The only thing 
wrong with that statement is that it is not $5 billion, it is $7 billion. 
The finance minister is using $7 billion of funds which come from 
employed workers and corporations, the intent of which is to pay 
for people who are unemployed while they are looking for 
employment for a certain period of time.
<P>
	There is a huge surplus. The excuse is that some years there is a 
deficit. That is true. When I ran in 1992-93 the deficit in the EI 
fund was $3 billion. That gives a clue why in our zero in three 
budget we felt it imperative to make $12 billion in cuts 
immediately, faster than the paltry cuts the government has made 
in its program spending, because we did not count on a huge 
surplus in the EI fund.
<P>
	This is a gift to the finance minister which he has misused. He 
has a golden opportunity to stick to his party's platform, to stick to 
his party's caring, sharing, forgiving and giving government, doing 
it slowly, doing it properly, not punishing people unduly, and yet he 
will not share the $7 billion. He has a golden opportunity.
<P>
	He might do something during the election campaign. Maybe 
that is the selective tax cut that he will justify because I agree we 
cannot have a broad based tax cut.
<P>
	Today he misrepresented our platform when he said that the 
Reform Party would implement a broad based tax cut. That was not 
true. He told half the story. He should be spewing forth the truth 
when he talks that way.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	He should be saying that once the budget is balanced the Reform 
Party would offer broad based tax cuts that would average $2,000 
per family by the year 2000. That is why we say $2,000 in 2000. It 
takes a year or two to balance the budget. We say no tax breaks 
until then, no tax cuts until then.
<P>
	Then we raise the personal exemptions, the spousal exemptions, 
to $7,900. We will get rid of the federal surtax of 5 per cent, the 3 
per cent, and all the extra taxes we will not need. That will leave the 
money in the hands of the people who need it, in the hands of the 
people who know how to spend it better to look after themselves. 
This in turn will reduce the pressure on welfare programs, reduce 
the pressure on all the other social assistance programs the 
government has to provide, as it should to those who truly need 
them.
<P>
	I will quote further from the <I>Financial Post</I> to support my 
argument and submission that there is an opportunity here to do 
something with the $7 billion in the EI fund.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A faster reduction in the premium rate would help lower business costs for 
employers, whose share of the premiums is proportionally more. It would boost take 
home pay, especially for lower income workers. The combination would contribute 
to higher consumer spending, profits, economic growth and jobs. Some studies put 
the employment potential at up to 200,000 jobs.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	A potential for 200,000 jobs just be lowering the unemployment 
premium rates, EI rates, to $2.25 or $2.30 from the current $2.95.
<P>
	These are not from the Reform Party. The finance minister takes 
off his glasses, waves them and says that half-baked numbers do 
not work. They were from a business economist. He is not the only 
one. I could quote many different sources and many economists 
who argue and maintain this point of view.
<P>
	High taxes kill jobs. Payroll taxes kill jobs. Why does the 
finance minister not something when he can and while he can? We 
have a surplus. We do not need the $7 billion in the EI fund. We 
should keep a base of $3 billion to $4 billion, keep that surplus and 
reinvest $3 billion of it with the Canadian public.
<P>
	Maybe I should not tell him that, because if he offers that he 
might come back here with a majority government again. We really 
do not want that. We want a fresh government later this year.
<P>
	I will summarize a few more items from the <I>Fiscal Monitor</I>. 
Transfer payments in the 11 months since April 1996 to February 
1997 have decreased. Transfer payments to individuals, which 
includes the elderly benefits and the EI benefits, net out at a 
decrease of $349 million. It increased the elderly benefits by $512 
million and decreased EI benefits by $861 million.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9944"> 9944 </A></B>
<P>
	Not only is what it is collecting on EI greater than what needs 
to be put out, but the benefits it is paying out are going down from 
the previous year by almost $1 billion or $861 million.
<P>
	Transfers to governments have been reduced by $4 billion. Of 
that $4 billion, $3.685 billion is the Canada health and social 
transfer after 11 months. That is where it hits.
<P>
	The government claims it is the fault of provincial governments 
because it is their responsibility to look after health care. If they 
close hospitals, we should not blame the Liberals. If they have to 
lay off nurses and pay doctors less, we should not blame them. We 
should blame the provincial governments, provincial health 
ministers, provincial premiers and provincial treasurers. How 
foolish is that?
<P>
	In its first budget it said that we all must sacrifice. I support the 
government in reducing the Canada health and social transfer by 
$7.5 billion. That is not my criticism.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	The Liberals said that we had to share, sacrifice and make do 
with the same or less money. They were to show leadership by 
example. They were to cut federal government program spending 
outside the Canada health and social transfer, outside the transfer to 
provinces. They were to reduce the rest of the spending of 
government by a greater amount than the $7.5 billion. They were to 
reduce it by $9.5 billion. To date, after 3.5 years and projected to 
the end of four years, the government will not be there. The 
Liberals will have only made $4 billion with those cuts. That is 
from their own information.
<P>
	This is not being made up by the Reform Party. I respect the 
Liberal member opposite who said politicians should represent 
more of the facts rather than distort or give their interpretation of 
them. That is what I am trying to do. The government has fallen far 
short.
<P>
	Other transfers and subsidies add up to $128 million. Total 
program spending has decreased by $4.778 million. If the 
government were truly trying to show leadership by example, after 
four years of governance the government should be closer to 50:50 
in program spending even in the past year. In fact the number 
should be higher than $4.7 million. The $3.6 billion reduction in 
Canada health and social transfer is fine. That was projected. It was 
to be phased in over a period of time, two or three years, which is 
the right way of doing it.
<P>
	Cuts in program spending should have matched. Rather than 
$4.7 million, the real embarrassment to the finance minister is that 
the number should be $7.2 million. He has failed to pressure, to 
push, to keep the other cabinet ministers in line, and to force 
cabinet ministers, deputy ministers and assistant deputy ministers  
to clean house, to shape up. This is what the Canadian public wants.
<P>
	Those are the direct words and orders from the finance minister 
and the President of the Treasury Board. They set the target and 
they are missing it big time. That is the embarrassment in the 
<I>Fiscal Monitor</I>.
<P>
	That is what it revealed. That is the failure of the finance 
minister. He is actually $4 billion behind the cuts he promised to 
make when he asked all Canadians to sacrifice and all levels of 
government below this one to figure out ways to provide the same 
level of service with less money. The federal government cannot do 
it.
<P>
	The President of the Treasury Board rose today in question 
period with a set up answer from the former minister of defence. 
He talked about infrastructure and whether municipalities would be 
guaranteed the money would go to the programs they want. Then 
he lambasted the finance minister from Ontario. He quoted him by 
name. He took after the premier of the province. Those two 
gentlemen are in provincial politics. They are not even in the 
Chamber. They are not here to ask a question or to defend 
themselves. That is shameless. It is an embarrassment to have a 
member of the government do that. It was cheap, political 
partisanship against a level of government that is not even here.
<P>
	He should hang his head in shame. He should write a letter of 
apology saying that he is sorry and that he got carried away. He 
should indicate there is an election coming and the former minister 
of defence asked him to embarrass the local government in Toronto 
so that he can boost his chances of getting re-elected.
<P>
	That is crap. They believe in infrastructure but I do not. I 
criticize all levels of government for going forward on short term 
jobs. There is only one taxpayer. It is an admission by all levels of 
government that they have let infrastructure deteriorate, if that is 
where it is truly going.
<P>
	The first responsibility of a municipal government is 
infrastructure: bigger projects, provincial and bigger than that, 
federal. Where have these guys been for 10 years if all of a sudden 
we have to spent $6 billion or $9 billion on infrastructure?
<P>
	To pick on people in another level of government who are not in 
the House and cannot defend themselves is a new level of cheap 
political partisanship I have not seen before. The government has 
made its deficit reduction mainly by cutting the transfers to 
provinces. Some 77 per cent of this year's deficit reduction has 
been through the Canada health and social transfer. It is undeniable. 
The facts are here. I am quoting the government's own statistics.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	We have proof that an overwhelming majority of the 
improvement in government program spending comes  from cuts to 
the CHST. I have already said what the percentage. When we 
include other transfers to provinces, reductions in transfers 
accounted for a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9945"> 9945 </A></B>
<P>
full 84 per cent. Eighty-four per cent of government spending was 
by way of downloading. The provinces were given less. They were 
told to handle it, and the government said it cut spending. The 
government says it has done its part and now it is the provinces' 
turn. What a way to do it.
<P>
	It promised to cut program spending by 18.8 per cent and then 
only reached 9 per cent and changed the definition of program 
spending. It took from here and there and suddenly $4.5 billion 
because 18 per cent again. How does $4.5 billion become 18 per 
cent? Once again it is perception.
<P>
	I will speak later on Bill C-95, the anti-gang legislation. The 
Prime Minister in his autobiography said that in politics perception 
was everything. What a shame. It is too bad that in politics reality 
and facts cannot be everything. It is too bad those in the traditional 
parties who were here before us believed in that perception. Why 
not deal in truth and facts? Why not represent reality and assess 
what is really happening and then propose legislation to solve the 
problem?
<P>
	In a 1995 speech to a symposium on budget deficits sponsored 
by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, the Minister of 
Finance stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We were nevertheless determined not to cut back our support to the provinces by 
any greater percentage than we were hitting programs in our own backyard.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	If he wants to refer to our zero in three, which I will touch on that 
a little later, I will refer to what he said in 1995.
<P>
	Cuts to provincial transfers made up 84 per cent of the total 
spending cuts to date this year. Departmental reductions have made 
up 8.4 per cent of the spending cuts. The reduction in transfers to 
the provinces represents a 16.2 per cent cut over 11 months. The 
$400 million in departmental spending represents 1 per cent.
<P>
	In the second budget he told us what he was to do with the CHST. 
He made the promise worldwide so it must be something he 
believed in and something he told cabinet he would do. He was 
determined-I would assume cabinet and the rest of the Liberal 
caucus were determined-not to cut back support to the provinces 
by any greater percentage than they were hitting programs in their 
own backyard. All they have cut in their own backyard to date is 
$4.5 billion. What they have cut by downloading to provinces in 
other areas amounts to $8 billion.
<P>
	How about that for promises? That party is good at breaking 
promises made in its election platforms. The Liberals got elected 
on renegotiating NAFTA but did not do it. They got elected on not 
having a third runway in Toronto. They got elected on saving 
taxpayers money on Pearson airport but did not do it. It will cost us 
close to  $600 million. They got elected on getting rid of the GST 
but did not do it. In fact they entrenched it.
<P>
	Talking about flip-flops, when the finance minister was on this 
side of the House he said that if a provincial sales tax is ever 
combined with a goods and services tax the GST is entrenched 
forever. What has he done as finance minister? There is a GST and 
a BST in the three Atlantic provinces that were signed on by three 
Liberal premiers, one of whom quit because he saw the writing on 
the wall. I am looking forward to the provincial elections to be held 
in another year or so when the effect of the harmonized sales tax 
works through the system. He has entrenched this GST, a terrible 
thing which is against his own principles. There are two examples 
right there.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	The government is skimming more and more of the economy's 
weak recovery in the form of higher tax revenues. In April through 
February 1996, the government collected $3.5 billion more in 
personal income tax alone. Part of this increase was due to 
technical factors which affected the timing of income tax payments 
while the remainder was due to the effects of inflation in an 
unindexed graduated rate system with frozen basic exemptions.
<P>
	Today I asked the finance minister, if everything is so good, why 
is the after tax disposable income per family down by $3,000? If 
the minister has not raised personal income taxes over the past 
three years, why has personal income tax revenue in this past year 
alone been $4 billion more? And why has personal income tax 
revenue overall been between $10 billion and $12 billion? In 
response to my questions, the finance minister cited two or three 
things and then he stopped. The rest of the truth he failed to spew 
out was that he had tinkered with the personal income tax system, 
that he had removed some personal exemptions and basic 
deductions and that he had closed a few tax loopholes. He failed to 
say the one big thing he did, which represented a lot of revenue and 
which he would not talk about.
<P>
	There is a law that unless inflation increases by 3 per cent in the 
economy the personal exemption will stay frozen. In other words, 
an individual gets $6,500, the spousal deduction is $5,900 and it 
will not be touched until inflation hits 3 per cent. It is 2.5 per cent. 
It has averaged about 2 per cent in the past five years which adds up 
to 10 per cent. Those people who have seen their incomes go up by 
10 per cent because of inflation are in a higher tax bracket. They 
still get the same low personal deduction of $6,500 and therefore 
they are paying more in taxes. And he says: ``I have not raised 
personal income taxes''. Well, yes he has.
<P>
	The Reform Party recognizes that. We also recognize the need to 
ensure there is sufficient revenue so that programs can be paid for, 
health care and education spending can be increased by $4 billion 
and we can work toward a balanced and surplus budget. Then the 
first  thing we would do is raise the exemption level, both personal 
and spousal to $7,900. We recognize that stay at home parents are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9946"> 9946 </A></B>
<P>
being taken advantage of and to help the family decide on its 
lifestyle and not force both individuals in a marriage to work 
outside the home. We recognize that what anybody does when they 
stay at home is just as valuable as when they go out to work. That is 
why we would make that exemption the same. That is my story and 
analysis of the ``Fiscal Monitor''.
<P>
	Let me get back to the Liberals' favourite tax. The GST and the 
HST are entrenched forever in our lives. This goes against the very 
words of the finance minister when he was in opposition. I could 
not do that and I would not do that. That is not why I would be here. 
I would consider myself a hypocrite if I did that.
<P>
	Everybody in the country ranted and raved against the 
Conservatives on the GST. Eighty-three per cent of Canadians did 
not want the GST and the fools still put it in because they said they 
knew what was best for us. ``Leadership isn't about popularity'', 
said the former Prime Minister, ``it is about doing what is right for 
the people, and we know what is right''. How the heck can 83 per 
cent of Canadians be wrong?
<P>
	The Liberals rightly attacked it and attacked it. I am not sure 
what the NDP did but I know the Liberals attacked it. I have 
quotations from the Minister of Transport, the Minister of Finance, 
the Prime Minister, everybody attacked it. They said that it was a 
big issue. They had a big pre-election meeting in Toronto at which 
they decided to abolish the GST: ``We're going to kill it, we're 
going to scratch it, we're going to get rid of it''. They got elected 
partly on making that promise door to door. That promise was 
probably a huge factor in their election.
<P>
	I hope the Canadian taxpayer remembers what this Liberal 
government did to get itself elected. Liberals promised jobs, jobs, 
jobs. That was their big slogan. There were 1.6 million people 
unemployed. Today there are between 1.4 and 1.5 million 
unemployed and just as many if not more underemployed. Did the 
Liberals keep their promise? Did they create the jobs? Decide.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	Then we have the GST. Their promise went from abolishing it, 
killing it, scrapping it, to replacing it, harmonizing it. After two 
years they went from killing to replacing to harmonizing. If we 
read the promise in the red book, it states that they would 
harmonize with a system that was revenue neutral. This is not 
revenue neutral. It cost the Canadian government $961 million to 
pay the Atlantic provinces for their loss of revenue from lowering 
their provincial rate. They call that paying Canadians. I call that a 
cost.
<P>
	When the Liberals say they have solved the problem and have 
kept their promise, it is only in three provinces. Surely to goodness 
a promise to harmonize would  include all of Canada, would 
include at least Ontario where they have 98 out of 99 seats. They 
even failed to impress Ontario with their big harmonized sales tax 
scheme. Do members know why? It is because the Ontario 
government is smart enough to recognize how much it will hurt 
consumers in the long run.
<P>
	After all, a goods and services tax, no matter how it is sliced, no 
matter what the arguments are-that it helps businesses to keep the 
cost of the product low, that it simplifies the system and that they 
would have lower overhead-which are all true, but the one thing 
they stop short of saying is that no matter what the rate is, whether 
it is 1 per cent, 7 per cent or 15 per cent, guess who pays. The 
consumer pays. They pay pre-tax. They pay tax on their income. 
They have after tax dollars and they have to pay tax on that.
<P>
	What everyone ends up doing in this country, if they work nine 
to five, is work half a day for the government and receive half their 
pay.
<P>
	How much time do I have left, Madam Speaker?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> You are out of 
time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Have I had my 40-minute intervention?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Really, I was just getting warmed up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simon de Jong (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B> Madam 
Speaker, my intervention will not be 40 minutes but I wish to put a 
few things on the record.
<P>
	It is of course always a concern for New Democrats, particularly 
a New Democrat from Saskatchewan, to make certain that the 
books are balanced. I know many people have accused the New 
Democratic Party of being the party of tax and spend and running 
up high deficits. However, the background and history of the 
leadership of both the CCF and New Democratic governments in 
Saskatchewan has shown that historically we want to maintain a 
balanced budget.
<P>
	The Regina manifesto put it so well: ``No CCF government will 
run its public finances to help feed the parasitic interest receiving 
classes''.
<P>
	Having said that, it is worth noting that the attempts by the 
present Liberal government to balance its books have basically 
been done on the backs of working Canadians, the poor, the elderly, 
the young and the sick.
<P>
	As the previous speaker from the Reform Party so aptly put it, 
most of the money saved by this government has been because of 
the cutbacks to the Canadian health and social transfer payments. 
Huge sums of money that should have gone to the provinces to help 
pay for medicare, post-secondary education and the increased 
number of people on social assistance rolls because of the lack of 
job opportunities, are the people who are paying for the deficit 
reduction of this government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9947"> 9947 </A></B>
<P>
	As well, major hunks of surpluses of the employment insurance 
fund are going to general revenues to help further reduce the 
deficit. Yet let us not forget that it is not the poor and not the 
unemployed and it is not our social programs that have created 
the debt in the first place. A Statistics Canada study in the early 
nineties determined that 50 per cent of the debt was due to high 
interest payments. Some 44 per cent of it was due to loss of 
revenues. Only 6 per cent was due to increases in government 
expenditures of which I believe only 4 per cent was due to 
increases in government expenditures on social programs.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	It was not the increase in social programs that created the debt in 
the first place. It was the reaction to the runaway inflation of the 
seventies that created the high interest payments going to 18, 19, 20 
some per cent that catapulted the deficits into huge debts. Then it 
was the loss of jobs, plus the tax loopholes that mainly the Liberal 
government introduced in the 1970s that created a loss of revenue 
which in turn also accounted for 44 per cent of the debt.
<P>
	Only 6 per cent of the debt is because of increases in government 
programs and only 4 per cent of that is due to increases in social 
expenditures. Yet who are the people who paid for the reduction of 
the deficit? It mainly comes on the backs of working people, the 
young, the sick, the unemployed and the poor.
<P>
	A few years back Jesse Jackson in the United States coined a 
phrase that ``it wasn't us poor people who sat and indulged 
ourselves at the banquets but we're the ones who are stuck with the 
bill''. That is as true for people in Canada as it is in the United 
States.
<P>
	The wild government expenditures of the 1970s that created 
runaway inflation, that saw the horrendous growth of assets, 
stocks, bonds and real estate, both in Canada and in the United 
States, those are the people who benefited. Yet they are not the ones 
who are paying for it. Their effective tax rates have actually 
declined while the taxes for working and middle class Canadians, 
even for poor pensioners, have increased while their benefits have 
decreased.
<P>
	This system is wrong. It is morally wrong. It is economically 
wrong. It is a bankrupt system that does not bode well for the 
economic health and well-being of our country. The 
mismanagement and the wrong economic policies of this 
government and the previous Tory government have led us to a 
position where we have this huge mountain of debt that will take I 
do not know how many generations to pay off.
<P>
	One of the items also included as a tax item in this bill that we 
are debating, Bill C-92, is a change that resulted from the Supreme 
Court decision on what is called the Thibaudeau case. It was 
determined that rather than having the higher income earner paying 
child support  and family support payments being able to deduct 
those payments from his or her income tax, it should be the 
recipient of the payment who actually had to pay for those costs.
<P>
	At the time it was recognized that this would mean less money to 
families for child care and that it would mean an increase in 
government revenues. In fact the budget papers for 1996 suggested 
that as a result of the Thibaudeau court case the government will 
get a windfall of $120 million in the third year in increased tax 
revenues and more in subsequent years.
<P>
<B>(1300 )</B>
<P>
	That is $120 million extra which is being taken away from 
families. In most cases the male makes child support payments. 
They cannot deduct those payments from their income tax. The low 
income earner is not able to deduct child care expenses and the 
government is ending up with more money.
<P>
	While we support it in principle, it is of concern to us that $120 
million is being taken away from families. That money should be 
going to support children.
<P>
	I would like to place the position of the New Democratic Party 
on the record today. We would want this section of Bill C-92 to be 
reviewed on a yearly basis to determine what impact it is having on 
child care and the families raising children.
<P>
	Our concern is the impact this will have on children, particularly 
those children living below the poverty line. We are concerned that 
in the end it will mean some $120 million being taken away from 
the needs of those children. On behalf of the New Democratic Party 
I would like to put on record our concern and our wish that this 
section be reviewed on a yearly basis.
<P>
	The tax system is essential for a government to raise the 
revenues it needs to do the things which government should be 
doing and as well to effect a redistribution of wealth in the country. 
Our position has always been that such a system must be fair and 
equal to all Canadians. That is why we initially supported the 
suggestions and reports which recommended that a dollar earned, 
whether from profits, commissions, dividends, increases in capital 
gains or by the sweat of one's brow, should all be taxed equally, as 
the Carter commission proposed. We have never come close to 
achieving that ideal. What Carter said was that a dollar is a dollar 
and that the tax on that dollar should be equal.
<P>
	Corporations should be paying their fair share. We have seen 
during Liberal and Conservative regimes more tax loopholes being 
given to the rich and the powerful. While small and medium size 
businesses are struggling to keep their heads above water, creating 
jobs for Canadians, the very large transcontinental corporations are 
able to get by without paying any or very few taxes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9948"> 9948 </A></B>
<P>
	It is a crime that one family should be able to move $1 billion 
offshore and not pay a cent on the capital gains earned on that 
money. It is a shame that would be allowed when poor pensioners 
earning a little over $1,000 a month have to pay tax.
<P>
	The tax system is unfair. That creates cynicism and encourages 
average Canadians to cheat. The average Canadian will say ``why 
should I pay this amount of money when the rich and the powerful, 
those who have the connections to the Minister of Finance and the 
Department of Finance, are able to get special rules and omissions 
so they do not have to pay their fair share of the taxes?''
<P>
	This unfairness must be corrected. We will continue to fight for a 
fair and equal tax system so that all Canadians will be taxed fairly 
and equally.
<P>
<B>(1305 )</B>
<P>
	I find it interesting that Bill C-92 should be debated in what is 
presumed to be the end of this Parliament with an election being 
called soon.
<P>
	Taxation is what Bill C-92 is all about; who has the power, how it 
gets exercised, who benefits from the power. As long as there are 
political parties in power that are financed by the banks, 
international traders and the wheeler and the dealers, by the 
mighty, the powerful and the wealthy, there will never be true 
democracy, true equality and a true and just society. It will be the 
poor and the working people who will pay the price for deficit 
reductions, as we have seen under both the Liberal and Tory 
governments. It will be the poor and ordinary working middle class 
Canadians who will pay the price.
<P>
	The struggle will go on and in the coming election we will make 
certain this becomes a major issue.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is 
good to have a look at some of the amendments to the Income Tax 
Act that the government is proposing.
<P>
	Canadians are probably saying we need do not to amend the 
Income Tax Act; we need to totally eliminate it, rip it down to 
nothing and start again from scratch. The Income Tax Act is 
absolutely enormous. There are volumes and volumes to it. It does 
not seem that regular Canadians are able to fill out their income tax 
returns anymore because it has become so complex.
<P>
	It seems there are so many rules to follow and so many loopholes 
that people can slip through, it is almost impossible for anyone to 
obey the Income Tax Act or make any sense of it.
<P>
	When Bill C-92, an act to amend the Income Tax Act, the 
Income Tax Application Rules and another act related to the 
Income Tax Act came forward, most people would wonder what in 
the world it means. In either official language it does not seem to 
make sense.
<P>
	However, I would like to look at some of the specifics and talk 
about tax credits for individuals. It enriches the education tax 
credit, the tuition fee tax credit and credit for infirmed dependants. 
I guess there is some merit in trying to help students, but I am not 
sure this is the right way to go about it. I am sure that members on 
both sides of the House know that students want a good, solid 
education and a real job at the end. The government is tinkering 
with the Income Tax Act and offering them some token help, and it 
probably is a start. However, I think they would want more 
substantive reforms to make sure that when their formal education 
process is finished they will be able to get a job.
<P>
	It says that the education tax credit is increased from $80 a 
month for those attending school to $100 a month. For a student in 
school for eight months a year, the average university or college 
year, the increase means the education credit goes from $109 to 
$136, a $27 increase.
<P>
	Going out for supper could easily cost $27. This is not a 
tremendous amount of cash, no real encouragement to a serious 
student. Students are not looking for a $27 or $30 change but 
substantive changes from a government that is continuing to spend 
billions and billions more every year than it is bringing in.
<P>
	I know many students are fiscally responsible. Some may be 
living on a student loan. They have resource limitations in terms of 
part time jobs. However, they see their government spending 
money hand over fist, $60 million to $70 million a day more than it 
is bringing in. I do not know how they handle their frustrations 
when they see people who are running the country, the role models 
they are supposed to look up to, spending $60 million to $70 
million a day more than is being brought in and then saying to 
students ``sorry, we have made some tremendous cutbacks in your 
areas but we will be kind and generous with this $27 increase''. 
That is pretty pathetic.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	On the government's huge cuts to provincial transfers with 
respect to education, $7.5 billion cut to the Canada health and 
social transfer has meant huge tuition fee hikes on Canadian 
students. Twenty-seven dollars will produce very little assistance in 
this.
<P>
	It is incredibly incongruous it is for people to say ``we are 
concerned about your welfare, we really want to make sure you get 
a quality education, we care but we just chopped $7.5 billion''. 
They may want to blame it on the Tories.
<P>
	In two Parliaments we had the Tories blaming the Liberals when 
they were in opposition and now we see the Liberals blaming the 
Tories when they are in opposition. This place is just a vicious 
circle that goes round and round. I do not think the Canadian public 
really cares who started it or who is to blame, I think it  wants it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9949"> 9949 </A></B>
<P>
ended and right now. This kind of legislation certainly is not going 
to do it.
<P>
	When Liberals say they are the great defenders of medicare and 
post-secondary education it is unfortunate they do not live up to the 
commitment. When the Liberals were in power in 1965 they gave 
the commitment when medicare came in that they were going to 
pay 50 per cent of the funding of medicare. With this latest budget 
they are now down to 16 per cent. What do you expect the 
provinces to do?
<P>
	Now that post-secondary education is included in the Canada 
health and social transfer I can understand why students are upset. 
And yet the government says it is the defender of post-secondary 
education. I think it is a pretty weak defence and if it is going to 
offer $27 it is more of a slap in the face than what it is intended to 
do.
<P>
	A $7 billion cut. For those who attack my party and say we will 
rip medicare apart and we will not help students, do not forget that, 
as the myth goes, which we hear in question period here every day, 
we will take grocery money from old ladies and will dismantle 
pensions. That is not true.
<P>
	The Liberals looked after the MP pensions very well in this 
Parliament, tightening their belts, austerity measures. Instead of $6 
to one employer-employee contribution, they have really sucked in 
their belts and they are giving $4 to one employee-employee 
contribution. That is not sitting very well across the country.
<P>
	We understand the frustration students feel. The guarantee was 
made that the Liberals are the great defenders of health and 
education. Then they regularly, every day in fact, shriek about the 
fact that the Reformers are going to dismantle pensions and health 
care. That is not true.
<P>
	Reformers have committed to balance the budget and then 
reinvest $4 billion into health care with these kind of dollars in the 
late 90s, because wherever you go across the country and ask 
people their priorities, they say health and education.
<P>
	If those are the priorities, we respect that, but something else has 
to go. If we have a federal government with such a voracious 
appetite that it is spending billions of dollars a year more than it is 
bringing in, then something has to go.
<P>
	When I see this government talking about budgets, finances and 
what a wonderful job it has done in terms of getting the deficit 
under control, it is by tax increases and revenue increases, not by 
cutting spending. This is seen in the public accounts where it says it 
has increased revenues and taxation by $25 billion a year. I think 
the Canadian public would say shame. I think students in terms of 
the tax credits for individuals are not going to be blinded by that.
<P>
	What a pathetic day it is when we say to our young people that 
we are looking after them but then we turn around and slice and 
slash and then blame other political parties. Any political party will 
do for a scapegoat. ``Your more terrible than we are'', they say. Let 
us just fix the problem. That would be a far wiser thing to do.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	If we look at the tax codes and some of the changes that are being 
made in the bill, we realize that the government has maintained its 
policy of adding to the complexity of the tax code, not by adding to 
the simplicity of the tax code.
<P>
	People want things simpler when it comes to income taxes and 
the Income Tax Act, but the government has adjusted the rules for 
various interest groups. I am not surprised by that. For 
years-whether it was the Liberals or Tories really does not 
matter-millions of dollars have gone to special interest groups 
that have one function and one reason only, that is to come to 
Ottawa to lobby for more funds. Governments give money to 
interest groups that come back to Ottawa to ask for more money, 
and it goes around and around. I call it the royal flush.
<P>
	The government has also removed legitimate reductions so that 
overall Canadians have faced an increase in taxation. Earlier today 
in question period the finance minister said that Canadians were far 
better off. Canadians will be doing their taxes this week because 
April 30 is the deadline. I do not think there would be very many 
who would be supportive and say they feel better in terms of their 
disposable income or a whole lot better thinking they have more 
cash in their pockets. That is not true. They can ask their family and 
friends. They all pay taxes.
<P>
	I do not think anyone is jumping up and down, whether in the 
province of New Brunswick where I just came back from this 
morning or on the west coast. People are not feeling really cheery 
that they are paying less taxes. They know they are paying more. 
They have stubs and are sending in their income tax forms this 
week. They know perfectly well what is happening.
<P>
	Government members can talk and blather all it wants in the 
House of Commons but it is irrelevant. People are paying more 
money in taxes. They have less disposable income. The main point 
is that people are frustrated with a system that keeps saying it is 
okay, it is looking after them and it has their best interest at heart. 
Meanwhile the government is winking one eye and has a hand on 
their wallets.
<P>
	A certain trust factor is missing between the Canadian public 
who is filling out its income tax forms right now and the people 
who are saying: ``Trust us. We are from the government. We are 
here to help you''.
<P>
	Taxes have increased since 1993. Again today the finance 
minister was trying hard to make us believe that it was under the 
Conservative government that taxes  increased. We have had a few 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9950"> 9950 </A></B>
<P>
budgets now from this government and that is simply not true. By 
fiscal 1998-99, next year, the government will collect $30.4 billion 
more in tax revenues than it collected its first year in office.
<P>
	It would be difficult to blame the Conservatives for that. The 
Liberals have been in office since 1993. They say it is the fault of 
the Tories, that they are responsible. However, since 1993 they 
received $30.4 billion more in tax revenues than they collected in 
their first year in office.
<P>
	Then there are tax hikes. I have heard for 3.5 years in Parliament 
that the lousy Tories raised taxes time and time again. The Liberals 
were to be better at it. What do you think? The Liberals have hiked 
taxes at least 36 times, not including the multi-billion dollar hikes 
to federal user fees over the same period. There is more money 
going from an individual's pocket to government as a tax.
<P>
	The finance minister can call it an investment. He could call it 
increased revenues for the new, beautiful harmonized sales tax 
down in Atlantic Canada. They are not really happy about it in New 
Brunswick. They voted in a Liberal government because it was 
going to scrap, kill and abolish the GST. It has been entrenched 
further. It is thicker and deeper in Atlantic Canada with this new 
blended sales tax.
<P>
	``We are from the government and we are here to help you''. The 
people in New Brunswick did not feel that way this morning. 
Government members know it and I know it. They have increased 
taxes.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	Canada pension plan premiums were increased by 73 per cent. 
The government says that is an investment and not a tax hike. I am 
not so sure I want the kind of investment the finance minister is 
trying to offer people of my generation and people who are coming 
along behind. We are going to pay 10 per cent of our income into a 
Canada pension plan premium rate so that when we are 65 years old 
we will get a maximum of 8,800 bucks. That will be nowhere near 
$1,000 a month for people in their early twenties when they reach 
65 years of age. It will be an $8,800 a year maximum payout for 
CPP. That is not good enough. People will not be able to live on that 
in the year 2040 or whatever it is they retire.
<P>
	Is it a tax? It is more money going from the taxpayers' pocket to 
a government they do not trust because for the last 25 years 
governments have spent far more money than they have brought in.
<P>
	In 1996-97, not a Tory year but a Liberal year, Canadian 
individuals and companies will have paid $3.1 billion more in taxes 
than they would have paid had the Liberals left the tax system as is 
upon leaving office. Why the time, why the paper, why the energy, 
why the cost in Bill C-92? Why would we bother with it? Even if 
the  Liberals had just left things alone and kept their mitts off it, the 
country would have been better off. It will go up to $3.1 billion 
more in taxes for Canadian individuals and companies. It is pretty 
scary.
<P>
	The finance minister likes to quote from our taxpayers' budget 
and go back to 1993 dollars when we were referring to Econometric 
figures and role models and were making estimates on the dollars 
being spent in 1993 and 1994. He is always interested in comparing 
the dollars of yesteryear. Let us measure it in real 1996 dollars. The 
Liberals will collect $11.4 billion more in income taxes in 1998-99 
than in 1993-94.
<P>
	When the Tories came in and gave their great budget predictions 
for 1996 everything was to be absolutely terrific. However, if we 
look ahead to 1998-99 there will be $11.4 billion more in income 
taxes.
<P>
	The finance minister has now delivered four budgets. I could 
have sworn when first elected he said there would be no new 
income taxes. He would have a hard time convincing Canadian 
citizens today sitting around their tables trying to fill out their tax 
returns that there have been no new income taxes. They would 
think his nose was growing.
<P>
	What is the bottom line? It is that Canadians are shipping more 
of their hard earned money down to Revenue Canada. I do not think 
they are happy about it. Whether they support Liberals, Reformers 
or the Bloc, I do not think they are happy about it. They see less 
return for more money they are sending to the taxman. I guess that 
is what we have to look at.
<P>
	I do not think Canadian citizens deny that they should pay taxes. 
If we want government services, if we want roads, airports and 
other infrastructure, obviously there will be tax revenues. I have 
never met anyone yet who is not upset about paying some form of 
taxes.
<P>
	What bugs them, whether they are Liberal or Reform supporters, 
is that the people they send the taxes to are spending the money 
irresponsibly. They are just tossing it around. It is called deficit 
financing. They are spending tens of billions more every year than 
they are bringing in.
<P>
	It becomes a trust factor with politicians. People ask why they 
should trust the government with the money they send and why 
they should send more when it does not spend what they have 
already sent in a responsible manner. That is the crux of this matter. 
If the government could be trusted more to do what it says it will 
do, people would not mind sending tax money. Taxpayers get pretty 
upset when the government spends more and more and more and 
they are given less and less and less in return. There is something 
wrong with that system.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	Heaven help the politicians who go out of here, probably next 
Sunday when the writ is dropped, and  make foolish, unwise 
promises to get re-elected. If I can leave members in this place with 
some advice, it would be that when they go out on the campaign 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9951"> 9951 </A></B>
<P>
trail they should not to try to buy their way into office or make a 
promise they cannot keep. If they ask Canadians to vote for them 
and promise to give them more, they should remember that it is 
taxpayers' money.
<P>
	I read an article today in a Saint John, New Brunswick, 
newspaper about a government program to give seed money for 
hotels and new armouries to be bought. We should not think for a 
minute that people believe it for a minute. It is taxpayers' money 
which they want the government to spend responsibly and not 
waste.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me this afternoon to join in the debate 
on third reading of Bill C-92, an act to amend the Income Tax Act, 
the income tax application rules and another act related to the 
Income Tax Act.
<P>
	We cannot discuss the bill without talking about Canada's 
crippling public debt, which currently stands at over $600 billion 
and is still rising steadily. It is expected that our national debt will 
reach at least $619 billion by 1998. The Mulroney Tories added 
$300 billion in just nine years. People are well aware of the legacy 
of Brian Mulroney. Thanks to Liberal overspending, Canada's 
public debt has increased by a further $111 billion since they came 
to power in the fall of 1993. The interest payments on the national 
debt are expected to be a staggering $45 billion to $46 billion per 
year over the next three years.
<P>
	Who pays for all this? There is only one Canadian taxpayer and 
that is who is paying. Of the $10,200 the average taxpayer sends to 
the federal government each year, about $3,400 of it will go to 
service the huge public debt.
<P>
	Then we come to the deficit. It was projected at the time of the 
budget at $19 billion for this fiscal year. It is hardly a figure to brag 
about, but that is exactly what the Liberals have been doing. After 
learning about this figure Alberta provincial treasurer, Jim 
Dinning, said that if he were the one turning in that figure he would 
expect a kick in the butt. He would deserve it.
<P>
	We know that the burden of deficit reduction has been 
shouldered by Canadian taxpayers as the Liberal government waits 
for tax revenues to catch up to its spending. There are rumours that 
the deficit could come in substantially lower. We are quite likely to 
see figures of $14 billion, $13 billion or perhaps down around $10 
billion in deficit projections at some point during the election 
campaign.
<P>
	British Columbians will be very suspicious of that type of 
rhetoric during an election campaign. They well remember Glen 
Clark of the NDP that is still in power in British Columbia and 
some of the projections about deficits, balanced budgets and that 
type of nonsense  during the last provincial election. Regardless of 
the deficit number, the point has to made and Canadians have to 
understand that the hole is still getting deeper. We might be digging 
a little slower but it is still getting deeper every year and we are still 
passing on more and more debt to the next generation.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	How has the Liberal government made the gains it has in the 
battle with the deficit? A number of my colleagues referred to this 
during their presentations over the last hour. It is a fact there has 
been a $24 billion a year increase in taxation revenue.
<P>
	It is a fact that as we go into an election campaign, whether it is 
this spring, next fall or next year, the Liberal government has to run 
on the record that it is collecting $24 billion more this year in 
taxation revenue from Canadians than it did in 1993 when it came 
to power.
<P>
	It has to run on the record that it has cut roughly $7.5 billion 
from the Canada health and social transfer. It cannot deny, despite 
its red book claims of being the great defender of medicare, of 
being concerned about the next generation and education for our 
young people, that it is the one that has made that huge cut of $7.5 
billion to the CHST.
<P>
	The Liberals cannot deny that a week before this year's budget 
they slipped in a 73 per cent increase in the CPP premiums. The 
facts speak for themselves. They cannot deny that they have been 
very fortunate to have their administration operating at a time when 
our nation has enjoyed the lowest interest rates in four decades. 
That is the real reason that some gains have been made on the 
deficit.
<P>
	What have we seen in the area of spending? We have seen a total 
lack of priorities. From the time the Reform movement was born in 
1987, we recognized that the way to get government spending 
under control was to reduce the size of government by prioritizing 
spending on the things Canadians desire most. The simple fact is 
that we cannot continue to do business as usual. That is what the 
Liberals are attempting to do. They have made some cuts but in 
reality they still cling desperately to this old philosophy of big 
government, of we know what is best for all people.
<P>
	The arrogance of past prime ministers was very clear during 
Brian Mulroney's presentation to the Canadian Club in Toronto the 
other day. We are seeing that same type of we know what is best 
from the Liberal government across the way.
<P>
	Nothing provides a more apt example of why we find ourselves 
in the position of needing to borrow $10.8 billion this year than 
Canada's regional development agencies. They provide a perfect 
example of the Liberal philosophy: throw money at it and the 
problem will go away. Through agencies such as the Atlantic 
Canada Opportunities Agency, Western Economic  Diversification 
and the Federal Office of Regional Development for Quebec, this 
government is subsidizing private businesses and adding to our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9952"> 9952 </A></B>
<P>
staggering national debt which will be paid off by the long 
suffering Canadian taxpayers and by future taxpayers.
<P>
	By doing so the government is interfering with natural market 
forces. It is using low interest, no interest or in some cases what the 
Liberals would like to call non-repayable loans-whatever they 
are-to give some businesses an edge over their competitors that 
are not fortunate enough to be chosen as the objects of the Liberal 
government's pork-barrelling patronage.
<P>
	In November 1996 the Atlantic Institute for Market Studies 
conducted a study which was aptly titled ``Looking the Gift Horse 
in the Mouth: The impact of federal transfers on Atlantic Canada''. 
The authors of that study found that if the federal government had 
invested all regional subsidies to Atlantic Canada in three month 
United States treasury bills it would have built up a nest egg of 
about $700 billion U.S. since 1971. That is about $1 trillion 
Canadian if the federal government had invested that money.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	To put this into perspective, that is almost twice the size of our 
national debt. The House will remember what I said earlier about 
priority spending. It would translate into a surplus over the debt, no 
more punishing debt service charges and ultimately into much 
reduced taxes for Canadians.
<P>
	In his 1995 budget the finance minister promised to undertake 
what he called a program review. Part of the program review 
involved a commitment to refocus the regional development 
agencies and to decrease spending in this area by 50 per cent, from 
$1.1 billion in 1994-95 to $576 million in 1997-98. What do we see 
now? We see a very different picture from what was promised by 
the government in 1995.
<P>
	When we look very closely we see that regional development 
agencies will actually have total expenditures of $1.2 billion in 
1997-98. However, we do not see the increases in the budget 
numbers. The increases have been hidden, as have other spending 
increases. For example, the 1997 budget did not even provide a 
breakdown of what the regional development agencies will spend 
in the upcoming fiscal year, even though such breakdowns have 
usually been provided in past budgets. If a breakdown of spending 
had been provided, what taxpayers would see is not the 50 per cent 
decrease that the finance minister promised in 1995, but an 
increase.
<P>
	Instead, when funding to extend the infrastructure works 
program is included, what we really see is a 7 per cent increase in 
total expenditures for regional development agencies from the last 
fiscal year. Funding for infrastructure is included in this calculation 
because  the Liberal government originally intended it to be 
included.
<P>
	In their 1995 budget projections for regional development 
spending the government noted that the figures were to include 
infrastructure expenditures. This makes sense, considering that 
infrastructure programs are a form of regional economic 
development based on a formula that includes regional 
unemployment levels.
<P>
	However, what we see now is the Liberal government trying to 
exclude money for infrastructure works from the regional 
development figures in an attempt to make it seem as though 
spending in this area has actually decreased. It is smoke and 
mirrors. This is creative accounting at its worst.
<P>
	When funding to extend the infrastructure works program is 
included, what we see is this:
<P>
	First, Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency spending will 
increase 2 per cent from the last fiscal year to this year, to $347 
million in 1997-98. Spending by the Federal Office of Regional 
Development for Quebec will increase by 11 per cent, to $408 
million. Spending for the western economic diversification 
program will increase by 10 per cent, to $380 million.
<P>
	Where is the money for regional economic development 
agencies going? A look at the public accounts for 1995-96, released 
in October 1996, gives us some telling examples.
<P>
	For example, in that year $211,500 from the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency went to the Society for Canoe 
Championships in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, and $310,071 from the 
western economic diversification program went to the Abbotsford 
air show. Those are probably worthwhile organizations, but is it 
right to invest taxpayers' money in such a way?
<P>
	In January 1997 an interest free loan of $723,000 was granted by 
the western economic diversification program to Alberta potters, 
jewellers, weavers and other craft artists belonging to the Alberta 
Craft Council for Business, Training, Marketing and Network 
Development.
<P>
	When we look at the 1997-98 estimates respecting spending by 
the Federal Office of Regional Development for Quebec, we see 
that from last year to this year total grants under this program, or as 
the Liberals have been fond of calling them, non-repayable loans, 
have increased from $300,000 to $1,055,975. Why? Because once 
again the Liberal government has chosen to subsidize small 
business rather than introduce meaningful tax cuts which would 
encourage economic growth and assist all small business.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	The increase is attributable to grants made under IDEA, the 
innovation development entrepreneurship and access program for 
small and medium sized businesses.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9953"> 9953 </A></B>
<P>
	In the limited time remaining, I will sum up by saying that over 
the last 3.5 years we have seen a lack of commitment to spending 
priorities. Reformers suspected before we became members of 
Parliament and it has been borne out over the last 3.5 years that 
the government is committed to the philosophy of big government, 
big spending, big taxes. The cuts it brags about and which it is 
taking into the election campaign are in reality just smoke and 
mirrors. It has not happened.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Johnston:</B> It is Liberal math.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> That is quite correct. 
Coming to light are the canoe museums, armouries and hotels 
being built in Shawinigan. It reminds me of a comment our deputy 
leader made to me earlier today about the movie <I>Sleepless in 
Seattle</I>. It was a huge hit. The spending in Shawinigan reminds us 
that the Liberal sequel may be Shameless in Shawinigan.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Johnston:</B> Coming to a theatre near you.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Perhaps not to a 
theatre. Coming to a voting booth near you.
<P>
	I am sure that when Canadians take the time to look at the record 
of the Liberal government which added over $100 billion to the 
debt in 3.5 years, drove the country deeper and deeper into debt, 
burdening the already over-burdened citizens and taxpayers of the 
future, and when they go to the voting booths and think of this 
Liberal sequel, Shameless in Shawinigan, they will be turfed out. 
Canadians understand it is Liberal, Tory, same old story. The 
Liberals believe in big government, big spending, big taxes. It has 
been tried for over 130 years and it is time for a fresh start with 
Reform.
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it very interesting to hear the hon. member and his 
description of various aspects of work that we have been 
undertaking over the last several years which have been directed 
toward the creation of opportunities for jobs and growth in the 
Canadian economy.
<P>
	It has been very interesting to begin to speculate, based on what 
we heard him say, what exactly the Reform Party platform might 
mean for jobs and growth in the Canadian economy. I have 
managed to deduce a few things from his comments.
<P>
	The first would be this. Despite all of the efforts that 
governments around the world put into building a vibrant tourism 
industry in their countries, and despite the fact that the tourism 
sector is projected to be one of the largest growing economic and 
employment sectors in the world over the next 20 years as 
increasing numbers of the world's population become 
economically capable of engaging in tourism and travel strictly for 
pleasure, the Reform Party does not believe that the Government of  
Canada should direct its efforts toward improving the tourism 
product or attracting tourism to Canada. Many of the things he has 
criticized are ones that go directly to support the travel and tourism 
business.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	Let me pick one example, the Abbotsford air show. He puts that 
down and he picks on that one. Out in the heartland of British 
Columbia, it is now the premier air show in North America. It is the 
point to which all of the major aircraft suppliers and manufacturers 
come, Abbotsford, British Columbia. It is an important contributor 
to the economic development of that region. It is a destination 
creator for Abbotsford as well as being important to the western 
Canada aerospace sector, and he would cut it out.
<P>
	There is no air show in the world, whether in Paris or the UK, 
that continues to attract the level of participation necessary to have 
a major air show without government support, and the Reform 
Party would end that.
<P>
	He talked of western economic diversification and its role. He 
has a little trouble with the numbers because he cannot quite figure 
out how the infrastructure funds fit into the estimates. He is a little 
out of date. He thinks they are still providing direct assistance to 
individual enterprises. He is wrong. Listening to the last two 
speakers from the Reform Party I am reminded of some of my 
other duties with respect to technology. I think we need a new 
V-chip for the parliamentary channel that can bleep out some of the 
misleading things that occasionally come out of the mouths over 
there.
<P>
	Let me talk about western economic diversification. Not in years 
have they been giving direct assistance to individual enterprises. 
What would they shutdown when they close western economic 
diversification across western Canada? They would close down 91 
points of service for small businesses throughout that region. They 
would close down all the community future development 
corporations, those little organizations grounded in western Canada 
where they develop the priorities for the economy of their region, 
where they sort out what their potential is and how they can build 
jobs and growth.
<P>
	That is not some kind of political slush fund. It is the lawyers, 
the accountants and the small business people of communities 
across western Canada who participate as volunteers in finding the 
keys to economic growth and diversification in their communities. 
That is what western economic diversification is supporting.
<P>
	It is women's enterprise centres, the sources of information for 
women to find out how they can start businesses, how they can 
build careers that not only help themselves but provide 
opportunities for others to work. That is what they would shut 
down. That is what western economic diversification is now doing. 
Their criticism is directed at the dinosaurs that are gone, and not 
inappropriately.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9954"> 9954 </A></B>
<P>
	We hear from Reformers repeatedly that in order to create jobs 
they would slash the government and they would cut taxes. Then 
they make a list. They say the Minister of Finance has raised taxes 
and I think they recite a number. They include of course the 
number of tax increases they blame the Minister of Finance for, 
increase in taxes on the banks. They blame him for shutting down 
loopholes. They count those as tax increases.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has targeted tax reductions, over $2 
billion in the last year in areas where it makes the most difference. 
We help the people who need the help most. They would substitute 
across the board tax cuts in order to benefit whom? The highest 
paid, the best income people in the country. That is the Reform 
Party platform. Is that going to create jobs? It may well do that 
because some of those high income people are going to have more 
spend on their vacations outside Canada.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> There are suntans over there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manley:</B> There is someone speaking who does not like to 
listen. She does not listen very often, I have noticed, around here.
<P>
	What we see repeatedly from Reformers is nothing but a bunch 
of economic bunk. There is no economic analysis or study that they 
can provide to anybody that would show that across the board tax 
cuts can provide direct economic benefits and job creation in this 
country.
<P>
	In fact, they are like the kids before Christmas who want to open 
their presents on December 20. They are not even ready to get the 
deficit down to zero before they start to open the presents and cut 
the taxes. That is the kind of economic analysis and argumentation 
they put forward-
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Madam Speaker, on a 
point of order, perhaps you could enlighten the House. Is this a 20 
minute rambling speech or is this questions and comments?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> This is 
questions and comments for 10 minutes. There are 3 minutes and 
12 seconds left.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manley:</B> Madam Speaker, I did not see any point in putting 
a question because I did not think the hon. member would have an 
answer. However, I do see the point in making comments.
<P>
	We have listened to speaker after speaker from the Reform Party 
spouting this kind of economic nonsense. I have had a great 
privilege as a minister of the crown over the last 3.5 years to travel 
the world and hear from others exactly what it happening and how 
Canada is viewed.
<P>
	When we had to present the budgets in 1994 and 1995 and take 
ourselves to the financial capitals of the world, it was impossible at 
that point to be accepted as credibly  managing the finances of our 
country because of the years of the Mulroney government when the 
Government of Canada had failed to meet its deficit reduction 
targets.
<P>
	We have achieved in exceeding the targets year after year, in 
bringing the deficit from the sixth worst in the G7 to the best in the 
G7, in setting the course toward reducing our overall indebtedness 
as a nation, in reducing a $30 billion a year current account deficit 
to a surplus last year, in reducing the tourism account deficit from 
$6 billion to $2 billion. We have rebuilt this country's credibility. It 
is on that basis that we will rebuild the jobs and economic growth 
that this country so deeply wants.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
how much time do I have?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> One minute.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> This is fair debate?
<P>
	I have never heard such a bunch of nonsense in my whole life as 
what has just been spouted by the hon. minister from across the 
way. He referred to western economic diversification and then 
attacked the Reform Party, saying that we would cut out all these 
great and wonderful things. How many people out there know that 
the western economic diversification program is subsidizing 
banks?
<P>
	He says we would shut down the Abbotsford air show. How 
many people in Abbotsford would vote to subsidize an air show 
versus $7 million cuts in health care? What we are talking about is 
priority spending, something this government does not understand.
<P>
	As far as blipping out stuff on the parliamentary channel, if we 
had to blip out misinformation there would not be a thing said from 
the other side of the House.

	The House resumed from April 17 consideration of the motion

second time and referred to committee of the whole.
<P>
<B>(1355 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I wish 
we could stay on Bill C-92, after the diatribe by the cabinet 
minister, especially in pointing out that we would be making tax 
cuts before the budget is balanced. That is a false representation of 
our platform. We would not cut taxes until the budget was 
balanced. We could get there sooner and we would put more money 
back in the hands of taxpayers than this government will ever 
dream about doing.
<P>
	Let us get to the matter at hand, Bill C-95. Bill C-95 is anti-gang 
legislation that has some serious issues tied and related to it.
<P>
	This all started as an incident, as we all know, in Quebec City. 
There is a lot of violent crime being committed by some gangs 
there, basically threatening innocent bystanders on the streets. It is 
important to address this situation.
<P>
	However, the federal government is reacting to a challenge by 
the Bloc Quebecois that says the government is doing little to 
protect Quebecers. The Minister of Industry states how 
wonderfully the government is investing and how great everything 
is financially in the province of Quebec. I assume he also includes 
it with the regional development grants and how all the wonderful 
laws that the government is passing is benefiting Quebecers so that 
they understand and realize that this is a great country to live in and 
they should stay in Confederation. Notwithstanding all that, the 
representatives who were sent here by the majority of Quebecers, 
the Bloc Quebecois, stand up in this House and say this government 
is doing little to protect Quebecers. They have said other things in 
other areas.
<P>
	Perhaps the federal government should pay more attention to 
what the demands and needs are of various provinces all across the 
country.
<P>
	Perception is everything in politics. The Prime Minister said 
that. As I said earlier today, it is  unfortunate that reality is not 
everything and is what the government is basing its decisions on 
and is what it is working toward; the reality, the real truths, not 
everybody's distorted opinion of the truths.
<P>
	What is wrong here is now that there is an election being called 
this justice minister has rushed to the fore where a month ago he 
was not interested in this issue. When the plea came from the Parti 
Quebecois to do something about introducing stronger federal 
legislation to handle these criminal organizations or a criminal 
gang, he was not interested. He did not want to go too fast.
<P>
	I do not know when somebody whispered in his ear that there 
might be a potential election call, so gear for it, get ready for it. 
Most of the decisions that we have seen in the last couple of weeks 
and the behaviour of this federal government seem to be that it is 
preparing for an election and it is trying to make itself look good. 
There are quick settlements on a lot of issues that have been 
outstanding and dragging out over the last two or three years. They 
are getting resolved in the last two or three weeks, in the last two or 
three days and even the House leaders have been working together 
to co-operate and get everything done together. This is all because 
of an election.
<P>
	If this issue was not important to the justice minister two years 
ago when it first arose, if this issue was not that important to him a 
month ago, why is it that important now and that we only have 
three days to debate this?
<P>
	I know why it is important but why create the urgency that it 
must be passed within three days? Why can it not wait? Why can 
the government not wait for an election and call an election for real 
reasons? It has no reason to call an election.
<P>
	There are important and pressing issues in the economy, in 
society that the government could still be addressing. On the 
wonderful job and the great honour and privilege that the Minister 
of Industry claims to have had by serving, why does he not serve 
for another year and finish it? If he does a good job for another year 
he will get elected again. What is he worried about?
<P>
	No, perception is everything so it has to give the perception to 
the Bloc Quebecois that the government is looking after the 
interests of Quebecers and the Quebec society, that the federal 
government is co-operating and the Reform Party is co-operating 
as well. We are helping this legislation go forward. We do not want 
to be restrictive. We do not want to expand debate. We want to get 
to it.
<P>
	I submit that this is an example of poor governance. If it is 
politically motivated, it is poor. I accuse the Liberal Party, the Bloc 
Quebecois and the Reform Party of the same accusation. Our job 
here is to present proper and good legislation. What is the point in 
passing bad legislation? It will just get thrown out in the courts 
<P>

<P>
anyway, especially amendments to the Criminal Code.  We would 
be better to have no law at all than to have a bad law.
<P>
<B>(1400)</B>
<P>
	I certainly support the general intent and the problem the bill is 
trying to resolve. However the bill has raised so many red flags in 
my mind that I feel we should take a little more time to discuss it, 
even if it is a couple of days. There are many important issues here. 
Over the past two years we debated many criminal amendments for 
months, and suddenly this one goes through in three days.
<P>
	We have been pressing and trying to represent victims and 
victims rights with victim impact statements. A member of our 
caucus, the member for Fraser Valley West, presented a victims bill 
of rights. It had a lot of good clauses. It was every bit as good as the 
legislation in Bill C-95. We asked the finance minister to fast track 
it. We did not say three days. We asked him many months ago to 
put it on the agenda so we could get through it. A year ago it was 
sent to committee. Since then nothing has come back and nothing 
has been done. Why? It was because the polls did not tell the 
government to react.
<P>
	The Liberals are doing poorly in Quebec. An election is coming 
a week from now. The government has to act, react and show that it 
cares. In the process it might be passing bad legislation, not might. 
I have examples of areas of concern where we need constitutional 
experts and arm's length lawyers to give opinions because they 
intervene and conflict with the charter of rights and freedoms.
<P>
	This is a serious issue. Never before has a justice minister or a 
government tried to pass laws that talk about a group and what 
criminal organizations are. There is freedom of association in the 
country. The Quebec provincial government wanted a law to make 
it a crime to belong to a criminal organization. How do we know it 
is criminal? We have to define criminal organization.
<P>
	It is dangerous to give powers to the police if it is done quickly 
without being thought through. The police needs the tools to do its 
job, but if they are given with the intent solving one problem are we 
perhaps creating other problems? What about this extra 
surveillance with electronic devices to listen in on telephone calls? 
What about requisitioning and procuring income tax returns of 
people suspected of associating with criminal organizations? What 
if these powers are used for other groups? It could entrench on civil 
liberties and has to be discussed.
<P>
	It is being done for the wrong reason. It is being fast tracked for 
the wrong reason. To bring the bill forward, to debate the bill, to 
solve the problem is honourable, good and should be done. 
However the Liberals are responding and reacting to one provincial 
government that has threatened to pull out of the country. They are 
reacting faster to that government than to anything that  any other 
opposition party, from the NDP to the Reform to the Conservative, 
raise in the House to satisfy British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba, 
Saskatchewan, Ontario and the maritime provinces.
<P>
	We have to be very careful when we talk about giving powers to 
the police. It is just like the gun control bill, the firearms 
legislation. I gave a talk on it when the justice minister was in the 
House. He was trying to force, ram and push that legislation 
through. It got through the justice department which put it together. 
It got by the justice minister who was involved.
<P>
	Guess what was in that clause? If they suspected somebody of 
hiding firearms, shotguns, rifles or handguns, police forces had the 
right to search and seize the weapons without a warrant. That was 
the original clause in bill when it came to the House. It was just like 
the bill today with clauses of a similar nature. The justice minister 
said that it should be fixed, that we were right, and that we could 
not let police forces search ad hoc anybody they feel like searching. 
He agreed that we should insist upon a warrant on certain grounds.
<P>
<B>(1405)</B>
<P>
	I am talking about rushing bills through and ending up with bad 
legislation. That is poor governance. I certainly recommend we 
should not be a part of that. We should take the time needed to get it 
right.
<P>
	In terms of victims rights the justice minister said in the House 
that we had to take our time and get the bill right. He said it 
involved many issues such as provincial jurisdiction and the 
charter of rights. He was in favour of it but said we had to take our 
time. Now we have anti-gang legislation being rammed through.
<P>
	I refer to a <I>Globe and Mail</I> article by Rhéal Séguin which read in 
part:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``We've defined criminal organization and then we said it is not a crime to be a 
member of it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``But if you do anything that is a crime and that is for their [the criminal 
organization's] benefit, under their direction or in association with them, then you've 
put yourself in a position where you've created a very serious offence, '' Mr. Rock 
told a news conference.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Let us think this through for a second. There is a contradiction.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> No one can figure it 
out but a lawyer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Even some lawyers would have a hard time defining 
criminal organization and making it illegal for a person to be a 
member of such a group if he or she commits a crime for the 
benefit of the group. How does it become a criminal organization if 
it has never committed a crime? If a crime has been committed, 
why is the person not put away to do the time for that crime? How 
can an organization be called criminal? If it is not illegal to belong 
to a criminal organization but it is illegal  to commit a crime within 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9957"> 9957 </A></B>
<P>
it, the group is already identified as a group intent on committing 
criminal activity. That should not exist.
<P>
	Under the definition of criminal organization the crown must 
prove that five or more members in the group act as an association 
or a body together and that one member of the group, or each 
collectively, commits an indictable offence with the maximum 
penalty of five years or more. That is one of its primary objectives.
<P>
	How is the primary activity proved unless a conviction has been 
registered for an indictable offence punishable by a maximum 
penalty of five years or more? In other words the person should 
have been caught and put away even before the group existed. Five 
or more persons is defined as a group. Are four people not a group? 
If four people intent on criminal activity form a group, will this 
definition not apply? Does it have to be five or more?
<P>
	The bill talks about explosive substances and owning offence 
related property. Officers are allowed to confiscate dynamite, 
bombs and things like that. However the definition of explosive 
substance is not in the bill. If it is not defined, should it not be 
defined? We know the obvious, but what about what is not 
obvious?
<P>
	I will turn to another item in the bill. How does the bill coincide 
with young groups? There is no reference to age. There is no 
mention of the Young Offenders Act. We are talking about a certain 
group. We know who they are. We see them. We see pictures of 
them.
<P>
	There have to be five or more. It cannot be four or less but it does 
not talk about young groups. How does the bill relate to the Young 
Offenders Act? Does it conflict? Does it have an impact on it? That 
is not covered. Should it not be covered?
<P>
	The next item in the bill talks about everyone who participates in 
or substantially contributes to the activities of a criminal 
organization knowing that any or all of the members of the 
organization engage in or have, within the preceding five years, 
engaged in the commission of a series of indictable offences under 
this or any other act of Parliament for each of which the maximum 
punishment is imprisonment for five years or more. How do we 
prove ``participates in''? What does ``substantially contributes'' 
mean? ``Aiding and abetting'', but to what degree? What does it 
really mean? What is the level of a substantial contribution? If 
somebody gives $25 to a political party, if somebody else gives 
$500 and if somebody else gives the maximum $1,000 for which 
they receive a tax receipt for $550, which one is substantial? Is a 
$100 donation substantial or is it closer to $1,000? It is the same 
thing here. What is a substantial contribution to an organization? If 
I give $500 I am okay, but if I give $1,000 that is a substantial 
contribution?
<P>
<B>(1410)</B>
<P>
	These are some of the problems which deserve a little more 
attention. If we as politicians were to do our job  properly, we 
would ensure that civil liberty groups would have the chance to 
understand why there is a need and how these things are to be done. 
Those questions should be answered.
<P>
	If we ask these questions when we get to committee of the whole 
on Monday of next week, the justice minister should have the 
answers. I do not see how it will be possible for him to have the 
answers because they are not in the bill. Those answers are left to 
interpretation.
<P>
	Another pressure point comes from the media. The politicians 
are trying to further their party and show they care by passing 
legislation. I do not want to belong to the party that holds it up. I do 
not want to be a Bloc Quebecois, a Reformer or a Liberal who holds 
up the legislation because if somebody gets killed tomorrow or 
next week it will be our fault. That is crap. It will not be the fault of 
anyone in this room; it will be the fault of the person who 
committed the crime.
<P>
	We must pass good legislation to address this problem. If a crime 
is committed next week and the individual goes to court, and 
because of poor wording and a lack of clarity the criminal gets off 
on a technicality, because a supreme court justice whose job it is to 
protect individual rights decides that this criminal should get off, 
but we know he did it, then who is to blame? It will be the fault of 
the Liberals, the Bloc and Reform. It will be our fault.
<P>
	That is what is wrong with this bill. That is why it is important 
for us to have the sensibility and the common sense not to rush 
things through for partisan purposes.
<P>
	We have been a party to certain bills which have gone through 
quickly, but they were done properly because the language was 
clear. We are talking about amendments to the Criminal Code 
which will impact the charter of rights and freedoms. The justice 
minister could have added a chapter to those rights and freedoms 
over the past three years called responsibility. If someone is a 
member of a gang they have certain rights and freedoms, freedom 
of association, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom 
to drive up and down the streets with 100 bikes roaring in their 
ears. It is the responsibility of the person to keep those freedoms by 
not committing a crime. If they do they will lose their rights, 
freedoms and individual liberties.
<P>
	If we debated this properly, took an extra five days and sent it to 
committee for a decent period of time, some better suggestions 
might come forward.
<P>
	It is more important to get it right than to get it done quickly. We 
can get it right and done quickly if we all get together and put our 
heads to it, rather than the leader of the Bloc Quebecois trying to 
make political brownie points in Quebec, rather than the justice 
minister trying to show how co-operative he is in times of urgency 
and emergency. Victims rights are just as important as this. He is 
setting a bad precedent, proving he is doing it for political reasons 
and that the Reform Party is afraid to  speak its mind because it 
does not want to be seen as a deterrent to progress of the justice 
system. We are not.

<P>
	All three parties should put away their political partisanship on 
the issue, get their heads together on Monday in committee of the 
whole and come up with legislation that will be right, with proper 
explanations and definitions, clarity and a sense of confidence that 
when it is challenged in the courts it will not make the politicians of 
this session of Parliament look like fools.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is interesting that this bill has come forward very 
quickly. Considerable attention has been paid to this issue in 
Quebec. Canadians are concerned about the increase in crime, 
especially violent crime in some cities in Quebec, directly 
attributable to the actions of gangs, the drug trade, the illegal 
trafficking in guns, gambling and prostitution, in short, organized 
crime activities, not only in Quebec but across the nation.
<P>
	Canadians who are watching the debate today in its abbreviated 
form are perhaps scratching their heads wondering about the use of 
section 745. I heard a comment recently about Clifford Olson being 
the multiple murderer who is hiding behind a rock.
<P>
	There was a hue and cry across the nation from victims, victims 
groups and the general public. Organizations like the Canadian 
Police Association had passed a resolution asking for the repeal of 
section 745. There seemed to be a genuine consensus that 
something should be done to prevent this individual who has 
admitted to the horrible torture, rape and murder of 11 children, 
from using that section, the so-called faint hope clause and getting 
another day in court to make his points and revictimize the families 
of these young children.
<P>
	I am sure Canadians are wondering how the government can 
move in such a speedy fashion on a bill such as C-95 and yet pay 
virtually no attention to section 745 and the cries of victims and 
victims groups to repeal that section.
<P>
	In February the judge had no option but to grant Clifford Olson 
his day in court. He will be flown from Saskatoon to Vancouver on 
August 18 and the whole country will once again be treated to the 
spectacle of this predator, this disgusting degenerate, having 
another day in court.
<P>
	I wonder if my colleague would like to comment on what I see as 
a terrible travesty of justice, that something like this could be 
allowed to happen and it has received virtually no attention.
<P>
<B>(1420 )</B>
<P>
	The government brought in some minor amendments and tried to 
sell them to the Canadian people by saying that it did not really 
believe that it should repeal section  745 because there are some 
people who perhaps deserve early parole. They did not want to cut 
that off. What we were saying is that 25 years is not too much for 
the Canadian public to expect first degree murderers to serve.
<P>
	Polls taken across the country consistently show that about 65 
per cent to 70 per cent of Canadians support the return of capital 
punishment for people like Olson and Bernardo.
<P>
	Previous governments have been able to sell abolishing capital 
punishment for these types of animals by telling Canadians that 
they would serve 25 years. I cannot help but wonder what will 
happen to someone like Clifford Olson who I am sure the majority 
of Canadians believe cannot and will not ever be rehabilitated. 
What happens when his 25 years are up?
<P>
	We all hope and pray that he will never be eligible for early 
parole, despite the government allowing him to have the luxury of 
going through this farce of a section 745 hearing. However, what 
happens after 25 years? We are not talking here about parole. He 
will have served his sentence and theoretically he is going to get 
out because this government has not addressed that type of 
concern.
<P>
	Something has to be done to keep these predators locked up 
forever. They cannot be allowed back into society to select more 
victims. It cannot happen. We have to find a way to prevent that 
from happening.
<P>
	I wonder if my hon. colleague would comment on what I see as a 
clear contradiction on the part of this government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manley:</B> Explain what 25 years is without parole.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Would the hon. 
Minister of Industry just kindly hold his comments? He had ample 
time a little while ago to spout all sorts of nonsense for as long as 
he wanted. Now he is trying to do it again.
<P>
	I wonder if he would comment on the contradiction between a 
government that holds itself up as being concerned about victims, 
concerned about gang violence, concerned about all these things 
and is rushing this bill through, when in reality that is the furthest 
thing from the truth. The government is not concerned about 
victims. That is clearly shown in the legislation it has introduced 
and passed. That legislation has done little or nothing to benefit the 
victims of crime and lots to benefit the criminals themselves.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Madam Speaker, I am just guessing, but I assume I 
have about two minutes left.
<P>
	I am glad I was able to settle the dispute between the Minister of 
Industry and my colleague. Now they have each had an 
intervention of eight minutes.
<P>
	My colleague makes a very good point. What criteria does the 
justice minister use to decide what is a priority if addressing 
section 745 is not a priority? He claims he  has. He claims he has 
fixed it for multiple murderers. If people commit one premeditated 
murder they will still have a chance to get out after 15 years even 
after being sentenced for life with no parole for 25 years. The 
murderer will still receive this early review after 15 years. That is 
not truth in sentencing. That could have been addressed. It would 
have been an easy bill to pass very quickly. It would have had 
clarity and would have passed the test of the Supreme Court.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="9959"> 9959 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	My colleague is right. We have to be consistent in the application 
of the criteria. I am embarrassed to admit it but I believe the justice 
minister is rushing this bill through more for political reasons than 
for showing that he cares about the violence in Quebec City. He did 
not care about that a month ago.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, we 
are having a difficult time convincing Canadians that there is 
justice in the justice system. That perception among Canadians is 
becoming more and more prevalent all the time.
<P>
	I could not help wondering, as I was listening to my colleague 
speak, why are we acting in such haste with this bill? I have 
listened to the justice minister on various occasions say that tough 
cases make bad laws. As a matter of fact, he used that argument 
when the Reform Party and others were pressing his department to 
make changes to section 745. How is this situation any different 
than that?
<P>
	Certainly all Canadians agree that organized crime should have 
very severe restrictions placed on it. We all agree that what has 
been happening in the gang wars in Montreal is an absolute 
travesty. Innocent people are being killed. It is a form of terrorism. 
When a gang war is going on in your community it is a form of 
urban terrorism. Canadians are well within their rights to be 
repulsed by this kind of activity and it behooves this place to do 
something about it.
<P>
	This situation did not emerge in the last few weeks so therefore 
we must act immediately. It makes me wonder whether we are 
going to enact this legislation or whether it has simply been placed 
on the table. I know we are not supposed to impugn motives but I 
wonder if this legislation has not been tabled more for optics and 
political reasons than for justice reasons.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice has not found it within his realm to act 
expediently on other sections, for instance, to pass retroactive 
legislation that would stop multiple killers like Bernardo and Olson 
to apply for early release. The legislation is not retroactive. People 
who are now serving life sentences will be able to apply for parole 
after serving two-thirds of their sentence.
<P>
	It puzzles me how the minister can on the one hand say that we 
must act with caution and due diligence and take deliberate slow 
steps and on the other hand say that  this problem is taking place in 
Quebec and must be dealt with immediately. He knows it is 
potentially fertile ground for his party. He knows that it has always 
been a key to Confederation. It has always been a key to whether or 
not a party holds a majority and therefore that should be reason 
enough to act immediately.
<P>
	I think the people in British Columbia are going to remember 
long and hard the fact that Clifford Olson has been treated with 
some celebrity status and is certainly getting the notoriety that he 
so hungrily seeks. I believe the electorate in British Columbia are 
going to remember these instances. I would even go so far as to say 
that if they are having a little bit of a problem remembering it, there 
will be certain political parties that will do their utmost to make 
them remember.
