leave to introduce Bill C-274, an act to amend the Criminal Code

<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for 
Mississauga South for seconding my private member's bill which 
aims to recognize victims of crime as individuals by ending 
volume discounts for rapists and murderers in our courts. These 
volume discounts are granted by concurrence sentencing which 
allows a serial killer or a serial rapist to serve sentences for 
multiple crimes at the same time and be out on the street in only a 
fraction of the total sentence.
<P>
	I believe Canadians are tired of having the price for murder and 
rape marked down by the courts and parole boards. This bill would 
narrow the gap between our justice system and justice.

	The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House 
that managing the family home and caring for preschool children is 
an honourable profession which has not been recognized for its

Parliament to pursue initiatives to eliminate tax discrimination

<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CONSIDERATIONRESUMEDOFMOTIONFORSECONDREADING">CONSIDERATION RESUMED OF MOTION FOR SECOND READING</A></H4>
	The House resumed from April 24 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-31, an act to implement certain provisions of the budget 
tabled in Parliament on March 6, 1996, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise on Bill C-31, a bill recently 
introduced by the Minister of Finance, which not only implements 
several budgetary provisions but also adds to the provisions of the 
latest budget brought down by the Minister of Finance some 
elements of the agreement on the GST reached the day before 
yesterday between the Minister of Finance of Canada and three of 
the four maritime provinces.
<P>
	My argument will focus on two major aspects of the bill: first, 
the part dealing with certain provisions of the Unemployment 
Insurance Act and, second, certain provisions of the agreement on 
the GST, and those calling for the outrageous amount of $961 
million to be paid out in compensation to the maritime provinces.
<P>
	But before I go on, I must say that I deplore the fact that the 
government does not like to be told the truth, to hear certain facts 
about the unemployment insurance system, the GST or the 
outrageous agreement entered into with the maritime provinces. 
Instead of responding to these statements and debating the issues in 
public, in front of the people, the government chooses to hide 
behind a wall of silence, stifling debate with a gag order not once 
but twice today. This is a shame and a disgrace.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1927"> 1927 </A></B>
<P>
	Regarding the unemployment insurance system, I would like to 
start by commending my colleagues, particularly the hon. member 
for Mercier, the hon. member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, 
the hon. member for Lévis, and all those who have supported them 
in literally besieging the human resources development 
committee, whose members were once again trying to limit 
debate, something we will not abide. The real issues must be 
raised. I congratulate my colleagues on doing just that and we will 
keep on fighting with their support.
<P>
	Our position on unemployment insurance is clear and, regardless 
of the gag put on us and the government's attitude in trying to hide 
the truth from the people who elected it, we will press on. The only 
thing that this bill is good for is to be tossed out. This is the only 
way the unemployment insurance system can be properly reformed 
today.
<P>
	Let me restate our main reasons for opposing this reform. First, 
the proposed reform is unfair, because it will be harder to qualify 
and two categories of unemployed will be created, depending on 
how frequently they are unemployed. Second, this is a regressive 
reform, because there will be a single rate of contribution and the 
maximum insurance earnings will be reduced to $39,000.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	Third, by lowering the maximimum to $39,000, the Liberal 
Party of Canada is doing a favour to large corporations, since those 
that can afford to pay insurable gains totalling $39,000 annually are 
precisely the big corporations that contribute to the Liberal Party's 
coffers.
<P>
	Fourth, the reform is detrimental to job creation, since the new 
contributions structure favours capital intensive industries, at the 
expense of labour intensive industries.
<P>
	Fifth, the reform will generate poverty, because it lowers the rate 
of benefits while taxing workers from the very first hour of work.
<P>
	This debate on Bill C-31 gives me an opportunity to reiterate the 
position of the Bloc Quebecois regarding this issue. The proposed 
unemployment insurance reform is not agreeable to Quebecers and 
Canadians as a whole. The government must withdraw its bill and 
start the whole exercise all over, do some real thinking, and come 
up with a real unemployment insurance program that will help the 
poor in our society, instead of hitting them hard with cruel 
measures.
<P>
	As regards the GST, there are many things we could say and 
repeat to the Minister of Finance. There are many things we could 
say and repeat to the Prime Minister, now and then. There are many 
things we could say and repeat to all government members 
regarding the numerous promises they made concerning this tax.
<P>
	Why did the government, this morning, limit to only one day, or 
100 minutes for the official opposition, the debate on the new 
agreement reached between the maritime provinces and the federal 
government concerning the GST? Why did it do that? I will tell you 
why. It is because this government is ashamed of the Liberal 
Party's promises that have not been kept. This government is 
ashamed of the attitude of its Prime Minister, who reneges on his 
commitments. This government is ashamed of the attitude of the 
Deputy Prime Minister, who said she would resign if the GST was 
not abolished. We are being gagged because the Prime Minister 
failed to meet his commitments. This is why.
<P>
	Not that long ago, the government made very clear statements. 
We have recordings, newspaper articles and even videos of that, 
just as in the case of the numerous scandals involving the 
Department of National Defence. Prominent members of this 
government have made a formal commitment to Quebecers and 
Canadians, especially during the election campaign. They have 
made a promise. This Prime Minister stated in a CBC interview in 
1993: ``We will scrap the GST''.
<P>
	What is the Prime Minister saying now? He keeps repeating we 
should read the red book. But what did he say personally? He 
indulged in petty politics by promising Quebecers and Canadians 
that he would eliminate the GST. We have his commitment on tape. 
It was recorded. And that has nothing to do with the red book. He 
promised that he would kill the GST. And what is he doing now? 
He is breaking his promise.
<P>
	On October 18, 1993, on the CBC, the Deputy Prime Minister 
made a statement that is just fine when you want to entice voters 
during an election campaign:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``I have already said personally and very directly that if the GST 
is not abolished I will resign''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
So, she promised to resign if the GST was not eliminated.
<P>
	What is she doing now? She is laughing at us. She is laughing at 
Quebecers and Canadians with her broken promises. Shame on her. 
We would have thought that, as it was said during an election 
campaign, they would stop saying they would if they did not really 
mean it. But that was not to be. On May 2, 1994, about six months 
after coming to power, the Prime Minister repeated: ``We hate this 
tax, and we are going to eliminate it''.
<P>
	How can they take such an attitude now? How can they try to 
hide behind an agreement with the maritimes, an agreement that 
not only leaves the GST in place throughout Canada, but also 
buries it in the price?
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1928"> 1928 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	How did we get from a formal commitment to some kind of 
political hybrid that makes the Minister of Finance look good and 
gives the Prime Minister the opportunity to say: ``Look, we have 
done something about the GST'', when what he promised was not 
to do something about the GST, but to scrap it? How can a 
government deceive the voters this way? It is unacceptable. It is so 
totally unacceptable that there is a general outcry in Quebec and in 
Canada.
<P>
	About the hidden tax, for instance, let me remind the House that, 
as early as 1994, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce made a 
survey and concluded that 70 per cent of its members were opposed 
to a sales tax, the new GST or any new value added tax, being 
hidden in the price of goods. Seventy per cent of its members were 
against such a measure in 1994. The Canadian Chamber of 
Commerce carried out another survey not so long ago, last 
February in fact, and realized not only that the situation had not 
reversed, but, quite the opposite. There are now 76 per cent of 
Canadian businesses that are opposed to the new GST being hidden 
in the price of goods.
<P>
	When there is almost unanimous consent within the Chamber of 
Commerce on this issue, why should the government come up with 
such a hypocritical initiative? The Canadian Taxpayers' 
Association, through its president, also reacted strongly against a 
hidden GST. Why? First, because it allows the government to 
conceal what the real financial situation is in Canada. It also allows 
the federal government to conceal its mismanagement of public 
funds and the fact that it is standing on the brink of a financial 
abyss, with an accumulated debt of over $550 billion. That is the 
first reason.
<P>
	The second reason is that by hiding the tax-as the Minister of 
Finance has done in the agreement reached with the three maritime 
provinces and which he would like to extend to the rest of 
Canada-the government has found a roundabout way to increase 
the tax, year after year, without the consumers in Quebec and the 
rest of Canada knowing about it.
<P>
	In fact, while in opposition, the Liberals vigorously attacked the 
previous government on the GST and emphasized the very same 
things we just mentioned. In 1989, the Liberal opposition minority 
report said: ``Moreover, if the GST is hidden in the sales price, it 
will be a lot easier for the government to raise it later''. This is 
what was said in the Liberal minority report of 1989. It also said: 
``Nothing will prevent the government from regularly raising the 
GST.'' This is still according to the 1989 Liberal minority report.
<P>
	This is what the Liberal Party was saying then. I find it peculiar 
that they should do a complete turnaround a few years down the 
road. How can the people of Quebec and Canada trust a 
government like that?
<P>
	As such, the agreement is a bad deal. Why? Because not only is 
the problem of the hated GST not solved, not only is this tax hidden 
and there is no national reform, since this is restricted to the 
maritimes only, but this will cost Quebecers and Canadians outside 
the maritimes at least $961 million over the next four years to 
compensate the maritime provinces for the revenue loss they will 
experience after replacing the actual federal and provincial 
taxes-totalling some 19 per cent in the maritimes-by a single 
federal tax of 15 per cent.
<P>
	This is a $961 million political compensation that has nothing to 
do with federal compensations like, for example, the one that 
followed the abolition of the Crow's Nest rate for the transportation 
of western grain. They said then that economic distortions were 
created.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	These economic distortions are being eliminated, but there must 
be compensation for those who, since 1897, benefited from this 
preferential transportation rate. That is not the same thing. That 
was an economic compensation. This compensation is political. We 
are supposed to believe that the government is doing something 
about the GST, that it wants to harmonize the consumer tax 
collected by the federal government and the provinces, when in 
reality this accord is a smokescreen for a broken promise and an 
outrageous expenditure of $961 million over the next four years.
<P>
	This is a lot to pay so that the Liberal government can pull the 
wool over our eyes, to the tune of almost $1 billion over the next 
four years. This is not right.
<P>
	Not only that, but the finance minister is keeping something else 
from us about this agreement, and that is that in four years, when 
the $961 million have been paid, equalization payments will kick 
in. It is not just $961 million. After the fourth year, we will 
continue to pay, on average, approximately $250 million annually 
to the maritimes for this bad deal, this political deal that the finance 
minister signed this week.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The new deal between the federal government and the maritimes 
will cost $1 billion to Quebecers and Canadians outside the 
maritimes. It is a high price to pay for Canadians for a bad deal, a 
political deal, which maintains the GST.
<P>
	It is not the only price. After four years Canadians will continue 
to pay compensation to the maritimes by equalization payments. 
When one reduces the taxation base, as in the proposal of the 
Minister of Finance, equalization increases automatically.
<P>
	In Quebec we realized harmonization for five years without any 
cost to the federal government, without any cost to Canadians in 
other parts of Canada. Why is it not possible for the Liberal 
government to do the same thing  in all territories of Canada? Why 
is it not possible to avoid paying $1 billion to the maritimes?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1929"> 1929 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Not only is this agreement costing us dearly, not only does it 
solve nothing, not only is it a smokescreen for the Liberal Party's 
broken promises, but in addition there is a danger that it will set a 
precedent of interfering in the fiscal autonomy of the provinces.
<P>
	I would like to tell you what the deputy premier of Quebec said 
when he heard about this agreement, because there are fears in 
Quebec about the agreement. He said, and I quote: ``Certain 
conditions cannot be gotten around, including full fiscal autonomy 
for Quebec, which must retain full flexibility to set the base and the 
rate''.
<P>
	His concerns are not without foundation, because in the paper 
tabled Monday at the same time as the agreement, it is clearly 
mentioned that the new Canada revenue commission, the one 
which was announced in the speech from the throne and which 
came up again in the last budget speech, will be responsible, in 
place of the provinces, for managing the new tax, the Liberal 
government's new hidden and hypocritical GST.
<P>
	As this paper points out, if application of this agreement between 
the federal government and the maritime provinces is to be 
expanded to all of Canada, over the next few months there will be 
many approaches made to the various provinces to get them, 
Quebec in particular, to give up their taxation autonomy, 
administration of the sales tax, the right to set the level of their own 
taxes-something Quebec is totally free to do today-and 
particularly the right to determine which goods and services are to 
be taxed. This is what lies hidden behind the agreement reached 
between the maritime provinces and the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	We can but regret this agreement, this political agreement, this 
bribery of the maritime provinces, aimed at getting what the 
Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister want. We can but 
regret, as well, what occurred here yesterday at 5.21 p.m. Since I 
saw it as a tragic moment for Canadian parliamentary history, I 
took note of the exact time the Minister of Industry tabled a notice 
of motion to gag us in the debate on Bill C-31, as well as on the 
outrageous agreement between him and the maritime provinces.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	This agreement will be terribly costly for us. A minimum of $1 
billion over the next four years, $250 million from the tax dollars 
of Quebecers to foot the bill for a political agreement entered into 
with the maritimes. This agreement will serve to increase 
competition between Quebec businesses and those in other 
provinces, New Brunswick, for example.
<P>
	Such a situation is not right, particularly since we in Quebec 
have come to an agreement with the federal government, have 
made an incredible effort to harmonize the tax, have defined highly 
efficient mechanisms for its application and administration, and 
now are rewarded for our efforts by the federal government's 
presenting us with an agreement that has been thrown together, a 
political agreement that will cost Quebec $250 million, and the rest 
of Canada some $750 million.
<P>
	I can understand why Quebec is starting to rise up, and the other 
provinces as well. It is not right for a federation to be administered 
the way the federal government is administering this one. Nor it is 
right for it to renege on its commitments, as the Prime Minister and 
the Minister of Finance are doing.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened 
with great interest to my friend and colleague. He is an eloquent 
speaker, but as is all too often the case, only part of the picture is 
presented and is not one we on this side of the House agree with.
<P>
	The member questions the finance minister and the 
government's making an arrangement with the three Atlantic 
provinces because they saw it was fit, fair and just to provide a 
degree of compensation to assist with the transition. This is 
especially the case because of the lowered provincial rate portion 
of the harmonized tax.
<P>
	I am a member of the House of Commons finance committee, as 
is my colleague. I went through the extensive consultations in the 
spring of 1994 which covered a wide range of witnesses across the 
country and a wide range of issues. We looked at about 20 options 
for replacing the GST. There was no doubt the best replacement for 
the GST was a harmonized system involving provincial taxes and 
the federal GST.
<P>
	We had the concurrence of the Reform Party on this suggestion.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Wrong.
<P>
	<B>Mr. St. Denis:</B> We only have to look at the minority report to 
confirm that fact
<P>
	I will deal specifically with the member's points in the latter part 
of his presentation and why the province of Quebec should not now 
receive some payment for having harmonized some years ago. We 
appreciate that Quebec had the foresight to harmonize. It was the 
right thing to do and obviously the government of the day thought 
so. It is still a good plan. No doubt there are some improvements 
that can be made and as a government we look forward to working 
with Quebec on that.
<P>
	However, statistics will show Quebec actually gained from the 
harmonization. In the maritimes because of the tax base and the 
desire to lower the provincial rate of tax, a 5 per cent threshold was 
decided on. For any province  which harmonized above a 5 per cent 
cap, compensation would be provided for loses above 5 per cent. 
As we calculate it there would be no loss for Ontario. As we see it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1930"> 1930 </A></B>
<P>
there was no loss for Quebec. Some other provinces might 
experience a loss.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	As a government we are being responsible and we are prepared 
to provide some limited degree of compensation. This is not a 
political decision. This is a country that is not built on cheque book 
federalism, it is a country built on partnerships among all the 
regions of this great nation. Every area is treated equally but we 
cannot treat every area the same.
<P>
	Did Quebec gain when it harmonized its provincial tax with the 
GST?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Madam Speaker, my colleague is being a bit 
facetious in asking such a question. Harmonizing taxes, reducing 
the paper burden and simplifying the administration of taxes are all 
good things. Nobody said they were not. This is in fact what 
Quebec has understood and has been doing since 1991. We 
harmonized the federal tax and the Quebec sales tax, but not at a 
cost of $1 billion. Not at all.
<P>
	We harmonized the bases gradually, through discussion, through 
an administrative agreement, the kind you are so fond of. You are 
always advocating administrative agreements, everyone's full 
understanding and participation by all the provinces. And what are 
you handing us this week-a slapdash agreement with three of the 
four maritime provinces.
<P>
	Without consulting any government in any province of Canada, 
least of all Quebec, you announce that from now on this will be the 
basis of discussions. And then you bring out this agreement, which 
will cost $961 million over the next four years over and above the 
equalization payments, which will take over. And now we have to 
pay. Button it and pay up is what you are telling the governments of 
Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and British 
Columbia.
<P>
	This is not how it was in Quebec. There, we could see the 
advantage of harmonizing and of simplifying the administration. 
We could also see that the more we simplified and cut back 
administration, the better our economic performance. But we never 
asked for anything. The only money the federal government gives 
the Government of Quebec is for services rendered, because it 
administers the federal government's GST. And that is what is not 
right.
<P>
	Furthermore, I do not think we are alone. Some may call us evil 
separatists and perpetual federalism bashers, but it is not true. See 
how rational, very rational we were with the GST, unemotional 
even. In Quebec we harmonized it. Not only are we criticizing this 
ridiculous  agreement, but like the rest of Canada, we in Quebec 
find this whole business unacceptable. It is not right that the rest of 
Canada should pay for an agreement that is going to allow people 
in the maritimes to save 4 per cent in provincial tax.
<P>
	If it were an equalization adjustment, it would be a completely 
different matter. Let us not mix apples and oranges as the Minister 
of Finance is so good at doing in order to confuse Canadians. That 
is not right. Do not forget-and my colleague knows it full well 
because he sits on the finance committee-that when a tax base in a 
province or a group of provinces is reduced from 19 per cent to 15 
per cent, as is the case with the new consumption tax, the new 
hidden GST, and the federal government pays out $961 million in 
compensation, the federal equalization formula must kick in.
<P>
	Whether we like it or not, it is automatic. Put a 15 per cent 
consumption tax base in the equalization formula, a reduced base, 
and after the fourth year or maybe after the third year or maybe 
immediately-we do not yet know the specifics of the political deal 
signed between the Minister of Finance and the three maritime 
provinces-given the equalization formula, Canadians will 
necessarily have to pay, not for four years, but ad vitam aeternam, 
as long as the principle of equalization is in effect in this country.
<P>
	This is a bad deal. Because we are making people aware of this 
bad deal, because we are bringing to their attention your poor 
management, political deals made to give the impression that the 
government is acting on the Prime Minister's commitment to 
eliminate the GST, we are being gagged. It is not right to deal with 
such important matters in this manner.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	I would be very careful if I were you because, when you go back 
to your ridings this weekend or the next, you may find that some of 
your constituents are disgruntled. During the 1993 election 
campaign, some people thought: ``Wow, this will be a good 
government. It will abolish the GST, scrap it. We will vote for 
them''.
<P>
	But the situation has changed since Monday. The Minister of 
Finance admitted he cannot keep that promise, while the Prime 
Minister told us they had kept it. Who should we believe? I think 
we must trust the intelligence of Canadians. They know perfectly 
well that the GST is there and for a long time, but that it will be 
hidden from now on.
<P>
	So I think a lot of your constituents will be waiting for you with 
two messages by next week: you did not keep your promises and 
the government acted hypocritically.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jean Payne (St. John's West, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak on the implementation of certain provisions of 
the budget, presented on March 6, which are very important to my 
riding.
<P>
	While the 1996 budget meets the federal government's 
commitment of sustained deficit reduction, a balanced budget by 
and of itself must never be our only goal.
<P>
	The Liberal government has the challenge of safeguarding and 
ensuring our social programs remain effective well into the next 
century. The new Canadian health and social transfers, which 
consolidate transfers for health care and post secondary education, 
began on April 1, 1996. Because it is block fund it offers more 
flexibility to the provinces, allowing, for example, for the 
development of innovative programs for people receiving social 
assistance.
<P>
	Greater flexibility will reduce administrative costs and allow the 
provinces to adjust to the new funding levels while protecting 
program quality.
<P>
	The 1996 budget introduced a five-year funding arrangement for 
the CHST for 1998-99 through 2002-03. The CHST will be 
stabilized at 1998-99 levels for two years. Then it will begin to 
grow.
<P>
	There will be no cuts to the CHST beyond those announced in 
last year's budget. By providing predictable funding the 
government is demonstrating its commitment to safeguarding 
health care and other social programs valued by Canadians. The 
provinces will be able to plan programs with clearly set levels of 
federal funding in following years.
<P>
	When the CHST begins to grow in the year 2000-01 federal 
transfers will increase for the first time since the mid-eighties. 
While the CHST will promote innovative solutions, established 
national principles will continue to be upheld. Provinces must still 
provide social assistance without imposing residency 
requirements.
<P>
	The government will continue to vigorously defend the five 
principles of the Canadian health care system. It will also work 
with the provinces to develop other shared principles and 
objectives for the new transfer. Funding will remain constant at 
$25.1 billion for the first two years and will actually increase over 
the remaining three.
<P>
	Although the cash component of the Newfoundland CHST will 
decline initially, transfers will resume growth sometime during the 
five-year arrangement. The federal government is guaranteeing the 
cash component of the transfer will never be lower than $11 billion 
during this five-year period. Newfoundland will benefit from the 
tax component as well as from the cash guarantee.
<P>
	By putting a floor of $11 billion under the cash part of the CHST 
the federal government is ensuring the principles of the Canada 
Health Act can and will be enforced throughout Canada.
<P>
	A new seniors benefit will replace the existing old age security 
and guaranteed income supplement. The new system is designed to 
help those who need it most. In my riding of St. John's West there 
are many single seniors and many senior couples who live on 
incomes well below $40,000 a year.
<P>
<B>(1145 )</B>
<P>
	Over these past few weeks I have met with many of them and I 
have reviewed with them the new seniors benefit. It was found that 
they will be better off under the new system than under the old one. 
The new benefit will be tax free and fully indexed to inflation. The 
new system targets those who need it most and ensures the system 
is sustainable in the future.
<P>
	Fiscal progress should always be the means to a greater public 
end such as lower interest rates, more jobs and then a more 
prosperous and secure nation. Fiscal progress must give us the 
green light to move forward on priorities such as the preservation 
of Canada's social safety programs, programs that have helped 
establish Canada as one of the most envied and respected nations in 
the world.
<P>
	In order to meet this end, as the Prime Minister has said, we have 
to provide a long term funding arrangement for health and social 
programs and arrangements that are growing, stable, predictable 
and sustainable.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, my 
colleague opposite was very brief, she addressed only two points in 
Bill C-31. She forgot quite a few others. She kept silent on many 
issues this bill is trying to hide.
<P>
	I would like to remind her that this bill contains provisions on 
unemployment insurance that were supposed to be in Bill C-12 
originally. This morning's gag orders will prevent us from really 
discussing Bill C-31, also dealing with unemployment insurance, 
and Bill C-12 at committee stage. So when will we have the 
opportunity to address these issues?
<P>
	Bill C-31 amends the Unemployment Insurance Act so that, 
retroactively to January 1 1996, maximum weekly benefits will 
drop from $445 to $413. Why is this government introducing the 
same measure twice? Why use two bills, C-31 and C-12, to enact 
the same legislation? Is the government afraid of some kind of 
complication? Does it fear it will not be able to respect the 
deadlines set in the budget?
<P>
	Bill C-31 does, in a roundabout way, what the government 
should be doing directly with Bill C-12. With each new bill, we 
should be discussing new issues. Will my colleague be happy this 
weekend when she meets her constituents? Will she be able to 
explain what is happening with unemployment insurance?

	<B>Mrs. Payne:</B> Madam Speaker, I omitted to mention at the 
beginning of my speech that I will be sharing my time with my 
colleague from Provencher.
<P>
	When I began my speech I indicated that I would be referring 
only to elements of the budget that were very important to my 
riding. These dealt with the CHST and the seniors benefits.
<P>
	Over the last two or three weeks I have spoken to a great many 
people in my riding about both of these matters. About 90 per cent 
of the people I spoke to will be better off under the new seniors 
program.
<P>
<B>(1150 )</B>
<P>
	I am extremely pleased that the Minister of Finance and the 
House had the foresight to look at those who are most in need of the 
benefits that they will now receive under the new program.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
member for St. John's West should know that to be liked, 
appreciated and respected a tax must be simple and fair.
<P>
	How could she explain to Canadians as a whole that this tax is 
fair when her government is going to take close to $1 billion of 
taxpayers' money to buy, to conclude a political deal with three 
provinces who, it appears, could but benefit from teaming up with 
this new government which was has been in power for two and a 
half years already?
<P>
	Hardly 12 months ago, this same government paid $1.6 billion 
directly to western grain producers when the Crow rate was 
abolished. This time, it is going to spend $1 billion to compensate a 
small portion of the Canadian population who will pay less in 
provincial sales tax and GST.
<P>
	Does she believe this tax is fair and simple while Liberal 
members when they were in opposition were dead against-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> We are now 
resuming debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Iftody (Provencher, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is 
with pleasure that I rise in the House to participate in the debate on 
Bill C-31, an act to implement certain provisions of the budget 
tabled in Parliament March 6, 1996.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to discuss the portion of Part 
II of Bill C-31 that deals with the sale of government owned 
railway cars, or hopper cars, as they are known. In the budget of the 
Minister of Finance on March 6, 1996 he announced that in order to 
continue the transformation of the western grain handling and  
transportation system, the government would do primarily two 
things. First, it would dispose of its fleet of grain hopper cars and 
second, it would minimize its role in the day to day operations of 
that system.
<P>
	The government has committed itself to selling all of its fleet of 
13,000 grain hopper cars. This policy change is designed to 
enhance the competitiveness of the grain handling and 
transportation system while keeping increases in freight rates paid 
by producers to a minimum.
<P>
	I would like to remind the House of a couple of incidents, in 
particular in the use of grain hopper cars in the export of grains to 
the Vancouver port, the difficulties that western farmers have had 
in the control over that process. I am pleased to say that this 
allocation process will give western Canadian farmers greater 
control over that export process.
<P>
	These decisions were adopted from a package developed by 
senior executive officers or the SEO group. This industry group 
was tasked last year with reviewing car allocations, the disposal of 
the government hopper car fleet and the Canadian Wheat Board's 
role in transportation. The review was announced in the 1995 
budget. The report by the SEO group was carefully reviewed and it 
is important to note that several of their recommendations were not 
accepted due to concerns voiced by producers and producer led 
groups.
<P>
	Two of the discarded proposals which were very important 
included a proposal by this group to sell the government cars to the 
railways for $100 million with a $1 per tonne freight rate increase 
for up to five years to cover the cost.
<P>
<B>(1155 )</B>
<P>
	Second, producers were also concerned about the lack of a 
producer's voice on a proposed car allocation policy group. The 
Minister of Finance listened to these people. He listened to the 
producers and he acted accordingly.
<P>
	I should point out that between 1972 and 1979 Canada had a 
Liberal government that listened to the pleas of farmers who were 
concerned about the transportation of grain at that time. It spent up 
to $500 million with interest payments on those capital costs to 
provide an additional 13,000 grain hopper cars for western 
Canadian farmers.
<P>
	How will the commercialization of the grain hopper cars affect 
farmers? Selling the fleet will allow for the efficient use of grain 
hopper cars. Cars will now be allocated on a commercial basis 
responding to market need. This will improve the ability of farmers 
to get their products to market quickly. It is an essential element, 
particularly with regard to a disposable good such as grain and in 
getting it to our international markets in the Asia Pacific rim and 
eastern Europe.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1933"> 1933 </A></B>
<P>
	The government has already acted in its latest budget to protect 
the farmer's position by limiting the freight increase associated 
with the sale of the cars to 75 cents per tonne, as announced in 
the finance minister's budget. It will also postpone that same 
increase by another year to 1998. Further, efficiency 
improvements will generate reductions in the freight rates which 
should offset the increases over time.
<P>
	Other measures, such as legislating the fair sharing of 
productivity gains between farmers, railways and shippers will 
assist farmers. The other side of the coin is how will this policy 
affect the railways?
<P>
	Currently cars are allocated on an administrative basis which is 
not effective. Selling the fleet will result in more efficient use of 
the cars that will be allocated in response to market demand.
<P>
	The railways will be given the flexibility they need for efficient 
day to day operation of the system. These efficiency improvements 
will over time result in lower costs for the railways and 
consequently lower freight rates which will help farmers. Proposals 
to buy the cars will be encouraged by all interested parties 
including-from my perspective most importantly-producer 
friendly entities. Producers, farmers, the railways and any other 
interested party will be given their say.
<P>
	As the budget stated, the federal government will consider all 
proposals put forward for the disposition of these cars. It will take 
into account the interests of producers, shippers and railways and 
the need to make the most efficient use of these cars.
<P>
	Bill C-31 seeks to implement the measures I have outlined and to 
implement the budget the minister has given. The 
commercialization of these cars is a sound and productive measure 
of the budget. It should be allowed to be implemented at once. 
Producers, grain companies, railways and ultimately Canadians 
will benefit from this privatization exercise.
<P>
	As my colleague, the Minister of Transport recently stated: ``We 
have to ensure that Canadian grain reaches world markets as 
efficiently as possible. Improving global trade in this way enhances 
Canada's international competitiveness, a key element of the 
government's economic growth and jobs strategy.''

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
could my colleague, who welcomes the fact that the government is 
providing a great deal of assistance to western farmers to help them 
adapt to the elimination of the Crow rate and sale of hopper cars, 
remind his finance minister that, over five years, he has cut $220 
million in subsidies to dairy producers, nearly half of whom are 
located in Quebec, without offering them any transitional help?
<P>
	This same government paid $1.6 billion directly to producers, $1 
billion to promote export and $300 million to improve 
transportation-hopper cars, as the member explained so well.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	In total, the Canadian government will spend $2.9 billion on 
western grain producers, and close to $1 billion to help three 
maritime provinces harmonize the GST and their provincial sales 
tax.
<P>
	Does he not believe that his government is using a double 
standard?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Iftody:</B> Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to answer the 
member's question. I want to refer to a response by the member's 
former colleague and that is the one-sided picture always presented 
by the Bloc on these matters.
<P>
	Some of the largest dairy producers in the province are in my 
riding of Provencher. The riding of Provencher produces almost 50 
per cent of the milk in Manitoba. Of course I too was concerned 
about any possible decreases in subsidies to dairy farmers. I remind 
the member again that it was a Liberal government in the early 
1970s which brought in that support system and continues to 
defend it also for Quebec farmers.
<P>
	In specific response to his question about the subsidy, he must 
know, ought to know and should be telling his constituents and his 
dairy farmers that they have been allowed to pass those costs on, 
through the Canadian Dairy Association, to the consumers. Over a 
three or four year period, the reductions in those subsidies will be 
recovered by the dairy producers.
<P>
	It is my pleasure here today to give the hon. member that 
information so he can share it with his dairy farmers in Quebec if 
he does not already know that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, to 
wrap up on the issues the member was talking about, I would like to 
know how much of the program is designed after this transpires. 
After there is privatization in the selling of the hopper cars, how 
much will then become farmer operated and farmer driven rather 
than by government? Is the government going to back out as most 
farmers believe they should or will it continue in this area?
<P>
	One major thing that concerns all Canadians, including farmers, 
on which I have not heard anything from that side of the House, 
from the Prime Minister, the finance minister, right down the list 
and about which nobody talks, including the hon. member, is the 
huge national debt. It is literally tearing the guts right out of a 
number of opportunities and programs particularly in the 
agricultural area as well as thousands of other places.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1934"> 1934 </A></B>
<P>
	Why are the huge growing debt and the interest payments on 
it which are becoming the greatest expense we have not being 
addressed by any member on the opposite side of the House?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I am sorry, but 
the time has expired. Resuming debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to address Bill C-31. I will touch on some elements in the 
bill. I will talk about how sometimes an opposition party that 
becomes government looks at things and operates. Specifically, I 
will talk a little about the Prime Minister and his philosophy. Then 
I will go on to aspects of the bill and the part in question which is 
the harmonization with compensation.
<P>
	In reading the autobiography <I>Straight from the Heart</I> by the 
Prime Minister, I found a couple of quotes, which in my opinion 
explain to Canadians the type of thinking our Prime Minister uses. 
One is: ``In politics, perception is everything''. Another is:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A successful politician must not only be able to read the mood of the public, 
he must have the skill to get the public on his side. The public is moved by mood 
more than logic, by instinct more than reason, and that is something that every 
politician must make use of or guard against.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Interesting, is it not? A third quote is:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I learned early that business is business and politics is politics. The proof is 
how few important businessmen have made good politicians. They make think 
they are very smart about everything because they made millions of dollars by 
digging a hole in the ground and finding oil, but the talent and luck needed to 
become rich are not the same talent and luck needed to succeed on Parliament 
Hill-.Most businessmen have very limited, specialized knowledge which often 
gives them a narrow view.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	As a businessman, the kind of person he is talking about, I do not 
believe my view is narrow enough to mislead and distort the 
Canadian public. The fourth quote I would like to put into context 
is: ``If businessmen want to make the decisions, the solution is 
simple: they should get themselves elected to Parliament''. Well I 
did. I am here and I am going to try to do my best to point out the 
hypocrisy, duplicity and failure of this Liberal government to keep 
their election promise.
<P>
	I refer specifically to that part of Bill C-31 which appropriates 
$961 million-let us round that out to $1 billion because it rhymes 
with bribe-from the consolidated revenue fund to pay off or bribe 
as most people are saying. It is not just the Reform Party, the 
premier of British Columbia has called it a bribe. The provincial 
elected officials in Ontario have called it a bribe. A lot of people 
are calling this a bribe to the three Atlantic provinces which have 
agreed to harmonize the PST with the GST but only if they are 
compensated for revenue shortfalls.
<P>
	I would like to review, analyse and comment on the Liberal 
promise, not the one to kill, abolish, scrap the GST. We have gone 
through that and the Liberals have admitted they broke that 
promise. They have admitted that they failed to deliver on that 
promise. That is fine. But what about the promise they put in 
writing, the one the Prime Minister brags about, to replace it, as per 
page 22 of their now dead and embarrassing red book? In that red 
book the Liberals promised to the Canadian public that they would 
replace the GST with a system that generated equivalent revenues. 
That is not so. They are not equivalent revenues.
<P>
	The harmonization in the Atlantic provinces represents a 
shortfall over three years of $1 billion and in order to induce, 
encourage and bribe those provinces to get on board, the 
government is going to pay for that shortfall. They are not 
equivalent revenues. The Liberals failed on that part of their 
promise in the red book. It does not generate equal revenues. 
Basically it is a tax cut for the three provinces at the expense of all 
Canadians. Wait until the consumers in those three provinces find 
out how much more they will be paying for the promises of their 
three Liberal premiers to the Liberal Prime Minister.
<P>
	Page 22 says that this replacement tax will be fairer to 
consumers and to small business. I will agree it is fairer to small 
business. It does improve the situation for small businesses. They 
will have one tax to collect and one tax to remit. They will have a 
choice on how they can do it. There is no question that it does 
streamline it for the businesses. However, it will not be fair to the 
consumers. The consumers will be the ones who will be paying a 
greater portion of the tax in those provinces.
<P>
	If we look at what goods and services the retail sales taxes are 
applied to or exempted from in New Brunswick, Newfoundland 
and Nova Scotia, we will find many that are exempt from the PST 
but will now be taxed with this new 15 per cent GST. Although the 
provincial rates go down on the PST, the combined rate will 
increase taxes on a lot of items that are in the service industry.
<P>
	Work done by construction companies will now be taxed. 
Certain footwear, children's clothing, hair cuts. All these items will 
now be taxed. Funerals, pharmaceutical and medical supplies, 
mobile homes, utilities such as water and heating oil in the 
province of New Brunswick. Most of the lists are the same. 
Children's car seats, postage stamps and coins. We read about that 
in the paper today. The revenue minister did not even know there 
was a tax on stamps. Many labour charges, wood burning stoves, 
wood splitters, hand crafted products. These are all things on which 
people have not had to pay PST but will now have to pay tax. This 
is where it is an 8 per cent tax increase to the consumers in those 
three provinces who have allowed their premiers and their 
governments to harmonize with compensation.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1935"> 1935 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	The harmonization we support and we say works is one that is 
revenue neutral. It combines the two rates into a single rate and is 
applied to all things so there is the lowest possible rate. However 
the government did not do that. It chose to do it another way. The 
government chose to do it so that no revenues are lost on the GST 
portion. The premiers of those three provinces can promise their 
people a tax cut which will be subsidized by all Canadians. It is 
distorting the economy and creating unfair competition. That is not 
the kind of harmonization our party supports.
<P>
	When the Prime Minister says that the Reform Party supports 
that kind of harmonization by quoting the minority report of the 
Reform Party, he is once again distorting and stretching the reality 
of what we said in that paper. He is taking it out of context and I 
take exception to that.
<P>
	That is why I quoted the Prime Minister. It is not reason or logic 
that matters. What matters in his own words is the mood, and make 
sure that programs are matched to the mood of the people, and 
instinct. Whatever you can get away with, do it when you can. It 
will only be a short term hit. It will only be criticized for a while 
and then away we go, we are off to the races. That is why the quotes 
in my opening comments are very, very important.
<P>
	In a speech at the University of Prince Edward Island in October 
1993 the Deputy Prime Minister had the following to say about the 
GST: ``Food is not subject to GST because it is a necessity. So are 
books. They are needed for young minds to grow''. If she still 
believes what she said during the last election campaign, then why 
has her government not only not removed the GST from reading 
materials but in harmonizing the tax systems in Newfoundland, 
Nova Scotia and New Brunswick has effectively doubled the tax on 
reading materials?
<P>
	Also, the current chairman of the Standing Committee on 
Finance, the hon. member for Willowdale, had this to say about the 
tax on reading materials, a tax his government has now doubled: 
``The government is proposing to add to its GST by taxing the 
printed word. It strikes a blow at learning, the transfer of 
information''. That is what the hon. member said in the House. 
What does he say now about increasing the tax on reading material 
to 15 per cent from 7 per cent?
<P>
	There is more. The Minister of Health urged the government to 
``axe the tax and prevent the GST from being presented on books 
and literature''. Believe me, there is more.
<P>
	I ask the Deputy Prime Minister, does she now support a tax on 
reading, a tax that will now double which will make it even more 
difficult to deal with Canada's literacy problem? This is a tax she 
promised to scrap, not to double, as her government is doing now. 
Going for mood  and instinct rather than logic and reason is not the 
way to govern a country.
<P>
	We go back to the promise on page 22 of the red book. We have 
analysed whether it generates equivalent revenues. Not so. Fair to 
consumers and small business is only 50 per cent true. It is fairer 
and simpler to business but unfair to consumers and wait until they 
find out.
<P>
	I am only talking about page 22. The Liberals promised to 
replace, not scrap, not abolish, not kill, simply to replace. That is 
all. Have they met their promise as the Prime Minister claimed 
yesterday? That is all I am trying to establish here today. I am 
laying evidence and putting forward the argument that the 
government has failed to do so.
<P>
	The third element is ``promotes federal-provincial fiscal 
co-operation and harmonization''. I submit it is not so. What kind 
of fiscal co-operation is it with three provinces out of 10? The 
province of Quebec is angry and Alberta is saying: ``We share. We 
contribute $2 billion to the GST. Where is our share of that 
subsidy?'' Is Ontario happy about it? No. That is not fiscal 
co-operation. It is fiscal disharmony, not harmony.
<P>
	Who asked for this? Did those three provinces in Atlantic 
Canada ask for this? The answer is no. None of the provinces 
across Canada asked for it. I was on the standing committee when 
this was reviewed. I listened to the witnesses in the spring of 1994. 
I was a co-author of our minority report on the GST replacement. 
Nobody in the provinces asked for it.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	From the witnesses and the discussion of the MPs around that 
table, we knew it would have to be a federal initiative. The 
government would have to go to the provinces, lay out the 
advantages and do the sales job. None bit until the word 
compensation came in and until the government lowered the rates 
in those three Atlantic provinces to 15 per cent combined instead of 
the 19 per cent they have now.
<P>
	That is when this took on some life and when the son of GST, 
which is being nurtured in the three Atlantic provinces, comes to 
life. Only when the government subsidized a tax cut did these three 
provinces even agree to go further.
<P>
	As the chief finance critic for the Bloc Quebecois has mentioned, 
this is a politically motivated agreement. This has nothing to do 
with economics. This increases the tax burden on consumers in 
those provinces. This is uneconomical and inefficient for 
consumers. It is will cost more to their pocketbooks.
<P>
	In opposition the current finance minister said: ``If you ever 
merge the federal sales tax, the GST, with provincial sales tax, the 
PST, it will be very difficult to get rid of the GST''. Now that he is 
the finance minister what has he done? If it was bad in opposition 
three or  four years ago, why is not bad now? When a person 
promises to get rid of something why does he go about entrenching 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1936"> 1936 </A></B>
<P>
it? That is exactly what the finance minister has done. It will be 
very difficult to ever separate the two.
<P>
	Those three premiers, to brag about a tax cut, have now lost their 
autonomy over their own rates. How in heaven's name will those 
three premiers argue with the federal government when they are a 
little short on revenue and want to raise their share of the PST or 
the GST? The federal government will say ``no, it is the GST. We 
collect it, we set the rate and it is staying at 15 per cent. Tough. Do 
it through the income tax''.
<P>
	One of the three provinces is already presenting legislation in its 
legislature to increase personal taxes. The price that one of these 
provinces has to pay will be enormous. This does not create 
federal-provincial fiscal co-operation and harmonization. It is 
exactly the opposite.
<P>
	The finance minister has now basically entrenched the GST in 
the lives of those three provinces. In an effort to sell it everywhere 
else, we are talking about words like mood and instinct: ``this is the 
time to do it, we have the majority, we will force it down their 
throats''. People did not forget Brian Mulroney after forcing the 
GST down their throats. People will not forget what the Liberal 
government is doing.
<P>
	What a joke, closure on a debate as important as this. We are 
talking about a billion dollars and the advantages or disadvantages 
thereof and the government has introduced closure. It wants to 
limit debate on this because it wants to get going. It brought it in 
really fast under ways and means. A hundred changes, all the little 
things we could all be contributing toward making it better; but no, 
it wants to go ahead and do it without all that. That is not 
democracy.
<P>
	In opposition the Liberals cried, bellyached and whined every 
time the Conservatives introduced closure. Now they have done it 
more times in two and a half years than the Conservatives did it in 
their whole term.
<P>
	The Liberals are looking for and promoting support everywhere. 
They are begging for people to show the advantages of it. When the 
Canadian Federation of Independent Business supports it, they are 
talking about only a narrow sector. It is a special interest group, a 
small business. However, they do not talk about the consumers who 
buy the products of those business and how much more they will 
have to pay.
<P>
	I would like to ask the president of the CFIB what the answer to 
that is, transferring the tax from businesses on to the consumers of 
their products. I hope they are proud of that. When they get one 
accounting firm out of the millions across Canada to support their 
proposal they get the media to put it on the front page and support 
it. This does not make economic sense overall.
<P>
	Bits and pieces of it make good sense and are positive. There are 
things that can be done constructively to make things better if we
<P>
really want to do it the right way. However, I do not believe the 
government has the interest to do that.
<P>
	The Liberals even claim the Reform Party supports 
harmonization. I state unequivocally right now in the House, the 
Reform Party is against and does not support harmonization with 
compensation. Do members know what will happen a week or two 
from now? The Liberals will take what I said today, because they 
go by mood and instinct rather than by logic and reason, and say 
``he said something, let us use it against him''. They will say ``that 
member stood in the House and said he was against harmonization, 
and now he is flip-flopping''.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	They forget I said ``with compensation''. A single tax instead of 
two only makes sense. A single tax instead of two is better in terms 
of efficiency and simplicity, but we never said anything about 
driving somebody if there is a shortfall. If the combined rate still 
takes the same money out of our pockets, why bother?
<P>
	They have not given the transition cost alone of doing this in 
those three provinces. All they talk about are the lost revenues. The 
complications of a value added tax system that exist for a lot of 
people will still be there. It does not eliminate all the exemptions, 
the zero rated, the tax exempt and all of those complicated rules.
<P>
	I put on record that the Reform Party was against the GST 
replacement proposal of the Standing Committee on Finance, and it 
said so. Reformers then complimented the Liberals on their efforts 
in reviewing harmonization. They spent a lot of time, as did we all, 
exploring that. However, in the final analysis we said we could not 
concur because the way to do it is to first get their fiscal house in 
order and establish a balanced budget. After they do that they can 
introduce a more simple and visible form of taxation along the 
lines of a proportional flat tax. That is what we recommended. 
They dismissed that.
<P>
	There is another distortion. The finance minister stood in the 
House and said they had explored all of the alternatives. That is not 
so. The one that was not reviewed, the one that was not looked into, 
was the one from the hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood. 
He, along with a number of members from the greater Toronto area, 
with the support of about 20, 30 or 40 Liberals, suggested a flat tax 
to simplify the tax system and then get rid of the GST altogether. It 
would save the country $2 billion, $3 billion, $4 billion, $5 
billion-up to $10 billion. Get rid of it and use a simplified tax 
system.
<P>
	The chairman of the Standing Committee on Finance said: 
``Given the time constraints we have, we cannot explore this. It is 
too massive a change and we cannot explore this alternative''. 
Therefore it was dismissed. It  was not reviewed. It was not 
considered. The minister stood in front of Canadians and said they 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1937"> 1937 </A></B>
<P>
looked at them all, 20 different proposals. This is not so. There is 
one they did not review, one which our party will pursue.
<P>
	I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That all the words after the word ``That'' be deleted and the following 
substituted therefor:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>this House declines to give second reading to Bill C-31, an act to implement 
certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on March 6, 1996, since 
the principle of the bill does not seek to abolish the goods and services tax.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The Chair will 
deliberate on the proposed amendment and will return to the hon. 
member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is interesting to sit here over 
time, as the hon. member and I have. We were both rookies in 
1993. I am truly saddened to listen to his diatribe this morning with 
its misinformation and distortions.
<P>
	The Reform Party arrived here supposedly speaking for 
business, big and small, and yet when things are done by the 
government which are applauded by business or by the Fraser 
Institute, which it used to quote all the time, it suddenly does not 
mention them any more. The Fraser Institute applauded the budget, 
the subject of this implementation bill.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	Suddenly Reformers are not the friends of business. The other 
day we heard them attack profits. Today we have heard an attack on 
small business, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business. 
They threw the gauntlet down and said ``how dare you tell us this 
will be good for business''. In their opinion-it is always their 
opinion and no one else is right-this cannot be good for business 
and this cannot be good for Canada.
<P>
	I am glad the hon. member opposite admitted he was a member 
of the finance committee at the time we brought out our report on 
the GST. He signed a minority report. I believe he was still a 
member if he was not being disciplined by his party for disagreeing 
with it on this or other things. Reformers supported harmonization 
on the broadest possible base; food, medical devices, everything. 
They wanted it because as they said in their minority report it 
would effect the lowest possible rate.
<P>
	It is nonsense to suggest they thought a flat tax would replace the 
GST. He is quite correct to say flat tax was a huge undertaking that 
would require enormous study and had the purpose of a complete 
revamping of the entire tax system, not a replacement for the GST.
<P>
	As for compensation, it is incredible that now the member 
opposite qualifies his support for harmonization by saying ``of 
course, we never thought about adjustment''.
<P>
	I ask him, as I have asked him before, to comment on whether it 
is inappropriate for one region of the country to offer adjustment 
assistance to another region of the country for structural change. In 
particular, could he comment on the state of the wheat industry, the 
wheat sector, wheat farmers and the compensation they are 
receiving as a result of budgetary structural change over the last 
few years. Could he elaborate again, if he dare, on his suggestion 
we are somehow stifling debate.
<P>
	We have moved on the issue of the length of this debate only 
when it became apparent from the member opposite and his 
colleagues they had no intention of discussing anything in this bill 
other than one segment. There are many pages to this legislation. 
They have not yet commented on the CHST, on UI, on seniors. He 
says all they are talking about and all that is worth talking about is 
this issue.
<P>
	I wonder if he would acknowledge, and I would be happy to 
retract and say I am wrong, that we have been debating more than 
the GST here. It would be wonderful to hear more from the 
member's party and the official opposition on many of the other 
important things in the budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Madam Speaker, I have worked with the hon. member 
on the Standing Committee on Finance and I still do. I respect all 
the people who try to give their best efforts here.
<P>
	I am sorry if he is saddened, but it is pathetic to listen to his 
diatribe. It is totally pathetic to stand up and say to Canadians that 
all we have talked about is this portion.
<P>
	I talked only about this portion because we were told only an 
hour before proceedings yesterday that the government had a deal 
with those three provinces. That is how much notice the finance 
minister gave the opposition parties that the deal was in place. We 
are supposed to get our act together and find out what is good about 
it and bad about it an hour before, listen to the whole diatribe and 
then go through it?
<P>
	The member for Capilano-Howe Sound gave a complete 
dissertation on UI and the problems with UI and how the 
government is using that as a way to fund the deficit; $18 billion in 
revenues, expenses have dropped from $17 billion down to $12 
billion, and it is putting that $5 billion away into its cash flow and 
using it to meet its deficit targets.
<P>
	If the government only had a ceiling on UI, a $2 billion ceiling, 
capped it and then lowered the rates for business and lowered the 
rates for employees, it would be a tax cut. A tax cut would help 
consumers and businesses and would stimulate the economy.
<P>
	No, the government is not doing that. It will save that $5 billion 
and apply it to the deficit. If the government did it the way it should 
the deficit targets the finance minister has set out would not have 
been reached.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1938"> 1938 </A></B>
<P>
	We have spoken about more than one thing. I am sorry about 
losing my cool a little.
<P>
	On harmonization and subsidies, what is being subsidized is not 
grain. What is being subsidized is not unemployed people. What is 
being subsidized is not giving money to the needy. It is subsidizing 
a tax cut to three provincial premiers who will brag that they 
brought in tax cuts.
<P>
	When in heaven's name did we ever start subsidizing tax cuts 
across the country? That is all this is. It is not a disruption 
mechanism. The rate in the province dropped from 19 per cent 
down to 12 per cent. In one province that is a 7 per cent drop. It is a 
loss of revenue and the government is subsidizing it, plain and 
simple.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	With respect to the Fraser Institute, I am sure Mr. Michael 
Walker just had a weak moment in praising the Liberal budget. If 
he reviews his comments about the $111 billion which the 
government will have added to the debt when it exits, I would think 
the Fraser Institute will change its tune pretty darn quickly.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> After 
consideration, the Chair will accept the proposed amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, after 
listening to the member for Calgary Centre I have decided to 
change my speech somewhat to include a discussion of 
consumption taxes.
<P>
	I also served on the committee that travelled across the country. 
We talked to not just every day Canadians, but businesses and 
people in policy administration.
<P>
	It was interesting when we got to the maritime provinces. I 
discovered the problems those governments were having in dealing 
with the revenues that were being generated through their 
provincial sales tax systems and what they were doing with them. 
When we talk about money being transferred through taxation 
systems it is important to not only consider taxation itself, but to 
also consider the other side, what does it do?
<P>
	In Newfoundland much of that money went toward supporting 
its health care system. In your province of New Brunswick, Madam 
Speaker, the health care system and the educational system are 
among the systems for which province uses the money.
<P>
	Industrialization has brought a changes over the years, indeed 
some will say over the centuries. The maritime provinces have seen 
a reduction in their industrial base. This has put great strains on 
their financial resources to maintain services which are similar to 
those in the rest of Canada.
<P>
	The change in rates from 19 per cent to 12 or 13 per cent in some 
provinces is positive in a number of aspects. We must consider that 
through the process of equalization payments the wealthier 
provinces are  already transferring moneys to poorer provinces. 
Whether they are given a subsidy or an implementation or a 
structural change which allows those provinces to change those 
rates for a brief period of time or whether it is transferred by way of 
equalization payments, it is all the same.
<P>
	This is a better system. It allows those provinces to reduce the 
retail sales tax. It also allows them to move toward a more efficient 
tax. What do I mean by that? A retail sales tax by its very nature 
taxes business inputs. To put it simply, in my own riding, General 
Motors is a big manufacturer. The automotive sector accounts for 
approximately 6 per cent of our GDP. Because the province of 
Ontario levies a retail sales tax, General Motors will pay that tax on 
some of its input costs. For example, if it buys stationery and 
adding machines for its offices, it is paying retail sales tax as it is 
an end user.
<P>
	As businesses are not social institutions, they transfer those costs 
on to consumers. The people who buy automobiles manufactured 
in the province of Ontario pay retail sales tax. They are paying a 
portion of that retail sales tax when they buy the automobile.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	The province of Quebec has already harmonized its retail sales 
tax system. It does not have a retail sales tax, it has a value added 
tax, the GST. Through the administration of that tax, those 
companies which export their products worldwide are able to take 
the tax off those products. To show how ridiculous it is, within 
Canada there are nine retail sales taxes and one federal sales tax.
<P>
	In the province of Quebec, General Motors in its plant at 
Sainte-Thérèse is able to take the retail sales tax out of that product. 
In other words, it can ship cars from Sainte-Thérèse, Quebec into 
the American market cheaper than a similar plant in Oshawa if only 
the retail sales tax is considered. Therefore, retail sales taxes have a 
very negative effect on exports. The export sector accounts for 
something like 30 per cent of Canada's GDP.
<P>
	The government's move to harmonize taxes is very positive. A 
plethora of people are in the tax collection business. There is 
tremendous duplication. The governments in Fredericton and 
Charlottetown, and others, collect their own retail sales taxes. 
Some are having great difficulty. The administration of the retail 
sales taxes in those provinces has great inefficiencies in collecting 
taxes. Some fully admit that a lot people in those provinces have 
been able to escape the retail sales tax system.
<P>
	It is very easy to escape the retail sales tax because it is a single 
stage tax. If you do not pay it once you sneak away from it entirely. 
The value added tax is a lot more difficult to escape simply because 
every stage of production adds a tax. If I buy something from one  
person I get a credit for the GST that has to be paid if I use it in my 
business. This is not so in the retail sales tax area. A lot of those 
provinces have had difficulty in the simple administration of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1939"> 1939 </A></B>
<P>
tax. There is no question the retail sales tax, compared to a value 
added tax, is a lot less efficient tax.
<P>
	What I really want to discuss today is the whole area of 
consumption. That is what this budget implementation bill is really 
all about. Everyone is very concerned to make the Canadian 
economy more efficient and to create a degree of harmonization 
across Canada.
<P>
	Next Tuesday is the deadline for people to file their income tax 
returns. If there is one thing that unites us as a nation, although we 
might have a common dislike of the event, is the once a year 
requirement to file a federal income tax return. Generally speaking, 
the rules and regulations in the Income Tax Act are the same 
whether you live in British Columbia, the Yukon, Quebec or in 
Prince Edward Island. It is a commonality that happens across the 
country.
<P>
	I have encouraged the Minister of Finance and I believe he has 
taken it somewhat to heart that what has to be achieved through the 
harmonization process is a consistent rate across Canada of the 
GST. Why would I say that? When I was in Newfoundland I was 
surprised and shocked to discover that there is a tremendous 
business in mail order sales. People buy things through the mail 
from Ontario rather than going to downtown St. John's or 
Cornerbrook to buy from a local retailer because the retail sales tax 
in Ontario is 3 or 4 percentage points lower than in Newfoundland.
<P>
	In other words it was a negative for the people in Newfoundland. 
People were not buying their products from the local retailers but 
from Ontario solely because Ontario had a lower retail sales tax. 
The province of Alberta would gain the most because it has no 
retail sales tax.
<P>
	It shows how the country gets into these ridiculous economic 
situations. It should be the end objective of the GST legislation that 
all provinces come onside so the rates are the same across the 
country. Then there will not be the problem of products moving 
between jurisdictions or how the rates are adjusted. This is just a 
ridiculous situation. People say a consumption tax is a lot fairer 
tax.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	I heard the member for Calgary Centre talk about how we should 
have a flat tax. I say that a flat tax is not an efficient or fair tax. 
With a flat tax interest would not be taxable. The banks of the 
country must really embrace the Reform Party because any interest 
earned on revenues under a flat tax system would not taxable.
<P>
	A flat tax would take the tax burden from the wealthiest and shift 
it to the middle income earner, those people making $65,000 or 
$70,000. In the Reform  Party's magical world those people would 
be paying more taxes than wealthy people.
<P>
	The President of the United States said: ``I do not understand a 
flat tax. Everybody over $200,000 is going to be paying less taxes 
and those people in the middle income brackets will be paying 
significantly more''. That says a lot about the Reform Party and 
who it represents.
<P>
	As members will recall, Steve Forbes advocated a flat tax when 
he ran for the Republic nomination for president. I read an 
interesting comment which I will paraphrase because I do not have 
the article in front of me. It pertains to Steve Forbes.
<P>
	The magazine said that the companies that Mr. Forbes owns, 
<I>Forbes</I> magazine and others, stood to gain $3 billion from the 
implementation of a flat tax. The magazine went on to say that it is 
not a fair tax and is not something America wants. I was not 
reading a leftist magazine. It was called <I>Money</I> magazine.
<P>
	People who deal in this area know that the flat tax is not a fair 
tax. I can only suggest that the Reform Party is representing those 
who are not the common people of the country.
<P>
	A lot of people think a consumption tax is a fair tax. It is a 
discretionary tax. If we do not buy that new car, we do not pay the 
tax.
<P>
	The reason I want to talk about it is because I am personally very 
concerned about the level of consumer credit in the country. The 
government is also concerned about it. If we look at the budget and 
the dedication to reducing the debt and deficit, it is part of the 
process of getting the economy back on its feet again.
<P>
	There has been an alarming growth in consumer credit. I talk 
about disposable incomes. Ninety-two per cent of disposable 
income in the country is now committed to fixed debt payments. 
That is the cheque taken home every week. In looking at the 
financial statements of the banks it does not take long to realize 
how that has changed. There has been a tremendous growth in 
consumer debt with our financial institutions.
<P>
	Is that healthy for our country? There are some other interesting 
statistics coming from Stats Canada telling us that personal 
bankruptcies are at an all time high in the country. The banks will 
tell us that the reason they have to keep credit card interest rates so 
high, 18 per cent when interest rates have been declining, is 
because of personal bankruptcies.
<P>
	Which is the cause and which is the effect? Are there personal 
bankruptcies because the banks have loaned all these people money 
to finance personal consumption? Or is it the other way around? I 
suggest that we have an alarming problem in the growth of 
consumer debt.
<P>
	It is not unusual for the banks to send out credit cards to all 
university students, people who do not have a way to pay them. 
They are getting into debt at very early  stages of their lives. I was 
alarmed the other day when I saw an ad which read: ``Go to Costa 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1940"> 1940 </A></B>
<P>
Rica for $85 a month''. That was the end of the message. For $85 a 
month, someone can go to Costa Rica and have a good time on the 
beach. That is $85 a month for another year of their life. Many 
people are susceptible to that. A lot of people who are under stress 
and strain today are susceptible to such escape mechanisms.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	What we are doing is compounding people's debt problems and 
they will never get out of these situations. Many of our young 
people think they are never going to be able to own a home because 
they are entrapped with consumer debt.
<P>
	Governments try to help people such as ours has done with 
RRSPs in the last budget. We have recognized that a lot of people 
are not able to utilize those RRSPs. In their younger years they may 
be doing other things and are not able to save that money. We allow 
them to transfer those credits and eligibility for RRSP deductions. 
We allow them a second crack at it.
<P>
	When I talked about 92 per cent of disposable income going into 
supporting fixed debt repayments, that is across this country. If we 
look at it intergenerationally and at people under 45 years of age, 
we will find they actually have negative consumer income.
<P>
	Why is this a bad thing? It is bad because most recoveries in the 
economy have been driven to some degree by a prior mandate of 
savings. In other words, people save money to buy big ticket items, 
such as a car or refrigerator. We have allowed our financial 
institutions to so eradicate the concept of savings that people can 
no longer afford to buy anything.
<P>
	I was interested to hear some of the statements of one of the 
manufacturers in my riding, General Motors. It said that in Canada 
the actual sales of automobiles is declining. The types of sales that 
are occurring are for smaller vehicles which cost less money.
<P>
	People are holding on to their cars much longer than they have 
ever done before. The average age of a car is something like eight 
years now because people do not have any money. They have spent 
not only all the money they had but they also went into debt to 
financial institutions to finance an automobile, a house and now 
consumption.
<P>
	How many times have we gone to a liquor store and watched 
somebody slip a card through the credit machine? In Canada, the 
average debt held on a credit card is something like $1,500. Think 
about that when we say 25 per cent of the people pay it off every 
month. The real average of those people who do not pay off their 
cards is astronomical.
<P>
	We have developed a whole culture of debt. That has not 
happened before in Canada. These are alarming  figures. I had an 
opportunity to discuss this with the Governor of the Bank of 
Canada. He too questioned whether these were not alarming 
statistics.
<P>
	I am bringing it here to the House of Commons because I would 
like to alert parliamentarians of the real concern that not only I but 
many other people are starting to have about the growth of credit in 
this country. We should think about curtailing it. How do we curtail 
it?
<P>
	Financial institutions are regulated through the Bank Act. We 
have had discussions about whether they should be selling 
insurance. Now they tell us they want to lease cars. Do we want our 
financial institutions to have such a hold on our economy that we 
cannot create growth?
<P>
	People do not have the savings in order to gain stability, and 
stability is another big feature of this. People do not feel stable any 
more in their own environments. They are not even sure whether 
they will have their jobs next week. That is compounded by the 
huge debts they have built up.
<P>
	Watching the bankruptcy statistics will only give further proof 
that we are pushing a lot of people into financial situations they 
cannot handle. Governments have problems with debts and 
deficits. An important thing we are forgetting is that generally 
people also have significant debt and deficit problems.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I am very supportive of the budget 
implementation legislation. I am very supportive of what we are 
doing here in Ottawa to get the government's fiscal and financial 
house in order. I believe as our debt and deficit come down, 
disposable income will start to rise. Hopefully in three or four years 
we will start to see reductions in tax rates occur in this country to 
free up more disposable income for the average Canadian. Then not 
only will Canadians be able to save for their future but they will 
also be able to invest in items to support our manufacturing sector.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, in his 
speech the hon. member talked about many things and nothing at 
all. He forgot to tell us that the federal government was having all 
Canadians and all Quebecers pay for harmonizing the GST with the 
maritime provinces. We will have to pay almost $1 billion for this 
harmonization. I repeat that Quebec, when it harmonized, did not 
get any compensation.
<P>
	Another thing he could have talked about, because we did not 
learn anything, is that by harmonizing the GST the federal 
government is interfering directly with the provinces' autonomy 
since they will lose full control over the taxation rate and the tax 
base.
<P>
	In preliminary discussions, the Bloc Quebecois had suggested to 
the government that it could solve two  problems at once in this 
area. First, abolish the GST and give the whole field of indirect 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1941"> 1941 </A></B>
<P>
taxation to the provinces, and then obtain some form of 
compensation for the federal government's losses. The federal's 
compensation could have taken the form of reduced cash transfers 
to provinces.
<P>
	In this way, the federal government could have maintained its 
financial balance and the provinces would have regained control of 
their fields of taxation, therefore their autonomy. Then, we could 
have done away with the Canada social transfer and each of the 
provinces would have had the right and the power to manage, and 
manage completely, the areas of health, education and social 
assistance.
<P>
	I would like my colleague to answer the following question: 
Why have they brushed aside this solution which would have been 
much more equitable for all Canadians and all Quebecers?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Shepherd:</B> Madam Speaker, I have heard the Bloc 
Quebecois members mention many times the necessity of creating 
a Canadian common market. Even in their strange world of a 
separate country they see the need for a common market. The 
European Union has been wrestling for decades to harmonize 
consumption taxes within its jurisdictions.
<P>
	The member mentions that they need their independence 
because they want to create new and wonderful bridges and walls. 
We are spending time here on another piece of legislation, the 
agreement on internal trade, which attempts to reduce barriers 
between the provinces. Why? To support commerce. Why? 
Because the erection of artificial barriers is inefficient. The bottom 
line is that everybody pays for that because we do not get the best 
and most excellent in our economy.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	It is in the best interests of all Canadians, Quebecers included, 
that we have a harmonized rate system on our consumption taxes. 
We are not going to tell the province of Quebec how to spend it. 
That is Quebec's choice. That is how we respect constitutionality 
under federalism. To say that we want a 25 per cent rate in the 
province of Newfoundland instead of 10 per cent, the bottom line is 
that we cannot conduct commerce in this country, we create 
artificial barriers to carrying on business in this country which is 
not in the best interests of developing a unified common market.
<P>
	To answer the member's question, he cannot have it both ways. 
He cannot argue at one point that he wants a common market and 
then turn around and say they want to fix their tax rates differently 
from everybody else. It just will not work.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to verify something with my distinguished colleague, 
who sat on the finance committee.
<P>
	There are two points that disturb me in Bill C-31 regarding the 
harmonization of the GST with provincial sales taxes in the three 
famous provinces with which the finance minister has cooked up an 
agreement. The first one is the 15 per cent rate. Does the hon. 
member feel that the finance minister woke up one morning and 
said to his wife: ``All right, it will be 15 per cent''?
<P>
	At the present time, two provinces are paying almost 19 per cent 
altogether in GST and PST, and Newfoundland is paying almost 20 
per cent. People of these provinces are already paying these rates. 
Our good finance minister probably woke up one morning and said: 
``It will be 15 per cent''. To make the medicine easier to take, he 
added: ``I will give you $1 billion over four years and in cash, 
immediately. That will help you pay for kleenex to forget the 
money not collected, 4 or 5 per cent, as the case may be''. I would 
like the hon. member to give me his views on that, since he sat on 
the finance committee. Why 15 and not 16 or 12 per cent?
<P>
	Second, when that party was sitting here on the so-called official 
opposition benches, it fought against a hidden GST and convinced 
Mr. Mulroney not to hide it in 1990. At the time, you said it would 
be increased, just as you are increasing taxes on gasoline, tobacco 
and alcohol.
<P>
	Today, you are hiding it. Of course, you will tell me: ``We will 
have the sales slip''. Who looks at the sales slip? You? No, I do not 
think so. I, for one, never check it. What counts is how much I pay 
and how much change I get back.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Shepherd:</B> Madam Speaker, why is it 15 per cent was the 
question. Studies have been done on tax policy throughout the 
world and I will refer to the European Union; we do not want to use 
the Canadian example. Studies will tell us that consumption tax 
rates in excess of 15 per cent are almost impossible to collect. I 
suggest that the province of Newfoundland was probably having a 
considerable amount of difficulty collecting the 20 per cent tax.
<P>
	If the tax is reduced to 15 per cent, and it will also be in a value 
added tax system, more revenue will actually be collected. I 
suspect the tremendous amount of efficiencies in doing a rate 
reduction will actually expand the tax revenue in those provinces. 
In fact the exposure to the federal government will be even less 
than has been suggested.
<P>
	The second matter the member spoke about was the concept of a 
hidden tax. I for one have always thought it  was important to have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1942"> 1942 </A></B>
<P>
the tax visible. When I served on the committee and went across 
the country, I listened to Canadians. They told me over and over 
again that they do not want to see it. The bottom line is we have 
turned the country into a nation of bookkeepers and accountants.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	If we go to Chicoutimi and there is a dress on a rack which is 
$100, we cannot figure out how much it cost when we leave the 
store. People do not to deal with it.
<P>
	If we want to make it a visible tax, we should make it visible 
here. If we want to change that 15 per cent to 16 per cent, we should 
do it in this forum so that everyone can know the rate is changing.
<P>
	When we go to a gas station, we do not get out of our car to 
check the metre to see how much tax was added. Maybe we should. 
The bottom line is most people do not want to do it.
<P>
	We are doing what people have asked us to do. That is the 
democratic process.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to speak to Bill C-31 introduced by the Minister of 
Finance. This bill makes me somewhat uncomfortable in light of 
our basic duty, namely debating issues in the public interest and 
trying to meet as adequately as possible the real needs and basic 
concerns of those who elected us, without being gagged as is now 
the case.
<P>
	In a way, I feel bad about having to speak to such a pernicious 
and insidious bill. I deplore our having to debate such a bill, which 
results from a long and laborious plot orchestrated by the hon. 
member for LaSalle-Émard and supported by the Right Hon. 
Prime Minister and member for Saint-Maurice, who both represent 
Quebec ridings.
<P>
	I must tell you, however, that the support I received from those 
around me and from many of my constituents have made this a 
memorable moment in my life as a member of Parliament: acting 
as the spokesman for an entire community for whom the minister is 
nothing more than some sort of abstract entity.
<P>
	When a family man, who turns out to be one of the many victims 
of the axe wielded by this federal Liberal government, comes to my 
office to ask for my help in finding work, I feel proud of what I am 
doing now in condemning this insidious bill as vigorously as 
possible.
<P>
	The hon. minister has probably never experienced a situation 
like that of the family man I just mentioned, at least not personally. 
Yet, his bill directly affects hundreds of thousands of people who 
are not necessarily among the disadvantaged or the poor, far from 
it. This bill, a hodgepodge of tax provisions contained in the last  
budget, concretely affects the middle class commonly and bluntly 
described as overtaxed.
<P>
	While government members applauded the minister's cosmetic 
budget on March 6, we warned the people against the negative, 
hidden impact of that statement, whose only purpose was to win 
votes. Well, here we are. We must now discuss the absurdity and 
emptiness left behind by the March 6 budget.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	The bill in question stems from the same logic that has dictated 
the government's actions ever since October 1993, and it was 
acting in good faith-I repeat, in good faith. In fact, the 
government is enacting a whole series of legislative measures that 
are so underhanded that it is actually pulling a fast one on the 
public.
<P>
	Watching the minister struggle with the media these past few 
days, I came to the realization, with some astonishment, that all the 
government is trying to do is to lull the public, deliberately playing 
with abstract concepts, to make almost everyone lose interest in the 
process. Who are the big losers in all this? All politicians. Such 
strategies, understandably, shatter the public's confidence in its 
politicians.
<P>
	I have been repeatedly calling the House's attention to a recent 
opinion poll in which, out of a sample of approximately 40 
professions, people were asked which professionals they felt they 
could trust the most, the least and not at all. You will be surprised to 
hear that barely four per cent of Canadians trusted their politicians. 
Although, when we see the Prime Minister, during oral question 
period, arguing high and low that he did not say that the 
government would abolish the GST he had condemned so strongly 
and taking his red book out-which is against the rules-to read a 
little excerpt that comes in real handy to get him out of this mess, it 
is understandable that the percentage is not any higher.
<P>
	It is a good thing that modern technology enables us to produce 
videos of the 1993 election campaign, in which the Prime Minister 
and member for Saint-Maurice, in Quebec, can be heard saying, in 
his very colourful words: ``We hate the GST and we will kill it. We 
will scrap it''. This is a strange way to scrap it. Today, he is 
proposing to hide it, through harmonization, at Canadian 
taxpayers' expense. We will have to pay the tidy sum of $1 billion 
to try to hide the mistake he made during the 1993 election 
campaign and the Liberals' mandate in the opposition, when their 
friends filibustered in the other place.
<P>
	Now in power, these same politicians are gagging us. The two 
young Quebec scholars who recently joined the Liberal team must 
not be too proud to see the government act against their principles 
of justice and respect for the people. This is tantamount to saying 
``we love you'', but not showing it. And it is because of prime 
ministers and members like these that barely four  per cent of the 
population trusts politicians. Our sholarly friends were better off in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1943"> 1943 </A></B>
<P>
their universities; indeed, the confidence rate in universities is 
significantly higher.
<P>
	I am not trying to criticize the government's goals to reduce the 
deficit and to improve the state of public finances, quite the 
contrary; these are very noble and praiseworthy objectives.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	However, I strongly condemn the method used by the 
government to reach its goals. I am merely trying to show this 
House the true colours of this government formed by the Liberal 
Party, the party of forgotten promises, the party that has become a 
master at promising changes without ever doing anything.
<P>
	As you know, these blunders cannot be attributed to the 
government's good faith. I often use the expression ``good faith'', 
because the Minister of Finance seemingly made an honest 
mistake. An honest mistake, can you believe it?
<P>
	Abolishing the GST was the Liberals' favourite theme during the 
October 1993 election campaign. Today, in all good faith, they 
decide to keep this tax and to hide it, as is the case with the taxes on 
gasoline, tobacco and alcohol products. I challenge members 
opposite to tell me that, when they last filled their tank, bought a 
pack of cigarettes, or got a bottle of alcohol or a case of beer, they 
inquired about the amount of money they were paying in federal or 
provincial taxes.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I am sure that even you did not check that. Yet, it 
would be a good thing to do.
<P>
	This government, and more specifically the Minister of Finance, 
will hide the GST in at least three provinces. This takes some 
nerve. While they sat in opposition, the Liberals were opposed to 
hiding that tax because, they said, the government would gradually 
increase it. Yet, these same Liberals will turn the GST into a hidden 
tax.
<P>
	This really contradicts what the Liberal Party said in its red 
book. But this does not seem to affect the logic of the members 
opposite. Even individual promises are not being fulfilled. Indeed, 
as we are speaking, the Prime Minister should normally be in the 
process of replacing the Deputy Prime Minister, since she had 
pledged to resign. She made that promise. Remember, you were 
there. If such is the governing authority in our political system, let 
me tell you that I prefer, by far, my status as a member of the 
opposition to being associated with and sitting behind this Prime 
Minister and this Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	Government members should show more judgment when 
developing their election promises instead of having to eat humble 
pie, as the finance minister did, in shouldering the full weight of 
the Liberal pipe dream when he admitted several times that he had 
made an honest mistake.
<P>
	Ultimately, knowing what the Liberal Party is capable of, we 
could very well have accepted the notion of harmonization of the 
GST and PST, had it not been for these concepts of compensation. 
Unfortunately, the government only succeeded in jeopardizing 
once again the fairness and the balance in this country's tax system. 
When Quebec harmonized its sales tax with the GST in 1991 under 
the Conservative government of Brian Mulroney, it did not demand 
compensation.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	Five years later, Liberals have the gall to pick the pockets of all 
consumers and voters to the tune of $1 billion for three provinces, 
to get them to come on board and get out of a mess they got 
themselves into, in the first place.
<P>
	I figure that we, in Quebec, will fork out close to $250 million 
that will be paid to these three Maritime provinces led by Liberal 
friends, including Brian Tobin, a former member of the rat pack 
who sat in opposition with our Prime Minister and who went on to 
become the premier of Newfoundland. Quebecers will pay $250 
million to these Liberal friends literally to buy off these provinces, 
namely Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Newfoundland. It seems 
that the net result of this operation will have to be figured in votes 
and not in terms of economic recovery. A provincial election is 
expected in Prince Edward Island very shortly and then it will only 
be a matter of days or months before a fourth province joins the 
process.
<P>
	In the end, the Minister of Finance will have bought the support 
of four provinces for only $1.2 billion. That is $1.2 billion of your 
money, Mr. Speaker, and the money of the new minister, who is 
considered an intellectual in Quebec, by the way, as well as my 
money and the money of all the people who have elected us to 
represent them in this House. The worst thing of all is that the 
Prime Minister is heartily approving the poor performance of his 
government since the beginning of the 35th Parliament.
<P>
	This is what the Liberal government of Canada stated: ``This 
government has consistently acted on the principle that the state 
and the people need to be able to see structural change coming and 
to adjust to them''. Right now, Canadians are trying to adjust to the 
broken promises of the Liberals. Many arguments are used to try to 
relate all this to current events, but that usually puts the 
government on the spot. It is obviously some kind of strategy.
<P>
	Now for justice and fairness. This great principle does not seem 
to have been included in the honour code of the Liberal Party 
currently in power, at least not as far as the distribution of 
adjustment assistance is concerned. As an example, a reminder, 
here is one of the many erroneous, if I may so express myself in 
this House, statements that were made: ``We have provided 
resources to ease the adjustment in response to the elimination of 
the Crow  rate, $1 billion''. You are signalling me that my time is 
almost up, Mr. Speaker, but I would like to tell members what a 
number of my constituents said to me last week about the finance 
minister. A group of citizens pointed out that the most influential 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1944"> 1944 </A></B>
<P>
shareholder in Canada Steamship Lines, our very own finance 
minister, registers several of his ships in the Bahamas. Dominique 
Joly, Hélène, Josée and Vincent told me that the finance minister 
registered a number of his ships in the Bahamas, apparently to save 
on taxes. As they told me: ``If that is a good finance minister, then 
Heaven help us''. They also told me that he often bought his ships 
and had them refitted in Asia, because it seems that it costs less 
there.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	This is a fine sort of government. When the Minister of Finance 
goes all the way to Asia to buy things, when we have, right here, 
factories that can build very good ships, ships that Canadians 
would be proud to build. In fact, there is a great factory in Saint 
John that could build the ships needed by the finance minister.
<P>
	In closing, I wonder if the Liberal MPs are proud of their 
government. I can tell you that the day after that party turfed out 
one of its members, with my name bearing as you know such a 
close resemblance to that of the Prime Minister, I received seven 
calls in the space of an hour and a half-Patrick Saint-Jacques can 
confirm this-from citizens in the Ottawa area who were 
telephoning my office here, in the belief that it was the Prime 
Minister's office, to speak out against the way the member from the 
Toronto area was treated.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister for International 
Cooperation and Minister responsible for Francophonie, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to start by thanking my hon. colleague for 
acknowledging my intellectual capacities that are recognized all 
over Quebec. These are very necessary for understanding issues in 
depth, and yet they have not prevented me from spending the past 
twelve years in the business world, creating jobs on the 
international level for Canadian companies that are open to the 
world.
<P>
	I would also like to say that I am extremely proud to have been 
elected to the Liberal team this past March 25, although I am being 
told I ought to be ashamed of it. I would like to point out to him that 
I won with 60 per cent of the total vote, whereas in 1993 we got 52 
per cent. That means that, even without talking about the GST, we 
have improved our performance at the polls, while the Bloc has 
dropped from 39 per cent to 34. I would therefore ask the hon. 
member to be a little more restrained in his statements.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> He is off the topic. We were not 
referring to results at the polls.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pettigrew:</B> Absolutely.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Come on now, this is not about 
election results. Get back to C-31.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pettigrew: </B>Well now, I would just like to reassure my fellow 
Quebecers on the adjustment formula and to explain to them most 
clearly that their acceptance of harmonization of the tax in 1990 
was extremely fortunate for the Quebec economy. We were 
extremely happy to have that harmonization, and the adjustment 
formula implemented by the Minister of Finance does not penalize 
Quebec in any way. It does not penalize Quebec in any way because 
only provinces losing 5 per cent of their tax revenues are affected 
by that measure. We in Quebec, on the contrary, had additional 
revenues after we had harmonized the tax in 1990. The formula 
does not, therefore, penalize Quebec in the least, the opposite in 
fact. Whether it was done in 1990 or in 1996, Quebec has benefited 
from being the first to harmonize the taxes.
<P>
	On the other hand, I wonder if my hon. colleague is aware that 
yesterday the Quebec Minister of Finance, Bernard Landry, said 
the following about the GST: ``Strictly from the taxation point of 
view, this is good news, for more provinces will have a VAT from 
now on''. Mr. Landry, the Quebec finance minister, thinks this is a 
very good thing, and I quote him again word for word: ``This is a 
very good thing, having a VAT in the other provinces around us, for 
the fact that ours in Quebec is lower will be to our advantage. It 
places us in a competitive position; this is good for trade and 
harmonizes our economic space''. That was the position of the 
Quebec Minister of Finance. I can tell you that I am most pleased 
that the Quebec finance minister is supporting our efforts toward an 
economy that is more competitive, more open to the world.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Frontenac has the 
floor for five minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Oh, that is wonderful. You are fair, 
Mr. Speaker, a rarity these days in this party.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	I am grateful for the question raised by my colleague in this 
House, who was elected with a 60 per cent majority. I might remind 
him that a kid was elected in Lac-Saint-Jean with a 76 per cent 
majority, and you in the Liberal Party poured everything-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pettigrew:</B> He is not a kid; he is a member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> It is an expression from 
Lac-Saint-Jean, I will have you know.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pettigrew:</B> Oh, is it?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> It is. If you got out of Montreal, you 
would learn some regional expressions.
<P>
	I wonder if the minister would not be more proud of his Minister 
of Finance if he bought his ships at home. He would create jobs and 
if he registered them here, he would pay taxes here.
<P>
	On the subject of compensation to the three maritime provinces 
that signed on, and that were penalized because they lowered their 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1945"> 1945 </A></B>
<P>
sales tax by five per cent, why do you  not leave them where they 
are at right now? They are already paying 19 or 20 per cent. You are 
making them a gift; they will be paying less tax. I am the one who 
is going to compensate their governments, innocent that I am.
<P>
	The governments of the maritime provinces would rather have a 
big provincial sales tax and less income tax. That is their choice. It 
is not up to us to meddle in the way a province is administered, as 
my colleague for Chicoutimi pointed out. He talked of respect for 
provinces and jurisdictions. We will respect them.
<P>
	In 1991, when Quebec harmonized its sales tax, the QST, with 
the GST, you did not give us one red cent. We do the collecting and 
we split the cost fifty-fifty. It costs you $88 million a year.
<P>
	In the maritimes, Ottawa will pay the whole shot. Strange idea of 
fairness in this party and this government. What did you do when 
dairy subsidies were cut over five years? It will mean an average of 
$8,000 per farm. You, a fine representative of Quebec-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry. I would ask both member to 
address their remarks to the Chair. The member has three minutes 
left.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, could you tell him he 
has done nothing to protect dairy producers? Of course, he is going 
to answer: ``I am from Montreal, there are no farmers in my 
riding''. He should tell his constituents that there are many 
consumers among them and that they will have to pay more for 
their butter and cheese. Cheese will be around 50 cents more a kilo 
and butter 28 cents more a pound; but he will not say a thing. His 
constituents mentioned it, he will not be seen anymore. They saw 
him during the campaign, but they will not see him any longer.
<P>
	Of course, Bernard Landry, now a Quebec minister, was one of 
those who supported harmonization back then. He was not sitting 
in the National Assembly at the time, but he agreed with Robert 
Bourassa that harmonization was the way to go. It is a lot more 
convenient. I was one of those who had to fill in the infernal 
GST-QST forms every month. It was very costly and time 
consuming, and the amount of tax was very little since my business 
was not international.
<P>
	This being said, when we harmonized, did Ottawa give us $1 
billion? Certainly not. Quebec could get carried away and say: 
``Let us raise the sales tax, the QST, to 19 or 20 per cent as in 
Newfoundland'' and then several months later, it would decide to 
harmonize. It seems that this would cost Quebec $1.2 billion. The 
province could then tell the rest of Canada: ``Give us $1.2. billion''. 
This is the way it works.
<P>
	Essentially, what the finance minister did is use taxpayers' 
money to buy three provinces to start with. Prince Edward Island 
should follow in a few months.  This will bring the number to four, 
but there are many other provinces missing. In Alberta there is no 
sales tax.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	Alberta will most certainly not come on board, neither will 
British Columbia, or Quebec; Ontario is not interested. In Ontario, 
they do not want to increase taxes, they want to lower them. These 
four provinces account for close to 80 per cent of the total 
population, or at least 75 per cent. This is a strange way to fe fair.
<P>
	To conclude, I will remind the House that to be accepted, a tax 
must be fair and simple. What the finance minister is doing is 
neither fair nor simple. It is far from being fair.
<P>
	The international cooperation minister did not tell me if he 
checked how much taxes he paid last time he filled up his car, how 
much taxes he paid when he bought a quart of liquor or a case of 
beer, how much taxes there is on cigarettes. This government is 
being hypocritical in attempting to hide the GST it criticized so 
vehemently when it was in opposition.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure and honour to address the House of Commons today 
during this debate on the budget implementation bill.
<P>
	During the recent byelection in Etobicoke North I became very 
aware of the value of the legacy of the members of Parliament who 
served so capably in the riding in the years before me.
<P>
	In particular, former Minister for International Trade Roy 
MacLaren, the incoming High Commissioner to Great Britain, 
served the constituents of Etobicoke North with great distinction 
for four terms, beginning in 1979. I rediscovered during the 
election campaign the value of hard work and integrity in 
representing riding constituents because I heard so many positive 
comments about Roy MacLaren as I canvassed from door to door.
<P>
	I had the good fortune to work with Roy MacLaren in the riding 
for five years before the byelection and it was with great pride that 
I discussed with constituents his successes and the many ways Roy 
MacLaren and his gracious wife, Lee, so positively impacted 
people in the riding over the years.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	My constituents have also talked to me about other great 
Canadians who represented with distinction in this House the 
people of York West, a riding whose boundaries were redrawn and 
which was renamed Etobicoke North in 1976. Red Kelly, Robert 
Winters and Alastair Gillespie are names that came back often, but 
I should also mention Jim Flemming, Philip Givens and Bob 
Pennock.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1946"> 1946 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I follow in the footsteps of so many great Canadians who have 
made such a significant contribution to public policy and to public 
life in Canada. It is a daunting thought and a challenge that I will 
fully devote myself to. I too aspire to earn the respect and support 
the constituents of Etobicoke North have reserved for the members 
who have preceded me.
<P>
	I thank the constituents of Etobicoke North for placing their 
confidence in me. As well, I thank the many volunteers who helped 
me during the election campaign. Without their support I would not 
be here.
<P>
	As we all know, winning an election requires the commitment of 
many people in canvassing, office work, installing signs, writing 
and distributing brochures, fund raising and a host of other tasks. I 
was very fortunate to have had a very talented and dedicated team 
working with me.
<P>
	Our election victory in Etobicoke North was very much a team 
effort and I am very grateful to those who worked so effectively on 
our campaign team.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As I canvassed door to door, I met many voters who recognized 
the importance of concluding the debate on national unity. I look 
forward to contributing to these discussions. The people of my 
riding want the matter to be settled so that we can go on to other 
things.
<P>
	One of the few obstacles to investment in Canada and Quebec is 
the political uncertainty in Quebec. As a former Quebecer from 
Montreal, I am very troubled to see that businesses and jobs 
continue to flee that province.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As Minister for International Trade, Roy MacLaren worked very 
hard with the Prime Minister and Team Canada to develop our 
export trade potential. Missions to South Africa, South America 
and Asia were orchestrated under his leadership and under the 
leadership of the Prime Minister. These missions resulted in 
billions of dollars in trade deals over the short period of one and a 
half years.
<P>
	Given my experience in international business, I know many of 
these agreements moved from the concept stage to the contract 
signing stage as a result of these missions. These deals resulted in 
and will continue to provide thousands of jobs for Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	Equally important, the way has been paved for more business in 
the future. Canada's business community is to be congratulated for 
its leadership and performance in export trade, one of the real 
success stories of our economy.
<P>
	In Etobicoke North I plan to build on the Team Canada concept 
of building export trade and, equally important, working with all 
stakeholders in the community to build more jobs and a healthy 
economy. This means building partnerships with industry and 
labour as well as the Etobicoke city council and the provincial 
government.
<P>
	The constituents of Etobicoke North expect all their politicians, 
irrespective of political stripe or political agenda, to work together 
to improve the lives of residents of Etobicoke North. Citizens in the 
riding deserve this. I am encouraged by early signs which indicate 
that all stakeholders will be able to work together in a very 
constructive way.
<P>
	I invite the participation of all constituents in my riding to 
contribute ideas on how we can create more jobs and a healthy 
economy in Etobicoke North. Some individuals have already come 
forward with some very excellent ideas.
<P>
	I hope the Ontario government will seize the moment and 
harmonize the provincial sales tax with the federal GST. No 
province will benefit more from harmonization than Ontario. 
Ontario could harmonize at a rate of 14 per cent and reduce the 
sales tax by 1 per cent without losing any revenue. More economic 
potential in the province and in my riding could be unleashed and 
our businesses would be more competitive, which would mean 
more jobs. In my opinion jobs are the best social program.
<P>
	I realize the task at hand is not an easy one. In Canada, thanks to 
the hard work of the finance minister, our economic fundamentals 
are coming together in a very positive way. We are getting the 
deficit under control, interest rates are low and short term interest 
rates in Canada today are lower than those in the United States. 
This trend is also apparent with long term interest rates. These 
factors create an unprecedented opportunity for investment flowing 
into the country.
<P>
	In Etobicoke North we have some incredible strengths which we 
can build on. We have Pearson International Airport nearby. We 
have the 401 highway which runs through the riding. We have 
quality industrial land, a qualified workforce and a number of high 
technology companies.
<P>
	We know from the extensive work done in the area of 
international competitiveness that those jurisdictions which have 
the most qualified and knowledgeable workforces will attract the 
industries of the future, which will provide permanent high paying 
jobs. In Etobicoke North we already have a head start with an 
abundance of companies and workers on the leading edge of 
various technologies like aerospace, advanced engineering and 
health and life sciences, to name a few.
<P>
	The government in the recent throne speech and budget 
recognized the value of innovation. We have  committed ourselves 
to supporting industrial innovation and research and development. 
In 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1947"> 1947 </A></B>
<P>
addition to setting a positive business climate, this is a very 
legitimate and necessary role for government to play.
<P>
	We need only look at international competition to realize 
governments around the world support and encourage their high 
technology industries. We must do the same in Canada if we are to 
compete internationally. I am very pleased we are actively and 
aggressively doing so.
<P>
	Herein lies the opportunity for Etobicoke North. By supporting 
industrial innovation in my riding we can continue to develop our 
leading edge companies. I have already launched such an initiative. 
I am very confident that in my riding by working together and by 
working hard we can collectively build a stronger economy and 
create more jobs.
<P>
	I also realize the importance of the many other businesses, both 
small and large, in Etobicoke North that are not necessarily high 
tech companies. I pledge to work closely with them also. Given the 
rapidly changing international marketplace, some of these 
companies are adjusting to these new realities and face difficult 
challenges also.
<P>
	The initiative I have put in motion in Etobicoke North involves 
bringing industry leaders in the riding together to assess our 
strengths and identify areas in which we can improve. We will 
assess what impediments or constraints there are to economic 
growth in our riding.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We will look at so-called industrial clusters in Etobicoke North. 
The Quebec government, among others, has greatly benefited from 
this economic development tool, which led to the emergence of 
Silicon Valley in California.
<P>
	The city of Ottawa is a role model for all of us. For decades, it 
was little more than a government town. There were other 
industries, but the pillar of the economy was the federal 
government.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	Look at all that has been achieved since then. We have become 
Silicon Valley North. A booming industrial cluster grew up around 
computer hardware and software and telecommunications, right 
here in Ottawa.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We can produce the same results in Etobicoke North, not 
necessarily computer hardware or software, but perhaps in other 
clusters such as engineering, biotechnology, life sciences or other 
service sectors.
<P>
	The recently concluded open skies agreement between Canada 
and the United States could open many economic doors for us in 
our ridings if we have the courage and the goodwill to work 
together.
<P>
	We seem to have a structural unemployment problem in Canada 
and throughout the world. Countries like France, Germany and 
Italy are facing the same challenge. We need to reflect on what is 
causing this. While I do not pretend to be a labour market expert or 
an industrial economics expert, I have reached some conclusions of 
my own.
<P>
	We know technology is having an impact on unemployment 
levels. We cannot fight this. In an ironic sense we need to 
encourage it. As someone who supports the need for our natural 
resource industries to add more value in Canada, I am continually 
amazed by those who will not acknowledge that many value added 
initiatives reduce job levels because they are capital intensive. 
Often value added initiatives replace labour with advanced 
technology, replacing people with machines, but pursue value 
added we must because this strategy produces more wealth for all 
Canadians.
<P>
	Labour is priced like any other good or service, and if labour is 
too expensive business shifts its emphasis to other alternatives. In 
the early 1990s in Canada our productivity was low. We were 
losing our international competitiveness. Since that time our 
productivity has improved considerably to a point where this is no 
longer an issue. Economists today are focusing on total factor 
productivity, not just labour productivity, because to be 
competitive business must optimize its uses of all the factors of 
production, labour, plants and equipment, technology and financial 
capital.
<P>
	We are doing well in this regard and labour productivity is very 
much a part of this improved performance, but these developments 
do not necessarily produce jobs. In addition to technological 
influences on the job market there are many other subtle changes 
occurring that impact on this; for example, the growth in the 
services sector and more part time work of all descriptions.
<P>
	I believe the real impediment for job growth at this time in 
Canada is a lack of consumer confidence. Consumers are not 
spending. Our export growth has been phenomenal thanks to the 
efforts of Team Canada, but consumer confidence is lacking. When 
consumers do not spend, factories do not expand, new factories do 
not get built and the service economy suffers also. Why are 
consumers not spending?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I think the reason why consumers are not spending is because 
they are unemployed or unsure they will be able to keep their jobs. 
Similar factors are at work around the world. What can we do? I 
think we must show the way. Our economy is not big enough to 
exert much influence on that of other countries, but we can improve 
the situation here at home. How can we do so?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1948"> 1948 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I will be concentrating my efforts in Etobicoke North. If all 
members did the same in their ridings, the cumulative effect would 
be substantial. What role can the federal government or an 
individual member of Parliament play? Cynics would say there is 
no role for us. I say the opposite. I would not have sought public 
office if I did not believe I could make a difference. The same can 
be said for all of us, I am sure.
<P>
	Am I talking about a large interventionist role for the federal 
government? Definitely not. I believe in the wisdom of the markets 
but I also know that from time to time markets can fail. As a 
member of Parliament I will play the role of a catalyst to bring 
industry, labour and governments together in Etobicoke North. I 
will make businesses in the riding aware of the support the federal 
government can offer in the areas of technology and innovation.
<P>
	I will also be working closely with the schools in my riding and 
other excellent educational institutions in Etobicoke North such as 
Humber College. Through this work I hope to support education 
and skills development for young Canadians and youth 
employment. Young Canadians in Etobicoke North and throughout 
Canada need hope for the future. I commit myself to work with 
them.
<P>
	Last week I had the honour to present the Prime Minister's 
award recognizing teacher excellence in mathematics, technology 
and science to Mr. Larry Tracey at the Elms junior middle school in 
Etobicoke North. These pockets of excellence need to be replicated 
and recognized across Canada because students are our leaders of 
tomorrow.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	What role can industry play to address the structural 
unemployment we are now facing? As I said earlier, I believe the 
federal government can create the policy and business environment 
that is conducive to business investment activity. This I believe we 
are doing.
<P>
	By 1997-98 our government will have achieved the initial deficit 
target of 2 per cent of GDP, one of the lowest if not the lowest of all 
industrialized nations. We are going about this task in a determined 
and responsible way. I can say from my experience in management 
and government that the pace with which we are proceeding 
reflects an understanding that when we deal with budget reductions 
of this magnitude, what we are really doing is reinventing 
government. Reinventing government if it is to be done in a 
responsible and caring way, cannot be done in one or two years.
<P>
	The federal government can also assist business in areas such as 
technology and innovation as I said earlier. Governments alone 
cannot create lasting jobs. Only the private sector can do that. I am 
very proud to have worked in the private sector and I believe I 
understand  the demands on business and the competitive 
environment in which they operate.
<P>
	Business acknowledged in the 1960s and 1970s that it also had a 
social responsibility. These responsibilities first manifested 
themselves in areas such as corporate philanthropy, investment in 
human resources training and development, environmental 
protection, information disclosure and other areas such as those.
<P>
	Canadian business has responded so well to the new realities in 
the past. I would ask business leaders in Canada: Are we focused 
exclusively on the pursuit of shareholder value and enhanced share 
prices to the exclusion of some other very important corporate 
responsibilities, such as the responsibility to people and 
communities? How many more times do we need to hear about a 
company that has downsized, right sized, re-engineered or 
restructured with resulting massive layoffs or job cuts all at a time 
of record corporate profits?
<P>
	How many executives today remember that when they were at 
university an undergraduate degree paved the way to a job in 
corporate Canada? For the younger executives the requirement 
may have ratcheted up to a masters degree. Today there are 
countless young Canadians who have more formal education than 
that, yet they cannot find jobs.
<P>
	I ask executives in Etobicoke North, and throughout Canada for 
that matter, to consider the following questions: How rational and 
balanced are your corporate human resource policies through the 
medium and long term? How could you productively put people to 
work to grow your business? As a member of your community, 
could your company be doing more to give people a chance to 
demonstrate their value to your business?
<P>
	All of us in the House understand the business imperative of the 
bottom line. I recognize that industry is not one big social program. 
Many companies however are re-examining their staff cutback 
policies and are looking at ways to develop and grow their 
businesses. A number of business analysts have concluded that 
large wholesale staff reductions have generally not produced the 
winning results that companies may have expected.
<P>
	The industry I am very familiar with for example, the forest 
products industry, through the Forest Sector Advisory Council is 
working closely with the federal government exploring ways in 
which even more jobs can be created in this industry. It is 
encouraging to learn also that a major Canadian bank has recently 
launched a program designed to provide mentoring, business 
support and loans to young Canadian entrepreneurs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am confident that businesses will rise up to the challenges we 
all face as Canadians and that, like Team Canada, we can all work 
together to build the future.  Like public authorities, unions, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1949"> 1949 </A></B>
<P>
interest groups and citizens, businesses must help in tackling the 
task ahead.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	For these reasons I will support and I urge all members in the 
House to support the budget implementation bill before us. 
Implementing the budget will allow the federal government to play 
its rightful role in the jobs and growth agenda, building quality and 
permanent jobs for all Canadians now and for the future.

	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened carefully to what our colleague from Ontario said. I think 
this was his maiden speech in this House. My congratulations. I 
would, however, like to comment on some of his remarks. I think 
that he is right when he says that good government should be 
restored, it should be. Today more than ever, we need very good 
government, especially when those in power make promises that 
they do not keep.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	He raised another point: economic difficulties resulting from 
political instability. But he failed to discuss the problem of the debt 
and the deficit, the economic raiding that has been going on for so 
long in Quebec and mismanagement, proof of which we now have. 
While we, in Quebec, have managed to harmonize the GST with 
our sales tax without getting a penny in compensation from Ottawa, 
the federal government is about to set up the same system in 
eastern Canada at a cost of $1 billion.
<P>
	For the longest time, and particularly since the early 1970s, 
billions have been devoted to building symbols of Canadian unity, 
without getting anywhere. But again, they always forget to mention 
this.
<P>
	There is simple explanation: Quebec is almost always 25 years 
ahead of the pack. It was evident in the free trade debate and today 
again concerning the harmonization of the GST and the PST. 
Quebec has been asking for many years already that the federal 
government's spending power be capped, duplication and overlap 
eliminated and powers decentralized to the provinces. It is starting 
to happen now. More and more the other provinces are asking for 
the same thing. Unfortunately, Quebec has moved ahead again and 
now wants economic sovereignty. Every province will eventually 
have to become politically and economically sovereign if we want 
this debt problem to be resolved.
<P>
	I would like my hon. colleague to tell me something. Soon, by 
1997-98, the debt will be $600 billion, $50 billion of which will 
just be in interest charges. If $50 billion did not have to be paid out 
in interest charges each year and could be used to create jobs 
instead, would we not be short of unemployed instead of short of 
money right now? Would the unemployment problem not be  
resolved must faster this way than the way the federal government 
is going about it right now?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cullen:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member covered a number of 
points.
<P>
	My information is that we have been re-engineering the federal 
government and the operations of the federal government for some 
time and with great success. The federal government has had an 
operating surplus for a few years. That operating surplus is going to 
continue to grow.
<P>
	I agree with the member that we need to get at the debt. As the 
member knows, the only way to reduce the debt is to attack the 
deficit. Until we can put our budget into a surplus position, we will 
not be reducing the debt.
<P>
	What we have here is a phenomenon of governments of all 
description. Looking at the budget situation the province of Quebec 
is in and looking from province to province, over the years we have 
made the mistake of spending beyond our means. We are now 
trying to come to grips with that.
<P>
	The answer does not lie in reducing expenditures at a rate that 
does not allow for the infrastructures of government and the 
delivery of services which impact on people who are in need. We 
should not try to solve a problem that has developed over 15 or 20 
years in two or three years. I agree with the member that we need to 
attack the debt and redeploy those resources to programs. To do 
that, we need to reduce our deficit.
<P>
	In terms of the deficit and the debt situation, the financial 
markets basically invest capital in our country. I do not believe we 
need to necessarily take all our cues from the financial markets, but 
they are very important to listen to. The budget direction we are 
heading in has been endorsed by the markets which is reflected in 
the interest rates this country now has.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	Again I would say that the only impediment to growth and 
investment in Canada is trying to bring some stability to the 
politics of Quebec. Hearing Bloc members in this House from time 
to time, perhaps other Canadians are as concerned as I am when I 
hear how Quebec has been mistreated, the errant child who cannot 
get a fair deal.
<P>
	I suppose that is the mandate of the member's party, but if we are 
going to try to build a country and move forward, certainly from 
my perspective and political agenda this is not constructive. It does 
not allow us to move forward. I would hope to hear more on how 
we can build together and less on how Quebec is aggrieved from 
time to time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member said he would not have sought his seat if he did not believe 
he could make a difference. Seeing as he ran for the Liberal Party, 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1950"> 1950 </A></B>
<P>
how does he feel about the fact  that on Bill C-31 which he is 
speaking to and which was introduced to the House just yesterday, 
the government has chosen to bring in closure? In other words, it is 
ending democracy. Can he justify that for us?
<P>
	Surely if the member thought he could make a difference he 
must have thought the Liberals were going to be democratic and 
not autocratic in the way they have shown themselves to be. Does 
he have any comments about that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cullen:</B> Mr. Speaker, the decision to institute closure is not 
my decision but I do support it because to my mind our government 
has a positive and constructive agenda and program to put in place. 
All of us, as Canadians, expect our government to do something. If 
we sit in this House and debate forever, what are we doing for 
Canadians who put us in this House to try to improve things?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We will now move to statements by members.

	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in July 1995, the

Repentigny. 
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois condemned this illogical decision, since the 
CEC in Repentigny had to rent premises to meet the needs of its

asked for the submission of letters of interest regarding the lease of

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in an 
April 15 memo, the commissioner for Canada's prisons ordered 
universal distribution of bleach kits for inmates.
<P>
	Each inmate will now receive a bottle of bleach and instructions 
on how to properly clean needles and syringes used for injecting, 
tattooing and body piercing. This is ludicrous. Injection of illicit 
drugs is a Criminal Code offence. More, the commissioner's 
directive states that syringes and drug paraphernalia are prison 
contraband and, therefore, must be seized.
<P>
	On one hand, the commission's office promotes a program 
which encourages inmates to break the law and on the other hand, 
the commissioner intends to arm prisons with bleach and needle 
usage, both potential weapons to be used against other inmates and 
prison staff.
<P>
	Rank and file prison guards state the obvious. Either 
Correctional Service Canada bureaucrats are incompetent or they 
have lost complete and total control of the administration of 
Canada's prison system, or both.

Speaker, today is Canada Book Day. As a self-confessed 
bookworm, I am proud of the government's record in promoting 
literacy, a prerequisite to full participation in Canada Book Day.
<P>
	We promised in the red book to restore the national literacy 
program. Not only has this been done, but the Prime Minister has 
also appointed a minister responsible for literacy. Under her able 
leadership, the national literacy program has been restored and 
many Canadians are on their way to acquiring the literacy skills 
needed to participate fully in the workplace and in society.
<P>
	It takes more than government policy and initiatives to 
implement this however. Tribute must also be paid to the thousands 
of volunteers across Canada who show their commitment to the 
cause of literacy by working with their local literacy groups.
<P>
	This being National Volunteer Week, I can think of no better 
time to acknowledge the efforts of the Saskatoon Literacy 
Coalition. Each year, volunteers like Eleanor  Charman and Ruth 
Thompson, and many others, organize a fundraising spelling bee in

<P>
	When I was mayor of Saint John, the citizens played a major role 
in the development of that project. Thirty-eight senior staff 
members from Point Lepreau II and their families from greater 
Saint John moved to Cernavoda, Romania where they used their 
expertise to build the reactor to the same specifications as Point 
Lepreau II, the most modern and efficient Candu reactor in the 
world, which is located in my riding.
<P>
	Hundreds of Romanians from Cernavoda travelled to Saint John 
where they were trained at Point Lepreau on how to run a Candu 
reactor. Throughout this project the people of Saint John and 
Quebec performed tremendous outreach in Cernavoda as they built 
a community centre and a day care centre. The Church of England 
built a hospital for babies born with AIDS that were abandoned.
<P>
	There is a need for even greater outreach. I want to thank the

<P>

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister stubbornly defended the agreement 
with the maritimes yesterday, by claiming to have met his 
commitments, despite the fact that the Minister of Finance, 
accompanied by the Minister of Revenue, apologized for being 
unable to follow through on the Liberals' promise to scrap the GST.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. How are we to interpret 
the attitude of the Prime Minister, who dismisses his Minister of 
Finance with a wave of his hand, although as everyone agrees the 
minister simply acted with integrity acknowledging the Liberals' 
mistake with the GST?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I do not think the Minister of Finance and I are in 
disagreement. The Minister of Finance is carrying out the Liberal 
Party's program, as it appears on page 22 of the red book in English 
and on page 20 in French.
<P>
	He said, obviously, and I agree with him, that he would have 
preferred we proceed more quickly. He thought a system could be 
set up right away and more easily. However, we have chosen to go 
the route of co-operating with the provinces.
<P>
	At this point we have the agreement of four provinces, and we 
hope that the other provinces will join with us, because it will ease 
things for consumers. For companies and people in business, it will 
be a lot easier, and we will have a harmonized tax all across the 
country.
<P>
	I think the hon. Leader of the Opposition should read the 
statement by the Quebec finance minister, Mr. Landry, on this 
subject.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on December 10, 1991, the Prime Minister said, when he 
was the Leader of the Opposition, and I quote: ``People will believe 
in us when we say we are going to eliminate the GST''. A little 
further on, he spoke of his government: ``Ours will be an honest 
government that will call a spade a spade, and people will believe 
in it''.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister realize that the crisis of confidence in 
his government currently brewing across Canada arises from his 
own words as Leader of the Opposition and that the only way to 
re-establish any sort of confidence would be to follow the example 
of the Minister of Finance and the Deputy Prime Minister and 
apologize to Canadians?
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have just said we would have preferred a simpler system, 
more easily and quickly put in place. This is what the Minister of 
Finance has said as well.
<P>
	I am not about to apologize, when I can rise in the House, pick up 
a text-one I have read here seven or eight times-in which we 
said the solution was a tax harmonized with the provinces, which 
would bring in the same revenues, because the government cannot 
afford to lose revenues right now.
<P>
	This is just what we told our fellow Canadians we would do. I 
make no apologies for doing what is in the red book.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, with the Prime Minister hiding behind the red book since 
yesterday, are we to understand that, in future, the contents of the 
red book take precedence over the words of the Prime Minister?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister is reiterating what is in the red book, 
so there is no problem. We drew up a detailed political program. 
We worked on it for months and months. We chose a text we wrote 
ourselves. There is no discrepancy between the red book, myself 
and the Minister of Finance, because the member who worked with 
me on the red book is now the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we will scrap the GST-those were the words of the 
Prime Minister during the 1993 campaign. The Liberal government 
has made the unilateral decision to commit more than 90 per cent 
of the Canadian population to a semblance of GST reform, one 
which will be very costly, far more than the $961 million called for 
in the agreement.
<P>
	British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario 
and Quebec were not consulted, but they will pay for this 
outrageous cosmetic action taken in a pretence of meeting the 
commitment on which the Prime Minister and the Liberal Party of 
Canada have reneged.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance admit that he has gone beyond the 
usual mechanisms of consultation to commit all Quebecers and all 
Canadians to a politically motivated compensation payment to the 
maritimes of close to $1 billion, without anyone having any say 
whatsoever on the matter?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1955"> 1955 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
we have had numerous discussions with the ministers of finance 
in the other provinces concerning harmonization of the sales taxes. 
We have made offers, not only to the three provinces who 
accepted, but also to Prince Edward Island, Manitoba and 
Saskatchewan. We have held discussions with the other provinces 
to explain the reasons why the formula applied to this or that one.
<P>
	We used exactly the same approach as when we passed on to 
Quebec $120 million for the Atlantic groundfish strategy. We used 
exactly the same approach when we passed on to Quebec $75 
million after elimination of the freight subsidy. The federal 
government accepted its responsibilities for a very great structural 
change.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if they want to keep talking about the GST, let us talk 
about it. When the GST was harmonized, Quebec did not see a red 
cent. That is the reality.
<P>
	What is being asked of the Minister of Finance today is not all 
that difficult. He is being asked to stay on the path of integrity, the 
integrity he has shown this week, in acknowledging that this 
agreement with the maritimes on the GST will cost far more to 
Quebecers and to Canadians than the $961 billion in compensation 
projected, for under the agreement, equalization will kick in 
automatically after four years, so the government's political deal 
will continue to be a costly one.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member does not, unfortunately, understand how the 
equalization system works. It depends on fiscal capacity, not the 
taxes collected by a province, but its fiscal capacity.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	So, right at the beginning, there will be a slight drop in 
equalization payments to the Atlantic provinces. Eventually, with 
the growth of economic activity and with job creation, there will be 
another drop. This is good for the Atlantic economy. The hon. 
member is, unfortunately, in error.
<P>
	I would like to quote Mr. Landry, the Quebec Minister of 
Finance. From a strictly taxation point of view, speaking of the 
harmonization with the Atlantic provinces, Mr. Landry said: ``This 
is good news, because more provinces will have a VAT in future''.

	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	The testimony before the Somalia inquiry makes it quite clear 
that General Boyle knew about his department's plans to tamper 
with, alter and destroy  documents related to the Somalia affair. 
This latest testimony seriously undermines the minister, who time 
after time has defended Boyle in the House.
<P>
	Will the minister now agree to ask General Boyle to stand down 
until the Somalia inquiry determines his role in this cover-up?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have 
covered this issue a number of times in the past couple of weeks.
<P>
	I will not comment on any evidence presented at the inquiry. I 
will not engage in any public debate. The inquiry is to determine 
the truth of all the facts presented to it and all the evidence. It will 
do this in short order.
<P>
	With respect to the chief of defence staff, he certainly is doing 
his job. He is doing it well and he will continue to do his job. I ask 
the hon. member to allow the Chief of defence staff the courtesy all 
Canadians expect, which is to allow him to go to the commission 
and to give his position.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the minister does not want to comment. That is fine 
because, quite frankly, Canadians have no confidence in anything 
the minister says anyway.
<P>
	The minister tried to distance himself from senior officials' 
attempts to cover up Somalia documents. Yet a staff officer for the 
Minister of National Defence was part of the Somalia working 
group.
<P>
	It is inconceivable to Canadians that the minister was not briefed 
about the scheme hatched by the public affairs branch of his 
department to alter Somalia documents and obstruct access to 
information requests.
<P>
	What did the minister know about this attempted cover-up? 
When did he know it? Was he a pawn or a player?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, by the tone, 
demeanour and substance of the hon. member's question he 
certainly is not a player in the House for reliable questioning.
<P>
	The subset of hearings over the next couple of weeks will deal 
with these the questions of the public affairs matter. Every question 
the hon. member has posed in the House will be answered in the 
appropriate way at the commission before those impartial 
commissioners. That is where Canadians expect to get the answers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Minister of National Defence has placed himself 
right in the middle of the Somalia scandal.
<P>
	The minister's department altered and destroyed documents on 
his watch. The minister recommended a chief of defence staff who 
was, by his own admission, aware of the plan to deliberately 
tamper with evidence.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1956"> 1956 </A></B>
<P>
	The minister's own staff officer was part of the Somalia 
working group. It is time the minister came clean with Canadians. 
The Minister of National Defence is responsible to Parliament for 
these errors in judgment. Will he do the honourable thing and 
resign?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was worried 
because the hon. member has not asked me to resign in the last few 
days. I took that to mean something.
<P>
	Again I have to assert that the only thing I am in the middle of is 
getting at the truth. The government wants the truth in this matter. 
We have established the inquiry. We have taken our responsibility 
by establishing the inquiry. We have a terms of reference which has 
never been challenged, which talks in the language used by the hon. 
member, ``cover-up'', ``destruction of documents''. All of that is in 
the terms of reference. The commission has the terms of reference 
to do the job, to get the answers. It will do it and it will do it soon.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	We learned that the chief of defence staff approved a plan to 
tamper with documents critical to the Somalia inquiry. His lawyer 
excused General Boyle, citing his failing memory, and I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``When you are talking about something which happened many 
years ago, your memory may not be as clear''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Fortunately, his lawyer added: ``He now remembers''. The 
documents turned over to the commission allowed the general to 
recover his memory.
<P>
	Considering that the military police's report that was given to the 
commission exonerated General Boyle, is the minister going to ask 
the military police to alter its report in the light of these new facts?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I have already 
answered these questions, but I must point out that it is not proper 
for me, as a minister, to comment on the testimonies heard daily by 
the commission. It is not appropriate.
<P>
	The military police has reopened its investigation in view of the 
new documents which surfaced. I think this is a normal process.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The military police have reopened the investigation. Obviously 
they had an obligation to this, as did the information commissioner. 
All these matters will be discussed at the inquiry. That is the forum 
for the answers.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, given the seriousness of the allegations regarding General 
Boyle, does the minister not think that he should immediately 
relieve the general of his duties, at least until the inquiry is 
completed?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, once again, I 
have already answered this question and the answer is no.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
October 18, 1993 the Deputy Prime Minister promised Canadians 
on national television: ``If the GST is not abolished under a Liberal 
government I will resign''.
<P>
	Today in a press conference she said: ``Making a fast lipped 
comment in the middle of an election campaign should not put me 
in a position to resign''.
<P>
	Which way is it? If you make a promise, you make; do not break 
it. Will the Deputy Prime Minister resign right now?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, she has said she does not intend to resign because we are 
meeting the commitments in the red book, and she campaigned on 
the red book.
<P>
	If we want to quote what people said in the past, after what the 
hon. member for Beaver River did yesterday, I quote what she said 
in 1991 or 1992: ``The behaviour in the Chamber just drives me 
wild. I taught grade eight for too many years to think this sort of 
behaviour is cute''. I guess she is now in grade seven.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I stand 
by what I have said and I stand by what I have done. There is one 
place for the red book because it simply has not been completed.
<P>
	Yesterday the Prime Minister said the Liberals have kept 75 per 
cent of the red book promises. That is not true. We have gone 
through the numbers. Of 157 promises made in the red book, 37 
have been fulfilled; 23.5 per cent. That is shameful.

	On the campaign trail the Deputy Prime Minister told the voters

personally and very directly that if the GST is not abolished I will 
resign''. It is fine that she thinks I may throw things around, but I 
know one thing: the voters of Hamilton East will throw her out in 
the next election. They want to know, will she resign?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I believe I was right a minute ago when I said she was in 
grade seven. She does not know how to add. She should look at 
page 111 of the red book. It is all there and it is very simple; all the 
cuts we said we were to make and all the programs we were to 
implement.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	The marine shipping industry is very important to Montreal's 
economy. Today, the Conseil régional de développement de l'Île de 
Montréal, the City of Montreal, the minister of state responsible for 
Montreal and the Montreal Chamber of Commerce have joined in 
condemning the user fee policy the minister intends to apply to 
Coast Guard services.
<P>
	Does the minister not agree that imposing a fee structure without 
first assessing its economic impact could have a devastating effect 
on Montreal's marine industry, which creates more than 14,000 
direct and indirect jobs and generates $1.25 billion in economic 
benefits?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I agree that all the shipping industries are very 
important to the economy of Canada.
<P>
	What we are merely asking is that we expect them to pay a user 
fee for public facilities provided by the public at taxpayers' 
expense. This user fee is reasonable. It is less than one tenth of one 
per cent of the total value of the cargoes. It is less than 3 per cent of 
voyage costs. It is less than 10 per cent of the services provided.
<P>
	While there are some differences about how the fee should be 
paid, it is safe to say most of the industries that have been consulted 
and that have appeared before the standing committee, while they 
do not particularly want to pay the fees, are prepared to pay their 
fair share of the public cost.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> I will give the minister a 
second chance to answer my question, Mr. Speaker. Does the 
minister recognize that, by imposing user fees on aid to marine 
navigation, he runs the risk of diverting marine traffic to ports on 
the east coast of the U.S. and on the Mississippi, at the expense of 
the port of Montreal, thus undermining its role as a North 
American shipping hub?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, there are many other considerations involved. The 
information at this time is that the 10 per cent recovery, which 
amounts to $20 million across Canada, will not divert traffic to any 
other port.
<P>
	Most of our trading partners have similar fees. Is the hon. 
member saying he would like the big companies not to pay the 10 
per cent of the share the taxpayers actually provide when other 
organizations and smaller people are paying their fair share? I do 
not believe he is suggesting that.

	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
Tuesday we witnessed the embarrassing spectacle of the finance 
minister grovelling for forgiveness for the government's broken 
election promise to kill the GST.
<P>
	Today the Prime Minister is standing up in the House and saying 
``we did not break our promise'', suggesting somehow that all 
along they had gone to the electors with the promise to bribe the 
Atlantic premiers with $1 billion and to create a GST super tax in 
three provinces.
<P>
	Who is telling the truth, the finance minister or the Prime 
Minister?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the statements I made the other day stand. The statements made by 
the Prime Minister today stand. The statements made by the 
Deputy Prime Minister stand.
<P>
	The government speaks with one voice. The issue is how many 
voices does the Reform Party speak with?
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	Let us talk about the substance of the issue. While the Reform 
Party plays its little games, the Canadian people are out there 
speaking. Who supports what the government has done? The 
Canadian Manufacturers' Association, the Retail Council of 
Canada, the Consumers' Association of Canada, the Canadian 
Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Canadian Automobile 
Dealers Association, and more to come in the supplementary.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleague, may I gently caution you that the 
use of the word ``bribe'' when you use it  government to govern-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1958"> 1958 </A></B>
<P>
ment is close but we must not use the word ``bribe'' when 
describing one member's actions toward anyone else.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there 
are a lot of different stories over there. I suggest there is a major 
Liberal fib fest happening right now. If this whole issue is called 
harmonization, then I think a lot of Canadians are starting to feel 
the Liberals harmonized them real good at the last election.
<P>
	We know now that the Prime Minister personally told Maude 
Barlow in a private meeting before the 1993 election that he 
already knew his promise to kill the GST was a sham. Is it Liberal 
integrity to say one thing behind closed doors to Liberal insiders 
and to say the complete opposite in order to get elected?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
never has a more cruel blow been imposed on Maude Barlow than 
to be cited by a Reformer.
<P>
	Rather than go on, I will read the list of support at another time. 
Allow me to take the hon. member through the work we went 
through before coming to this solution.
<P>
	When we were in opposition we looked at a series of 
alternatives. There are a number of people here who supported a 
business transfer tax. I myself publicly supported a personal 
expenditure tax. Once we came into office the finance committee 
was set up and it looked at a multitude of alternatives.
<P>
	At the same time, the House may remember we made an offer to 
the provinces that would lower the rate and impose a flat tax which 
was rejected. There were public debates with the province of 
Ontario as to whether it would vacate the field or we would vacate 
the field.
<P>
	This government has left no stone unturned in its seeking of a 
better alternative to what we have come up with. In the end we 
came up with the alternative that we felt was the best thing for the 
Canadian people, public policy and job creation. We are proud of 
what we have done.

<P>
	The Mohawk community of Kanesatake, which elected James 
Gabriel as acting Grand Chief to replace Jerry Peltier, is now about 
to hold an election and correct the appalling economic situation 
caused in large part by Mr. Peltier. Unfortunately, the government's 
confused and indecisive attitude is not helping them.

claims, can the minister confirm to the Kanesatake community that 
he is finally ready to  acknowledge the results of the February 28 
election and to recognize Mr. Gabriel as acting Grand Chief of the 
Mohawk community of Kanesatake?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe I have answered this 
question once already.
<P>
	As the hon. member knows, in that First Nation, right now there 
are two people who purport to be chief. The first, Mr. Peltier, was 
elected. We spent almost $50,000 to have a reputable consulting 
firm come into Kanesatake for a three year period. The second 
person, Mr. Gabriel, referred to by the hon. member went in by 
petition supposedly a couple of months ago. At this stage I have to 
get some direction from justice. We may not even have the 
authority to remove Mr. Peltier.
<P>
<B>(1445)</B>
<P>
	It was said from the meeting that he had resigned. This is not 
correct. He sent me a letter saying he is still the chief. In fact until it 
is sorted out either in the court or hopefully by the people in the 
community, there are two chiefs in Kanesatake.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I fail to 
understand the minister's attitude. Why does the minister refuse to 
recognize the legitimacy of James Gabriel's election, when his 
colleague, the Deputy Prime Minister, does so in an April 17 letter 
to Grand Chief Gabriel? Even the Deputy Prime Minister 
recognizes him. Why does the minister in charge of this matter not 
recognize him, too?

applauding what in a sense is a tragedy.

	Mr. Gabriel writes to the Deputy Prime Minister and purports to 
be the chief. Her staff prepares a letter responding to him as the 
chief. That does not change what I have just said in this House

<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
put in place a range of adjustment tools such as the early retirement 
incentive, which provides a waiver of pension penalties for public 
service employees who are 50 and over with 10 years of service, 
and the early departure incentive, which facilitates through cash 
incentives the voluntary departure of employees in those 
departments which have been hardest hit by expenditure 
reductions.
<P>
	We have also established joint adjustment committees across the 
country in partnership with the unions. We have implemented a 
policy of alternates which permits a number of people who want to 
keep their jobs to change jobs with people who want to leave the 
public service.
<P>
	All in all, we have put into place a lot of measures which 
indicates that we want the downsizing to be done in a fair and 
equitable manner. Everybody has recognized this is what has 
happened.

	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
finance minister must have left off of his list of support the 
provinces of B.C., Ontario and Alberta. I guess he just missed 
them.
<P>
	I would like the government to listen to what the Atlantic 
Canadian business community is saying about the finance 
minister's attempt to create harmony in the tax system. He must 
have missed these quotes as well. Ernst &amp; Young: ``There is a 
quagmire here''. The Canadian Federation of Independent 
Business: ``You are better off leaving the stupid thing alone''. That 
is a good quote.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. If this is such a good deal 
for Atlantic Canada, Mr. Prime Minister, why does section 12 of 
the agreement allow for an increase in provincial taxes after the 
government's bribe money runs out?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Again, my colleague, would you withdraw the 
word ``bribe'' please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> I withdraw the word ``bribe'', 
Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Does the right hon. Prime Minister want to 
answer? A supplementary, the hon. member for Fraser Valley West.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
supplementary. They did not answer the first question so I will go 
to a supplementary.
<P>
	The finance minister on a talk show this morning said he was 
bailing out Atlantic Canada. That bailout is about $1 billion. That is 
$1 billion this country has to borrow in effect.
<P>
<B>(1450 )</B>
<P>
	This government has a deepening problem with misrepresenting 
the facts. Will the finance minister or the Prime Minister come 
clean and admit the truth that what they are really doing is bailing 
out the Deputy Prime Minister, the Prime Minister and all those

	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	On April 18, representatives of Canada signed an agreement 
with Russia allowing Canada to begin importing plutonium, a 
highly radioactive substance, for use as a fuel, for one thing, in 
Candu reactors, which in fact the government intends to sell 
increasingly outside the country.
<P>
	Would the Prime Minister not agree that importing plutonium 
originating in Russia is an extremely dangerous business, given the 
enormous health and environmental risks associated with the 
processing and handling of this highly unstable material?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we accepted the invitation from the Americans and the 
Russians to see whether we could use up their surplus plutonium, 
because they are about to dismantle missiles, which leaves 
plutonium to dispose of.
<P>
	As illegal trade in this element is also very dangerous, they have 
asked us if we could consider using up the plutonium to get rid of 
it. We replied that if we can do so safely, without damaging the 
ecology or creating health problems for anyone, that would be a 
contribution that Canada could make towards peace. Because if the 
plutonium is gone, then there is no longer a risk of it being traded 
illegally, among other things.
<P>
	We therefore agreed to do a feasibility study. We are also told 
that, in the form of MOX fuel, it can be transported with no risk. 
We are now conducting studies, and if it is completely safe, of 
course, we will be prepared to help with dismantling the missiles, 
thus reducing the risk of nuclear war.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is sad 
to note that the tokamak installation, specializing in research into 
pollution-free energy, is about to be closed, while plans are being 
made to import plutonium, a material that is highly dangerous to 
health and the environment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1960"> 1960 </A></B>
<P>
	Given that Canada already has problems getting rid of its 
nuclear waste safely, does the Prime Minister realize that by 
importing plutonium, he is solving nothing, and that, on the 
contrary, he will worsen the problem of getting rid of nuclear 
waste in Canada, which poses a real danger to the public?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what we want is to get rid of the plutonium. We want to 
see it used up, and we will see if it is possible.
<P>
	The Americans and the Russians came to us because we have 
developed a unique technology, the Candu reactor. Other 
experiments will be done in other countries. However, since Candu 
uses heavy water and natural uranium, this system would be the 
best to get rid of the plutonium.
<P>
	Obviously, if this cannot be done safely, without damage to the 
environment, it will certainly not be done, but we agreed to study 
the possibility. If we can do it, the Americans and the Russians 
would be very happy. In fact, the Americans are ready to pay us to 
dispose of it. But if we cannot do so safely, with no harm to the 
ecology, we will not go ahead.

	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the GST 
fiasco has left a sour taste in the mouths of Canadians who now feel 
betrayed by the government. The promise to scrap the GST was a 
cynical purposeful campaign trick. I am concerned that the next 
betrayal is looming on the horizon for seniors who will soon be 
facing massive cuts to the Canada pension plan.
<P>
<B>(1455 )</B>
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance admit that there is simply no way to 
secure the future of the Canada pension plan without taking another 
5 per cent or 10 per cent of workers' incomes or radically cutting 
benefits to seniors? Is his promise to protect seniors and taxpayers 
as hollow as his promise on the GST?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
two alternative options are being presented to Canadians in terms 
of the Canada pension plan.
<P>
	There is that put forward by the members of the Reform Party 
which is to effectively abolish the Canada pension plan and turn it 
into a super RRSP. That would result in pensions for the wealthiest 
in the country and no pensions for the poor. We categorically 
rejected that option.
<P>
	At the present time a federal-provincial commission is travelling 
across the country examining ways in which the Canada pension 
plan can be kept whole.
<P>
	The Canada pension plan obviously requires modification. 
However it is not in danger despite the  cataclysmic declarations of 
the Reform Party. Yes, there may well be increases in premiums 
and there may well be changes in benefits. However, the fact is that 
this government, and I also believe all of the provincial 
governments and the territories can assure young Canadians that 
the Canada pension plan will be there for them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, every time 
their policies are completely indefensible, the Liberals turn around 
and attack Reform.
<P>
	The only member of this House on the commission, who 
happens to be a Liberal member, is on record as saying that Canada 
pension plan premiums will have to be doubled to maintain the 
CPP. I think it is the government's intention to lead the citizens of 
Canada up the garden path and into the rose garden before the 
election and leave them in the stinkweed after the election, just like 
it did with the GST.
<P>
	I would like the Minister of Finance to confirm that we are 
talking massive changes to the premiums or massive cuts to CPP 
benefits.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the chief actuary has already stated that because previous 
governments going back a decade did not take proper action on the 
CPP, by the year 2030 if nothing is done, the premiums might well 
have to rise to 14 per cent or 15 per cent. It is precisely to avoid that 
tremendous burden which would be placed on payrolls that this 
government has taken early action. While there will be an increase 
in such premiums, it will not be of the kind projected by the chief 
actuary.
<P>
	On the earlier point, I apologize to the hon. member for 
comparing our policies to his, but every time we do it we look so 
good it is very hard to resist.

	<B>Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
week the Minister of National Revenue introduced 100 
improvements to the sales tax system.
<P>
	The notional sales tax as it applies to car sales has caused much 
confusion, problems and a real sense that it is unfair. How will the 
minister's sales tax changes correct this longstanding irritant to 
Canadian car buyers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member for Huron-Bruce raised two very 
important points.
<P>
	First, he recognizes that the government has just tabled a ways 
and means bill that presents to the Canadian public 100 proposals 
for improvements to the GST. That speaks directly to the concerns 
of the Canadian public.
<P>
	Second, he asked specifically about the notional import tax 
credit, which is the way the tax has been collected on  used cars. It 
has been so complex, so confusing, so frustrating for the Canadian 
public that we have changed it. From now on when a Canadian 
buys a new car and has a trade-in, GST will be paid on the 
difference only. That makes sense. It speaks directly to the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1961"> 1961 </A></B>
<P>
concerns of Canadians. It is proof that the government is 
committed to replacing the GST with a tax that is fairer to 
consumers.
<P>
<B>(1500)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Finance has said harmonization of the PST and GST in 
the Atlantic provinces will expand exports and create jobs. He did 
omit bring back the cod, but it was pretty close.
<P>
	The minister will recall that during the GST debate the 
government of the day tabled a number of documents 
substantiating its claims.
<P>
	Will the minister today table the studies that substantiate his 
contention that exports will rise as a result of harmonization and 
that jobs will expand?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am certainly prepared to make available to the hon. member the 
studies that will show what happens when one reduces the cost to 
business.
<P>
	Jim Moore of the Canadian Exporters Association, one of the 
experts in the field, said: ``Obviously it could [create jobs] when 
you are competing at a level where a 1 per cent difference on a 
product can make the difference between a sale and a non-sale''. 
He is basically saying it will increase our exports.
<P>
	The Canadian Federation of Independent Business and the 
Canadian Manufacturers Association say harmonization will 
enhance competitiveness for manufacturers and exporters as well 
as create a simpler and more efficient tax system.
<P>
	The bottom line from the CMA is: ``The net result of these 
changes will be more jobs and an overall increase in investment 
and business activity''.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-31, 
an act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in 
Parliament on March 6, 1996, be read the second time and referred 
to a committee, and on the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I quote 
from the speech of the Minister of Finance on March 6, 1996 to the 
House:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>What Canadians want is action and they want to see real progress. These are 
the standards that Canadians have set.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Seldom in our history have so many people experienced so much anxiety. 
Canadians feel our very way of life is at risk.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>They look at medicare and feel that it is threatened. They look at the pension 
system and wonder if it will be there in years to come. They consider the 
economy and worry that gale force winds of competition and change will carry 
away their jobs. Canadians think about their future, our youth, and ask what 
kind of opportunities will be left for them.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1505)</B>
<P>
	These are the damning words of the Minister of Finance to the 
House, from a government that has been in power now for two and 
a half years. Obviously the government does not have the answers, 
period.
<P>
	The hon. member for Etobicoke North confirmed these issues 
when he talked about unemployment and said we do not have 
answers. He talked about the various issues of concern of 
Canadians and continued to repeat the government line. 
Unfortunately when we listen to the government line it does not 
have answers.
<P>
	These things are important to Canadians. I quote from page 8 of 
the budget speech:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is our view that chronic deficits constitute a clear and present danger to this 
country-to our way of life and to our future.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1962"> 1962 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Chronic deficits put the disadvantaged at risk, because it is they who suffer 
when the financial strength of government is so weak it can no longer reach out to 
those in need.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Members may have noticed that in question period a few 
minutes ago I asked a question of the Minister of Finance to bring 
to the attention of all Canadians that the Canada pension plan is 
seriously at risk. That was acknowledged by a minister in his 
budget speech:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>First, the CPP must be put on a sound financial footing-and done so in a way 
that is sustainable, affordable and fair.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In the House we saw the Deputy Prime Minister stand and say 
how she is committed to standing behind seniors and the Canada 
pension plan. We have asked questions of the Minister of Human 
Resources Development and he has stood up in the House and said 
they stand four-square behind seniors. We have heard the Minister 
of Finance repeat the same rhetoric.
<P>
	When we look at the public accounts, page 1.16, we find the 
government has no liability, commitment or responsibility to pay 
seniors on Canada pension plan beyond the money already in the 
bank.
<P>
	This concerns me because the government has misled Canadians 
on the GST with rhetoric from the Deputy Prime Minister and 
others which has so often been pointed out in the House: ``We will 
scrap the GST. We will get rid of the GST''. When we ask them to 
deliver on their commitment they picked up a thing called the red 
book, and I believe it is page 22 that the Prime Minister has so 
frequently referred to. He says it was always that they would 
harmonize, replace and change, and with some smoke and mirrors 
give us something else that will cost us more.
<P>
	I am concerned for seniors because while the government said 
one thing before the election, it was a different thing after. While it 
held up the promise of improvement before the election, it hit 
people over the head with the continued GST and higher taxes after 
the election. I see the same thing looming once more for the 
Canada pension plan. The numbers are quite simple. The numbers 
are huge but they are simple.
<P>
	The Liberal member who is on the tour on the Canada pension 
plan is on record as saying Canada pension plan contributions 
should double and double soon, so we will not contribute 5 per cent 
of our income, we will contribute 10 per cent, double. We will be 
paying 5 per cent more into the Canada pension plan in order to 
protect seniors and they way they are currently receiving Canada 
pension.
<P>
	I do not think that it is strictly a case of increasing payments to 
maintain payments to seniors. I think there will be a trade-off here 
and we will see increased payments and at the same time there will 
be a decrease in benefits.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	That is the point I want Canadians to be aware of while the 
Minister of Finance keeps using euphemisms: ``We will fix the 
Canada pension plan. The Canada pension plan is in a little trouble. 
Maybe we will make a little increase in the payments and adjust the 
payments to the beneficiaries''.
<P>
	There will be a massive increase in payments. There could very 
well be a massive decrease in benefits. The sooner the Minister of 
Finance says that and gets it out in the public domain for people to 
decide the way they want to go the better.
<P>
	I have a real fear that from now until the next election we will 
see these little euphemisms: ``We will fix it. We need to have a 
little more cash in the kitty. We may have to tinker a little with the 
benefits''.
<P>
	The point is after the next election when the Liberals think they 
will be firmly ensconced on that side once more, they will drop a 
big hammer on the heads of Canadians, just as they have done on 
the GST where they dropped a hammer on Canadians again and 
said ``no relief from taxation, pay the GST forever more''.
<P>
	We will see the same thing with the Canada pension. We will see 
huge increases in payments. We will see great decreases in benefits 
after the election, and that is my concern. I want to get Canadians 
thinking about these things now. I want them to think about them 
before the next election and ask the government what it really 
intends to do because these euphemisms will lead people into 
thinking the government has it right when the government has it 
wrong.
<P>
	Part of the budget implementation rules and regulations being 
brought forward in this bill give me some cause for concern also. 
The bill intends to amend the Financial Administration Act, which 
would provide for the termination of employment in certain cases 
where government services are being transferred.
<P>
	I do not really have a problem with the termination of 
employment of the civil service where we are maybe transferring 
programs to the private sector. It does not concern me. It happens 
all the time. People in the private sector change jobs all the time.
<P>
	What does concern me is the way the government plays fast and 
loose with Canadian taxpayer money. Take a look at Nav Canada. 
Nav Canada is some new hybrid. The Liberals call it privatization 
but it is a not for profit monopoly with virtual taxation powers they 
have created. They have hived it off from government balance 
sheets and government records. They have created this new entity, 
Nav Canada.
<P>
	I think it is unique in Canadian corporate history because I have 
never heard of a not for profit enterprise that has billions of dollars 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1963"> 1963 </A></B>
<P>
in revenue. When you can go  to money markets and borrow $3 
billion and still call it not for profit I have a problem with that.
<P>
	I also have a problem with the way the government was able to 
manage the transfer of employees off the rolls of the civil service 
and on to the Nav Canada payroll. Somehow while these people 
were working on Friday, they kept their job, the same desk, the 
same telephone number, the same pencil on Monday morning. 
While there may be a new name on the paycheque they get at the 
end of the month, somehow we said they have lost their job and 
they are entitled to severance pay. We gave the people in the 
organization $200 million in severance pay and nobody lost their 
job.
<P>
	I scratched my head. You work on Friday, you work on Monday, 
same desk, same telephone number, same pencil, same job, same 
everything, but you got laid off? There was $200 million in 
taxpayer money to recognize you got laid off and it does not seem 
to fit.
<P>
	We are now to institutionalize that or put it into legislation, 
saying that is the way we want to do it. That is the least of my 
problems with regard to this bill.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	The bill goes on to say: ``In addition, amendments to that act 
would provide for exceptions to appropriations so that the unused 
portion of funds appropriated by Parliament does not lapse at the 
end of one year''.
<P>
	What is this? Is it that appropriations are no longer going to lapse 
at the end of a year? Is that what the bill states? I thought the whole 
parliamentary tradition was that this House appropriated funds for 
a department and said: ``This is the money you are going to get for 
one year and if it is not spent then it is not spent and if you need 
more for next year you come back to this House and ask for it''.
<P>
	The Liberals have now sneaked in some legislation which states: 
``the unused portion appropriated by Parliament will not lapse at 
the end of a year''. This House is losing control of the government. 
The government has lost control of the management of the country. 
I cannot understand why we do not have a full debate on that one 
issue alone. However, what do we find? Closure.
<P>
	This bill was introduced yesterday. We have closure today. We 
vote on it tomorrow and it becomes law on Monday morning.
<P>
	In the bill we find the tradition of hundreds of years of 
Parliament having control over the government out the window 
without even a mention.
<P>
	This government is trampling on the rights of this House. It is 
trampling on democracy when it thinks it is going to slip a few 
lines into this bill to eliminate the lapsing of funds so that it has to 
come back to this House every year for the money it needs to run 
the government.
<P>
	The bill continues on: ``As part of the restructuring of the public 
service, successor rights in the form of continued collective 
agreements and union representations will be introduced'', and so 
on. The Liberals are going to legislate rather than negotiate with 
the unions on how they are going to handle the transfer of civil 
servants into the private sector. I put the private sector in quotation 
marks because NavCan, by no stretch of the imagination, can be 
considered private sector. It is a not for profit monopoly with 
virtual taxation powers. All the government has done is taken it off 
the balance sheet and off the expenditure side of the government.
<P>
	No doubt the Minister of Finance is going to stand up here next 
year and boast about how expenditures of government have come 
down when all that he has done is drawn a line between the air 
navigation and said that it is no longer part of government and no 
longer part of its expenditures, even though we are still paying for 
it. He is also going to boast about how he is containing government 
expenditures. The point is that he is not. We have seen it time and 
time again as he manipulates the numbers and calls it a success.
<P>
	The President of the Treasury Board, every quarter, brings out a 
booklet telling us how he has met his target of reductions in the 
civil service. I know that in the next quarter the President of the 
Treasury Board is going to stand up in this House and boast about 
how he has once more met his target of reducing the civil service. 
However, 6,500 of this reduction just moved over into NavCan. 
Nobody lost his or her job. This is the type of smoke and mirrors 
that we get from this government. This is what Canadians need to 
know about because I do not think they really appreciate being led 
down the garden path in this way.
<P>
	The bill continues: ``Amendments to the Public Service 
Superannuation Act would facilitate the portability of pension 
values on an individual and a group basis and provide flexibility for 
the extension or termination of coverage of an entity and its 
employees under the act''.
<P>
	Maybe there should be portability. I think we should have some 
portability of all pensions. Careers are changing rapidly and many 
Canadians are changing jobs more frequently. It is important that 
this government address the important issue of portability of 
pensions in the private sector.
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	However, it has demonstrated no desire to help people in the 
private sector and every desire to legislate things for its own 
benefit. By introducing under the Public Service Superannuation 
Act portability of pensions allows the government to take large 
chunks of the cash sitting in the public service superannuation fund 
and set up a pre-funded pension plan for the NavCan employees so 
that their pension plan can continue unabated.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1964"> 1964 </A></B>
<P>
	Canadians out in the private sector who lose their jobs on Friday 
afternoon have to go out on Monday morning and find a job. After 
months of searching they find that there is no portability of their 
pension.
<P>
	These are the types of social issues that the government should 
be dealing with rather than the smoke and mirrors of legislation to 
allow it to bully the unions, to bully the civil servants and create 
these fictitious types of situations regarding the downsizing of the 
government.
<P>
	As I said, there is a much bigger issue concerning the pensions. I 
would have thought the government would have wanted to address 
it. It has not. The Minister of Finance has not. Everything has 
always been focused on what can the government do to let 
Canadians think it is addressing the issue when in fact it is not.
<P>
	Bill C-31 was introduced yesterday. The government moved 
closure on it today. How are we as parliamentarians and how are 
Canadians able to join in a debate about the finances of this 
country, about the management of this country, about the way the 
government tries to run this country when closure is invoked after 
one day? On the budget the Liberals threw out one of their own 
because he stood up and voted against the government. Now they 
are not prepared to even entertain debate by anyone in this House. 
Otherwise we might find embarrassing problems that are buried in 
this legislation. That is despicable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President 
of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for 
St. Albert is the Treasury Board critic and I thank him for his 
presentation.
<P>
	Since I have entered this House I have been disappointed with 
members on all sides when they say things just for the sake of 
saying them without any substance. I have had many discussions 
with the member for St. Albert. He is a fiscal manager. I wonder 
how he would do some of the things that are being done at Treasury 
Board.
<P>
	I will refer to a couple of things that the member spoke about. He 
spoke about appropriations. We have this form as members of 
Parliament. The Treasury Board brought that in awhile ago because 
members had a way of rushing out and spending a whole lot of 
money at the end of the year.
<P>
	Whenever projects are started they do not begin and end at a 
fiscal time. We are trying to be innovative. We are trying to get 
government right. There is no way we are not going to have value 
for dollar. That is the reason that there are appropriations.
<P>
	The member talked about NavCan. He said these people still 
have their jobs after we said we would get rid of jobs. I ask him 
what he would rather do. This department is so important that it is 
an essential service. It has to do with people coming into the 
country in  aircraft. Even when they are problems with labour, they 
cannot strike because it becomes very dangerous. During strikes 
they have to be there in case there are emergencies. There are a lot 
of emergencies in the air with aircraft flying over a country with 
military operations and so on. So NavCan is extremely important.
<P>
	It was a great negotiated policy of the government. It has been 
moved out of the government to an agency that is going to do a 
better job. The hon. member said that small business could do a 
good job.
<P>
<B>(1525 )</B>
<P>
	He said that we brought in measures in the legislation on which 
we will not negotiate. I want to say to the member that we 
absolutely want to negotiate. However, we certainly do not want a 
final arbitrator which will take the monetary commitment away 
from this legislative body.
<P>
	We are being fiscally responsible. If he were in our place he 
certainly would not want to bring someone in from left field to 
make a wage settlement which the Government of Canada would 
have no alternative but to accept.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thought we were going to hear real 
explanations for the problems I raised in this bill.
<P>
	He started off by asking what I would do as the treasury board 
critic. The first thing I would not do is introduce closure on the bill 
the day after it was introduced. These issues need to be debated. 
That is what we are here for. That is what the government is 
stopping.
<P>
	He tells us about this great and wonderful negotiated thing called 
NavCan. Yesterday afternoon in the Standing Committee on Public 
Accounts, the Auditor General of Canada, an officer of this House, 
expressed grave and serious reservations about the accountability 
of NavCan. It has been hived off into some kind of not for profit 
institution. It is not a crown corporation. It is some new hybrid and 
we do not know exactly what it is. The Auditor General of Canada, 
our watchdog on the finances of the country, has been shut out. He 
does not have the authority to look at NavCan. Neither has anybody 
else been given the authority to look at NavCan from an 
accountability point of view. If the auditor general, who is an 
officer of the House, is concerned, the House should be concerned.
<P>
	That is the type of thing which the government is pushing 
through without any debate. That is why I am concerned.
<P>
	NavCan is a disgrace of management. I am not talking about the 
employees. Unfortunately they are pawns. They were not even 
given a say. The government stood up one day and made an 
announcement that it was going to hive NavCan off and make it a 
not for profit agency. It is a billion dollar not for profit agency. The 
government  turned around and told NavCan: ``Go out to the open 
market, borrow $3 billion and give the government $1.5 billion to 
buy these assets''. Then the Minister of Finance can say: ``Look 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1965"> 1965 </A></B>
<P>
how the deficit is coming down. I have another $1.5 billion in cash 
from NavCan''.
<P>
	Accountability is the word. There is no accountability in what 
the government is doing. It is time it realized that Canadians will 
not put up with it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to inform you that I will be sharing my time with the 
hon. member for Carleton-Charlotte.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the 1996 budget follows through on the 
government's commitment to reduce the deficit in a sustained 
fashion. However, we should not forget that balancing the budget 
must never be the sole objective.
<P>
	Improving public finances should always be a means to reach the 
greater goal of lowering interest rates, creating jobs and ensuring 
Canada's prosperity and future. It must also allow us to continue to 
work on other priorities and issues which are dear to Canadians.
<P>
	It goes without saying that one of the top priorities is to maintain 
Canada's social program network. These programs have made 
Canada one of the most envied countries in the world. To reach that 
goal, as the Prime Minister promised, we must propose a long term 
funding framework for health services and social programs that 
will grow, while also being stable, predictable and sustainable. To 
that end, the 1996 budget provides for the setting up, over a period 
of five years, of a funding framework for the Canada health and 
social transfer.
<P>
	This transfer, which was introduced in the 1995 budget, is the 
most important federal initiative to provide financial assistance to 
the provinces regarding health care, post-secondary education and 
social assistance.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	Under the Canada health and social transfer, provinces enjoy 
increased flexibility in designing and managing their own 
programs, while medicare and other social measures are being 
preserved.
<P>
	Since these transfers to the provinces represent a sizeable 
proportion of total federal spending, we cannot improve public 
finances without reducing them, as we did in the case of all other 
expenditure items. This is why funding will be reduced in 1996-97 
and in 1997-98.
<P>
	Following consultations with the provinces, the 1996 budget 
now expands the scope of the Canada health and social transfer, 
which will not undergo additional cuts. We have established a five 
year funding mechanism under which transfers will increase and 
the cash portion will be stabilized, to eventually increase over the 
years.
<P>
	It is important to note that federal equalization payments to the 
poorest provinces, which also help fund social programs, will keep 
on increasing. The new mechanism is based on four fundamental 
principles: maintaining health care and social programs; 
re-establishing the increase in transfer payments and stabilizing the 
cash portion; guaranteeing stable and foreseeable funding to the 
provinces; providing the provinces with more comparable funding.
<P>
	Our action plan takes these principles into account. Allow me to 
review its main proposed elements. The funding level for the 
CHST announced last year for 1996-97 and 1997-98 will remain 
stable, which means that appropriations will amount to $25.1 
billion in 1997-98 and will be made up of tax points and cash in 
roughly equal proportion.
<P>
	The 1996 budget provides for five year legislated funding of the 
CHST over fiscals 1998-99 to 2002-03.
<P>
	During the first two years of the implementation of the new 
mechanism, appropriations will remain at $25.1 billion. Since the 
provinces' tax points will increase, the cash portion paid by the 
federal government will decrease somewhat. However, total 
funding, cash and tax points combined, will remain stable. It is 
obvious that as a result of the CHST, global entitlements will never 
diminish. Funding will not be cut.
<P>
	In fact, during the three last years of this framework, total 
transfer entitlements will grow each and every year at an increasing 
rate, according to a formula tied to economic growth. This means 
that, by the end of the five-year period, overall CHST entitlements 
should exceed those of 1997-98 by $2.3 billion. For the first time 
since the reduction plan was initiated in the mid-1980s, a federal 
government will be taking steps to make these transfers grow 
faster.
<P>
	Moreover, under this framework, the cash portion of the CHST is 
guaranteed never to fall below $11 billion. In fact, by the end of the 
five-year period, it should begin to grow. For greater safety, the 
cash floor within the transfer will be guaranteed by legislation to 
make absolutely sure that cash transfers will never be under $11 
billion during this time frame.
<P>
	The budget also provides for a new allocation scheme reducing 
disparities caused for a large part by the ceiling imposed by the 
Conservatives to tranfers to three provinces under the Canada 
assistance plan.
<P>
	Finally, the new allocation scheme will be implemented 
gradually over five years. In theory, each province's entitlement 
will be adjusted periodically based on its share of the CHST and its 
relative demographic weight within the country. By the year 
2002-03, any disparity in per capita financing will have been 
reduced by half.
<P>
	Of course, this is a compromise solution and no single allocation 
scheme will satisfy all the provinces. We  believe however that this 
is a reasonable compromise and that the five-year phasing in of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1966"> 1966 </A></B>
<P>
new allocation scheme will give provinces a chance to adjust and to 
plan with greater certainty.
<P>
	To conclude, budget proposals regarding the CHST clearly show 
that the federal government is doing its share to ensure the future of 
the Canadian health system and social security net and to build a 
renewed social and economic union. The provinces will continue to 
decide how they want to allocate federal transfers between these 
priorities.
<P>
	Finally, the government is taking steps to ensure that social 
programs remain within the financial capability of the nation and 
meet the needs of Canadians in the future.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the 1996 budget has and continues to meet the 
government's commitment to sustain deficit reduction on the way 
to a future balanced budget, but a balanced budget alone must 
never be the only goal of our wonderful country, Canada.
<P>
	Our government is fundamentally responsible for setting a stage, 
one which provides a model for the Canadian people. Our 
government is here to establish a neutral framework within which 
all Canadians can work and prosper. This framework is represented 
by the 1996 budget in its current implementation. There is no 
question it is difficult to establish a framework which is fair, equal, 
democratic and neutral and which at the same time ensures that all 
Canadians will see the framework in the same light.
<P>
	Our government has successfully created a plan which will 
encompass job creation and progressive changes to old age 
security, to Canada student loans and the Canada health and social 
transfer. Today I will focus on the CHST and the progressive 
changes it marks for Canadians, demonstrating the fundamental 
responsibility of this government to establish a fair and equitable 
framework for all Canadians to grow, to prosper and to work 
together.
<P>
	Fiscal progress should always be a means to greater public ends, 
to lower interest rates, to more jobs and to a more prosperous and 
secure future for Canada. Canadians must be allowed to move 
forward on issues that are important to them instead of being held 
back by fundamental requirements needed to maintain the basic 
standard of living. Canadians want to be successful both on the 
domestic home front and the international stage.
<P>
	In order to establish this level of financial success while 
maintaining public prosperity, it is necessary to follow the 
established plans for economic recovery. Those plans are included 
in the 1994, 1995 and 1996 budgets. They are tailored to result in 
the domestic  comfort and confidence levels necessary to build a 
foundation for continued export and international growth.
<P>
	Clearly, one of the highest priorities for the Canadian 
government, needed to fulfil domestic prosperity, is to preserve 
Canada's network of social programs. These programs have helped 
to establish Canada as one of the most envied nations in the world. 
To ensure their continued success, the Prime Minister has promised 
to provide for health and social programs long term funding 
arrangements that are growing, stable, predictable and sustainable. 
The 1996 budget advances this promise in a new five year 
arrangement for the CHST.
<P>
	This arrangement dictates that there will be no cuts in 
entitlements to the provinces. In fact, the entitlements will increase 
in a few years. The CHST will be stabilized at the 1998-99 levels 
for another two years and then will begin to grow. There will be no 
cuts in the CHST beyond those announced in last year's budget. By 
providing predictable funding, the government is demonstrating its 
commitment to safeguarding health care and other social programs.
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	When the CHST begins to grow in 2000-01, federal transfers 
will then increase for the first time since the mid-1980s. Over the 
years 1998-99 to 2002-03 the federal government will transfer 
nearly $130 billion to the provinces.
<P>
	We established the CHST in last year's budget to fund health, 
post-secondary education and social assistance. It is true that we 
cut the transfer payments in that budget. Overall transfers to the 
provinces were cut by an average of 4.4 per cent in 1996-97. That 
was much lower however than the average of 7.3 per cent in cuts 
we made to our own federal programs. We had no choice but to cut 
transfers after inheriting a huge deficit and debt from the previous 
administration.
<P>
	Cash transfers alone represented well over 20 per cent of all 
federal program spending. They had to be included in our deficit 
reduction plan. At the same time, we have given the provinces the 
increased flexibility they were asking for in order to design 
programs that meet their own needs. It is important to note that the 
federal equalization payments to less affluent provinces which also 
support social programs will continue to grow.
<P>
	It is also important to note the four key objectives of the CHST 
arrangement: to safeguard medicare and social programs; to return 
to growth in transfers and stabilize the cash component of the 
transfers; to restore stability and predictability for provincial 
governments; and to provide the provinces with a more comparable 
funding support program.
<P>
	Transfers to the provinces make up nearly one-quarter of federal 
program spending. In no way could the CHST be exempt from 
expenditure restraint. Over all,  reductions will amount to less than 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1967"> 1967 </A></B>
<P>
3 per cent of provincial revenues. The provinces will be able to 
absorb the impact as most have or are near balanced budgets.
<P>
	New Brunswick for example is a province strong and successful 
in its financial position, with the riding of Carleton-Charlotte 
contributing significantly to the overall success prevalent in New 
Brunswick. My riding of Carleton-Charlotte is vast in geography, 
rural in nature but extremely industrially progressive.
<P>
	Carleton-Charlotte is a riding which stood tall during the tough 
economic times that were witnessed in recent years. It has managed 
not only to maintain its industry but has also managed to expand in 
many areas. There are also many successful industries in 
Carleton-Charlotte and I would not attempt to start naming them. 
However, I do believe this riding certainly deserves to be 
commended on a job well done.
<P>
	Carleton-Charlotte is a community, a riding that could easily 
provide a framework model for the success that can be achieved by 
people when they work together to maintain domestic stability and 
then expand outward. This domestic stability, providing a 
foundation for international recognition and expansion is what all 
Canadians can work toward together as one large community.
<P>
	The model or framework the 1996 budget presents is simply a 
larger model of what has been accomplished in 
Carleton-Charlotte and exemplifies the role of what a government 
should aim to accomplish.
<P>
	This government has not placed exploitation or suppression in 
the hierarchy. Instead it has supplied Canadians with a neutral 
model to expand and prosper.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	I commend this government for maintaining its focus on 
domestic prosperity and for providing a greater means to public 
ends through the new and revised plan for the Canada health and 
social transfer and through the confidence that has been building in 
Carleton-Charlotte and across Canada. This confidence has 
resulted from this budget and the past two budgets of this 
government in addition to the measures taken to get our financial 
House in order for the first time in many, many years.
<P>
	This is why I am pleased and proud today to support Bill C-31, 
the budget implementation act, 1996.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
rhetoric goes on and on about all the confidence Canadians have. I 
have been doing a lot of travelling around Canada in the last few 
months. I wish I could assure everyone that the confidence is there 
but it is not.
<P>
	One of the reasons it is not there is that there is one thing which 
never seems to be mentioned on that side of the House: the huge 
debt and the interest costs in servicing that debt. It is pretty obvious 
to everyone that is the biggest threat to our social programs and the 
future  of our country. It rests totally in what we are going to do 
about that huge debt as it grows and grows and grows.
<P>
	I have listened to the finance minister and he does not talk about 
it. I have listened to the Prime Minister and he does not talk about 
it. All the speeches I have heard from that side of the House never 
talk about what Canadians perceive to be a very major problem: the 
huge growing debt and the interest payments to service that debt 
which have now become the largest expense the government has.
<P>
	Why does the hon. member not address the debt and the interest 
on it? What are we going to do about that? Why have none of his 
colleagues addressed this? Have they been ordered not to talk about 
it? Why do they not bring it into their speeches? Is that why there is 
closure after only one day? Is it so no one else will have the 
opportunity to mention this country's major problem?
<P>
	I would like somebody on that side of the House to explain to me 
when a deficit figure goes down at one rate and an interest figure 
goes up at another rate, just exactly who are they trying to fool 
when they talk about all the savings they are bringing in and that 
they are going to meet their targets and all the problems are going 
to be solved? I think they are leading Canadians astray and I wish 
somebody would address the debt and the interest that is growing 
daily and what they are going to do about it. The only thing I can 
suggest is a zero budget and I have not heard anything about that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Culbert:</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all I thank my hon. colleague 
from Wild Rose for his comments and his questions. We will 
certainly try to do our best to answer them.
<P>
	When this government assumed power it inherited a $500 billion 
plus debt, a $42 billion deficit and a $6 billion deficit in the 
unemployment insurance fund. It was extremely difficult but this 
government took its responsibility and it set goals. It set goals that 
created a challenge, goals that were achievable even though they 
were challenging. We are meeting those goals. For the first time in 
many, many years in this country goals are being met.
<P>
	The hon. member mentioned confidence. Yes, confidence. That 
confidence encouraged the new company CANUSA two weeks ago 
to make an official announcement in Centreville, New Brunswick 
in my riding that it was developing and constructing a new plant. It 
will create 25 new jobs directly, indirectly a number during 
construction, and more indirectly in transportation and other areas.
<P>
<B>(1550 )</B>
<P>
	It is the same confidence that encouraged McCain Foods two 
weeks ago to announce doubling the size of its data processing 
department in Florenceville, New Brunswick in my riding. 
Between 30 and 50 new jobs will be there for the people of my area.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1968"> 1968 </A></B>
<P>
	Sabian cymbals in Meductic, New Brunswick again in my riding 
moved across the road a couple of weeks ago to its new expanded 
modern technological plant, with an additional 12 to 15 new jobs 
created as a result.
<P>
	Briggs and Little woollen mills of York Mills in my constituency 
suffered a terrible fire in the fall of 1994 and has recently 
reconstructed its plant. Without confidence would these business 
people have made these decisions? I think not. They are confident. 
They will continue to be confident which will boost our economy 
and create future jobs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am extremely pleased to rise today to speak to Bill 
C-31, an act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in 
Parliament on March 6, 1996.
<P>
	It is always interesting to criticize the budget tabled by the 
government and especially by the Minister of Finance. Even more 
so in the case of this year's budget, which shows how easy it is to 
mislead the public on the government's real intentions. My 
colleagues and myself have said it many times: this year's budget is 
essentially cosmetic. Under the make-up, however, one can see 
things for what they really are.
<P>
	Bill C-31 is the opportunity the government was waiting for so it 
could sneak through a series of unpopular, highly controversial 
measures. I will get back to the public's reaction later.
<P>
	A few weeks ago, the Minister of Finance brought down a budget 
without any concrete measures, a budget designed to sweeten the 
pill so that people will be more receptive to the reform of social 
programs. But it is the measures proposed in Bill C-31 that will 
have a real budget impact.
<P>
	Through this bill, the government wants to implement, among 
other things, the so-called GST reform-to which I will also get 
back-and to sneak through UI measures that were originally 
supposed to be part of Bill C-12 now in committee.
<P>
	Among other things, Bill C-31 allows the government to go 
ahead with the transfer of public service employees to the private 
sector as part of the restructuring of the public service and the 
privatization of certain services and to dispose of railway 
equipment. In this regard, I noticed a little something in the report 
that I would like to quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Part II would grant the Minister of Transport the power to dispose of 
government-owned railway cars, or rights with respect to the railway cars, that 
are used for the purpose of moving grain. It would also provide for an increase 
in the maximum rates for movements of grain after at least 10,000 of the railway 
cars or rights with respect to at least 10,000 of the railway cars are disposed of.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What this means is that they will dispose of at least 10,000 
railway cars. In the last few months, the government has been 
selling off ports, airports, railway lines, bridges and railway cars; 
everything is up for sale.
<P>
	Bill C-31 also makes minor amendments to the old age pension 
as provided for in the budget. These are not key elements of the 
reform, but simply measures affecting access to the old age pension 
for recent immigrants.
<P>
	Bill C-31 implements the reform of Canada social transfer. It 
also proposes amendments to make transition easier. I am 
confident that many of my colleagues will elaborate on this in their 
speeches on Bill C-31.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	The bill also includes measures seeking to give more flexibility 
to the Minister of Industry regarding the issuance of spectrum 
licences, that is specified radio frequencies within a defined 
geographic area. These measures do give more flexibility to the 
minister, but this is nothing new. Since we got here, all the bills 
introduced in this House seek to do the same. What we see here, as 
in all the bills, is an increasing tendency to centralize power in 
Ottawa.
<P>
	So, the minister will have more flexibility and will be able to use 
regulations, instead of having to introduce legislation. The minister 
will be able to issue licences through a bidding process, which is 
tantamount to an auction.
<P>
	Bill C-31 also includes an amendment to the Canada Student 
Loans Act, as well as a provision allowing the government to spend 
$960 million to compensate the maritime provinces regarding the 
GST reform. Let me just read the last clause of Bill C-31, that is 
clause 64, on page 55:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>From and out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund there may be paid and 
applied a sum not exceeding nine hundred and sixty-one million dollars for 
payments to provinces as adjustment assistance for the purpose of facilitating 
their participation in an integrated value added tax system.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I read this clause to show that a few lines in an act can have 
enormous consequences. This is why I always tell people to read 
the Canadian Constitution. We are always told that it is of little 
value to certain people. But the fact is that a few lines in an act can 
involve the spending of millions of dollars.
<P>
	I also want to point out something strange. Bill C-31 includes 
two things that are also found in Bill C-12, which we are currently 
reviewing in committee. Part III of the bill amends the 
Unemployment Insurance Act by retroactively reducing maximum 
weekly benefits from $445 down to $413. This bill will 
retroactively affect the unemployment insurance program, as of 
January 1, 1996, which means that people will retroactively be 
entitled to less benefits.
<P>
	In this same Part III of the bill, the maximum weekly insurable 
earnings are $750 a week, or $39,000 a year,  retroactive to January 
1. Unemployment insurance premiums will therefore have to be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1969"> 1969 </A></B>
<P>
paid up to this limit. This provision is found in both C-31 and C-12. 
This is something worth noting.
<P>
	Why is the government trying to include the same provision in 
both bills? In fact, there is no escaping that it is because it wants to 
have this bill passed as quickly as possible. We saw with two 
motions that were presented here today in the House that a gag has 
been put on what is being done on C-12 in committee, and also that 
time allocation has been brought in with respect to C-31.
<P>
	Of course, we will do a thorough study of the unemployment 
insurance amendments in committee and in the House. For the time 
being, I would like to recall the basic positions of the Bloc 
Quebecois with regard to unemployment insurance.
<P>
	First of all, this bill must be withdrawn, and that is what we are 
trying to do in committee. It seems that the minister is completely 
exasperated with the Bloc's position. I would like to remind the 
House that, when the bill introducing the GST was tabled, when the 
Conservatives were in power, the present minister tabled 68 
amendments. That was on April 3, 1990, not so long ago. 
Sixty-eight amendments, and each of these amendments was to 
abolish a clause in the bill proposing the creation of the GST.
<P>
	For example, Motion No. 1 of the present minister of Human 
Resources Development on April 3, 1990 read: ``That Bill 
C-62-the one introducing the GST-be amended by deleting 
clause 1''.
<P>
	His second motion was ``that Bill C-62 be modified by deleting 
clause 2''. In all, there were 68 motions to abolish all of the clauses 
of the GST bill. Yet today we are accused of wanting to study each 
of the motions of the bill currently in committee properly, and our 
time to do so is being restricted.
<P>
	The proposed reform is inequitable, for the conditions for 
eligibility have been made tougher. There will be two classes of 
unemployed, regular and frequent users. Third, the reform is 
regressive, because there is only one contribution rate and the 
insurable earnings limit is dropped to $39,000. Fourth, the reform 
is does not promote job creation, for the new contribution structure 
encourages capital intensive industries over labour intensive ones.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	It is understandable that, generally, small and medium size 
businesses have described the introduction of these measures as a 
direct attack on them, for unemployment insurance contributions 
will now be payable from the first dollar earned. Before, the 
deductions did not kick in right away, and also the ceiling was 
much higher, at $42,000, which brought in those with much higher 
earnings. Now the ceilings are being dropped again, and 
contributions will be required from the first dollar  earned, which 
means that small and medium businesses size will be the direct 
target, while big businesses, with their high capital, will be getting 
allthe perks.
<P>
	Although these are called pro-employment measures-the act 
refers to employment rather than unemployment-we know very 
well that, at the very time that companies are making the most 
profits they are also making the most cuts. Numerous examples of 
layoffs have been reported lately, and I shall list but a few. There 
are some thirty in all, but I shall give five or six.
<P>
	General Motors of Canada declared record profits of $1.39 
billion, yet recently it got rid of 2,500 workers. The five biggest 
banks in Canada had a combined profit of $4.9 billion, but cut 
2,800 staff positions. In 1995, Bell Canada made $502 million in 
profits, but reduced its staff by 3,2000 in that same year. I could 
continue, for there are about fifteen cases in all. It has long been 
proven that, when major employers are given advantages to create 
jobs, they create no jobs at all. This reform benefits primarily the 
large corporations and not the small and medium businesses, which 
create the jobs in both Quebec and the rest of Canada.
<P>
	We oppose this bill, as well, because the $5 billion surplus in the 
unemployment insurance fund, a surplus that belongs, not to the 
Government of Canada, but to the workers and employers who 
contributed to it, will be used to artificially reduce the debt, which 
amounts to a general garnishment of wages.
<P>
	This document also contains everything on the reform of the 
GST. I think there will be a lot of discussion about this in the days 
to come. Yesterday morning, the Minister of Finance presented his 
reform of the GST. After promising to abolish the goods and 
services tax, the Liberal government negotiated an agreement with 
three maritime provinces: Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and New 
Brunswick. Under this agreement, it will combine the provincial 
sales taxes and the GST into a single national tax. This national tax 
will be at the rate of 15 per cent.
<P>
	Everyone knows that taxation is higher in the maritime 
provinces than it is elsewhere. Added together, the provincial tax 
and the GST amounted to more than 15 per cent in these provinces. 
It is therefore not surprising that they reached an agreement with 
the federal government. It is to their advantage to do so. They will 
come out ahead on the deal in the short term, as the federal 
government is prepared to make up the shortfall of these provinces 
from the taxes paid by Quebecers and Canadians by agreeing to pay 
out nearly $1 billion in compensation.
<P>
	Contrary to anything the government might say and to what the 
member for Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle said yesterday, the 
Government of Quebec never approved the new national tax before 
us today. What the government said, and I want to make this point, 
is that it is responsible for its provincial tax and that Quebec may  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1970"> 1970 </A></B>
<P>
therefore be more competitive than the other provinces. That is 
what was said.
<P>
	Does the federal government really think that the people of a 
province like Alberta, where there is no provincial tax, will accept 
such an agreement with it and does it think that the people of 
Alberta, Quebec and all the other provinces that have not 
concluded an agreement with it will want to pay for the provinces 
that have?
<P>
	This manoeuvre on the part of the federal government not only 
makes Quebec and Canadian taxpayers unduly pay for something 
they never asked for, but is a deliberate offensive that will 
eventually permit Ottawa to take over the collection of all taxes 
across Canada. During the last election campaign, Liberals, 
including the Deputy Prime Minister of Canada and the Prime 
Minister himself, hung their case on the elimination of the GST, 
and got elected on the promise they would get rid of the GST; and 
now we have the government proposing a reform which is without 
any doubt the most blatant breach of an electoral promise in the 
whole parliamentary history of Canada.
<P>
	Reactions in today's papers, especially in the English press, bear 
witness to this fact; nearly all of them point out that the 
government, in this matter, is reneging on its election promises. No 
matter what is written in the Liberal red book, what is at stake is the 
government members' word; the government did promise it would 
scrap the GST.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	Under the law, there is exchange of consent when an individual 
signifies expressly or tacitly his or her acceptance of the offer made 
by another party. People signified they wanted the GST scrapped. 
The Liberals expressly promised to scrap the GST. Perhaps they 
would like to see videotapes of the statements they made during 
their first election campaign; if need be, we can show them to them.
<P>
	Any proposal including all the elements pertaining to the 
proposed contract and indicating that it becomes binding on its 
author should it be accepted is a contract offer. The Liberals made a 
contract offer, they offered to scrap the GST should they be elected. 
People believed their promise and accepted their proposal. The 
government made a formal contract offer, an offer which was 
binding but which it did not honour.
<P>
	The law also says that a contract is arrived at when the 
offeror-in this case the Liberals who offered, even promised, to 
scrap the GST-receives acceptance, no matter the form. The 
Liberals offered to scrap the GST, and people accepted to elect 
them as the government. A contract was arrived at and all the 
conditions for its validity were met.
<P>
	Two things happen whenever one of the parties fails to abide by a 
contract: first, that party is sued for breach of  contract with 
damages; second, it is no longer trusted by the other party, having 
misled it and caused it considerable damage. Well, the people will 
remember in the next election that they cannot trust the Liberals.
<P>
	We have three examples. Among other things, the Liberals 
promised to tear up the free trade agreement. That promise was 
quoted many times by Jeffrey Simpson, I believe. They promised 
to tear up the free trade agreement but, as we know, it slipped 
through with the greatest of ease. They promised to kill the GST 
but, as we know, they are now reinforcing it, even spending close to 
$1 billion to convince some provinces to jump on the 
harmonization bandwagon. They promised to recognize Quebec as 
a distinct society and we now have a principal homeland of 
something or other. All those promises have been abandoned.
<P>
	As we heard on the news this week, my Liberal colleague-I 
have just learned that he will be my deskmate in this House and I 
am looking forward to it-the hon. member for York 
South-Weston, who resigned from his caucus, has acted with 
great integrity and earned the respect of the people in his riding, 
who strongly supported his decision.
<P>
	The fact that a member of the government has resigned because 
he has lost confidence in his own government speaks volumes. It 
must be said that the government does not write down what it says 
or do what it promises in writing. It is important to remember this. I 
just want to quickly go over the commitments made at the time, 
which were recently quoted in the <I>Globe and Mail</I>. Here is what the 
Deputy Prime Minister was quoted as saying in the March 11, 1996 
edition of the <I>Globe and Mail</I>:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``I have already said personally and very directly that if the GST 
is not abolished, I will resign''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
To this day, there have been no resignations.
<P>
	Here is another promise as reported by the <I>Globe and Mail</I>. This 
time it is the Prime Minister speaking: ``We will scrap the GST''. 
There is no reference to harmonizing or to the red book. The 
message was very clear.
<P>
	The Prime Minister also said, on May 2, 1994: ``We hate this tax 
and we will make it disappear''. For once he said exactly the same 
thing in French and in English.
<P>
	It is also important to remember what the hon. member for York 
South-Weston said in his letter to the Prime Minister:
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1971"> 1971 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``The Liberals were in breach of their electoral commitment. We 
all know that we did not promise to simply harmonize the GST. The 
promise was to scrap it and implement a fairer system''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This is not what was done and this is why the hon. member for 
York South-Weston resigned, as did to the hon. member for 
Broadview-Greenwood.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	There are at least two people in this House, on the Liberal side, 
who have some backbone and who remember the promises they 
made. How many Liberals went from door-to-door during the 
election campaign, as we all did, and promised people that they 
would indeed abolish the GST, not harmonize it?
<P>
	Those who did that should remember that they made 
commitments, and they should seriously think about the calibre of 
people such as the hon. member for York South-Weston and the 
hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance now admits he made a mistake: ``We 
made promises which we failed to keep''. As for the Prime 
Minister, he says: ``We fulfilled our promises''. There is an obvious 
discrepancy between the words of the Prime Minister and those of 
the finance minister.
<P>
	I will conclude by quoting from a short text written by Jeffrey 
Simpson, who relates what is going on in an article entitled:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``The height of political gall lies behind a veil of crocodile 
tears''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This is truly extraordinary. In this article, Mr. Simpson tells us, 
in reference to the Minister of Finance, that:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``During the election campaign we were right to criticize the GST''. Among 
its problems, he recalled, were overlap and duplication. That is what the 
Liberals were campaigning against in 1993.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	And then, Mr. Simpson asks:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Is that what you heard from your friendly Liberal candidate in the election? 
Did ``scrap the tax'' mean ``end overlap and duplication''? Did ``abolish'' mean 
kaput for ``overlap and duplication''? We all obviously misunderstood.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a comment and a question for the hon. member for 
Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies.
<P>
	My comments concerns the GST. As the hon. member indicated, 
the GST has been harmonized in Quebec; the federal government 
and the Quebec government had agreed to phase in harmonization 
over a six-year period. What the member did not tell this House 
however it that Quebec would not have qualified for adjustment 
assistance since revenues resulting from harmonization alone have 
increased in Quebec. Harmonization has generated additional 
revenue for Quebec, while Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia 
do not qualify.
<P>
	We will recall that the premier of Quebec, the hon. Lucien 
Bouchard, was a member of the cabinet that instituted the GST and 
that he was the one who advocated harmonizing Quebec's sales tax 
without any financial compensation.
<P>
	It is also important to note that the federal government is still 
paying Quebec for administering the tax on its behalf. In recent 
years, payments averaging $100 million a year were made. Also, 
Quebec like the other provinces regularly receives adjustment 
assistance from Ottawa, including stabilization payments, supply 
management envelopes and regional development funding. In 
many cases, Quebec receives much more than the other provinces.
<P>
	My question is as follows. In his remarks, the hon. member for 
Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies mentioned Bill C-12, which he 
described as regressive legislation. He used the word regressive. I 
would like to know if it is regressive to move from a system based 
on the number of weeks worked to one based on the number of 
worked hours in a bill on employment. Let me explain. Who works 
15 hours or less in Quebec and Canada? The most disadvantaged 
members of our society, those who cannot find permanent 
employment, generally women. Under the old system, people 
could hold two jobs and work 30 or 40 hours per week during 30 
years without ever qualifying for employment benefits.
<P>
	If the hon. member could give me an answer, I would like to 
know if legislation that gives 500,000 workers, including 125,000 
in Quebec alone, access to employment insurance can be called 
regressive.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	I would also like to know if raising employment benefits by 18 
per cent for every family household in Quebec and Canada earning 
less than $26,000 and helping the most disadvantaged members of 
our society can be called restrictive or regressive measures?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, if the bill as it stands did what my 
colleague claims, I would be in agreement with  him. But the facts 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1972"> 1972 </A></B>
<P>
are otherwise. One could ask oneself whether he has really 
understood the proposed reform. Whether the thousands of people 
now protesting in Quebec, especially seasonal workers, and those 
adding their voices from the Atlantic provinces and Acadia, have 
all not understood what my colleague seems to have understood.
<P>
	What is happening now is that those who work will have to 
contribute right from the first hour, but when it is time to draw 
benefits, they will have to have worked a certain number of hours 
to be eligible. I think that it was the Canadian Labour Congress-I 
will find the article for my hon. colleague-that recently did an 
exhaustive study of this question. It claimed that two thirds of 
Canadian workers-it did not look at Quebec, just Canada-two 
thirds of Canadian workers would not be eligible for 
unemployment insurance benefits as the bill now stands.
<P>
	In fact, and that should give everyone an idea right away, there 
was a $5 billion surplus in this fund and it is being used to balance 
the government's books, when that amount does not belong to the 
government at all. It belongs to the workers and those who have 
contributed to it. This practically amounts to garnisheeing 
everybody's wages.
<P>
	We will see if my colleague is right, to what extent people are 
happy over the coming months when the implementation of this 
reform begins to make itself felt. I am certain that he will be 
surprised to see the outcry of protests and the people appearing in 
his office to complain.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague, 
the hon. member for Saint-Léonard-Anjou, has referred to 
credibility. At the present time we have a flagrant example, which 
casts doubt on the credibility of our institutions. When political 
parties are going after votes, making promises, and referring to a 
program, but then do a complete about face as soon as they are 
elected, it seems to me that this is unacceptable.
<P>
	This is also why MPs lack credibility in the eyes of the public at 
this time. The latest polls indicate that MPs have about 15 per cent 
of public credibility. In my opinion, this is the main reason for the 
lack of trust in MPs: they do exactly what the Liberals did during 
the last campaign. They do exactly what the Liberals did during the 
implementation of the GST, which was proposed and implemented 
by their Conservative predecessors.
<P>
	Then they did everything in their power, they set up strategies, 
they went at it hammer and tongs, scaring the public. For example, 
the hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell said on 
December 15, 1990 that the GST represented fear and suffering. 
People will say anything to attract votes. Today, we are in the 
process of accepting what is more or less the original Conservative 
plan.
<P>
	What I mean by that is that the public has had it with MPs who 
say one thing one day and a do completely different thing the next. 
So this is my question for my colleague. Does he believe that what 
the Liberals are doing at this time, and what they did during the last 
campaign, will add to or take away from MPs' credibility?
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to my colleague for 
Longueuil for his question. I would, however, remind him that I am 
the member for Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies and not for 
Saint-Léonard-Rivière-des-Prairies.
<P>
	My colleague noted that, quite recently, polls were giving us 15 
per cent credibility. I think, in the past week, we must have dropped 
to five per cent. That is a partial answer to my colleague's question.
<P>
	In fact, the government made all sorts of commitments before its 
election, stentorian commitments shouted from the 
rooftops-especially the Prime Minister and his promise to tear up 
the free trade agreement. The free trade agreement is in effect 
today, and most of the time the government is not very successful 
at defending the rights of Canadians. More often than not, despite 
the fact that our rights have merit, we lose to the Americans.
<P>
	The government and, in particular, the Prime Minister, had 
promised to eliminate the GST. We are in fact reinforcing it and 
right off we will be spending $1 billion for three provinces alone, in 
order to put a process of harmonization, which will never work, 
into effect.
<P>
	We also remember that the government and the Prime Minister 
himself promised distinct society recognition. It will never happen. 
We know very well. Even the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs, present here today, had promised to use every means 
possible to obtain this recognition. He is the same man who said a 
few months ago, before this promise was made, that the more 
Quebecers were made to suffer, the more the sovereignist option 
would diminish. He said that in Toronto. So here we have a member 
from Quebec, paid by Quebecers to defend their interests, who 
comes to Ottawa to make Quebec suffer. This says a mouthful 
about transparency.
<P>

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BUDGETIMPLEMENTATIONACT,1996">BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1996</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-31, 
an act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in 
Parliament on March 6, 1996, be read the second time and referred 
to a committee, and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President 
of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my 
time with the member for Cumberland-Colchester.
<P>
	It is my pleasure to speak to Bill C-31, the budget 
implementation bill. We recognize the impact worldwide 
developments have had on every Canadian over the last decade.
<P>
	Globalization, financial pressures, new technologies and other 
factors have put real stress on Canadians. Canadians have already 
stated in many ways that they want a strong, dynamic government 
which will meet the challenge of these sweeping changes. In other 
words, it is time government gets it right, providing the necessary 
services and programs in the most effective and efficient manner 
possible at the most affordable cost.
<P>
	The government has committed itself to four key priorities: to 
redefine the government's roles and responsibilities, to redirect 
resources to the highest national priorities, to provide Canadians 
with more modern and accessible quality delivery, and to achieve 
affordable government.
<P>
	The government undertook a review of all its major federal 
programs and services and reassessed what the government does 
and how it can do it better within the available resources.
<P>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
	The results of this exercise are integral to the major shifts the 
government has undertaken in conducting its business, not just in 
direct service delivery to Canadians but in the internal processes 
and systems that support the delivery of these services.
<P>
	The expenditure management system is one major initiative that 
all departments have implemented in the last year. This means that 
each department is operating in a businesslike manner and is 
assessing competing priorities and reallocating resources to where 
they are most required. Outputs are transparent, measurable and 
precise.
<P>
	Departments are also ensuring they have stronger, more flexible 
administrative structures to deliver the government's programs and 
services to Canadians in a fiscally responsible manner.
<P>
	The changes the president of the treasury board has proposed in 
the budget implementation bill are intended to put in place the 
foundation that will support the government's priorities. Allow me 
to go through some of the directions the government is undertaking 
in the bill to get government right and to respond to the needs of all 
Canadians.
<P>
	The government has mapped out three key priorities in serving 
national needs: alternative service delivery, compensation and 
collective bargaining, and pension reform.
<P>
	To provide alternative ways of delivering services to Canadians, 
we will introduce service entities, special operating agencies and 
other organizational mechanisms to support the delivery of client 
focused quality services. Nav Canada, for example, has been 
created to make it easier to deliver air traffic control services.
<P>
	Similar steps will be taken for food inspection services, national 
parks, revenue collection and in other areas as the need arises to 
meet the best interests of Canadians in the most affordable manner. 
The government will undertake other such alternatives on a case by 
case basis.
<P>
	The legislative amendments introduced in the budget 
implementation bill will now permit the government to put into 
place the administrative mechanisms necessary to ensure a smooth 
transition to alternative service delivery.
<P>
	For instance, changes are proposed to the Canada Labour Code 
as well as the Public Service Staff Relations Act to permit the 
introduction of successor rights. This means unions will continue 
to represent their employees and collective agreements will 
continue to be enforced until the term of the agreement expires as 
affected employees move from public service employment to other 
employers within the federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	We are also implementing amendments to ensure transitional 
organizations have the tools they need to operate efficiently, 
effectively and affordably. For example, we will amend the 
Financial Administration Act to allow multi-year appropriations 
where organizations require the flexibility to plan their operations 
for service delivery over more than a one year period.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1974"> 1974 </A></B>
<P>
	However, this is an enabling clause only and Parliament retains 
the right to approve when and if multi-year appropriations are the 
best business approaches to meet the specific organizational needs.
<P>
	These are the directions the government is taking to support the 
evolution in how it does business for the next century.
<P>
	Alternative service delivery will affect public service employees 
currently working in these areas. As a fair and equitable employer, 
the government believes it must treat these employees in a fair and 
equitable manner. To this end, the government has embarked on a 
series of negotiations with bargaining agents to ensure the 
transitional period is as smooth as possible for employees.
<P>
	Agreement was reached with most public service unions on the 
transfer agreements that will apply to employees affected by the 
creation of alternative service delivery organizations.
<P>
	The amendments will also allow us to put in place fair 
arrangements for all employees affected by such transfers. They 
will permit us to implement enhanced arrangements that some 
unions successfully negotiated on behalf of their members. The 
government is committed to working with the public service unions 
and believes that a negotiated agreement is always the preferred 
option.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	The second key priority area concerns compensation and 
collective bargaining in the public service. All collective 
bargaining in the public service came to a halt when the 
government implemented the Public Sector Compensation Act in 
1991. I am certain the nation supported this radical but necessary 
change.
<P>
	However, six years have passed since this legislation came into 
effect. For five of these six years, the public service employees 
have received no increase in their salaries, a most significant 
contribution by them to Canadians in achieving the government's 
objective of fiscal restraint.
<P>
	However, a more fiscally responsible government does not mean 
an unfair government to its employees. We all recognize that while 
the government can be a catalyst for change, it is our employees 
who are the agents of such change. To this end I am pleased to 
announce that the Public Sector Compensation Act will expire as 
originally scheduled in February, 1997. We will be able to return to 
collective bargaining at that time.
<P>
	The government is amending the Public Sector Compensation 
Act to reinstate performance pay and annual increments to those 
employees for whom they were suspended when the government 
introduced the wage freeze.
<P>
	In negotiating the terms and conditions of employment for 
employees with unions over the next three years we will suspend 
binding arbitration as a dispute resolution mechanism. We cannot 
risk awards being made by independent arbitrators who are not 
accountable to Parliament for the government's fiscal 
responsibility to Canadians.
<P>
	Binding arbitration will continue for employees of the House of 
Commons, the Senate, the Library of Parliament and the Canadian 
Security Intelligence Service. Their respective legislation prohibits 
strikes and requires the use of binding arbitration. However, in 
these cases the arbitrators will be required to take into account the 
wage settlements that have been reached for comparable 
occupational groups within the public service for which the 
Treasury Board is the employer.
<P>
	The bill would also provide authority for a 2.2 per cent wage 
increase for non-commissioned members of the Canadian Armed 
Forces. This measure will correct the disparity in wages that 
existed before the wage freeze between members of the armed 
forces and public service employees.
<P>
	The final priority of legislative amendments centres around 
pension reforms which provide individual and group employees 
with greater portability and meet the standards of the Pension 
Benefits Standards Act. In this area the government will revise the 
Public Service Superannuation Act to allow for employee pensions 
to be protected and to be portable to other organizations. This will 
be the case whether the individual or group is transferred to a 
separate organization. Portability will be enhanced by a two-year 
vesting and lock-in provisions.
<P>
	I will tell the House about a number of other government 
priorities. The government will take measures to re-engineer its 
many organizations to deliver more quality service while being 
fiscally responsible to the people of Canada.
<P>
	We will modify the Financial Administration Act to make 
changes with respect to group insurance plans in the public service, 
for example, the health care plan. This will permit the government 
to fund and manage the group insurance plan for employees. It will 
also be more consistent with general insurance practices in the 
private sector.
<P>
	I will mention a few of the many public service undertakings. 
The changes we are proposing, particularly in the areas of 
alternative service delivery, compensation and collective 
bargaining and pension reform will set the foundation for providing 
more value and quality in service delivery to Canadians. As the 
President of the Treasury Board said on April 24 in his introduction 
to this bill: ``These measures will help us secure a financial future, 
get government right-

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I hesitate at the best 
of times to interrupt anyone, but when an indication is given to the 
Chair that members are splitting their time, although 10 minutes 
may not seem very long, in fairness to other members awaiting an 
opportunity to speak on the same bill, I feel I must.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
know what the member thinks of the present the federal 
government just gave the three maritime provinces.
<P>
	We know it will give close to one billion dollars to these three 
provinces. It was mentioned that harmonizing the GST will cost 
more to the maritime provinces involved. Right now, as far as I 
know, the provincial taxes in the maritimes are between 11 and 12 
per cent. They are the highest in Canada. In Quebec, the sales tax 
used to be 9 per cent, now its is 6.5 per cent.
<P>
	Could it be, by any chance, that this gift of one billion dollars to 
three maritime provinces is to compensate for what they are losing 
due to UI cuts? Is this a way the government found to compensate 
them for their UI losses? This seems to me a rather obvious 
coincidence.
<P>
	The two ministers from New Brunswick were having a great deal 
of difficulty making people swallow the UI reform. It seems that 
they are being rewarded or compensated so that the two senior 
ministers from New Brunswick can be better perceived by the 
public.
<P>
	In any case, for us in Quebec, there is something we find 
unacceptable. It is estimated that Quebec will have to pay $250 
million in compensation. We are going to give close to one billion 
dollars to the maritime provinces.
<P>
	Of course, this $250 million is not directly part of the one billion 
dollars. However, we know that when the government's revenues 
are down, and when the time comes to transfer money to meet its 
responsibility with regard to health care and post-secondary 
education, among others, we know that the funds it will transfer 
will be less the money it will give the maritimes.
<P>
	We are well aware that in Quebec we will experience losses 
amounting to at leat $250 million because of this. I would like to 
know what the member thinks of all this, of this nice present to the 
maritime provinces.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I would like to ask the 
hon. member for Longueuil whether he intends to make a comment 
without answering the hon. member, otherwise, in the little time 
left, I will allow him to answer the comment already made. 
Agreed?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jackson:</B> Mr. Speaker, the jury is still out on the UI issue. 
We are reforming it. I do not believe the measure undertaken by the 
government with regard to what he called gifts has anything to do 
with UI.
<P>
	When the UI fund is underfunded the money has to be found by 
the government. It is strange that we are trying to restructure it and 
other members think we should spend the money in some other 
way.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	With regard to the member's other question, the government 
looked at 20 alternatives to the replacement tax. The 
accommodation it came up with was the best one. There is some 
dislocation with regard to these provinces. They have a small 
population base. We are still a country and we still have 
equalization payments. Provinces that do better under these 
circumstances have an obligation to transfer some of their funds to 
get the other provinces going.
<P>
	The government is trying to get government right. We believe 
through the moves we have made that we will have more jobs and 
be more competitive. We will wean those provinces off that money 
over a period of time.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to add my voice to those of my 
hon. colleagues to strongly endorse the budget implementation bill 
before us today.
<P>
	In the next few minutes I will focus on one key theme of the 
budget. The focus will be on youth, on what government is doing to 
invest in Canada's future through education and youth employment 
programs. Everyone knows the government is committed to deficit 
reduction and the positive spinoffs of lower interest rates and 
economic growth. At the same time, we must have the vision to 
sustain our social programs and build a future for our youth.
<P>
	There are some areas in which additional funds must be invested 
while we cut back in others. One such area concerns the youth of 
Canada. Young people are Canada's most important resource but 
sadly youth unemployment is about 50 per cent higher than the 
national average. Young Canadians are not looking for handouts, 
but for a chance to lend a hand. They need enhanced educational 
opportunities and an extra hand up to attain their very crucial first 
jobs.
<P>
	There is no question about the importance of education. It is the 
underpinning of this country's progress and accomplishments. 
Everything we have as a country and as individuals rests on the 
skills, abilities and talents that have been developed and polished 
through education.
<P>
	In today's changing world, education is a lifelong endeavour. 
During our time in this House we continue to learn more about the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1976"> 1976 </A></B>
<P>
Canadians we serve, about their  needs, their expectations and their 
hopes for this country's future.
<P>
	It is for Canada's young people that education holds a very 
special place. The greatest asset a person has is his or her own 
self-resourcefulness. No one can take your education from you. 
What they learn now they will use for the rest of their lives. During 
their lives they will see that the Canada of the future, how it lives, 
how it works and how it interacts with the broader world outside its 
borders, will change and grow beyond anything we see today. It is 
education that will take our young people there.
<P>
	All of this is well recognized by the government and with this 
budget we are taking durable, meaningful steps forward. One 
significant step is the new learning package. It delivers real help to 
Canadian students. The education tax credit is being raised from 
$80 to $100. The limit on the transfer of tuition fees and education 
amounts to those who support students is being raised from $4,000 
to $5,000. The annual limit on contributions to the registered 
education savings plan is being increased from $1,500 to $2,000, 
while the lifetime limit is being increased from $31,500 to 
$42,000.
<P>
	We are also helping parents who are full time students. Single 
parents and family parents who both attend school will be allowed 
to deduct child care expenses against all types of income. Parents 
who attend high school full time will also be allowed to claim this 
deduction. These new measures will deliver an extra $165 million 
in tax assistance over the next three years to students and their 
families.
<P>
	The new money in the learning package tells only part of the 
story. It supplements the considerable sums we already target to 
students. I am sure hon. members are familiar with the Canada 
student loans program. Currently we budget some $556 million to 
this program, money that will allow some 360,000 students to 
negotiate over $1 billion in loans this year. To help students, this 
year's budget announced the removal of the 10-year ceiling that 
was imposed on the repayment schedules of students who 
borrowed money under the Canada Student Loans Act.
<P>
	Under the new rules lenders will have more flexibility to match 
the repayment period to the financial reality of borrowers. Not only 
will this measure help the students who borrow the money, but it 
will also benefit the government as we will not have such a high 
default rate on loans.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	These changes follow on major reforms of the Canada student 
loans program made last August. At that time the government 
announced that it would provide special grants for disabled and 
high needs students and expand interest relief for borrowers who 
encounter difficulty in repaying their loans. Loan ceilings were 
increased and the  efficiency of the program was improved through 
new arrangements with the financial institutions. Under this 
arrangement it is the lenders who take on the risk and the costs of 
loan defaults.
<P>
	Formal education is a necessary foundation that all students 
seek, but there is something equally important that complements it 
and that is work experience. I am sure hon. members understand 
fully the challenge involved in making the transition from schools, 
colleges and universities to the workplace. Given the difficulty that 
this transition represents in today's fiercely competitive job 
market, which is evidenced by the youth unemployment numbers 
that I mentioned earlier, the government had to take action.
<P>
	Before the 1996 budget the government had already earmarked 
some $705 million over the next three years for programs to 
promote youth employment. These include Youth Service Canada, 
Youth Internship Canada and the Student Summer Job Action 
program. Now we are doing more. Funding will be increased with 
$315 million of new money reallocated from other areas of the 
budget. Some of this reallocated funding will be used to facilitate 
summer employment. Government support will double to $120 
million for this fiscal year. This action recognizes the value of on 
the job experience to students, not to mention the money it 
provides to help them with their education.
<P>
	Most of the remaining money will be used to assist young people 
who have left school to find jobs. Individuals with lower levels of 
education will be a special target group, and to fully fund and to 
fully understand the particular needs and difficulties they face.
<P>
	When the new funding for the learning package in youth 
employment is added to the existing employment programs, the 
total support for the next three years will be more than $1.2 billion.
<P>
	When I was a young girl growing up in rural New Brunswick in 
the 1950s, few young women went to university. Most were 
encouraged to get married. It was almost like a career. I was always 
an eager learner and I can remember my mother saying to me: 
``Diane, do not get too smart or no one will want to marry you''. 
That was a particular and prevailing attitude of the times.
<P>
	I went to university and I am still enrolled today in the masters 
program at St. Mary's University at Halifax. I encourage young 
women and young men to look at education as the greatest asset 
they will ever attain. You can never have too much of it, it will be 
the greatest gift that you ever give yourself and it will last a 
lifetime.
<P>
	I recognize this and as a working person all my life I am still 
being educated through a lifelong process. The government 
recognizes this. Education is a foundation for all successful 
employment and for successful citizens.
<P>
	I have a young man in my constituency who encountered drug 
and alcohol abuse throughout his  education at university. He was a 
failure and dropout. He came to see me in great disgrace in his 
community. Having been considered a complete failure by family 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1977"> 1977 </A></B>
<P>
and friends he asked for my help to get back to school. My message 
to him was: ``I will help you when you are prepared to help 
yourself''.
<P>
	Over the past two years he has called on me every few months. I 
am so pleased to say that these last few months he has taken control 
of his life, he is back on track and he is now enrolled in an 
education program in the Halifax area.
<P>
	If I do nothing else through this next period as a member of 
Parliament, I will feel very satisfied that I have been able to 
encourage and help one young person take control of his life and 
get back on track to get his education. It is education that opens the 
doors to successful young people who become successful adults not 
only in the workplace but as mothers in our society, as providers, as 
givers in the community and as very successful Canadians that will 
take this country into the 21st century.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on this bill. I am discouraged that closure has been 
moved on it.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	There are so many important things that need to be mentioned. I 
would like to mention a few, based on some of my travels over the 
last year, talking to ordinary Canadians all across the land. Most 
Canadians really do not understand a lot of the details of budgeting. 
Certainly I do not. However, they have been asking questions. I 
would like to relay some of the messages I have heard.
<P>
	First, the one thing of which Canadians are certainly aware is the 
huge debt. They feel it is the one thing that is tearing the guts out of 
our social programs. It is hurting our agricultural programs and it is 
hindering the country in a number of areas.
<P>
	I have been waiting to hear a Liberal member address the debt, 
but I never have. All I hear is a lot of rhetoric and glorified stories 
about what a wonderful thing the budget is. However, they never 
talk about the debt which will continue to be a serious problem.
<P>
	When the finance minister read his budget he said: ``When we 
came here the deficit was at 6 per cent of GDP. Then it was at 5 per 
cent. Then it was at 4 per cent. Then it was at 3 per cent. Next year 
the deficit will be at 2 per cent of GDP''. The crowd opposite 
cheered. Of course, most Canadians were not sure what they were 
cheering about. If he had said: ``When we came here we were $450 
billion in debt. Then we were $500 billion in debt. Then we were 
$550 billion in debt. Then we were $600 billion in debt. Now we 
are moving to $650 billion in debt and before we reach 2 per cent of 
GDP we will be pushing nearly $700 billion in debt,'' that would 
have made sense.
<P>
	Instead of talking about the deficit going from $40 billion to $35 
billion, to $30 billion, to $25 billion and then to $20 billion, he 
should have said that our interest payments have gone from $30 
billion to $35 billion to $40 billion to $45 billion and that we are on 
our way to more than $50 billion, that would have made sense. 
People could understand that.
<P>
	They would question: How can we do that? How can we afford 
that problem? When our deficit is decreasing at a pace and our 
interest on the debt is increasing at a pace, and the pace is fairly 
level, all Canadians are saying: ``Why do we not get the deficit to 
zero in order to stop paying interest?'' The debt would stop 
growing.
<P>
	That is what Reformers have been saying since we arrived. Let 
us do that. Let us stop that growth. It is tearing the country apart. It 
has brought us to the point where the biggest expenditure we have 
is the one which services the huge debt.
<P>
	I am going to talk about the things people understand when we 
are sitting on the tailgate of their truck, in their barnyard, in their 
small store and in a small community.
<P>
	We see different reports that come from different sources, such 
as the Canadian Taxpayers Association and other groups which 
look at government spending. They will be asking these kinds of 
questions: Why are we spending so much money? Why do we do 
that?
<P>
	We look at the waste reports which my colleague from St. Albert 
so capably put together.
<P>
<B>(1655 )</B>
<P>
	Many of the people in my riding of Wild Rose wonder why we 
are giving grants to businesses such as Beyer, Brown and 
Associates. Who is that to get half a million dollars? What about a 
real estate company getting $15,000?
<P>
	Breakwater Books Limited, Big Bill's Furniture and Appliance, 
Sears, Canadian Wine, Walch's Family Foods, Navy and Army 
stores, on and on it goes. It is grant after grant after grant to these 
businesses.
<P>
	They have a hard time understanding why businesses in Wild 
Rose are not receiving any of these grants. ``What is the story 
behind that,'' they ask. There is no answer. Why does this kind of 
spending continually go on?
<P>
	People keep looking a little farther. It is too bad you are not my 
age, Mr. Speaker. You would really appreciate this one: $116,000 
on a committee on seniors and sexuality. Boy, it makes me feel 
really good now that I am getting old to know a committee would 
get that kind of money to study seniors and sexuality.
<P>
	There is page after page of lists of grants given to do this and 
that. Pretty soon one starts adding it all up and find it comes to 
millions of dollars.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1978"> 1978 </A></B>
<P>
	That is what the people in the countryside are talking about. 
They are asking: What is going on? Where do we have that kind 
of spending? What is happening? Why is it that you can come to 
the House of Commons and hear people denounce us because we 
are politicians?
<P>
	Recently Alberta radio station CHQR-770 took a poll on what is 
your favourite occupation and for whom do you have the most 
admiration. Politicians were right beneath lawyers. We were way 
down the list.
<P>
	It was not until I came here that I found out part of the reason. 
There is a great deal of difference between being a politician and a 
leader or a statesman. When the minister of human resources 
stands, as he has done on a number of occasions, speaking about 
the million children who are living in poverty in our country, it is 
cause for concern. What are we doing about it?
<P>
	We hear different reports about the crimes being committed in 
cities where we have many street kids and many difficulties. We 
hear about 11, 12 and 13-year old girls who are being arrested for 
prostitution. There are pimps being arrested and, of course, they are 
let off the hook with a minor charge. You hear these things. You 
know the costs involved. We wonder as we sit in this House and 
talk about them. In the meantime, we spend money like there is no 
end of it. We waste it on the things I mentioned such as golf courses 
and grants.
<P>
	It does not make sense to Canadians. It does not make sense to 
me. What is even worse is when politicians are sitting here, with 
the leader sitting on the other side of the House, driving up here in a 
limousine with a driver, going around with your nose stuck in the 
air because you have a highfalutin position in this place. You are 
not willing to cough that up, nor are you willing to join some of us 
who gave up our MP pensions because that might help with some 
of those costs and bring things into line.
<P>
	When we start talking about those issues, they immediately get a 
bit concerned because the people opposite do not want to talk about 
that. Not one time has the waste or the lack of support for the things 
that would help us start fighting crime been mentioned.
<P>
	They talk about poverty being a reason for crime. Let us do 
something about it. They talk about the problems in the streets. 
Look at the penitentiaries. A number of things are happening there. 
We want people to be released. That is the idea. They are going to 
come out.
<P>
	We provide them with programs such as cognitive skills. They 
come out with a paper saying that they have cognitive skills but 
that does not get them a job. They walk out of the prison with $80 
in their pockets. The paper says that they have cognitive skills. It 
does not mean a thing.
<P>
	Two or three days later, they are back in jail. They are back in 
trouble. Why are we not doing something about that? Why do we 
not redirect some of our money to fight the very things which cause 
those things to happen?  Why do we not train some of these people 
to become useful workers?
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	We can incorporate these cognitive skills into any program if we 
know what we are doing. We can help these people so that when 
they do get out crime will go down. When crime goes down, boy, 
talk about saving dollars. We do not want crime happening in this 
country because it really does a good job of supporting our legal 
system. It does not do anything for justice but it sure keeps our 
lucrative legal system going.
<P>
	Let us train them. Let us create some discipline. But what do we 
do? Last year we spent a million dollars to make sure everybody in 
prison had cable TV. Maybe that is too much. Then of course 
$180,000 was spent to provide condoms in men's prisons 
throughout the country. I am having a difficult time with that one.
<P>
	Then of course there is this bleach project. We have to make sure 
the prisoners' needles are clean so we are going to spend a lot of 
money to give them clean needles. Why do we not go into our 
prisons and put an end to the drugs? Why do we not have the 
political will and courage to go into these places and put an end to 
it? Then when those people came out of prison they would be 
rehabilitated from the very problem that got them in there in the 
first place. Why not spend money on training them?
<P>
	Why do we not look at the idea of putting more police back on 
the streets where we can help kids? We could give them a little 
more authority to work with the kids rather than having to follow 
the little book right to the letter. Put more police out there. Oh, but 
that costs more money.
<P>
	I have an idea. Let us not register the rifles and shotguns. Let us 
take that $85 million, using the justice minister's own figures, and 
hire another 2,000 police. If we used the auditor general's figure of 
$1 billion, then we should not hire 2,000 police, we should hire 
20,000. If that is going to help prevent crime it will mean a great 
amount of savings to society as a whole. It will mean a great deal to 
the morals and values of our communities.
<P>
	When I was a school principal if any violence broke out at the 
school and it looked as if things were getting a little carried away, 
the last thing I would do would be to give them blackjacks and 
clubs. That is what the government is doing with bleach projects, 
condoms and all these other things. It is telling the prisoners that it 
is okay and we will make it better.
<P>
	None of this makes sense to normal Canadians. I hope I am 
normal. Sometimes I wonder myself when I walk out of here. I 
walk out of here and I hear people like that member from 
Saskatchewan who just clapped over there. That same member 
would sit in committee and say that our schools are the same as 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1979"> 1979 </A></B>
<P>
they were 40 years ago.  Hogwash. Forty years ago chewing gum 
was the major problem in schools. Today it does not evencome close.
<P>
	I sit in the justice committee and watch them interview people 
from the field of education. The final decision was that schools are 
no different from when we attended. What a bunch of baloney. The 
government is not recognizing the problems that are coming up and 
how to deal with them. Instead, the government tries to feed the 
problem by allowing this to go on. Not one government member 
will give up their limousine to help. Not one of them will give up 
their pension. They will hang on to that. Why not redirect that 
money into problem areas and help solve these things? It does not 
make sense.
<P>
	When I was in the school system there were ivory towers there as 
well. I was given a budget every year and was told to spend it. At 
the end of one year I had $2,000 left in the physical education 
budget. I was told I had to spend this money or I would lose it. I 
said I did not need it in the physical education budget but I needed 
some math books or something else. I was told no, I had to spend it 
or lose it. That was the mentality at that level of government and it 
exists here.
<P>
	Not too long ago some CIDA workers told me that there was 
$200,000 which they could have turned back into the federal 
government coffers but they were ordered by those in the ivory 
tower to spend it. That does not surprise me. It is what happens at 
every level of government. They figure out some trip, take the 
bureaucrats and away they go.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	I challenge members of the House to stop being politicians and 
think about being statesmen. Start looking at some things they can 
sacrifice or do to help the causes and let us see where it goes. 
Change the attitude to one where they are here to serve the people 
instead of the other way around as it appears because they have to 
have this or that or go here or there. Those are the kinds of things 
people in the communities of this land do not understand and I have 
a hard time understanding them as well.
<P>
	We can stand here talking about the millions of starving children 
who are living in poverty and not do anything about it for two and 
one-half years. Well, there are opportunities to do something. We 
just have to have the political will and the political courage to do 
so.
<P>
	Instead the arrogant Liberals sit over there with their pompous 
little attitudes and let it be known that they are in power and they 
are doing what the people wanted them to do. Well, I am not 
finding that to be the case. I did not find that to be the case when I 
travelled through Manitoba a week ago or in Saskatchewan the 
week before that or when I was on the west coast or in southern 
Ontario. I did not hear the same messages I am hearing from across 
the way.
<P>
	I am not sure how I will be received when I return to Wild Rose 
next week. I will tell my constituents that I know what kind of 
people they are. If there was a huge flood and a region needed help, 
they would be the first to cough up some dollars and give a lending 
hand. No doubt about it, they would help.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> Sounds like Winnipeg to me.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> If farmers needed something in an area because 
of a serious problem, Canadians would be there to help, just like 
the ones in Wild Rose.
<P>
	I can hardly wait to tell them: ``I know all of you need tax relief. 
That is what everybody in Canada would like to have, but you are 
not going to get any this trip. What you are going to do is give tax 
relief to another region of the country through this new GST 
harmonization''. I am not so sure they are going to accept that as 
being a good cause.
<P>
	I am really anxious to find out what my constituents will have to 
say about members from the other side of the House who say it is a 
shame that Alberta does not pay a sales tax. We happen to be pretty 
proud of the fact that we were able to manage things without a sales 
tax. To hear the comment that it is a shame that we do not pay a 
sales tax in Alberta is a pretty sad statement.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> I never said that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I hear the member from Saskatchewan across 
the way saying that he never said that. I never said that he did. I can 
guarantee him that it came from that side but it does not make any 
difference.
<P>
	I know that Alberta is not looking too kindly upon this whole 
idea of harmonization. I know that for a fact. We will wait and see.
<P>
	In conclusion I look at these waste reports that come out and then 
I look at the work the Canadian Taxpayers Association is putting 
together expressing that it does not understand how these dollars 
find their way to strange places. It is just not understood at all. And 
the best we can come up with is another target that even I could 
make if it was a two-foot high jump.
<P>
	This target making is a farce. Get after the problem. The budget 
does not do it. It is a fuzzy, warm, feel good budget. Be happy, I 
guess.
<P>
<B>(1710 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency and Minister of Western Economic Diversification, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has been talking about a tax, 
about a particular manner of handling a tax, and about its effects in 
Alberta, Saskatchewan and other provinces.
<P>
	It is always interesting to hear a Reform member refer to 
taxation but never refer to Reform's so-called budget which it 
presented, the taxpayers budget. The Reform  members' idea of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1980"> 1980 </A></B>
<P>
dealing with matters in Canada is to deal with matters like the 
elimination of multiculturalism funding. They would eliminate 
regional development groups such as western economic 
diversification, an organization that for many western areas of the 
country has resulted in a dynamic expansion in industry and 
secondary processing. They recommend the elimination of regional 
groups in other parts of the country.
<P>
	The Reform budget also includes a reduction in senior citizens 
benefits, reductions in unemployment insurance benefits, 
reductions in funding to post-secondary education, reductions in 
health, reductions in the Canada assistance plan, reductions in 
equalization, total cash transfer reductions to provinces totalling 24 
per cent, which is over and above what I have already referred to.
<P>
	Has the hon. member ever tried to correlate the cuts, the drastic 
slash and burn in the Reform budget to what he is discussing here 
today?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Mr. Speaker, slash and burn is not true, except 
for the hon. member's pension which he will someday be eligible 
for. We would certainly slash and burn that. We think parole boards 
are unnecessary. We would probably slash and burn parole boards. 
We could do with better correctional services. We would slash and 
burn a few other places where dollars are wasted. The member 
could count on that.
<P>
	As far as multiculturalism is concerned, there are a number of 
things in our budget. We set priorities. The priorities were pretty 
well listed. It just so happens that multiculturalism is something we 
believe should be funded by the communities that are affected. I do 
not believe the communities object to that. We do not object to 
multiculturalism but we say we are at a time now when some of the 
nice things to do are not affordable. They will have to be paid for 
by some means other than tax dollars.
<P>
	As far as seniors are concerned, we said from the beginning, and 
our budget says it loudly and clearly, that one of our highest 
priorities is to make absolutely certain those who are most in need 
will have their needs addressed. That is loud and clear in our 
budget. That idea came from many senior citizens in my riding who 
said they did not know why they were being given something that 
was just clawed back and they would just as soon not have that 
happen.
<P>
	As far as the transfer payments are concerned, what has 
happened as a result of this government is worse than what would 
have happened under the taxpayers budget over three years. I 
challenge any of the members over there to go back to square one 
and take a good long close look at what those transfer payments are 
doing.
<P>
	The member talked about post-secondary education. Perhaps I 
was mistaken and there were not thousands of young people on our
<P>
lawns protesting what was  happening by this government in that 
area. Maybe I was elsewhere at the time.
<P>
	I do not quite understand where the government is coming from. 
It is already a known fact that what it has done is worse than what it 
would have been under our plan.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, is the hon. member opposite familiar 
with the name Michael Walker? He has something to do with the 
Fraser Institute, an institute often referred to by the Reform 
members.
<P>
	There was an article in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> on March 14, 1996. I 
remind the hon. member that Michael Walker, one of their great 
folk heroes over the last two years, had this to say about the budget 
which he so roundly criticized:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In regarding the government's latest budget, commentators have missed 
some of the most aggressive fiscal action in the country's history.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The federal government is going in the near term future to be able to boast 
that it has the lowest borrowing requirements of the G-7 countries. Total 
government deficits in Canada will total less than in any of the G-7, and by 1998 
the total financing requirement relative to the gross domestic product will be 
less than half the comparable U.S. figure.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Far from being a bore-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
or worse, as this member suggests
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-this budget was a turning point in Canadian fiscal history. We may well 
chart a dramatic turn in our fortunes to March 1996.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is tough talk from Michael Walker, one of the hon. 
member's heroes.
<P>
	I wonder if you might like to comment on how Michael Walker,, 
who has been so tough on us over the years with respect to our 
budgetary plans, could have this much praise for a budget you think 
is so terrible.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I remind members not to 
directly refer to one another but to make their interventions through 
the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am familiar with Michael 
Walker. I am familiar with the article the member mentioned to me. 
I was wondering at the time I read the article that although the 
deficit figures and all these targets were mentioned why the whole 
idea of this huge debt and the interest payments were not 
mentioned. That is the same question I have been asking all day.
<P>
	Why are government members not talking about the debt? Why 
are they not talking about the interest payments on the debt which 
is growing far beyond what they ever thought it would?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1981"> 1981 </A></B>
<P>
	They are very fortunate. So far things are working well in terms 
of being able to meet these targets. However, when we run into 
that kind of huge debt I really wonder if anybody has anything 
in place or any plans at all, including Michael Walker-and I 
would like to ask him one of these days when I see him-if all 
of a sudden there is a downturn for whatever reason. It could be 
caused by something south of the border which would cause 
interest rates to suddenly jump.
<P>
	With a huge debt like this a downturn could be the very disaster 
we do not ever want to see. The only way to avoid that kind of 
disaster is to stop the debt from growing.
<P>
	The government under its plan is continuing to let the debt grow. 
I cannot understand why any economist or anyone with more 
knowledge than I have, and believe you me there are plenty-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> What do you want to cut?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Your pension, for one.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I am sorry, but this 
concludes the period of question and comments. We also move to 
the next stage of debate, having concluded five hours of debate.
<P>
	It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the House 
that question to be raised tonight at the time adjournment is as 
follows: the hon. member for Davenport, the environment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I always consider it a privilege to 
rise in this place on behalf of the constituents of Hamilton West. 
We are supposed to be dealing in this debate with Bill C-31, an act 
to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament 
March 6, 1996.
<P>
	My constituents elected me back in 1988. My colleague from 
Winnipeg St. James and I were colleagues back in 1988 and we sat 
on that side of the House in opposition. Whenever an opportunity 
came along we were not shy on words or prepared to take off on the 
government on the plan it had.
<P>
<B>(1720 )</B>
<P>
	In those days we had pretty good evidence in our hands; precise 
statistics, precise numbers, precise policies that the Liberal Party, 
in opposition from 1988 to 1993, could attack the Tories on. We sat 
over there, we made our arguments and they were solid.
<P>
	I will drift away from Bill C-31 only because I cannot let the 
comments of the hon. member for Wild Rose get by. First he says 
``pompous attitudes''. I do not see any pompous attitudes coming 
from this side of the House. I see red books being thrown across the 
floor. I see members over there getting up and calling other 
members liars, getting kicked out of the House and that kind of 
thing, which is outrageous.
<P>
	I remember an election promise from the Reform Party that it 
would do things differently in the House of Commons, that there 
would be a certain attitude, a new way of doing politics in the 
House. There would be a new decorum in the House of Commons.
<P>
	I did not understand that it meant the decorum would get worse. I 
assumed it meant the decorum would get a little better in the House 
of Commons.
<P>
	Then the hon. member for Wild Rose says: ``I am not sure, but 
blah, blah, blah. I do not know much about that, but blah, blah, 
blah. That is all fuzzy and feel good to me, blah, blah, blah''. You 
cannot talk in generalities.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Shut up. I do not like you either.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> There we go. There is the decorum again. The hon. 
member for Wild Rose says ``shut up''. That is the kind of thing 
that should not go on in this place. We have a history to respect 
here. We have to stand in our places and appreciate that for decades 
before us men and women were elected to the House, thankfully 
more women today than there were in the past because of the 
contribution they make to the House. This kind of attitude cannot 
go on in the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Blah, blah, blah.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Blah, blah, blah-exactly the kind of comment I 
would expect from Wild Rose. I would appreciate it if he stuck 
around to hear this because it is important.
<P>
	My constituents have been calling me as of late. They are talking 
about how the member for Hamilton West voted for the budget. 
There was a guy from this party who stood up and did not vote for 
the budget, no sir. We all know what happened to him.
<P>
	Here is why the member for Hamilton West, yours truly, voted 
for the budget. I voted for the budget because of its deficit 
reduction plan. For example, the budget delivers on the red book 
commitment to reduce the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP, down from 
6 per cent when we took office, something we promised to do, 
something that has been accomplished.
<P>
	By 1998-99 program spending will be reduced to 12 per cent of 
GDP, its lowest level in 50 years. Canada's financial requirements 
will be the lowest of the G-7 nations.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> How much has interest come down?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> You see, Mr. Speaker, I guess good news hurts. I 
continue with more good news on the budget. Our balanced and fair 
approach has to be recognized, a far cry from what we have been 
hearing over there of let us get that budget down to zero, and the 
sooner the better.
<P>
	I have asked the member for Wild Rose what he would cut. What 
social programs would have to suffer as a result of their mad desire 
to reduce deficit and thereby  the national debt to zero? Canadians 
from coast to coast would endure pain never felt before if those 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1982"> 1982 </A></B>
<P>
kind of programs were implemented to reduce the deficit in an 
unfair and callous way. There is no question about that.
<P>
	What else does the budget do? What did the member for 
Hamilton West and the majority of members on this side of the 
House vote for in the budget? How about no tax increases of any 
kind? What about a secure, stable, growing system of federal 
support for medicare? Medicare, I say to the hon. member 
opposite.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	The provinces will receive post-secondary education and social 
assistance through the Canada health and social transfers. There 
will be no further cuts in transfers to the provinces. We have 
announced a firm funding commitment for a five-year period 
beginning 1998-99.
<P>
	Do colleagues on this side remember when we were in 
opposition how the Tory government would make its promises and 
then make adjustments in the following budget and in the budget 
after that? There could be no opportunity for future planning for 
any of these organizations because they did not know what the 
federal budget would look like from year to year.
<P>
	We will change that. That is a promise we made. They will have 
the opportunity to see a commitment for stable and firm funding 
for a five-year period, which will enable them to make their plans. 
For the first two years of the CHST it will remain constant at $25.1 
billion. For the next three years it will increase.
<P>
	What about restoring confidence in the old age security system 
by creating a seniors benefit designed to help those most in need? 
That was a government promise. That is another reason the 
member for Hamilton West voted for the budget. As promised, 
seniors will continue to receive the benefits they now receive, 
despite the crude and scaremongering remarks made by members 
of the third party during question period on this day.
<P>
	I voted for jobs and growth. We have allocated money for new 
investment in three priority areas, one of which is youth, I remind 
the hon. member for Wild Rose. He was up on his feet saying: ``We 
are not doing anything for youth. I am not sure what we are not 
doing, but we are not doing anything''. We are doing things for 
youth.
<P>
	Areas critical to future jobs and growth are technology and trade. 
The hon. member for Wild Rose was complaining about that, but it 
is there in the budget.
<P>
	What about the provision of an additional $165 million over 
three years to help students and families with increased costs of 
education?
<P>
	It is unfortunate the hon. member opposite says government 
members are doing this in a pompous fashion. Maybe our chests 
are sticking out a bit because we are proud of what we are doing on 
this side. We are  actually accomplishing things and meeting goals 
we promised we would meet when we ran in the 1993 election. 
With a book in hand we said this is what we promise to do. The 
majority of those promises will be met. We will be able to go door 
to door in an election campaign and say this is what we promised to 
do.
<P>
	I know the media will be out there. It will not outline our 
accomplishments, maybe comparing the accomplishments of this 
government with the last. It will not say this is how much the 
government has done. The media will see the glass not as half full 
but as half empty. It will recognize the 10 per cent or less the 
government did not do. That is a crying shame.
<P>
	Canadians are winning. It is a Team Canada approach. It will 
happen. It will happen now. We are proud of that and we are proud 
of the budget.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will talk 
briefly if I may about our institutions and democracy as well, 
which have just become much less credible.
<P>
	All these government members did when in opposition was 
condemn the GST. They coined words, lashed out against it, but not 
only did they not scrap it, they are now harmonizing it and creating 
inequities between the provinces in the process.
<P>
	I had prepared a long speech. Unfortunately, I have only two 
minutes left. Let me just tell you that I find the attitude taken by the 
government in this debate most regrettable. It will do considerable 
harm to ours institutions' and our democracy's credibility.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, seconded by my colleague, the hon. member for 
Argenteuil-Papineau, I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the amendment be amended by adding after the word ``That'' the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``as promised before and after the October 1993 federal election''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The amendment to the 
amendment is in order. When we resume debate, we will proceed to 
the next stage and consider the amendment to the amendment, as 
moved by the hon. member for Longueuil.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the flag on Parliament Hill be lowered to half 
mast on April 28 each year to commemorate the National Day of Mourning for 
those killed in the workplace, a policy that is permitted under paragraph 13(d) of 
the general rules for flying and displaying the Canadian flag and other flags in 
Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to present for debate 
Motion No. 73 which calls on the House to express its will in 
support of flying the flag on Parliament Hill at half mast on April 
28 each year to commemorate a national day of mourning for those 
killed in the workplace.
<P>
	I point out that this important day, April 28, is only three days 
away. I cannot think of a better opportunity for parliamentarians to 
see immediate and direct results of our work here in this Chamber. 
Should we agree today that the flag should be flown at half mast 
then this weekend it is possible that our will shall be done.
<P>
	I do not have to tell any member of the House that this is a very 
serious issue. Deaths in Canada from traumatic injury in the 
workplace are approximately 1,000 every year. If the number of 
deaths which occur from industrial diseases are added in, which by 
the way are not measured by Statistics Canada or Labour Canada, 
then the number of deaths jump to between 6,000 and 10,000 a 
year.
<P>
	On the job injuries recorded by provincial workers compensation 
boards run between 80,000 to 100,000 a year. Of course the 
numbers do fluctuate from year to year. They are probably 
dropping right now, not because the workplace is any safer but 
rather because of the general drop in employment.
<P>
	For all intents and purposes, on average one Canadian worker 
out of every thirteen is injured at work. Unfortunately, close to 
17,000 workers between the ages of 15 and 19 are injured each 
year. Young people within our economy who we expect so much of 
in the future are finding themselves injured in the workplace due to 
circumstances beyond their control.
<P>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	We have to understand that worker health and safety means 
money to the economy and our communities. Time lost injuries 
rose 1.4 per cent from 1993 to 1994. At the same time, Canadian 
workers were increasing the number of hours they were on the job. 
Experts tell us that longer hours lead directly to deteriorating safety 
standards.
<P>
	This even is noticeable on the farm where many farm safety 
programs are run every year to alert people to the fact that long 
hours during seeding and harvest can sometimes lead to injuries in 
that workplace. Obviously the experience there carries over into 
the industrial workplace as well.
<P>
	In 1993, workers compensation boards in Canada paid out $5.2 
billion in benefits. That shows this means  money. With the 
addition of indirect costs, such as training replacement workers 
when a worker has been killed or injured on the job, loss of 
productivity, damage to equipment and materials and lowered 
morale, the annual total cost of occupation injuries to the Canadian 
economy could be closer to $10.5 billion every year.
<P>
	Members should recall that April 28 is already the national day 
of mourning. Royal assent of this act of Parliament took place in 
February 1991. Members will realize that I am not asking for April 
28 to be declared a national day of mourning. It has already been 
declared a national day of mourning by Parliament. I am simply 
asking that in recognition of the day that the flag on Parliament Hill 
be lowered to half mast on April 28.
<P>
	For the last six years there have been some attempts to have the 
flag on this building lowered to half mast to ensure that there is a 
visual representation of this important day. Over the years there has 
been a small problem in achieving that goal and that is why this 
motion is before us today.
<P>
	Just to back up for a moment, we should thank a former NDP 
member of Parliament, Mr. Rod Murphy of Manitoba, whose 
private member's bill did lead us to this official declaration of a 
day of mourning. Mr. Murphy worked very hard to get this 
legislation passed in 1991. Now that it has been passed, we have 
the responsibility and obligation to take the inevitable next step.
<P>
	I also want to mention that April 28 was chosen as the day of 
remembrance because it was the day that third reading took place 
for the first comprehensive workers compensation act in Canada. 
That first workers compensation act was proclaimed in Ontario on 
April 28, 1914.
<P>
	The movement toward the official national declaration began in 
1984 when on behalf of all Canadian workers, the Canadian Labour 
Congress executive council formalized the matter and began to 
work toward the national declaration which was finally achieved in 
1991.
<P>
	The aim of the day of mourning is to remember our commitment 
to fight for those in the workplace, as well as to mourn for those 
who have died.
<P>
	It should be noted that the reason for this motion today is that 
despite the intention of Parliament to recognize the importance of 
the day, those who interpret the rules or protocol for flying the flag 
tell us that it cannot be flown at half mast unless we specifically ask 
for it.
<P>
	I researched the issue and studied it closely. I have looked at the 
official protocol for flying the flag and discovered that according to 
the general rules for flying and displaying the Canadian flag and 
other flags in Canada, the flag can be lowered to half mast if we 
collectively ask for it to be done.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1984"> 1984 </A></B>
<P>
	Let me just read from the protocol rules so that all members 
of the Chamber and the public watching will know exactly what 
I mean. Originally published by the Department of the Secretary 
of State, the document is called ``General Rules for Flying and 
Displaying the Canadian Flag and other Flags in Canada'' .With 
regard to half masting, section 13(a) of the protocol reads in part: 
``subject to (c) and (e) or special instructions listed under 
(d)''-which I will come to in a moment-``the flag on the Peace 
Tower of the Parliament Buildings, Ottawa is flown at half mast 
on the death of-''. The protocol goes on to list a number of 
individuals for whom the flag can be flown at half mast, for 
example, the death of the sovereign or a member of the royal 
family, the Governor General, a member of the Senate or a 
member of the House of Commons, et cetera.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	However, section 13(d) of the protocol says: ``Flags flown at 
federal buildings and other locations are also half masted subject to 
special instructions on the death of-some other person whom it is 
desired to honour''. That is the specific section I refer to in the 
motion before us.
<P>
	The key words are the flag can be flown at half mast ``on the 
death of some other person whom it is desired to honour''. We in 
this Chamber would be proclaiming that ``some other person'' 
could refer to those who were killed in the workplace.
<P>
	Therefore, I ask that Parliament recognize this important 
distinction. If the Parliament of today agrees, we would have a 
declaration which would result in a visible illustration of our 
feelings.
<P>
	There are many examples throughout the country of how worker 
health and safety has been overlooked or abused. It is very 
important that as members of Parliament we express the feeling 
both verbally and visually that lack of worker health and safety 
protocol can no longer be condoned.
<P>
	In this regard I have also followed the public inquiry into the the 
Westray mine disaster in Nova Scotia. With every news report of 
that inquiry, my resolve to deal with this issue increased. The 
Westray story shows us in a most unfortunate but dramatic way that 
everything the deregulators and the right wing in this country tell 
us about business can result in loss of life.
<P>
	When an industry is deregulated and the people responsible do 
not take these matters seriously and do not act quickly on health 
and safety issues, people in this country can die. In fact, they have 
died. As those numbers at the beginning of my presentation today 
indicate, too many workers in Canada lose their lives in the 
workplace doing the jobs that we want to have done because they 
increase the productivity of our economy.
<P>
	I look at other news and view the world around me with this in 
mind. I cannot help but notice a lot of other  things that affect this 
issue. I see in the quest for deficit reduction and in reaching 
international trade agreements, a constant move toward less 
government regulation, less involvement of government inspectors 
within workplaces and less enforcement.
<P>
	Many workers, hammered by the constant threat of job loss 
through plant closures, privatization, restructuring and layoffs, are 
reluctant to speak out against unsafe working conditions simply 
because they are afraid of losing their job or losing the jobs of all of 
the people they work with. We must ensure those people feel 
comfortable with saying this is an unsafe workplace, we have to do 
something about it. Government has to be prepared within a more 
regulated system to step in and say: ``This has to be improved. We 
cannot afford to allow these unsafe conditions to continue''.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	In this regard, Canadians need to continue to work together to 
gain better protection in the law. We have to be better informed 
about what presently exists. I want to quote briefly from Rod 
Murphy's comments in the House of Commons in October 1990 
when he first introduced the motion that made April 28 the national 
day of mourning. Mr. Murphy argued that economic progress in 
Canada could not be achieved at the expense of the health and 
safety of workers and that by recognizing the day of mourning we 
were reminding ourselves of that fact regularly.
<P>
	Mr. Murphy said: ``I am sure that hon. members will agree with 
me that we are no longer in the era of the beginning of the industrial 
revolution. We no longer accept sweatshops. We no longer accept 
child labour and we can no longer accept unsafe working 
conditions for our citizens. We must all take the steps we can to 
promote safer working environments. We believe that the health 
and welfare of our people matters a great deal to all of us. Let us 
ensure that on April 28 every year we prove that''.
<P>
	As members can see, it is not a day of celebration. It is a day to 
look around to see what we can do to ensure that those who have 
died or who have been injured in the workplace have taught us the 
appropriate lessons. What can we be doing to reduce the number of 
people who die or are injured in the workplace? What can we do to 
ensure that our workplaces are safer? We can answer those 
questions as we look at the workplace with those questions in mind.
<P>
	If we know that April 28 is the day of mourning, we can think 
about it. If we do not know the significance of April 28, if we or our 
friends in the media notice that the flag on the Peace Tower is 
flying at half mast, we may ask why. By answering the question as 
to why the flag is flying at half mast, more people will understand 
and perhaps will be motivated by the purpose of the day of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1985"> 1985 </A></B>
<P>
mourning. That is why it is not only important but also  useful to fly 
the flag at half mast this Sunday and on every April 28 thereafter.
<P>
	In this regard and in concluding my remarks today, I ask 
members to give their complete attention to this issue and to 
support it if they can. Perhaps at the end of the allotted hour today 
we could by unanimous consent pass this motion as presented.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to take part in the debate 
on the hon. member's motion calling on the government to lower 
the flag to half mast on April 28 each year to commemorate the 
national day of mourning for those killed in the workplace. I say to 
the hon. member that the Government of Canada very much 
respects his views on this matter and fully acknowledges that 
workplace deaths and injuries are a senseless tragedy. I personally 
congratulate the hon. member for bringing this matter to the 
attention of the House.
<P>
	Having said that, the government shows considerable 
compassion and concern for the health and safety of Canadian 
workers. There is considerable evidence to that effect. Our federal 
occupational safety and health regulations and those of our 
provincial and territorial colleagues are among some of the very 
best in the world.
<P>
	Because of those regulations, Canada is highly regarded in the 
international community. Other nations have drawn on our 
expertise to develop their own safety and health regimes. We can 
attribute a good deal of this success to our approach, which is based 
upon the internal responsibility system. It is a regulatory 
framework similar to provisions contained in the International 
Labour Organization convention 155 which deals with OSH 
regulations.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	This system recognizes that an employer has the right to manage 
his or her enterprise in an effective manner. At the same the 
employer has the responsibility to protect the safety and health of 
his or her workers. The internal responsibility system also 
recognizes three fundamental rights of workers. They are the right 
to participate, the right to know, and the right to refuse dangerous 
work. These longstanding concepts are the foundation upon which 
the occupational safety and health system is built.
<P>
	It is not only the employers who have the responsibilities. Under 
the internal responsibility system Canadian employees have a 
responsibility. The responsibility is to follow safe work practices, 
to use personal protective equipment when required, and to report 
unsafe working conditions to their employers.
<P>
	At the same time, the foundation upon which the system 
functions can be seen in the roles of federal, provincial and 
territorial authorities. It is their responsibility to help ensure 
compliance, to monitor and  to audit how both parties fulfil their 
responsibilities and to address matters of non-compliance. In other 
words our occupational safety and health system has three partners: 
employers, employees and government. All three have rights as 
well as legal responsibilities to ensure a safe and healthy work 
environment.
<P>
	Here is one fine example of what can be achieved when partners 
with a vested interest work together. Hon. members are likely 
familiar with the workplace hazardous materials information 
system, more commonly known as WHMIS. WHMIS is the result 
of collaboration between federal, provincial and territorial 
governments. It is the result of these governments consulting over 
several years with industry and labour and what a result it is.
<P>
	I mentioned a moment ago that we are world leaders in 
occupational health and safety. WHMIS is the most advanced 
information system of its kind in the world. WHMIS has enabled us 
to establish a uniform identification system for dangerous 
ingredients in the workplace. It ensures that hazardous materials 
are adequately labelled by suppliers who must use standard criteria. 
That is not all. Through the communications component of 
WHMIS, workers learn how to handle hazardous materials safely 
and employers are given the information they need to train their 
workers in the proper use of hazardous materials.
<P>
	For employees to participate effectively in developing clean and 
safe work environments, they must recognize what is going on, 
understand changes that occur and grasp a plethora of information. 
WHMIS plays an important role in achieving these objectives. It is 
an information system Canadians should be very proud of.
<P>
	Nevertheless, just because we have developed a dependable 
occupational safety and health system, that does not mean we are 
resting on our laurels. Not at all. In its own way the government is 
fully supporting the noble intent of this worthy motion brought 
forward by the hon. member from The Battlefords-Meadow Lake.
<P>
	We are currently reviewing the Canada Labour Code including 
part II which contains the federal occupational safety and health 
requirements. This comprehensive review began in 1993. A 
tripartite committee comprised of knowledgeable individuals from 
labour, management and government is considering more than 200 
proposed changes brought forward by representatives from these 
three groups.
<P>
	The overall aim of the review is to modernize the code and 
ensure its continuing efficiency. The context in which the review 
has been carried out reflects the changing role of government, that 
is, less intervention and more emphasis on the responsibility of 
employers and employees to manage safety and health measures in 
the workplace.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1986"> 1986 </A></B>
<P>
	Again, the theme of productive partnerships runs through the 
review. Proposed changes will facilitate greater co-operation 
among partners in the workplace to resolve occupational safety 
and health issues. I am pleased to inform hon. members that the 
review is proceeding on schedule.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	In summing up, I would like to outline for my hon. colleagues 
the strategic directions in which the federal government is now 
embarking with regard to occupational safety and health.
<P>
	We are striving for greater co-operation among federal, 
provincial and territorial governments with regard to occupational 
safety and health.
<P>
	On compliance, we are strengthening the internal responsibility 
system by promoting greater employer responsibility for 
occupational safety and health and ensuring that workers and their 
representatives are able to become more actively involved in 
protecting their safety and health.
<P>
	On information, sound decisions can only be based on a clear 
understanding of the issues. We are supporting effective ways of 
providing OSH information, education and training to employers 
and employees. We are promoting greater awareness of 
occupational safety and health across the country.
<P>
	It is important to monitor effectiveness so we are developing 
performance indicators to assess the outcome of implementing 
occupational safety and health standards nationwide. We are 
actively participating in improving the standardized framework to 
collect, to code and to classify information on workplace injuries 
and illnesses.
<P>
	On partnerships, productive collaboration is the key to sound 
results. To that end we are striving to maximize the effective 
involvement of everyone concerned with occupational safety and 
health decision making. That includes the most efficient use of 
limited resources and valuable expertise.
<P>
	I empathize completely with the tragedy of workers who have 
been killed or injured on the job. I commend the hon. member for 
bringing safety and health concerns to the attention of the House 
and the general public. I can think of no issue that rates greater 
concern than the safety and health of Canadian workers.
<P>
	The federal government is committed to preventing occupational 
accidents and injuries and to strengthening internal responsibility 
within workplaces. I assure the hon. member that the federal 
government will continue to move in that direction.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am somewhat surprised by the speech of our friend, the 
parliamentary secretary to the minister. I also want to make it clear 
that the Bloc Quebecois supports  the hon. member's motion. It is 
not enough to wish to review the Canada Labour Code, as the 
government pledged to do. As a society, we must strive to achieve a 
balance between legislation and symbols.
<P>
	The NDP member is asking us to remember that people who 
were working in a workplace that was not as safe as it should have 
been lost their lives.
<P>
	Let me tell you about a personal experience. Before becoming an 
MP, I was executive assistant to the current Quebec minister of 
employment and consultation. Barely one week into my new 
job-and still very much excited about it-I met a mother whom I 
will never forget. I had never seen her before. She was in her early 
forties. A single mother, she told me that her 18 year old son-he 
could have been your son or the parliamentary secretary's 
son-was dead.
<P>
	He had died at work. I clearly remember that he worked on 
Notre-Dame street, for a company that builds frames for paintings. 
He was driving a lift truck. This was in January. On the way to the 
shipping department, the lift truck tipped and the worker was 
killed.
<P>
	This is not a rare occurrence. I got interested in this issue 
because, in Quebec, we asked for a coroner's inquest. An inquest 
was held and we realized that the whole issue of handling and 
driving lift trucks in the workplace needed to be regulated. If these 
regulations had been in place earlier, working conditions would 
have been safer and Mrs. Poulin's son would probably still be with 
us.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary says that the government will 
proceed with a review of the Labour Code. This is fine and we are 
looking forward to participating in this exercise. How should a 
potential revision of the Labour Code prevent us from making a 
highly symbolic gesture and expressing in very practical terms our 
solidarity with workers who have been killed on the job?
<P>
	I think some effort must be made, mathematically, to try to 
understand this phenomenon, because, once again, it is not 
exceptional. It is all very well to be in a society with labour laws. It 
is all very well to be in a society with occupational health and 
safety committees. It is all very well to have part II of the Labour 
Code, which governs the whole area of occupational health and 
safety. The figures remain very disturbing indeed.
<P>
	I looked for a more in-depth analysis of the type of accident and 
of the sort of people at risk or who lose their life at the workplace, 
and I came up with the following figures. Every five working days, 
in other words every week, in areas of federal jurisdiction, because 
this is what we are talking about, a worker dies. So, in this 
particular week, there is a statistical chance a worker who got up 
this morning and went to work will die, because he is in an unsafe 
workplace or because of a whole lot of other factors. However, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1987"> 1987 </A></B>
<P>
fact remains  that, in Canada, in 1996, once a week a worker will 
lose his life at the workplace.
<P>
	Every two minutes, again in Canada, in federal jurisdiction, a 
worker is injured. Obviously the extent of the injury varies, but the 
fact remains that, every two minutes, in Canada, in businesses 
under federal jurisdiction, a worker is injured. As a result, 57,000 
workers are injured or killed in accidents every year.
<P>
	Is it too much to ask ourselves as members of Parliament to 
make a gesture, to remind ourselves that we, as parliamentarians, 
have not made every effort, taken every step so that we can rise 
today and say that there are no work accidents in Canada, that no 
one has died because of a disregard for safety in the workplace.
<P>
	As the hon. member from the NDP pointed out, it is not only a 
matter of life-although it is, of course, our first concern. Work 
accidents also have an impact on a country's economic health.
<P>
	According to the Department of Labour, which is headed by the 
hon. member for Saint-Léonard, a total of $100 million-which is 
a substantial amount of money; it is not an epiphenomenon or 
marginal reality-is paid in compensation to workers who cannot 
earn a salary as a result of an accident. We must do something 
about this.
<P>
	There is another figure I find interesting: reducing by one day 
the average amount of time lost per accident in an area of federal 
jurisdiction-this should be of interest to the President of the 
Treasury Board and the Minister of Finance-could save $2.6 
million a year in compensation costs.
<P>
	Of course, one of the merits of the motion tabled by the member 
from the NDP is that it makes us realize we still have some way to 
go to make the workplace totally safe.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	It also reminds us that people lose their lives while trying to earn 
a living and that, as a society, we cannot tolerate such a situation. 
One of the means suggested to us for showing that we will not 
tolerate it to keep it fresh in our minds.
<P>
	One of the means of keeping it in our fresh in our minds is, of 
course, through some visible sign. It has great significance for a 
country-as you know, in this country there are many nations-it 
really means something to have a flag at half mast. Flying a flag at 
half mast means that, instead of an isolated action, we are inviting 
people collectively to remember.
<P>
	And what we have to remember is that still in Canada-although 
in the past too there were people who lost their lives while trying to 
earn a living, even before the days of industrialization-still in 
1996, not a week goes by, according to the Department of 
Labour-not the NDP member, not the Bloc, not the CSN, not the 
FTQ, but the Department of Labour, under the direction of the  hon. 
member for Saint-Léonard-not a single week goes by without a 
workplace death.
<P>
	There are financial repercussions to all this. The estimated 
amount of payments to injured workers, not unemployed workers, 
is $100 million. This reality of work related accidents and fatalities 
affects the private sector particularly, yes, but it also affects crown 
corporations and the various federal departments.
<P>
	I have a few figures to submit to you concerning the reality in the 
federal workplace. According to the Department of Labour, every 
50 working days, one worker in a crown corporation or a federal 
department dies. Every nine minutes, one worker in a crown 
corporation or a federal department is injured. This means an 
annual total of 12,800 workers involved in accidents, sometimes 
fatal ones. This amounts to $23 million.
<P>
	Twenty-three million dollars is exactly the amount of the deficit 
in the government's current operating account. Twenty-three 
million dollars are paid out in benefits to replace lost income as the 
result of accidents. In total, this represents 239,000 working days 
lost due to accidents.
<P>
	Have you ever considered that, in Canada, the greatest cause of 
days lost at work or of lack of productivity at the workplace is not 
strikes. It is in fact accidents on the job that, once again, in too 
many cases mean people lose their lives.
<P>
	We support this motion. This does not prevent us from 
mentioning for the benefit of our listeners that we are not starting 
from scratch. Part II of the Labour Code sets out employers' 
obligations. It provides very clearly that employers must ensure the 
health and safety of their employees.
<P>
	It also provides that employees are not to handle dangerous 
products and are to advise their immediate superiors of any 
situation that might compromise workers' safety.
<P>
	We must remember, nevertheless, despite these clear provisions 
in part II of the Canada Labour Code that-and we must not forget 
this; I cannot say it often or long enough-every week in Canada a 
worker dies as the result of an accident on the job. The costs are 
very high in economic terms, and we as parliamentarians must do 
everything in our power to put a stop to this situation.
<P>
	One particular way, as the member is proposing, is to remember. 
One way to remember is to lower the flag to half mast-a very 
powerful symbol.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
motion before us today calls for the flag on Parliament Hill to be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1988"> 1988 </A></B>
<P>
lowered to half mast on April 28 of  each year the commemorate a 
national day of mourning for people killed in the workplace.
<P>
	I am pleased to speak in support of this initiative. I commend the 
hon. member for The Battlefords-Meadow Lake for bringing it 
forth today.
<P>
	There probably is not anyone in the House who has not known 
someone who has been killed on the job. While driving through my 
constituency a few weeks back I came across a procession of 
people who had gathered at the site of where a friend of theirs, a 
taxi driver, had been killed. While on a call he was struck by 
another vehicle. The road conditions were icy at the time. Those 
people put up a large cross at the site of the accident. They covered 
the cross with flowers and left it there. As far as I know it is still 
there.
<P>
	I suppose they did this for various reasons. One was to 
commemorate this person who was simply doing his job and who 
met with a very untimely and costly accident. Another reason 
would be to remind other motorists who travel along that route that 
they have to be ever vigilant.
<P>
	I am sure that is what the member for The Battlefords-Meadow 
Lake is trying to accomplish today. I commend him for that.
<P>
	Before being elected to the House in 1993 I was a farmer. As a 
matter of fact, I still am. Generally I suppose people would assume 
farming is a very placid way of life, a laid back lifestyle with not 
much danger involved. However, farming is the most hazardous 
occupation in Canada.
<P>
	From information provided to me by the Canadian Federation of 
Agriculture based on a survey done by the United States and 
adjusted to the Canadian agricultural population, the average death 
rate among industries is something like 11 per 100,000, but the 
farm death rate is five times higher. It is 55 deaths per 100,000. 
That surpasses mining with around 50 deaths per 100,000. 
Construction is in the neighbourhood of 37 per 100,000.
<P>
	Between 1990 and 1994 in my home province of Alberta there 
were 82 farm fatalities. Farming also has the dubious honour of 
topping the list with the highest incidence of disabling injuries of 
all industries in Canada with 58 per 100,000.
<P>
	In my youth I spent some years trucking. It may not be well 
known, but truckers will take evasive action to avoid collision with 
other vehicles to the point that they put life and limb on the line, so 
to speak, to avoid collision with other vehicles. In so doing, 
truckers have often avoided a vehicle full of people but they have 
paid very dearly. They have driven off the road, upset their vehicles 
or collided with approaching vehicles and paid with their lives.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	When we are asked to reflect on the loss of life in the workplace 
we automatically think back about four years  to May 9, 1992 when 
Canadians from coast to coast watched heroic attempts to rescue 26 
trapped coal miners from the Westray mine in Plymouth, Nova 
Scotia. Twenty-six Canadians lost their lives in one of the worst 
workplace disasters in recent memory.
<P>
	The conditions at the Westray mine that led to the explosion are 
currently the subject of an inquiry. One of the questions being 
asked is whether or not health and safety laws had been enforced.
<P>
	I take exception to my colleague from The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake who suggests that private enterprise 
makes conditions unfavourable or unsafe for workers. If we look at 
the more socialized countries, their workplace death rates are 
nothing to brag about either. While I agree with the general thrust 
of the member's bill, I admonish him for dragging that kind of 
politics into it.
<P>
	The federal government is on the right track in some areas. It has 
put these jurisdictions under provincial control. I believe that is a 
move in the right direction. There is probably unnecessary 
duplication and overlap by provincial and federal jurisdictions. I 
would encourage this government to divest itself of areas in which 
it is not needed and to turn these areas over to the provinces where 
they may be administered better than they are now.
<P>
	Workers in federally regulated industries are bound by the 
provisions of Part III of the labour code. Provinces have their own 
laws for occupational health and safety which differ from place to 
place. As I said, the federal government should take the initiative 
and divest itself of those areas.
<P>
	The <I>Canada Gazette</I> of April 17, 1996 outlines the government's 
plan to extricate itself from setting the minimum wage rate which 
is a step in the right direction. More effort is needed to harmonize 
federal-provincial labour regulations.
<P>
	For the past year a review of Part I of the labour code has been 
under way and amendments are expected this fall. I hope a review 
of Part II and Part III will soon follow. Yesterday we debated the 
possibility of severance pay for older workers, an issue brought 
forward by my colleague from the Reform Party. The debate 
indicated that Part III could use some review. As a result of my 
colleague's efforts, the subject matter has been referred to a 
committee. I am sure we will make some headway in that area.
<P>
	Preliminary statistics for 1994, which is the last year available, 
show that there were 709 workplace related fatalities in that year. 
Seventy-four of those occurred in my province of Alberta. Whether 
workplace fatalities claim one life or twenty-six, they are 
devastating not only to family and friends of the deceased but to 
their co-workers and employers as well.
<P>

<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	Workers make this country productive. We have to do our utmost 
to ensure that workplace health and safety standards are not 
compromised. Lowering the flag is not only a symbolic gesture. I 
am sure, as I said at the beginning, that what the hon. member 
intends to accomplish is to provoke thought and to bring about 
prevention.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roger Simmons (Burin-St. George's, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first let me commend my friend from The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake for his initiative in putting down this 
resolution. It is a very good one. I am pleased to rise, as did my 
colleague from Hillsborough earlier and others in the House, 
including my friend from Wetaskiwin, to give support to this 
motion.
<P>
	In the riding of Burin-St. George's, which I have the honour to 
represent, there is a very picturesque community by the name of St. 
Lawrence. It takes its name from the fact that it sits at the very 
mouth of the Gulf of St. Lawrence.
<P>
	That town has a sculpture, which serves as a monument to two or 
three sets of events. It is a marvellous sculpture done by the 
Bulgarian sculptor, Luben Boykov, three or four years ago. It 
stands in the town square.
<P>
	For those of us who understand biblical references, though never 
described this way, it is in effect the good Samaritan sculpture. 
There is a person reaching out for help at the bottom of the slab, 
which represents a steep incline, and there is somebody offering 
help.
<P>
	I do not do justice in describing the sculpture but basically, 
physically, that is what it is. It commemorates a couple of sets of 
events: one has to do with wartime. That in itself is a very moving 
set of events in which many American servicemen were rescued by 
miners at St. Lawrence and the nearby town of Lawn in 1942.
<P>
	The sculpture was placed there not only for that reason, but for a 
second important reason. It has to do with mining. The sculpture 
known as ``Echoes of Valour'' casts in time the mining disaster, of 
which many Newfoundlanders, indeed many Canadians, will be 
aware.
<P>
	Let me read an excerpt from a description of the ``Echoes of 
Valour'' sculpture as it relates to mining. It makes reference, first 
of all, to mining beginning in this community around 1870. It has 
gone on in the 100 years since then.
<P>
	Here is a description:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Drilling was done with a dry hammer, which meant that dust was forever 
present, clogging a miner's nostrils, eyes and mouth. The dust and smoke was so 
thick that one could not see another miner until you walked right up to him. The air 
was so thin in certain parts of the mine that a cigarette could not be lit because fire, 
which requires oxygen, would immediately go out as attempts were made to light 
the match. Many miners were  getting sick, having great difficulty breathing. 
Some were hospitalized at St. John's with tuberculosis.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In the 1950s, miners started dying at a very young age. Dr. Cyril Walsh 
detected a high rate of lung cancer and brought it to the attention of the 
provincial Department of Health. This spirited a national concern, but it was 
already too late for hundreds of miners who had been exposed too much, too 
long to the radon gas, which causes lung cancer.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>St. Lawrence today has lost a generation of men from mining, leaving a town 
void of grandfathers. This sculpture stands as a tribute and a memorial to their 
hard work and dedication as they sacrificed their own lives to ensure a 
comfortable lifestyle for their wives and children.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That tragedy, which went on for many years, is, in 
Newfoundland folklore, the epitome of what can happen when 
things go wrong on the work site, when the bottom line becomes 
more important than the lives of the people producing the product.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	If I had the time today I could take members through a long 
litany of how the company knew for years what it was inflicting on 
those men and turned a blind eye, looked the other way.
<P>
	Today when people go to that town in St. Lawrence not only will 
they see the sculpture but they will meet dozens and dozens of 
widows whose husbands are prematurely in the graveyard because 
of company policy and a complete disregard for worker safety.
<P>
	Today that sculpture, as a result of a decision a couple of years 
ago, is the official symbol for the industrial safety organization 
across Newfoundland. On this coming Sunday afternoon I am 
pleased to say I will be in St. Lawrence, standing beside that 
sculpture with people from all across the province as we once again 
mark the day of mourning for the people who have lost their lives at 
the work site.
<P>
	Nowhere in the country is the impact of lost workers felt more 
deeply, more emotionally and more profoundly than in that town of 
St. Lawrence, that picturesque settlement on the south coast of 
Newfoundland on the Burin Peninsula.
<P>
	Today that is why I, on behalf of my constituents, can rise with a 
heart and a half and give support to the resolution from my friend 
from The Battlefords-Meadow Lake. We have not done enough 
for these people. We cannot bring them back but we can at least 
signal the contribution they made. We can at least once again flag 
the tragedy that is really ours because of the lack of attention to 
worker safety over the years.
<P>
	In flying that flag at half mast let it be a reminder of the lives that 
were lost and a standard and a beacon for us to resolve as a society 
that we will not let again happen what happened to people like 
those miners in St. Lawrence.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1990"> 1990 </A></B>
<P>
	If we had time we could talk about Westray. I know the inquiry 
is ongoing and so we should not be prejudicing anything that goes 
on there, but I do not think one needs to be Einstein to figure out 
the bottom line there was also more important than worker safety 
in too many cases.
<P>
	We must see to it that kind of thing does not repeat itself. If we 
are worth our salt in the Chamber we will not only go out and 
exhort people to put flags at half mast on Sunday in memory of 
those people but we will use that as a reminder that we have to do 
even more in symbolic terms and in tangible terms.
<P>
	If we can resolve as a society to do that, these people will not 
have died completely in vain if they can, through the effort and 
inspiration they give us, improve the lot of others who go to work 
sites which are not as safe as they ought to be.
<P>
	I am delighted to support the resolution.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am overwhelmed with the amount of 
support members have given to this motion. It begs me to ask, now 
that the debate is closing, that you may find it in order to seek 
unanimous consent that the question be put so that the members 
who have spoken in support of the motion have the opportunity to 
express that support in a vote. Then perhaps we will be able to see 
the flag flying at half mast three days from now in illustration of 
our will in support of these individuals.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THEENVIRONMENT">THE ENVIRONMENT</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on page 
64 of the red book of the Liberal Party published in 1993 we find 
the following promise:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Our first task will be to conduct a comprehensive baseline study of federal 
taxes, grants, and subsidies, in order to identify barriers and disincentives to 
sound environmental practices.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Last December when we reported to the House, the Standing 
Committee on the Environment and Sustainable Development did 
hold hearings in keeping  this promise and made numerous 
recommendations to the government for the 1996 budget.
<P>
	One positive result was that the budget contains measures for 
beginning the process of putting renewable and non-renewable 
energy sources on equal footing. That is a good step in the right 
direction.
<P>
	At the time of the committee's hearings experts in the field of 
sustainable development told us one year would be sufficient for 
completion of such a study and warned against stretching it over a 
longer time.
<P>
	Another reason for the year timeframe is that soon we will have 
in place a commissioner of the environment and sustainable 
development in the auditor general's department. In 1998 the job of 
this person will be to review each department's sustainable 
development strategy.
<P>
	If this baseline work is done now departments would be able to 
incorporate the relevant findings into their sustainable 
development strategies. In addition, this work would provide a 
benchmark to judge progress toward sustainable development 
objectives in individual departments.
<P>
	The environment committee recommended the finance minister 
appoint a small group of outside experts, supported by senior 
federal officials taken from the departments of the environment, 
finance, natural resources, agriculture and transport, among others. 
This working group would be chaired by a recognized and credible 
expert in sustainable development matters charged with the 
authority to make definitive recommendations on behalf of the 
working group. This approach to the baseline work would provide 
substantive proposals plus transparency and legitimacy in the eyes 
of the public.
<P>
	I ask the distinguished Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Finance if the government will launch the comprehensive 
baseline study now so as to be completed by September of this 
year, as recommended by the environment committee, or will it be 
the turn of the century before we see any results?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to respond to the hon. 
member for Davenport who is held in such high regard by many in 
the House, given his interest and expertise in areas concerning the 
environment.
<P>
	As the Minister of Finance indicated to the House on March 26, 
the government initiated work on a baseline study of taxes, grants 
and subsidies in 1994. At that time the government established the 
task force on economic instruments and disincentives to sound 
environmental practices which made recommendations.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1991"> 1991 </A></B>
<P>
	The 1994 budget announced measures to encourage energy 
conservation and encourage contributions to mine  reclamation 
funds. The 1995 budget announced measures to encourage 
charitable donations of ecologically sensitive land. The 1996 
budget announced tax changes which establish an essentially level 
playing field between certain renewable and non-renewable energy 
investments.
<P>
	The 1996 budget also indicated the government's intention to 
consult on tax and other measures to improve the treatment of 
energy efficiency investments and on the feasibility of extending 
the tax treatment of mine reclamation trust funds to other sectors 
such as waste disposal sites and reforestation.
<P>
	In addition, Technology Partnerships Canada, launched in the 
recent budget, will encourage the development and 
commercialization of environmental technologies in partnership 
with the private sector.
<P>
	As the Minister of Finance indicated to the House on March 26, 
the government is actively reviewing the proposals of the 
standingcommittee concerning further work on the baseline study 
and will be reporting shortly on how it intends to continue the 
important work which has been initiated 
<P>
	The government also appreciates the work of the standing 
committee, its chairman and all members of the House on this 
important matter.
<P>
	On a personal note, I hope this will be before the year 2000.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The motion to adjourn the 
House is now deemed adopted. Accordingly, this House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 
24.

	(The House adjourned at 6.36 p.m.)
