	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing, NDP)</B> 
moved for leave to introduce Bill C-363, an act to amend the 
Criminal Code (juvenile prostitution).
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise today to 
introduce this private member's bill for first reading. It provides 
that a Canadian citizen be tried in Canada where that citizen has 
sexually exploited children overseas.
<P>
	We all know there is a multibillion dollar sex trade, particularly 
in Asia. Other countries, in particular the United Kingdom and 
Sweden, have taken measures to ensure that their citizens who 
commit crimes against children, which is surely one of the most 
heinous crimes we can imagine, are tried in their home country.
<P>
	Article 35 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, 
which Canada was instrumental in implementing, states that 
governments have the obligation to ensure that children are 
protected from all forms of sexual exploitation.
<P>
	I recommend the bill to the House. I congratulate an organization 
called End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism, which has worked 
very hard to ensure that this trade be stopped.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ACTRESPECTINGCONSTITUTIONALAMENDMENTS">ACT RESPECTING CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-110, an act respecting 
constitutional amendments, be read the second time and referred to 
a committee.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, Bill C-110 represents the fulfilment of 
one of the three undertakings made by the Prime Minister during 
the referendum campaign. At that time, the Prime Minister made a 
commitment not to amend the Canadian Constitution without the 
consent of the people of Quebec. But the bill goes much further. It 
also ensures that no constitutional change will take place without a 
regional consensus.
<P>
	Let us be very clear: this initiative, the resolution respecting 
Quebec's distinctiveness, and the initiative that will follow 
tomorrow, are in no way the sum total of our response to the 
Quebec referendum or to the issue of national unity. Rather, these 
three commitments should be seen as important first steps.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It was in front of a rally of over 100,000 proud Canadians in 
Montreal that the Prime Minister promised change. He made a 
commitment and now he has delivered.
<P>
	On that day he made it clear that to implement change he would 
need the support of those same proud Canadians and their friends 
who came from coast to coast to coast to Montreal. The time for 
this renewal starts now.
<P>
	We need the support of those Canadians and Canadians from all 
across the country to confirm the faith of the majority of Quebecers 
who voted no to separation on October 30.
<P>
	The steps we are taking this week in combination signal a new 
beginning and a reaffirmation of our desire to remain united.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Bill C-110 should be seen in the context of this renewal. 
Yesterday, the Prime Minister spoke eloquently before the House to 
the resolution recognizing Quebec's distinct society.
<P>
	That resolution represents a solemn commitment, the fulfilment 
of a pledge, and this Chamber's genuine expression of respect for 
the people of Quebec. True, this  resolution will satisfy neither the 
Parti Quebecois nor the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
	As we know, sadly, nothing short of breaking up this country 
would satisfy them. But, as the Prime Minister said yesterday, it is 
easier to destroy than to build. This government is interested only 
in building a stronger, more united Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As the Prime Minister asserted yesterday, the resolution through 
which the House is being called on to confirm the reality that 
Quebec is a distinct society is not intended in any way and does not 
infringe on or derogate from aboriginal or treaty rights. This 
position includes the inherent right to self-government. We 
recognize the unique legal position of aboriginal peoples, including 
the protection of aboriginal and treaty rights as found in the 
Constitution.
<P>
	Tomorrow my colleague, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, will table a bill transforming the unemployment 
insurance program into an employment insurance program. This 
will represent the latest step in the practice established by the 
government in the two years since we have taken office; a practice 
of co-operating to end duplication with other levels of government 
as we work toward our common goals of creating jobs and 
achieving economic growth.
<P>
	We reaffirmed that commitment during the referendum 
campaign. Tomorrow will mark an important step in that 
continuing process.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	During the referendum campaign, we assured the people of 
Quebec that the Canadian Constitution would not be amended 
again without their consent. That was a solemn commitment. Yet, 
the Government of Quebec stands in the way of our modernizing 
the federation and stays on the sidelines by itself. It refuses to 
participate.
<P>
	As Canada begins its renewal, we need a practical way of 
assuring Quebecers that we will not proceed without them. What 
we have done is to provide a strong political commitment, backed 
by the force of law, that we will use our veto to oppose any change 
that, in the opinion of Quebecers or people from any other region, 
goes against their best interests. This simply acknowledges the 
reality. There is no point in adopting changes that do not have 
substantial support in all the regions of the country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Allow me to deal briefly with the contents of Bill C-110. May I 
emphasize at the outset that this legislation does not initiate or 
represent constitutional change. It is essential to emphasize that the 
adoption of this bill by Parliament will not result in any change in 
the amending formula provided for in the Constitution of our 
country.
<P>
	All of the features of Part V of the Constitution calling for 
provincial agreement in various forms, depending on the nature of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17001"> 17001 </A></B>
<P>
the proposed amendment, will remain entirely as they are at 
present. In particular, the general formula for amendment requiring 
the approval of two-thirds of the provinces representing 50 per cent 
of the Canadian population will remain exactly as it is at present.
<P>
	What this bill does achieve is to make the federal veto over 
constitutional change available in such a way as to ensure that no 
such change will take place without regional consensus. Simply 
stated, the federal government is providing by law that such 
support will not be forthcoming unless certain conditions are met. 
Those conditions involve the support of every region of Canada.
<P>
	Let me spend a few moments setting out in a summary way that 
which is already well known to members of Parliament; that is, the 
features of the present amending formula contained in Part V of the 
Constitution Act, 1982 and that will continue unchanged after this 
bill is adopted.
<P>
<B>(1015 )</B>
<P>
	Each and every one of the provinces already has a veto on many 
categories of proposed constitutional amendments. For example, 
each and every one of the provinces has a veto on all changes that 
require unanimity; that is, those matters that are touched on by 
section 41 of the Constitution Act. These involve changes to the 
office of the Queen, the governor general, the lieutenant governor 
of a province. They involve changes in provincial representation in 
the House of Commons and the Senate, the use of the English and 
French languages, and the composition of the Supreme Court of 
Canada.
<P>
	Under section 41, every province, from Newfoundland on the 
east to British Columbia on the west, has an absolute and 
unconditional veto over any amendment referred to in section 41.
<P>
	The second type of change contemplated by the Constitution and 
the second kind of veto provided in part V is dealt with in section 
43. Whenever there are proposed changes that affect one or more 
but not all of the provinces, those provinces affected by the 
proposed changes have an absolute and unconditional veto over 
any such amendment. Think, for example, about the resolution of 
boundary questions between provinces that neighbour each other, 
or instances such as the amendment permitting the construction of 
the fixed link between the mainland and Prince Edward Island. 
Without the concurrence of the province or provinces affected by 
changes under section 43, those amendments will not occur.
<P>
	The third kind of change in respect of which there is a virtual 
veto is under the general amending formula in  subsection 38(1). It 
is provided in subsection 38(3) that where there is any amendment 
approved by seven provinces with 50 per cent of the population, if 
it involves the reduction of any provincial power, right, or 
privilege, any province can opt out. In that section, the veto is 
exercised in a negative sense by the objecting province opting out 
of the proposed change. Under section 40, where such an opting out 
takes place in relation to matters involving culture or education the 
federal government is obligated to compensate the dissenting 
province financially.
<P>
	It is therefore clear that each and every province, from Prince 
Edward Island to Alberta, from British Columbia to 
Newfoundland, has a veto either directly or indirectly over almost 
all categories of constitutional change.
<P>
	The only area that exists at present where there is no veto is 
where the general amending formula applies and where the opting 
out provisions of subsection 38(3) do not arise; in other words, 
those amendments that do not involve taking powers away from the 
provinces. We are therefore dealing with those categories of 
amendment that would, for example, add powers to the provinces, 
enlarge the territories of existing provinces, or deal with all the 
other matters listed in section 42 of the Constitution.
<P>
	The effect of Bill C-110 is to provide a regional veto for any of 
the changes in respect of which the individual provinces do not 
already have direct or indirect vetos. The additional regional veto 
that is contemplated by this legislation will be provided not by 
constitutional change but rather through a commitment by the 
Canadian government to introduce such changes only when 
regional consensus is demonstrated.
<P>
	In effect, the federal government is putting in place a set of 
criteria that will guide the future use of its own veto power. The 
seven and fifty amending formula is still in place. Bill C-110 is 
merely a discipline the federal government imposes on itself.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canadian history shows that the idea of a regional veto has often 
been supported by many responsible proponents. Indeed, at the 
Victoria constitutional conference of 1971, the federal government 
and all 10 provinces agreed to a constitutional amending formula 
that was, in general terms, very similar to that proposed in Bill 
C-110.
<P>
	This approach was ultimately rejected, for other reasons, by a 
subsequent decision.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	Let us keep in mind, however, that the Victoria formula as it was 
then called had the original support of all eleven governments.
<P>
	Similarly, the 1991 report of the Beaudoin-Edwards Committee 
contained a proposal almost identical to that  in Bill C-110. Finally, 
at its 1992 policy convention in Hull, the Liberal Party of Canada 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17002"> 17002 </A></B>
<P>
endorsed certain specific amending formulas, including the very 
formula set out in this bill.
<P>
	As members will see, this bill provides expressly that no 
minister of the crown can introduce a resolution proposing an 
amendment to the Constitution unless such an amendment has the 
consent of a majority of the provinces. Which begs the question: 
What is meant exactly by ``the consent of the provinces''?
<P>
	First, let me point out that it will be up to the federal government 
to determine what this phrase means every time a new situation 
arises. Depending on the circumstances, the federal government 
might interpret as consent, for example, an expression of consent 
by the provincial government of the day, a resolution of the 
legislative assembly, or a direct expression of the population's 
agreement through a referendum.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There are those who may argue that Bill C-110 is 
unconstitutional because it represents a unilateral attempt by the 
Canadian government to amend the Constitution. I can tell the 
House that I gave careful consideration to this question before 
certifying the bill as constitutional, as it was tabled in the House 
yesterday.
<P>
	Let me express my sincere conviction that Bill C-110 is valid 
federal legislation. It does not amend the Constitution in any way. 
Indeed, it is complementary to the constitutional amending 
provisions.
<P>
	It must be observed that the House of Commons is the only 
legislative assembly in Canada with a complete veto over almost 
every conceivable type of constitutional change. That is so because 
as a practical matter no such change will occur if it is opposed by 
the House of Commons.
<P>
	Bill C-110 simply represents a reflection in legislative form of 
the policy of the Canadian government with respect to the 
circumstances under which it will lend its support to constitutional 
change where the provinces do not already have a veto.
<P>
	In my respectful view, this legislation is much in the same 
category as those provincial statutes by which certain provinces 
have bound themselves to support constitutional amending 
proposals only after a referendum has been held in which the 
people of a province express their support. I refer specifically to the 
legislation in both Alberta and British Columbia, which imposes on 
those provincial governments exactly that constraint or discipline.
<P>
	Accordingly, I say that this bill is neither intended to nor does it 
amend the Constitution directly or indirectly. It simply sets out the 
circumstances under which the Canadian government may support 
constitutional change.
<P>
	Another question that arises is whether there are four regions for 
these purposes or five. As the Prime Minister asserted in his 
remarks yesterday, some are already suggesting that the bill does 
not do justice to British Columbia. Let me emphasize that this is 
simply not the case.
<P>
	The changes in this legislation are a significant step forward for 
British Columbia in the constitutional process. These steps are the 
clearest recognition we have had to date of British Columbia's 
growing importance within Canada. The voices of British 
Columbians are being heard in Ottawa and throughout Canada. Let 
there be no mistake about that.
<P>
<B>(1025 )</B>
<P>
	As the largest western province, British Columbia will obviously 
have a major voice in determining whether regional consensus 
exists in the circumstances contemplated by Bill C-110. Indeed, the 
arithmetical reality is that British Columbia, with the support of 
only one other western province, could block any constitutional 
change affected by Bill C-110. This represents a significant 
increase in British Columbia's role in the amending process. The 
situation at present in respect of amendments to which Bill C-110 
would apply is that change would be possible without the consent 
of three western provinces, even if the three dissenting provinces 
together represented a majority of the population in the western 
region.
<P>
	The population of British Columbia is expected to surpass 50 per 
cent of the total of the western region early in the next century. This 
will mean that under the provisions of Bill C-110 British Columbia 
on its own would ultimately be able to block any amendment. This 
will represent a major improvement and significant recognition of 
British Columbia's place in Confederation.
<P>
	This issue should surely be kept in perspective. We speak in this 
bill of a veto. A veto does not initiate constitutional change, it 
blocks it. What we are talking about is the ability of a region to stop 
an amendment to the Constitution.
<P>
	I remind members as well that the Constitution requires that a 
conference convened by the Prime Minister and including all first 
ministers must be held before April 1997, expressly for the purpose 
of discussing the amending formula in part V. The issue of British 
Columbia's involvement in the veto process could very well be put 
on the agenda of that conference for full discussion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	There are those who suggest that Bill C-110 will make it 
impossible for any government to amend the Canadian 
Constitution. I fundamentally disagree.
<P>
	First of all, the amending formula remains exactly as it is today. 
Part 5 remains unchanged. The general  amending formula will still 
require the consent of seven provinces representing over 50 per 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17003"> 17003 </A></B>
<P>
cent of the Canadian population. Bill C-110 simply provides that a 
regional consensus must be achieved before the Canadian 
government can effect any changes.
<P>
	It is difficult to imagine that the federal government would 
endorse constitutional change without the support of all regions. 
Bill C-110 requires that a majority of provinces, namely six, 
express their support for or consent to the proposed changes before 
Ottawa can participate.
<P>
	That is, of course, a smaller number than required in Part 5 of the 
Constitution, and I emphasize as well that there is no national 
population threshold.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I suggest that Bill C-110 will strengthen the constitutional fabric 
of this country, not by changing the Constitution but rather by 
making plain the circumstances under which constitutional change 
can be carried out.
<P>
	This bill is a measure that reflects the importance of the regions 
of Canada and ensures their participation in constitutional renewal. 
In a sense the bill is a bridge, because we can expect that the 
amending formula will evolve in the years to come. There is no 
doubt that at some future point the amending formula will be 
reviewed and no doubt improved upon. In the meantime, by this 
legislation the federal government is ensuring that amendments 
will occur only when they have the support of all regions of the 
country.
<P>
	As I said at the outset, this bill and the other initiatives 
introduced this week are not in any sense the only response by this 
government to questions of national unity. Rather these initiatives 
are the first steps. They represent new beginnings. We undertake 
them with renewed hope and optimism for our future as a country. 
Let us proceed in that spirit and put Canada above all else. Let us 
put Canada first.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	I commend the legislation to the House and I urge all members to 
support it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, we are engaged here in a continuation of the 
discussion of the recent attempts by the Prime Minister to amend 
the Cconstitution. I feel that the contribution made to the history of 
Canada and Quebec constitutional law by Bill C-110 will be fairly 
negligible. It will add a page to the federal statutes, but that is as far 
as it will go.
<P>
	Before entering directly into an examination of the content of 
Bill C-110, I would like to try to destroy a myth, if I 
may-although myths are virtually indestructible-the myth that 
René Lévesque lost Quebec  its right to a veto. Yesterday again we 
heard the Prime Minister tell the House that Quebec had to be given 
back its veto because René Lévesque had given it up. That is 
something we hear all the time on the Hill as a self-evident truth, 
but something that is totally contrary to the facts.
<P>
	I note that the Minister of Justice, with his familiarity with law 
and jurisprudence, has taken great pains to avoid repeating such an 
enormity. We are well aware that the reason why Quebec is in the 
vulnerable situation it is with respect to constitutional change is 
that the Supreme Court, in a 1982 decision, its second judgment on 
constitutional challenges raised because of the 1982 patriation, 
found that the veto Quebec believed it possessed, the veto everyone 
believed Quebec possessed, which had always been respected 
because the general perception was that the Canadian Constitution 
could not be altered without Quebec's consent, had never existed.
<P>
	The Supreme Court analyzed the Constitution and found, after 
examining all elements which might make it possible to confirm 
the existence of a veto, that Quebec had no veto and never had had 
one. Now, that is a ruling by the Supreme Court of Canada. As a 
result, people ought perhaps in future to refrain from stating that if 
the necessity for Quebec to obtain a veto is central to the whole 
constitutional debate, is not as a result of René Lévesque's being so 
careless that it was lost, but has never existed in the opinion of the 
Supreme Court. The proof lies in the second challenge in 1982, 
when Quebec, which now stood alone, attempted to block 
unilateral patriation by invoking its right to a veto.
<P>
	You will recall that in the first attempt, in the first case, in 1981, 
Quebec had seven other provinces on its side and was successful in 
blocking patriation, this time by convincing the Supreme Court that 
a reasonable measure of provincial consent was necessary for 
proper patriation and major change to be possible. The Supreme 
Court had concluded that, with eight provinces dissenting and only 
two supporting the federal government, the reasonable measure of 
consent needed to authorize the patriation of the Constitution and 
the amendments it contained had not been reached.
<P>
	It was in the second attempt, when Quebec found itself alone, 
that it tried to block patriation and exercised its right to veto. At the 
heart of the 1982 constitutional challenge, which the Supreme 
Court decided on, just before the act of patriation was signed, but 
still in 1982, the court concluded that the argument did not hold in 
this case, because Quebec had no veto.
<P>
	I would just like to say this so it appears somewhere in <I>Hansard</I>, 
here, in this wash of gratuitous remarks to the effect that René 
Lévesque lost the right of veto, that someone rose, namely the 
Leader of the Opposition, who was on one of the teams of lawyers 
at the time, to point out that the Supreme Court never said René 
Lévesque had lost the right of veto. On the contrary, it said we  
never had it. Hence the present debate, which is part of a long series 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17004"> 17004 </A></B>
<P>
of abortive attempts to introduce the right of veto into the Canadian 
Constitution.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	Earlier, the Minister of Justice provided a quick overview of the 
various attempts that have been made, from Victoria, more 
specifically the Pepin-Robarts Commission, to the various task 
forces that were set up during the constitutional debates that 
preceded the Charlottetown accord, to show there had been a 
number of formulae. The formula used in Bill C-110 is somewhat 
like the Victoria formula in which Quebec is considered a region 
and could therefore, if the government is rightly talking veto, have 
its own veto too.
<P>
	But what is the reality of the situation. I contend, and the 
Minister of Justice was careful to avoid saying it, that there is no 
way this bill can be said to give a veto to Quebec in particular or to 
other provinces and regions. There is no way anybody can claim 
this bill provides for a veto, for two basic reasons.
<P>
	First, veto power is given only if everyone wants it to be. As 
soon as someone objects to its being given, the right vanishes. 
Consensus is at the very heart of the according of veto power. 
Unanimity is essential. All the provincial legislatures and the 
federal government must be in agreement. What we have before us 
is nothing more than the federal government's wish. Where is the 
support of Canada's provincial legislatures? There is none.
<P>
	What we do have are statements making it very clear that at least 
two, and maybe more, provinces have refused to support this veto 
bill. Only one need refuse for it to never exist.
<P>
	This means there is a basic flaw in the plan for establishing a 
right of veto. The reality of the situation is that we do not have here 
the conditions necessary for a veto to be given.
<P>
	The second reason has to do with the definition of a veto. The 
right of veto is an absolute guarantee. It is written into the 
Constitution and cannot be withdrawn without everyone's 
approval. It serves to permit one of the interested parties to block 
constitutional change.
<P>
	It should be binding on everyone under the constraining effect of 
the Constitution, the country's supreme legislation. Where will this 
bill end up after being passed by a majority of the members in this 
House? It will end up gathering dust in the federal statute books, 
where it will remain. It will never be enshrined in the Constitution 
or invoked to bind anyone outside this House because it is not, in 
fact, a right of veto.
<P>
	They will tell me: ``Yes, but Parliament will be bound, the 
federal government will be bound, since a bill was passed''. Not 
really. It will be bound only so long as the act remains in the federal 
statute books. It will no  longer be binding, even on this 
government, as soon as one minister or another rises to propose 
that this bill be withdrawn and replaced with another one. One 
piece of legislation replacing another. The legislative process 
hinges on having the same forum, the same vehicle, namely the 
House of Commons, pass a bill to amend another piece of 
legislation.
<P>
	In any case, we know full well that, fortunately, governments do 
not last forever, that there are elections in a democracy, that there 
will be a federal election in two or three years, that another 
government will be formed, perhaps by the same party, but 
possibly by a different party, why not? As for the Bloc Quebecois, 
it will certainly not be in the running, so that the only other party in 
this House likely to come to power is the Reform Party. What will 
be the first bill tabled by Reform should it come to power? The bill 
to withdraw Bill C-110. Which means that Bill C-110 is nothing. It 
amounts to smoke and mirrors.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	So, Madam Speaker, I trust you will allow me to spare you and 
not spend too much time repeating that this bill contributes 
absolutely nothing to the debate, that it is, at best, a diversion, a 
show put on by the Liberal government to silence criticism about 
failing to act on the constitutional issue, making empty promises 
and misleading the people. This way, for the next two or three 
years, the Prime Minister will be able to keep telling us, until we 
are sick and tired of hearing about it: ``We granted Quebec the right 
of veto through Bill C-110. We granted Quebec the right of veto 
through Bill C-110. We granted Quebec the right of veto through 
Bill-''It will become quite annoying to hear him say that over and 
over. That is not true, but he just will keep on repeating it all the 
time. Over, and over again.
<P>
	Those in the know, all those who examine the constitutional 
issue, who are courageous enough to keep looking into it from time 
to time, who overcome their mental fatigue to ponder these matters 
again, know that Bill C-110 is just one of those political ploys that 
do not really change anything in the problem Quebec and Canada 
have in this regard. And I suspect that the Minister of Justice would 
be the first one to recognize that, he who, a moment ago, gave a 
very neutral, factual and, I would say, professional description of 
his approach by setting out very clear limits, reassuring English 
Canada in the process.
<P>
	I noticed, in the remarks he made in English in particular, that he 
made a point to remind everyone that the Constitution will remain 
unchanged. ``Do not assume that this is a constitutional change. 
This will have no effect on the Constitution. The federal 
government is just exercising self-discipline''. I heard a speaker 
use the word ``discipline'' earlier, in English. The federal 
government will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17005"> 17005 </A></B>
<P>
exercise self-discipline, restraint, before granting too much to 
Quebec, of course. To anglophone  listeners, the government is 
describing this initiative as a way to refrain from giving too much 
to Quebec, to resist the urge to do anything like that.
<P>
	This leads me to believe and shows us that Bill C-110, in fact, 
has a pernicious effect in that, since the Canadian Constitution is so 
complex and twisted in certain respects, this bill, and that is a 
paradox, will in no way solve the current problems, but will make it 
even more difficult to transfer the powers that the federal 
government might be willing to give to Quebec.
<P>
	I can see the day when members from this side of the House will 
rise to ask the Prime Minister: ``Are you going to transfer 
manpower to Quebec, along with the real powers provided for in 
the Constitution? Are you going to enshrine the transfer of 
manpower in the Constitution? Are you going to do that? Are you 
going to also transfer the related funds?'' The Prime Minister will 
reply: ``I cannot do that. Bill C-110 prevents me from doing that. I 
have imposed self-discipline on myself. I have forbidden myself to 
transfer anything to Quebec''. Since he is a law abiding person, the 
Prime Minister will no longer be able to do anything for Quebec, 
when he wanted to do so much.
<P>
	I end with the conclusion of the Minister of Justice, who said: 
``Listen, this may not be much''-and he is right-``but it is only 
the first step. It will be improved. We will continue to work. The 
committee has an important task. That committee, which is chaired 
by the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and which will 
explore avenues for change, will come up with other proposals just 
as inventive as Bill C-110''. The minister adds: ``Do not lose heart 
just yet. True, there is not much in this, but we will improve 
things''. The fact is that, never in the history of constitutional 
negotiations and talks involving Quebec, the federal government 
and the rest of Canada, was an initial proposal improved on. On the 
contrary, every initial proposal made was later scaled down, 
watered down, split, doctored or dolled up, and in the end became 
almost meaningless. Now we are told: ``No, this time we start 
small, but end up with something big''. We will talk then.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	For the time being, let us simply say that this sham fails to 
convince, and that we will not give it any credibility by voting in 
favour of the bill. On the contrary, we will oppose this legislation 
and, in Quebec, we will move on to a more immediate, pressing, 
serious and imperative agenda, given the need to put our fiscal 
house in order, to create jobs and to do something about education 
and culture.
<P>
	We will see what happens after that.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am rising today to address Bill C-110, an act respecting 
constitutional amendments, and to state clearly our opposition to 
the bill as it is now drafted. I also hope to propose some things that 
the government will think about in terms of altering this legislation 
which may make it more acceptable.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I want to say that we, the members of the Reform Party, certainly 
oppose that bill, which gives a veto power over constitutional 
amendments to certain provinces, but not to others. More 
importantly, it denies Canadians the possibility of playing a role, 
by way of a referendum, in amending the Constitution.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I must admit that in the last two or three months I have been 
wondering what exactly it is we are doing in this place and why we 
are really here when it comes to the question of national unity.
<P>
	I had prepared a fairly long speech to discuss the constitutional 
amending formula and some of the considerations in that 
historically. I probably will not give it today. Instead I want to 
concentrate on a few other comments, things that I feel about this 
situation which I think need to be said.
<P>
	When I say I wonder why we are here, as intergovernmental 
affairs critic for my party I want to share some of the frustrations 
we have had. Monday morning the government did not even know 
it was making an announcement on national unity. We contacted 
the government and were told that by the office of the 
intergovernmental affairs minister. Certainly nobody in the press 
gallery was aware of it.
<P>
	The announcement was made Monday afternoon. Even 
yesterday morning no copy of the bill was available. We were told 
it was in the extremely complex process of being drafted, after 
notice had been given. Then we got the bill and it is all of one page. 
There is no doubt that the drafting required a lot of time and a lot of 
complex decisions which prevented it from being shown to 
anybody until a few minutes before it was tabled.
<P>
	We saw what happened when we tried to get a constitutional 
amendment at Charlottetown. We ended up with 60 clauses. It took 
months and they could not even produce a legal text. This is the 
kind of the role we see here.
<P>
	What is more important is this is a bill about the amending 
formula. The amending formula is an important question. Frankly I 
do not really think this bill has much to do with an amending 
formula in the Constitution. I do not think much thought went into 
this position.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17006"> 17006 </A></B>
<P>
	Judging from the comments of both the Prime Minister and the 
Deputy Prime Minister when we have questioned them in question 
period it is very clear there are concerns other than the amending 
formula. We seldom get any responses that try to justify or explain 
why this particular formula would be a good one.
<P>
	Instead, what is obviously a preoccupation in the government 
and in the country is the very deep denial about the nature of the 
events in the province of Quebec and where it is really going. The 
deep denial this country has been in for a long time is that there is a 
very simple solution to this problem, that somehow there will be 
some constitutional or non-constitutional concession and all we do 
is present it. It will address Quebec's historic demands; it will 
embarrass the bejeesus out of the separatists; the whole movement 
will collapse and then everything will be solved.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	We have heard this story over and over again for 30 years. 
Attempts have been made to go along with that approach and 
frankly, they seem to have made the situation worse. The most 
notable was in 1982 when nine provincial governments and many 
people were persuaded to pass a major constitutional package 
against the wishes of the separatist Government of Quebec. This 
was done as a method of dealing with our unity crisis to fulfil the 
commitments of the then Prime Minister to the people of Quebec 
during the referendum. We know that has led to a much more 
profound crisis than we had to begin with.
<P>
	As this crisis gets worse and worse, governments and the Liberal 
Party particularly seek to find enemies of Canada everywhere. Now 
the enemies of Canada are no longer just in Quebec among the 
separatist movement; we are now told there are enemies of Canada 
in great numbers in Alberta and in no less than the premier's office 
in Newfoundland. There are enemies in British Columbia. 
Everywhere there are enemies who will not put aside their narrow 
views in order to save the country.
<P>
	Let me go to our position on the amending formula and make it 
very clear. The Reform Party will not agree to any change to the 
amending formula for federal ratification unless it is done by 
national referendum. It does not matter whether there are four 
regions, five regions, 10 regions, or if we make every constituency 
of this House a region.
<P>
	It is not good enough to have 10 votes of 10 provincial premiers. 
We want there to be 30 million votes, the population of Canada in a 
national referendum to discuss federal constitutional amendments. 
If we get that, we can be more flexible about the nature of the 
federal geographic approval process. We have a constitutional 
amending formula for provincial approval today and that amending 
formula is satisfactory to us as a formula for provincial approval.
<P>
	The position that the Minister of Justice has presented, I would 
state with respect, does not make any sense. The government says 
it is not a new formula for constitutional amendment. It is not a 
constitutional formula because it will not be in the Constitution. 
That is clear enough, except that it is the stated intention of the 
government that these proposals will be brought into the 
Constitution at some point.
<P>
	The government is proposing a new formula for constitutional 
amendments involving provincial ratification. We already have a 
formula in the Constitution for provincial ratification, the seven 
and fifty formula. There are difficulties with the seven and fifty 
formula. The minister accurately outlined some of those 
difficulties.
<P>
	The reason for that formula is that when dealing with provincial 
governments the provinces decided that they did not want any one 
government to have a veto because that was a very risky situation 
with the concentration of executive power there is in this country. I 
will get on to that more later.
<P>
	The new formula obviously violates what the provinces 
themselves wanted in selecting the current provincial amending 
formula. The Minister of Justice has tried to make an argument that 
it is not unconstitutional for the federal government to unilaterally 
amend the provincial ratification formula even in a 
non-constitutional way. He has an argument there because the 
federal government can clearly delegate its powers.
<P>
	Why it would want to delegate powers to the provincial 
governments in an area where the provincial governments already 
have a formula is unclear to me. We will have two rounds of 
provincial ratification and no real federal ratification. This is 
completely unclear to me. In any case, this is what they are 
proposing to do.
<P>
	The delegation which is proposed here delegates that authority in 
a way that gives some provincial legislatures more authority than 
others.
<P>
<B>(1055 )</B>
<P>
	It is on that ground that some provincial legislatures, in 
particular the legislature in my province of Alberta, may well 
attempt to take this to court and have it declared unconstitutional. 
Alberta may challenge that and I would encourage it if it sought to 
do so because in the area of governmental powers all of the 
provinces should be treated equally.
<P>
	As well the Minister of Justice has argued, and I am a bit 
mystified at why he is even making this argument, that there are 
already plenty of vetoes in the Constitution which is true enough. 
There are already plenty of vetoes in the Constitution. That does 
not change the fact that for the areas he is proposing vetoes, he is 
proposing to give some provincial governments and not other 
provincial governments vetoes. This will be rejected by the 
population in large parts of the country, but  particularly in western 
Canada. Western Canada will reject it because it reflects a vision of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17007"> 17007 </A></B>
<P>
the country that does not at all reflect the way westerners see the 
country.
<P>
	I was born and raised in Toronto, so I can understand the central 
Canadian perspective. Unfortunately it is simply not a complete 
perspective of the country. It is interesting, when looking at the 
four regions there is Ontario and Quebec, the two original 
provinces before Confederation. Then there is Atlantic Canada and 
of course, it is a group with a small population. In the original 
Constitution we had recognized three regions, but then there is out 
there: western Canada and all of the Rockies, all of the prairies, all 
of the north. That is just one area.
<P>
	If we were to ask a westerner what the regions were, I am sure he 
would say they are the prairies, the Pacific, the north and the east. 
That would be the formula that would be proposed.
<P>
	This particular view is obviously going to be rejected even more 
in British Columbia than it is anywhere else. Why? Because British 
Columbia is obviously a distinctive and strong region with a 
vibrant economy, a great future regardless of what happens 
politically in this country. It is growing. It is larger both in terms of 
geography and population than all of the Atlantic provinces 
combined. It certainly is not going to view itself as part of some 
western region. Why then has it been defined this way? It is 
important to say something about this because it does reflect the 
nature and the inadequacy of the thinking behind the bill.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice talked about renewal. What does this 
particular formula have to do with renewal? When we asked why 
this formula came about, we did not get an instruction about 
renewal; we got an instruction from the minister and from the 
government about history.
<P>
	In 1971 the Government of British Columbia as part of a wider 
constitutional package that was eventually rejected, agreed to a 
formula that involved four regions. In 1971 Ken Dryden was a 
rookie playing goal for the Montreal Canadiens. The United States 
was still at war in Vietnam.
<P>
	The premier who signed that deal- and I do not mean to 
besmirch his memory, the premier has long since passed 
away-not only is he and his government out of power, the party he 
represented does not even exist in the province of British 
Columbia. The premier is dead and we are using him now as the 
reason we are bringing forward a a proposal for a constitutional 
amending formula in 1995.
<P>
	Then we got a second set of reactions. This morning the Minister 
of Justice seemed to concede that B.C. should have a veto or should 
be moving that way because of its population. I ask the House to 
think a little bit about this. The argument is that sooner rather than 
later,  British Columbia will have a majority of the population in 
western Canada so it will have a veto.
<P>
	What does this mean? This means that under the formula 
proposed by the government, the provinces of Alberta, 
Saskatchewan and Manitoba would have no say whatsoever in 
constitutional amendments, none whatsoever. They can be isolated 
in the seven and fifty formula and their consent would not even 
have to be requested to fulfil the requirements of Bill C-110. We 
would not even need to know what their position was.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	This is an absolutely incredible position and explains why in 
Alberta there is a reaction. Some circles have called for an Alberta 
veto.
<P>
	Across the country there is a particular concern that this gives a 
veto to the government of Quebec at the very time when it will be 
led not just by the separatists, but by the Leader of the Opposition, 
the leader of the Bloc Quebecois who will become the future 
premier of Quebec. He is not only committed to taking Canada out 
of confederation, but unlike Rene Levesque, is not willing to 
entertain any constitutional amendments whatsoever.
<P>
	During and since the referendum when the Prime Minister has 
been asked him about his speech in Verdun, he talked about trusting 
the people. He told us we had to trust the people in the referendum. 
The people defeated the proposal by Mr. Parizeau. Now the Prime 
Minister does not trust them. Now he is prepared to trust the Leader 
of the Opposition. This position contradicts his previous statements 
on constitutional reform. It contradicts resolutions the Liberal 
Party passed in 1992. It contradicts his statement about trusting the 
people and giving the Constitution to the people. It even 
contradicts statements he made recently in the House.
<P>
	We have to ask why would the Prime Minister do this? I want to 
try and be fair to him. The Prime Minister has been in politics for 
30 years. He has had a very successful political career. None of us 
would debate that. He has shown from time to time some very 
clever political judgment, regardless of what anyone says.
<P>
	He said he would trust the people. He said he would give the 
people a say. He said he would give the people of Quebec a veto. 
Now he is doing the opposite. He is giving the legislature of 
Quebec a say and not the people. In fact, a couple of days ago when 
I asked about this, he said this was even more democratic. This was 
really democracy. The people of Quebec chose this legislature and 
that is who we are trusting.
<P>
	I have pointed out on more than one occasion in the past that if 
we had left the decision on the separation of Quebec to the 
legislature of Quebec, it would already be a separate country if that 
is where the decision is to be taken. It is the people of Quebec who 
have decided repeatedly not to separate.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17008"> 17008 </A></B>
<P>
	Why is the Prime Minister doing this? I suggest he is doing this 
for the very reason that it is being criticized. He is doing this 
precisely because it gives a veto to the leader of the official 
opposition, the leader of the Bloc Quebecois. The Prime Minister 
can stand and say: ``I gave you a veto. I gave the people of Quebec 
something through you and you turned it down. You are the bad 
guy''. That is what he wants to say.
<P>
	Why does that matter? It matters because for 30 years the Prime 
Minister has been a fighter for Canada in Quebec against the 
Quebec nationalist movement. It is a fight that looks more and 
more in jeopardy as there has been a long term rise in support of 
this movement through the decades.
<P>
	As with all nationalism, this movement says that anybody who 
has a sense of wider loyalties is a traitor. The Prime Minister, 
because he sees himself as a Canadian, believes it is some kind of a 
sell-out.
<P>
	It reached a pinnacle in the last couple of years when the Prime 
Minister became the first Quebecer in our history to be elected 
Prime Minister without substantial support from the French 
speaking areas of Quebec. He also was aggravated, when in the 
referendum campaign, his interventions did not seem to have a 
particular affect on the population.
<P>
<B>(1105 )</B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister has decided to strike back. It is a perfectly 
understandable response for somebody who has been in the 
position he has been in, for somebody who must feel the way he 
feels, given the way events have gone and given the way he has 
been treated from time to time, particularly in his own province. 
From his perspective it may also be a response that is necessary 
politically as a federalist Quebecer.
<P>
	I suggest it will not work. The Leader of the Opposition, as we 
all know, is a smart enough fellow, which he demonstrated again 
today. He is not going to have any problem playing around with this 
argument. That is what he will do. Whether his arguments are right 
or wrong he will be able to deliver an effective argument against 
this motion.
<P>
	The Prime Minister should also know from his own history that 
success in politics is about being able to see that one's own feelings 
or one's own reactions should not interfere with one's own 
judgment or with the broader interests that are at stake.
<P>
	Canada needs an approach in looking for a new constitutional 
formula. That is what we should be looking at here. Canada needs 
an approach that is good for the country and good for Canadians. I 
suggest there are many things wrong with this bill. In particular a 
veto for the premier of Quebec is not in the interests of all 
Canadians. It is not in the interests of this country.
<P>
	What is in the interests of this country at the federal level is what 
we have: a provincial ratification formula which I believe is as 
good as it is going to get. At the federal level we need a national 
referendum for the people of Canada. We should be trusting the 
people of Quebec who have voted against separation. We should be 
trusting the people who went to the Montreal rally who were not 
there to endorse some bills and resolutions which they had not 
seen. We should be trusting their judgment. We should also be 
trusting the people who did not go to the Montreal rally. They were 
millions of Canadians, many of whom I suspect considered they 
would go but had second thoughts because they said: ``If I go there 
am I going to find that my name is being used to back some agenda 
by some group of politicians that I had never endorsed?''
<P>
	Those people in Quebec and outside of Quebec need a say in 
constitutional amendments. It is only by trusting the people that we 
are going to get anywhere. We will certainly vote against this bill 
the way it is. I ask the government to seriously consider looking at 
this proposal again to give the people a say over constitutional 
change at the federal level.

that is generous enough and I can see why.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I was in Montreal with 150,000 Canadians who came from every 
part of this country because they believed that we have a nation 
worth saving. They believe that Quebec is a distinct society. There 
is a reason we are different from our neighbours to the south, there 
is a reason that we have-

<P>
	There is a reason why, last week, we were able to pass a bill on 
firearms and there is a reason why we have a universal health care 
system; it is because, at the dawn of our history, when we made the 
decision to become a country, we held as a fundamental principle 
that there are two peoples.
<P>
	The hon. member can laugh, but my ancestor was a member of 
the Louisbourg government before anglophones ever came into 
Canada. My maternal grandmother was born in England. We can 
find solutions. That is why, last year, on Canada Day, the Leader of

world.

incapable of understanding the meaning of building a nation and 
the setting aside of regional differences for the good of a nation.
<P>
	The fact is that if Bloc members were offered the world they 
would want the moon. If they got the moon  they would demand the 
sun. If they got the sun they would demand the galaxy. If they got 
the galaxy they would want the universe. If they got the universe 
they would demand heaven. If they got heaven they would claim

	The Bloc wanted to know if campaign managers had paid for 
this, who had taken the school bus? Steelworkers from my riding, 
who had never been involved in politics in any way, rode in a 
school bus for ten hours to go to Montreal to express their 
solidarity and recognize what you know and what we know. It is a 
fact, Quebec is a distinct society, and that is why since the 
beginning of our history we have been different. Why did I say 
during the referendum campaign that Quebec is the heart of 
Canada?

	If our nation is respectful of individuals and communities, it is 
thanks to French speaking Canadians, who were able to survive 
throughout the history of North America. You were all by 
yourselves. Some could not keep their language, but you were all 
by yourselves and you managed to survive because you knew how 
to build a community. You have embraced the principles of sharing 
through institutions such as the caisse de dépôt and the co-op 
movement. Your contribution to the fabric of Canada is what makes 
up the soul of our country.
<P>
	Some people tell us: ``Mind your own business.'' If I am a 
Canadian, I am not an Ontarian, I am not an English speaking 
Canadian, I am simply a Canadian who believes her country, 
without Quebec, would be an empty shell. My country, without 
Quebec, will lose all we have achieved together. Admittedly, we 
have problems. There are always problems. But are we generous 
enough and open minded enough to accept wholeheartedly the 
changes that need to be made?

	Canada is not about cutting the best deal for oneself. Canada is 
not about carving up power among politicians. Canada is about 
building a hope and a dream for people around the world who look 
to Canada for inspiration from a country that can make its 
differences work.
<P>
	Let us look at the globe today. People with far greater differences 
than ours are making enormous accommodations and throwing off 
centuries of bitterness, centuries of historic hate. We see peace in 
the Middle East. We see peace in Northern Ireland. We see the 
peace process in Bosnia. Bitter rivals are laying down decades  and 
centuries of hatred and destruction and they are finding accom-

	The city of Shawinigan is twinned with mine. It was my father, a 
guy from Northern Ontario who spoke French slang, who twinned 
those to cities in the sixties. What do working people in 
Shawinigan and Hamilton want? They want us to be able to give 
the best to our children.
<P>
	My grandmother was a widow who raised six lads in Northern 
Ontario. She was penniless, and could not afford university for her 
children. Neither my father nor my mother went to university. But 
all their children did because, in the sixties, we tried to improve the 
situation in Canada to give more opportunities to more people.
<P>
	Our current fiscal circumstances are difficult, and we live in a 
period where we tend to withdraw into ourselves. But is that the

21st century. I sure of that.

	I am not afraid of public reaction to distinct society and veto 
rights. I am not afraid of people's reaction. The people said very 
clearly and in great numbers in Montreal that they were prepared to 
embrace real change. They were prepared to understand that the 
distinctiveness of Quebec forms an important part of the heart and 
soul of Canada.
<P>
	We are not hearing here today the voices of the people. They are 
the voices of the power brokers and the politicians who want to 
carve Canada into little pieces. The Bloc has an agenda. It wants 
Quebec without Canada. The Reform clearly wants a Canada 
without Quebec. Will regional expressions of difference, of making 
us smaller, of cutting us into little pieces, giving a little power to a 
politician here and taking a little power away there solve our 
problem? I know what will solve our problem.

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, today, I can understand the emotion the minister 
is feeling as she comes to realize how little she can do to change the 
situation for which her government is responsible.
<P>
	She also realizes that what she is offering on behalf of her 
government, because she is part of that government, means almost 
nothing to the people of Quebec. What I want to tell the tearful 
minister we saw today is that she should have shed her tears when 
her leader, the current Prime Minister of Canada, killed the Meech 
Lake agreement. That is when she should have shed tears.
<P>
	She should also have cried when the Prime Minister of 
Canada-who was only the leader of her party at the time-lurked 
around and tried to influence the Charlottetown accord 
negotiations. She should have shed tears then to try to convince 
him to listen more closely to what Quebec was saying.
<P>
	She should also have shed tears these last two years every time 
her government held a caucus meeting to say no to Quebec and to 
the historical demands of our province. That is what she should 
have done.
<P>
	Today, her tears come a little too late, and she has only herself 
and her own government to blame. I think the Leader of the 
Opposition made it clear yesterday and again today that we can 
expect nothing new from English Canada. We can expect nothing 
new from the other side because, besides some lip service and 
telling us: ``We love you, Quebec'', they have come up 
empty-handed.
<P>
	So, please, let us have a little less fuss and a little less show of 
emotion here. Let us try to remain clear-headed in our remarks and 
our approach in this House and have a very civilized debate, which 
is what we, in the Bloc Quebecois, intend to do.

Mulroney's. But the one who stabbed him in the back by jumping 
ship one month before the end of Meech was the Leader of the 
Opposition.

left. I was there till the end to support Meech Lake. The one who 
was not there, the one who resigned and did not have the guts to

that one was Lucien Bouchard. An if you are looking for one who 
did that, I am not the one-

off. He left the federal cabinet one month before Meech failed, 
without even having the decency to speak directly to prime 
minister Brian Mulroney because the pressure had become too 
much for him.
<P>

Lake.

emotional speech care to comment on the <I>La Presse</I> Gallup poll 
released this morning? It stated that 42 per cent of Quebecers 
polled support the 10 equal provinces scenario while only 37 per 
cent polled actually believe in two founding nations. The 
government clings to an outdated way of thinking.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> Madam Speaker, I tried to point out that if we are to 
build a future as a country we have to understand our past. We have 
a country that is generous. It is known around the world as being 
unique. We have a country where one-third of Canadians claim 
neither English nor French as the mother tongue. I am very proud 
in the riding of Hamilton East to represent them in Parliament. 
Why do we have this generosity of spirit?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Order. The time has 
expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am happy to rise in support of Bill C-110. If there is one 
overriding purpose here it is to put an end to the 30-years war.
<P>
	For the last 30-35 years since the quiet revolution in Quebec the 
best minds in Quebec and in Ottawa have been preoccupied with a 
constitutional debate. It is good fun. It has brought forth an army of 
special constitutional carpetbaggers and others, highly paid 
professional lawyers, professors who are available to give opinions 
on either side, open line talk show hosts and journalists who have 
grown up in one profession. They will all be sorry to see it go but it 
must end.
<P>
	There are more important problems today. Those are the 
economic problems that face us all of creating jobs, 
unemployment, and promoting economic growth.
<P>
	Even within the narrow area of government and public 
administration the excessive preoccupation with a Quebec problem 
too narrowly defined has been at the expense of examining 
rationalization and modernization of the constitutional 
governmental system. It is time to move on. What we can call the 
Chrétien package is an attempt to do that on a basis which the 
country will accept.
<P>
	It does have the two elements, the distinct society and what 
perhaps incorrectly has been called the constitutional veto. I was 
not part of the committee that drafted it, but in an open caucus 
where all ideas were put forward I brought together ideas that 
reflect those of my own constituents and the people in British 
Columbia who want one Canada and want Quebec to be part of it.
<P>
	If distinct society is defined it should restate what historically is 
a matter of faith but also law, has been accepted by Canadians and 
is reflected in those great constitutional international acts of 1759, 
1763, 1774 and onward. In so far as changes are made, they should 
not be formal constitutional amendments and thus be a roadblock 
to constitutional change in the future. That has been done. These 
matters are recorded in acts of Parliament and in accordance with 
the sovereignty of Parliament. Within the constitutional limits 
established by the Constitution they are capable of being 
re-examined and changed by ordinary legislation.
<P>
<B>(1130 )</B>
<P>
	In a certain sense these are yesterday's problems. The attempt is 
honourably to dispose of them and to move on to the new problems, 
to get away from this excessive preoccupation of the last 35 years 
that at some times seems to occupy 85 per cent or 90 per cent of the 
time in Ottawa and Quebec City. That is much too much.
<P>
	Since Bill C-110 is directed to the issue of constitutional change 
and its process, the issue of how do constitutions change has been 
raised. We have to recognize honestly that the constitutional 
amendment of 1982, chapter V, is a réforme manquée. It was an 
attempt to make a change, but it was not made.
<P>
	Under the old conventional system that ultimately turned on an 
act of the British Parliament passed at the request of Canada, the 
Constitution had a large degree of flexibility. Today it is rigid, 
virtually impossible to change. In fact the only two measures put 
forward in the last 13 years, Meech and Charlottetown, have both 
failed.
<P>
	So we do face the paradox that we have a rigid constitutional 
system and indeed any attention to this in a certain sense borders on 
being frustrated in the future.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17012"> 17012 </A></B>
<P>
	Constitutions are living documents. If they are not, they fail. 
Constitutions do change. Large masses of our constitutional law 
change by constitutional convention and custom.
<P>
	I would have said that the role of the Senate as a non-elected 
body conventionally follows that of the House of Lords. If you do 
not have the legitimacy of election, you do not interfere with 
legislation that is passed by a democratically elected lower house. I 
notice the Senate has been avoiding this in recent days. We may 
perhaps have to remind it of this.
<P>
	I simply point out that constitutional conventions through 
executive glosses is one way of changing a constitution. 
Constitutions change by judicial legislation. In 1982 I and others 
suggested to Prime Minister Trudeau that we consider a 
constitutional court, as they now have virtually throughout Europe 
in this post-communist reform and in Germany and other countries. 
Even so, the constitution changes through judicial interpretation.
<P>
	Lastly, a constitution changes through the exercise of constituent 
power. Ultimately, all constitutional power comes from the people. 
It is quite clear that the country has the capacity to renew itself 
through an act of total revision at some time. It is not defined in the 
Constitution, but it is the ultimate source of power.
<P>
	For those who worry too much, and I think unnecessarily, on 
reading this law and ask if we have put ourselves into a second 
constitutional strait-jacket after the 1982 amendments, the answer 
is no. I believe this generation of Canadians and British 
Columbians, many of whom I have taught, the many hundreds of 
thousands who have communicated their desire for one Canada, all 
have a rendezvous with the Constitution Act, if not this year then 
certainly by the end of the century. I think the new plural society 
we are getting in Canada today makes us a very unique country, a 
very distinct country in relation to the rest of the world. 
Multiculturalism is a living example of co-operation. I think we 
will find people will sit down and ask for a new constitutional 
charter, but not now. These people still have to be integrated in the 
political process. But it is occurring, and it is occurring before our 
eyes.
<P>
	In the meantime, the government is committed to pressing for 
constitutional change in other areas, using the fact that by 
executive example and discussion and negotiation-friendly 
relations and co-operative federalism-the system can be changed. 
Transfer of power, not in an abstract sense, with those battles of the 
1960s and 1970s before the courts, but identifying common 
problems all three levels of government need to work on together, 
is what the government is focusing on.
<P>
	We have seen this in the third element in the Chrétien package 
that has been brought forward. It is going to occur in many more 
areas, such as in the electoral system and actions on the Senate, 
which may require going to  the Supreme Court. We cannot do it 
through the 1982 amending procedure. There is the role of the 
cities. We are responding to the new transnational societies of 
which Canada is a part. This is key to the 21st century. All these 
things are going on.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister has responded to the Quebec referendum 
vote in a way that can rally enough support throughout Canada. It 
has to be an all-Canadian response. However, constitutional change 
will go on. We will see more and more emphasis on co-operative 
federalism, change through give and take and discussion at all 
levels of government. Federalism, if it involves power sharing and 
common decision making, also recognizes that federalism is more, 
as Prime Minister Trudeau once reminded us, than a collection of 
shopping centres. There is a national role, national norms.
<P>
	That is the challenge. The message is let us move on and bring 
peace to the Thirty Years War. Let us move on to the real economic 
and social problems. If we get that message, frankly, we have done 
honour to those who voted in the Quebec referendum on both sides 
and we have done something the people of Canada will understand 
and support.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I congratulate my 
colleague on a very eloquent speech.
<P>
	I had a chance to travel abroad on a trade mission and I met with 
many government officials in different countries. The first thing 
they asked me about was what is happening in Canada.
<P>
	Canadians, including those in the province of Quebec, have to 
look at Canada from the outside. We have to leave the country for a 
while in order to appreciate what we have in Canada.
<P>
	On an annual basis, in excess of ten million residents of other 
countries want to come to Canada. They believe, as do I, that this is 
the finest country on earth.
<P>
	It is beyond me why my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois will 
not consider what the government is proposing and try to make it 
work. Give us a chance to make it work. That is the hope of many 
of the people in my constituency who have written to me or called 
my office. They have asked me to stand in the House to call on my 
colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois to make an attempt to make this 
work.
<P>
	I want to ask my fellow caucus member if he has heard from his 
constituents who have come from different parts of the world. Have 
some of those people shared their feelings about their love for 
Canada? If they have, I would like him to share that with the 
House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> Madam Speaker, I am happy to respond to my 
colleague, who is one of the most thoughtful members of our party 
and very much  dedicated to the building of a new pluralistic 
Canada. We are a community of communities, in the sense Martin 
Buber offered. The interesting thing is that this society works. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17013"> 17013 </A></B>
<P>
People are co-operating. People are working together. We are 
integrating the new communities into the political processes.
<P>
	I told the Prime Minister the other day that British Columbia is 
the most distinct society of all because we have more national 
communities integrated into the political processes and working 
together. The message British Columbians are sending is that this 
country can function as a plural society. It is doing it already.
<P>
	One understands the distinctiveness of the French language and 
French culture in Quebec. We are prepared to respect that. 
However, we ask for similar respect for our distinctiveness, our 
culture, and the recognition that the larger Canada brings together 
all these elements into a new national outlook.
<P>
	I believe the reason the Prime Minister is receiving these 
messages from all around the world is because we have succeeded. 
This is not Bosnia-Herzegovina. I could name many countries 
around the world where nationalism exists in an intransigent sense. 
We have found the formula, and that is the message we are trying to 
carry in our approach to constitutional governmental change, 
change in the federal system in the balance of our term.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to ask something of the member for Vancouver Quadra. In law, 
as you know, we often say that the greater includes the lesser. 
However, in the bill tabled this morning, it seems that they are 
saying that the lesser includes the greater.
<P>
	I am totally confused. We rejected a lot more in the Meech Lake 
accord, but they are now saying that, in this proposal, they are 
responding to the wishes of Quebecers who voted no. Yesterday, 
they talked about the notion of distinct society in an insipid, dull, 
savourless declaration, just like we do with motions dealing with 
the national scouts week. Yesterday's motion had a similar effect. 
Today, a bill was tabled and I would like to ask the member how he 
can expect that we will accept something that we have already 
rejected in 1992 et which was a lot more than this?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> Madam Speaker, I would to say to the hon. 
member that I worked as constitutional advisor to many Quebec 
premiers. I was a member of the commission on French language 
and language rights in Quebec. For my part, I always believed in 
the tremendous possibility and flexibility of the federal system, 
which can decide that bills such as premier Bourassa's Bill 22 and 
even Bill 101 can still be essential  parts of the Government of 
Quebec as well as of our Canadian federal system.
<P>
	The message in all of this is that the existing flexibility of our 
constitutional system will stay. We must have faith in the future. 
We are ready to give Quebec what we can under the existing 
Constitution, which is very flexible.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
here is a perfect example of why the Bloc Quebecois has its place 
in Ottawa. We are here to face a government that is constantly 
insulting the intelligence of Quebecers. It is with great reluctance 
that we are debating Bill C-110, which will go down in history as 
the last insult the federal government will have inflicted upon 
Quebecers.
<P>
	Bill C-110 proposes a formula to amend the Constitution of 
Canada. It is simply a federal statute with all that it entails. It does 
not change in any way the amending formula since the procedures 
for amending the Constitution of Canada can only be modified 
through the procedure set out in section 41 of the Constitution Act, 
1982. I will come back to this later on.
<P>
	This bill does nothing but restrict the federal government's 
discretionary power to propose resolutions authorizing 
constitutional amendments. All in all, the federal government, 
being generous as it is, is lending to the provinces its constitutional 
veto. This bill brought forward by the Prime Minister and his 
associate, the Minister of Justice, adds to the numerous amending 
formulas already provided for in the Constitution Act, 1982.
<P>
	It will take a Ph. D. in constitutional law to be able to understand 
all that. Let us take a look, if we may, at the amending formulas 
already provided for in the Constitution of Canada. Four legal 
procedures for amending the Constitution are set out in sections 38 
to 44, Part V, of the Constitution Act, 1982. The most demanding 
formula applies only to fundamental changes to the Constitution.
<P>
	Amendments in this category must be authorized by resolutions 
of the Parliament of Canada and of the legislative assembly of each 
province. That is what we call the unanimity formula. There is also 
another amending procedure for changes in the distribution of 
legislative powers between the federal Parliament and the 
provincial legislative assemblies.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	It is the same procedure that must be followed to amend most of 
the provisions of the charter of rights and freedoms.
<P>
	The changes must be approved by Parliament and at least 
two-thirds of the provinces that have combined populations of at 
least 50 per cent of the population of all the provinces. This is what 
we call the seven and fifty amending formula. It provides that 
major amendments  could be made to the Constitution without 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17014"> 17014 </A></B>
<P>
Quebec's consent, because if Ontario were among the seven 
consenting provinces, the population requirement would be met.
<P>
	The third formula relates to amendments concerning one or more 
provinces. They include changes to provincial boundaries and the 
use of English and French within a province.
<P>
	The fourth procedure is found in section 44 of the Constitutional 
Act, 1982. It concerns changes to the executive branch of the 
Canadian government, the Senate or the House of commons.
<P>
	Now the Minister of Justice is proposing a fifth amending 
procedure. In the future, one will have to be very clever to be able 
to amend the Constitution.
<P>
	Not only is the bill introduced by the Minister of Justice an insult 
to Quebecers, it is the deathblow to the Constitution.
<P>
	This minister insults us by pretending to be following up on the 
promises made by the Prime Minister during the referendum 
campaign. He takes us for turkeys and is trying to shove his right of 
veto down our throats. He is debasing the concept and letting four 
regions of Canada use the federal's right to veto.
<P>
	If anyone in this House believes that Bill C-110 does more than 
simply lend something from the federal to the provinces, he or she 
is sadly mistaken.
<P>
	Not satisfied with adding to the constitutional jumble, the 
minister is strutting around saying he has a new formula for us. But 
it is a rehash, déjà vu.
<P>
	What the minister is serving up is a diluted version of the 1971 
Victoria formula spiced to the taste of the day. Federal mandarins 
have not waited long before showing their true colours. The only 
solution found by this hypocritical government was to brush away 
the cobwebs from the Victoria formula of 1971 and take the right of 
veto out of it. A new and improved formula. What nonsense.
<P>
	When the Prime Minister, through the Minister of Justice, 
introduces a bill proposing a regional right of veto and a motion 
dealing with the distinctiveness of Quebec, he adds insult to injury. 
He could not care less about Quebecers.
<P>
	Neither the present Prime Minister nor his successors will be 
legally bound by the amending formula. If, God forbid, it should 
become a law this formula would be an ordinary act like any other 
act and it could be repealed any time by the federal government.
<P>
	But how can we debate something we do not want to talk about 
any more? The Victoria formula was one of countless negotiations 
on constitutional reform. Those negotiations have been held ad 
nauseam but to no avail, except perhaps to deprive Quebec of the 
means it needs to develop itself in the Canadian federation.
<P>
	Efforts to corner Quebec have been such that the province is 
stifled and can only survive by acceding to sovereignty. The justice 
minister is wasting his time and ours. Do you believe that after all 
the affronts it has been subjected to, Quebec is going to accept such 
a proposal? I remember. Like all Quebecers, «Je me souviens.»
<P>
	Let us remember the so-called St-Laurent amendment of 1949, 
the 1960 Fulton formula, the 1964 Fulton-Favreau formula, 
Quebec's refusal of the Fulton-Favreau formula, the 1971 Victoria 
formula, the attempts by Pierre Elliot Trudeau in 1976, the 1978 
and 1979 conferences, the Pepin-Robarts formula, the conference 
of September 1980, the patriation project of October 2, 1980, the 
infamous patriation of the Constitution in 1982, the 1987 Meech 
Lake Agreement, Meech II and its defeat in 1990, the 
Charlottetown accord and its defeat in 1992.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	We will remember those 35 years of constitutional setbacks. The 
most recent affront sustained by Quebec is one too many. The 
Prime Minister of Canada, through his Minister of Justice, is today 
signing the death warrant of any possible constitutional reform.
<P>
	The Prime Minister is swaggering about and boasting about his 
empty proposals. He has a short memory. He should play the 
recording of the address he made to the nation four days before the 
referendum of October 30.
<P>
	I will never forget the sight of a desperate Prime Minister who 
did not have a clue about what promises to make next in order to 
win votes. A contrite and humble man.
<P>
	Many believed in this Greek tragedy. Many fell for it and 
believed the Prime Minister's promise to make changes. Today, the 
Prime Minister is patting himself on the back, but there is nothing 
to be proud of. Bill C-110 is a big bubble that is bound to pop 
sooner or later. Everything has its limits.
<P>
	The real purpose of the Prime Minister is to muzzle Quebec by 
stopping any future constitutional change. His right of veto is 
nothing but an illusion aimed at drowning Quebec in the Canadian 
sea. One people from coast to coast, with a wall to wall nationality.
<P>
	This bill is a rehash of the 1971 Victoria proposal. In an article 
entitled ``Modifying the Constitution or mummifying Quebec'', in 
<I>Le Devoir</I> of May 15, 1971, Jacques-Yvan Morin had this to say 
about the Victoria formula: ``You do not have to be a rocket 
scientist or even a sociopolitical expert to see what insurmountable 
problems Quebec will experience as soon as it tries to gain some 
significant change. Not that the amending formula is bad in 
itself-it would be perfectly acceptable in a homogeneous English 
state-but it does not take into account Quebec's aspirations or 
rather, it does, but to quash them''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17015"> 17015 </A></B>
<P>
	I go on with the quote: ``All in all, the anglophone provinces 
and the federal power are telling Quebec it can seek more powers 
and make as many major plans as it wishes, but it is only through 
them that it will achieve these goals. The new formula is the 
antithesis of the peoples' right to self determination. Under a 
benevolent exterior, federalism is in fact hiding dregs of 
colonialism''.
<P>
	Although this was written 24 years ago, it is surprisingly 
contemporary. This is to say that the federal government has not 
progressed that much since then. It is still intent on mummifying 
Quebec. Between the Victoria formula and the Meech Lake 
Accord, Quebec was taken for quite a constitutional ride in 1982.
<P>
	As we remember, in 1980, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, the then Prime 
Minister, and Jean Chrétien, his trusted lieutenant, had solemnly 
sworn to renew the Constitution, taking into account Quebec's 
interests. The Constitution forced on Quebecers in 1982 decreases 
Quebec's fields of exclusive jurisdiction. Moreover, Ottawa gave 
itself authority to amend the Constitution without Quebec's 
agreement. Quebec's right of veto disappeared. As a result, Quebec 
has had no say on constitutional amendments likely to change its 
political future.
<P>
	The unilateral patriation of the Constitution substantially 
reduced Quebec's legislative powers in matters of education and 
language. Since the patriation of the Constitution in 1982, the 
federal government has had a field day. It has continually intruded 
on matters under Quebec's jurisdiction, especially regional 
development, manpower training, cable television and several 
cultural areas.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	Then the whole constitutional process got bogged down at 
Meech Lake.
<P>
	When we talk about Meech Lake, we talk about the accord 
signed in June 1987 by the eleven first ministers of Canada. It was 
aimed at reintegrating Quebec into the Constitution ``with honour 
and enthusiasm''. There again, the results reflected the ill will of 
the federal government and of the English provinces.
<P>
	Quebec had offered to sign the Canadian Constitution provided 
five minimum conditions were granted. Namely, distinct society 
status for Quebec; more power in matters of immigration; limiting 
federal spending power in Quebec's fields of jurisdiction; Quebec's 
participation in the appointment of judges to the Supreme Court of 
Canada; and finally, the right to veto constitutional amendments.
<P>
	In June 1990, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Manitoba 
reneged on their signature, thereby sinking the accord. Despite last 
minute negotiations at the premier level, Manitoba and 
Newfoundland refused to ratify the accord.
<P>
	The day after its failure, the Prime Minister, who is now pushing 
a bill which is not worth the paper it is written on, embraced one of 
the most vociferous opponent to Meech, the Premier of 
Newfoundland, Clyde Wells. A Canadian version of Judas' kiss. I 
remember quite well, Madam Speaker.
<P>
	The failure of the Meech Lake Accord, which was to be the 
answer to the basic requirements of Quebec and bring the province 
back into the constitutional bosom with honour and enthusiasm, 
definitely proved that Canada refuses to recognize, among other 
things, the distinct character of Quebec. This week, the Prime 
Minister went so far as to reduce the distinct character to the level 
of a simple resolution of the House of Commons, without any legal 
meaning.
<P>
	We can certainly congratulate the Prime Minister for his 
consistency. He remains as sly as he has ever been.
<P>
	Let us continue our constitutional tour. In August 1992, the 
Charlottetown Agreement was signed by all representatives of 
Canada: ten provinces, two territories, four aboriginal 
organizations and the federal government. It was a ``made in 
Canada'' response to Quebec's legitimate requests.
<P>
	That agreement was a watered down version of Meech Lake and 
Meech Lake number two. Among other things, it recognized 
Quebec as a distinct society, accepted the transfer to Quebec of all 
responsibilities in the cultural area and stated that the federal 
government would withdraw from municipal affairs, tourism, 
recreation, housing, mining and forestry.
<P>
	On October 25, 1992, 57 per cent of Quebecers rejected the 
Charlottetown Agreement. They considered, with reason, that the 
agreement would give them only crumbs. The rest of Canada also 
turned down that agreement. English-speaking Canadians voted 
against it because they thought it gave too much to Quebec. Again 
another striking example of their love for Quebec.
<P>
	In spite of his commitment to negotiate on a one to one basis 
with the federal government, Robert Bourassa agreed to negotiate 
with representatives of nine provinces, two territories, four 
aboriginal organizations and the federal government. He even 
approved the agreement which gave Quebec even less than the 
Meech Lake Accord.
<P>
	For 35 years now, Quebec's requests for more power in the 
cultural, social and financial areas have been constantly rejected by 
the rest of Canada.
<P>
	Again today, the federal government is laughing at Quebecers 
with that bill. I say this to the government: the constitutional circus 
is closed for good; stop acting like clowns.
<P>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="17016"> 17016 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member spent 
a lot of time talking about the process and much time lecturing 
us on the history of the last thirty years.
<P>
	Like me, millions and millions of Canadians were not here 
during the last thirty years.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	They were not here in 1947, nor in 1911. Millions and millions 
of Canadians came after that. Like me, these people and the rest of 
Canada are interested in finding a permanent solution. We are not 
interested in the process, we are interested in the objective. We 
want to find a solution which is comfortable for the francophones 
in Quebec and the anglophones and allophones in the rest of 
Canada.
<P>
	Everywhere in the world we see borders being taken down. If 
you take the example of the European Union, you can see that 
borders are disappearing fast, even in France.
<P>
	With the new information technologies there are ever fewer 
borders between countries all over the world, whether in Asia, in 
Europe, in Africa or in North America.
<P>
	I wonder why our colleagues do not stop being so vicious, so 
idiotic and so indecisive. Why do they not give us a clear picture of 
what they want? Do we want to built a multicultural, multi-ethnic 
and multi-community country for all Canadians? Or is the final 
object the separation of Quebec from the rest of Canada?
<P>
	Indeed, we are wasting time talking about process and history. I 
was not here in 1841 and I am not interested in what happened in 
1841, in 1857 and in 1911. What I am interested in is a modern 
country, because Canada is the best in the world. The best country 
in the world, as we were told twice by the United Nations.
<P>
	I ask my colleagues to focus on the real problems of Quebecers; 
the real problems are the economy, the unemployment rate and the 
political instability that are affecting many business people who are 
thinking about investing in Quebec or doing business with Quebec. 
Thanks to my colleagues from the separatist party in this House, 
they are saying: we will wait until there is stability.
<P>
	Let us hurry up. Let us work with the Prime Minister, with the 
current government, because this government is willing to find a 
permanent solution to this crisis. The time has come. The time has 
come to let go of things that happened 2,000 years, 200 years, 20 
years, 30 years ago. Let us talk now about the future.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am quite astonished to hear a 
member of Parliament tell us that he is not interested in the past. I 
must admit seriously that this is inconceivable, when we know that 
analyzing the past allows us to avoid making the same mistakes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead): </B>The past is 
the key to the future.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne:</B> As my colleague just said, the past is indeed the 
key to the future.
<P>
	That someone would have such a vision of society is really 
astonishing, but I do not want to insist further. I think that he just 
got carried away.
<P>
	On the other hand, when he asks us if we intend to build a 
country, then obviously, we say yes. That is our goal. We want to 
build a sovereign Quebec, an independent Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have two comments for the hon. member opposite. First, 
I must point out that the purpose of the European Union is not to 
eliminate borders, but to preserve its member states' sovereignty 
while delegating, collectively and sovereignly, some of their 
powers to a common authority. In other words, the European Union 
is doing precisely what we intend to do in Canada. It is showing us 
the way.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	My second comment concerns the best country in the world. I 
have had enough of hearing that Canada is the best country in the 
world. If Canada is so terrific, it is not because it is a federation. It 
is because Quebecers and Canadians are active, inventive and 
energetic people, but it really has nothing to do with being a 
federation, because many other federations exist where there is no 
prosperity, Russia, for example.
<P>
	The system is not what makes us a good country, Canadians and 
Quebecers do. If the country was split in two, both halves would 
still have the same qualities, because, when you slice a cake, each 
slice is as good as the whole cake.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne:</B> Mr. Speaker, I can only commend my colleague for 
Blainville-Deux-Montagnes for his excellent comments. I totally 
agree with his words.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
absolutely delighted to take part in this debate today.
<P>
	It is very interesting that I have the opportunity to make my 
remarks on behalf of the people of Halifax and Nova Scotia in the 
wake of that impassioned intervention by my hon. colleague from 
the official opposition. There is no question that this is the best 
country in the world in which to live. I am not going to argue the 
whys and wherefores with the hon. member because a universal 
truth is a universal truth. The universal truth is that Canadians from 
sea to sea to sea are the most fortunate people on Earth.
<P>
	I come from what is normally known as a have not part of the 
country. It is quite true that there are many  things that we have not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17017"> 17017 </A></B>
<P>
in Nova Scotia. However, one of the things that we have, one of the 
things we opted for and one of the things we chose was Canadian 
citizenship. It is something we hold most dearly and most 
preciously.
<P>
	It is not merely because we live in Nova Scotia, which I think is 
the best place in Canada to live, just as I know my hon. colleague, 
the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, thinks that Toronto 
and its environs is the best place in Canada. I know that my hon. 
colleague from St. Boniface thinks that Manitoba is the best place 
to live and my colleague from London thinks that London is the 
best place. My colleague right over there from Alberta thinks 
Alberta is the best place to live. We all look at the rest of the 
country as the setting for our own particular jewels.
<P>
	I want to speak today to the passion which came from my 
colleague from the province of Quebec. I understand that passion 
as I think we all understand it, but that does not need to diminish 
our Confederation or our country.
<P>
	On Saturday I attended a meeting back in my riding. I sat next to 
a prominent Nova Scotia businessman. He raises money for all 
sorts of good causes, one of them being the Liberal Party. He told 
me he had been called upon by the premier and the minister of 
public works to help raise money to ensure that students and 
seniors who wanted to go to the rally in Montreal were able to go. 
He said that in over 20 years of being a fundraiser for various 
charitable causes and various political causes, he had never raised 
money so quickly. There was such a good response and such an 
absolute desire on the part of the people he called to contribute and 
to help because it was for our country.
<P>
<B>(1210 )</B>
<P>
	In my own family, my father's two surviving brothers went to 
Montreal after World War II and raised their families there. It is 
very interesting because my cousins in Montreal are a microcosm 
of Canada. Some of them have Irish last names, some of them have 
English last names, some of them even have Italian last names, and 
some of them have French last names.
<P>
	In my family while we may not be pure laine, we are purely 
Canadian. My cousins who live in the greater Montreal area will 
say that they are Quebecois and they are proud Quebecois. They 
and their children will continue to be proud Quebecois.
<P>
	The whole point of this debate, the whole point of this resolution 
is to follow up on a promise made by the Prime Minister on the 
responses of Canadians right across the country to the fact that 
Quebec is indeed a distinct and integral part of the Canadian 
federation, a distinct and integral part of the Canadian identity. We 
could no more see Quebec leave our federation than we could as 
individuals cut off an arm or a leg, or lose an eye.
<P>
	As we debate this here today and in subsequent days, it is terribly 
important for each of us to listen to each other and to understand 
that one region of Canada does not seek and never has sought, at 
least not in modern times, to defeat or humiliate the other side.
<P>
	That day in Montreal when I saw 150,000 Canadians converge in 
that square, I knew I was part of something very special. I knew 
that approximately-numbers are hard to be absolutely sure 
about-40,000 Canadians came from the other regions of Canada. 
There were 150,000 people in the downtown core of Montreal. It is 
clear that a vast majority of the people in that downtown square 
were Quebecois. They were people who were saying to their fellow 
Canadians: ``We want to stay. We want to hear from you that you 
understand we are different''.
<P>
	Whether we are from Quebec, Newfoundland or British 
Columbia, we do understand that there is a distinctiveness and a 
difference in our fellow citizens in la belle province. We know their 
language, although that too is shared with francophone Canadians 
in almost every other province and territory. We know their culture 
and the incredible richness that is the ongoing Quebecois culture 
within the Canadian mosiac is something that every Canadian 
benefits from, not just those within the borders of Quebec itself. 
We know Quebec's civil code again makes them different and 
distinct from the rest of us.
<P>
	Every single one of us celebrates that difference. We celebrate 
the fact that we can share. We can build a Canada that is a better 
place, whether one's language is English or French, whether one's 
ancestral origin is western Europe, eastern Europe, Africa, the Far 
East, or whether one is an aboriginal Canadian. None of these 
things matter in the desire to make a better place for our families, 
our children and our communities. I do not want my friend over 
there to be upset or to take this the wrong way. What matters is that 
this country is the best place in the world to live, whether you live 
in Quebec or Manitoba or Nova Scotia. Yes, we have problems, 
problems that those of us here in the House must work together to 
solve.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	Most of us in the Chamber have had the opportunity to go 
elsewhere. We have seen the Russian federation. We have seen 
countries of the world where people are clamouring to come to 
Canada, to Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia. We are trying to 
make them clamour to come to Nova Scotia too. Some day they 
will find out that is a good place to live as well. They are 
clamouring to be part of this incredible and unique and crazy idea 
which is Canada.
<P>
	I think we all understand the desires for recognition in the hearts 
and minds of our colleagues from Quebec. We are saying that there 
are similar desires in different areas for all Canadians. We cannot 
maintain this incredible and bizarre idea, this federation, this 
country, by standing  back and hurling implications at each other. It 
cannot be done by being accusatory or by suggesting motives that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17018"> 17018 </A></B>
<P>
are less than applicable in these situations. It is done by reaching 
out to each other the way we reached out in Montreal on that 
incredible Friday and the way all Canadians, English and French 
and allophone continue to reach out to each other.
<P>
	As many have said, this resolution is a step in that direction. It is 
something that the federal government, the Prime Minister and 
those on this side of the House sincerely believe is a response to the 
things the people of Canada asked us to do, including the people of 
Quebec.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurent Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened carefully to what the hon. member opposite was 
saying, and I would like to comment on some aspects of her speech.
<P>
	For instance, she made a big thing of this reaching out to us by 
people from western Canada, from Vancouver and Saskatchewan 
and the other western provinces. I want to tell her I do not question 
the feelings of love and affection these people showed Quebecers, 
except that it was made very easy for them. For instance, air fare 
from Vancouver to Montreal probably costs from $2,000 to $3,000, 
and these people got their tickets for $150 or $200. Now what if the 
situation was reversed? If Quebecers wanted to go and visit 
Vancouver, I am not so sure people would do us a favour and offer 
us tickets at $150 a piece. One starts to wonder how genuine this 
love and affection was. It was a great opportunity to visit Montreal 
on the cheap.
<P>
	And I also noticed in her speech that she referred to Canada as a 
wonderful host country for immigrants. I agree, but what difference 
would it make if Quebec became sovereign? Immigrants who want 
to go to Vancouver or Halifax, or Saskatchewan or Quebec would 
still be able to go there.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	In our blueprint for a Quebec society, we did not say that if 
Quebec became sovereign, we would stop immigration. I think the 
civility and warmth that are typical of Quebecers would make 
Quebec a very good host country for immigrants. I see no problem 
there. Why this claim that immigration can only work within this 
so-called great Canada? I do not understand.
<P>
	Are you implying that a sovereign Quebec would not be a good 
host country for its immigrants? Is that what you mean? Is this 
Canadian federation the one and only panacea? Is it impossible for 
a sovereign Quebec and English Canada to each find their own way 
outside this Canadian federation instead of going on as we have 
done for the past thirty years and wasting time, money and effort, 
on all this constitutional wrangling?
<P>
	In Quebec, successive provincial governments from Jean Lesage 
to Mr. Parizeau have tried time and time again to find ways to stay 
in Canada, but they never succeeded. Are we going to go on for 
another thirty years about Meech Lake, Charlottetown and 
constitutional problems? We are fed up. We want to go on to other 
things. We have tried everything, but nothing works.
<P>
	We never managed to reach an understanding. What makes you 
think that by continuing the constitutional debate between English 
Canada and Quebec, we would manage to agree? When I consider 
all the attempts made during the past thirty years, I see no reason to 
believe that continuing this useless debate will accomplish 
something positive. Instead of this endless bickering under the 
same roof, we would be much better off as good neighbours.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> That, Mr. Speaker, is unfortunate. I did not say 
anything about Quebec not welcoming immigrants. The province 
has a good immigration agreement with the federal government.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	At no time did I suggest that immigrants were not welcome in 
the province of Quebec. I did make reference to the question of 
pure laine and by implication to the remarks by Mr. Parizeau. 
However, I do not by any means attribute those to Quebec and its 
history of welcoming immigrants.
<P>
	It was unfortunate my colleague cast the kind of aspersions he 
did in his opening comments. It is clear that he looks the wrong 
way. He should have listened to my remarks. Perhaps he is not 
aware of it, but I am not from western Canada. I do not know what 
the situation was vis-à-vis the airlines.
<P>
	I have flown to western Canada many times, to your city, Mr. 
Speaker, and to cities farther west. If the hon. member is not aware 
of it, even for $50 to get on a plane and fly from Vancouver or 
Calgary to Montreal, go to a rally for two hours, get back on a plane 
and fly back to Calgary or Vancouver is not a joy ride. It is 
exhausting, tiring and cramped. If it is not done out of love then 
there are thousands of people in western Canada who possibly need 
to have their heads examined for doing this.
<P>
	The hon. member is really reaching when he suggests that people 
took advantage of cheaper air flights to have a good time in 
Montreal, not that Montreal is not a city where a wonderful time 
can be had. But I would suggest that very few people had the 
opportunity to do that on that Friday. Time schedules were very 
tight.
<P>
	Second, as the hon. member heard me mention in my earlier 
remarks, my good friend, the fundraiser, raised all that money 
joyfully. People just rushed to contribute. Many people from Nova 
Scotia came at no cost at all because the money was raised by 
contributing businesses in Nova Scotia. Again, those people did not 
have any  time to enjoy the benefits of Montreal. They went to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17019"> 17019 </A></B>
<P>
speak from their hearts to their love of country and their love of 
Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to start my speech by looking at the situation in which we now find 
ourselves. I think that Canadians, including Quebecers, have a 
better understanding of the role played by the Prime Minister of 
Canada and his government. They understood it yesterday and they 
understand it even better today.
<P>
	If we look at the current situation, we have on one side the Bloc 
Quebecois, which wants to separate. They use words like 
``sovereignty'' but we know that it really means separation. No 
wonder they refuse to even look at this proposal, to review it, to 
consider the possibilities. No. What they want is their own country, 
period, no negotiations, no flexibility, no open mind, no nothing.
<P>
	On the other side-as Canadians can see-is the other extreme. 
All they have to say about the government's proposals is, ``No, no, 
no, they are giving too much to Quebec and Quebecers''. I find this 
alarming. The two extremes here in this House refuse to make any 
efforts to consider what the government is proposing.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I mentioned in the House yesterday that I had checked <I>Maclean's</I> 
of 1989. In one edition in a specific article the leader of the third 
party suggested that distinct society had certain possibilities. In 
fact he stated quite clearly that words were not important if people 
really wanted to get together and work things out. That is what is 
said in that article.
<P>
	All of a sudden, no. Why would he think that in 1989 and have 
no openness today? It is quite clear. From his perspective and that 
of his advisers there appears to be an opportunity for his particular 
party, his particular view of Canada, his particular set of policies. Is 
it Canada first? Absolutely not. It is the party first and whatever 
happens to Canada, so be it. I find that most unfortunate.
<P>
	It is also interesting that the question of the regional veto is also 
one that the Reform members have supported. They want a 
regional veto to stop certain amendments. Did you know that, Mr. 
Speaker? I have found that most interesting.
<P>
	All of a sudden when we propose a veto that does not make a 
constitutional change, which would give additional protection to 
the provinces, which adds and does not take anything away, do you 
think Reform members would explain it that way? Would they 
attempt to talk with Canadians and say: ``Look, this is not 
necessarily what we wanted exactly but we have a proposal that is 
not terribly dissimilar to this?'' Of course  not. Why not? Let me 
tell you, Mr. Speaker. It is quite simple. Again, it is their political 
agenda. It is their political party that comes first, not Canada. That 
is unfortunate.
<P>
	That is why some people see them as two sides of the same coin; 
that is, we have one party that clearly states-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
``We want to separate from Canada. We want our own country''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
-and the other party that tries everything in order to crush, to 
deride, to set aside, not to look at openly, the proposals that are 
being made by the Prime Minister and the Government of Canada.
<P>
	Their policies hold a lot of contradictions. They suggest that they 
do not want this regional veto, but they have a regional veto on 
their books. They want one for B.C. but not for Alberta. The last 
time I checked they were pretty close in population. I guess that is 
what they want, I do not know. Perhaps they want one for all of the 
provinces. Perhaps they do not know what they want.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I now come back to the issue of distinct society. Distinct is 
defined as including the language, culture and institutions unique 
to Quebec. I find this quite commendable and acceptable. Like the 
vast majority of Canadians, if they made an error in judgment, they 
will soon find out.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	What is interesting, as you know, is that we now need unanimity 
on a number of issues to amend the Constitution. Nothing can be 
changed without the provinces' unanimous consent on a number of 
issues, on which I will elaborate later.
<P>
	There is another clause providing that no changes can be made 
without the consent of seven provinces representing 50 per cent of 
the population. This bill deals mainly with the principle that the 
7-50 formula cannot be implemented without the support of the 
four regions. These regions include Ontario, Quebec, western 
Canada-which means British Columbia and another province-, 
and the Atlantic provinces. This means two provinces representing 
50 per cent of the total population.
<P>
	What is really frustrating is knowing full well that the 
Constitution remains unchanged, that a little something extra has 
been given to everybody, that they already have a proposal in hand 
fostering this kind of veto and that they feel their party should 
come first, and the country second.
<P>
	I would now like to use the little time remaining to answer the 
most commonly asked questions. ``Why not table a constitutional 
amendment?'', our constituents ask.  But we know that the leader 
of the Parti Quebecois, the potential Premier of Quebec, has 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17020"> 17020 </A></B>
<P>
already made it clear that he does not want any constitutional 
amendment. That is clear.
<P>
	The purpose of this bill, on the heels of the Quebec referendum, 
is to show where the elected representatives of the Canadian people 
stand on this issue, and we will soon know it. We also know that the 
Constitution requires that a first ministers' conference on the 
amending formula for the Constitution of Canada be held by April 
1997. Constitutional amendment proposals, if any, will be 
considered at that time. This bill would in fact bridge the gap until 
then.
<P>
	There are other questions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	For example, what is covered and what sorts of future 
amendments would be blocked by this bill? The real impact will be 
on the amendments covered by the same seven and fifty rule, as I 
have mentioned, changes to the division of powers in favour of the 
provinces, changes to certain provisions relating to federal 
institutions, extensions or additions of provinces in some general 
amendments.
<P>
	Another question that is frequently asked is how does this bill 
differ from what is already in the Constitution. This bill does not 
change the Constitution or the amending formula. They know that, 
but of course they are not going to say it. It simply indicates how 
the government will conduct itself with respect to its own veto. It is 
willing to loan out its veto. That is what it does.
<P>
	There are significant vetoes already in the Constitution for 
provinces individually. For example, each province has a veto over 
matters requiring unanimity, such as the composition of the 
Supreme Court and the amending formula itself. Each province has 
a veto over any changes in its boundaries or the constitutional 
provisions specific to a province.
<P>
	In addition, there is the right to opt out of amendments 
transferring provincial jurisdictions to Parliament and to receive 
reasonable compensation if the amendment pertains to education 
and other cultural matters. This gives another type of veto to a 
province.
<P>
	The bill creates a regional veto, in effect, with respect to changes 
to national institutions such as the Senate and the Supreme Court, 
the creation of new provinces, and all amendments that transfer 
power from Parliament to the provinces.
<P>
	Another question raised is whether the Constitution already 
provides provincial vetoes-does the bill provide for any double 
veto? There are all kinds of amendments whereby provinces 
already possess such a veto, such as changes to the composition of 
the Supreme Court or to the boundaries of a province. They are 
expressly exempted from the operation of the bill. So too are  
amendments from which provinces can opt out under subsection 
38(3), those which derogate from provincial rights and powers 
expressly exempted through the operation of this bill.
<P>
<B>(1235 )</B>
<P>
	Would the regional veto formula make it more difficult for 
Quebec to separate? One view of the constitutional amending 
formula as it stands now, which is a very common view, is that the 
consent of all provinces would be required for Quebec's separation.
<P>
	How would the regional veto formula work in practice? This is a 
particularly important question because it is the very heart and soul 
of the issue. When at least six provinces, including Ontario and 
Quebec, two Atlantic provinces with over 50 per cent of the 
Atlantic population, and two western provinces with over 50 per 
cent of the western population have indicated their consent by 
resolution, referendum or government approval, et cetera, the 
federal government would be free to proceed with resolutions in 
the Senate and the House of Commons. If one or more of the 
regions fail to provide their requisite consent, the federal 
government would not proceed with resolutions, even though seven 
or more provinces with over 50 per cent of the population had 
adopted resolutions under the current amending formula to 
authorize the amendment.
<P>
	We have talked about the kinds of combinations that would be 
required for western and Atlantic provinces to get a veto under the 
regional formula. I want to repeat this because I think it is 
important. In the Atlantic provinces, Nova Scotia and either New 
Brunswick or Newfoundland would have a veto. New Brunswick 
would be in the same position with either Nova Scotia or 
Newfoundland as would Newfoundland with either of the others. 
P.E.I. would not have a veto except in combination with two of the 
other three.
<P>
	In the west, B.C. with any other province would have a veto. 
Alberta would have a veto with B.C. but not with either 
Saskatchewan or Manitoba alone. Saskatchewan and Manitoba 
together would not have a veto.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is important to note that we are not dealing with a new veto. 
The bill only indicates how the existing veto is exercised at the 
federal level.
<P>
	I am running out of time. That is unfortunate, because I would 
have had so much more to say. But I will conclude with, perhaps, 
one last comment.
<P>
	As I pointed out at the beginning of my speech, these proposals 
concerning a distinct society, this bill and the right of veto are all 
part of an effort to build a better country, a country in which people 
work together and better understand each other.

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Unfortunately, the hon. member's time 
is up. Is there unanimous consent to give the hon. member more 
time?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think that our hon. friend from St. Boniface 
has said enough for now. He will have an opportunity, during 
questions and comments, to expand on his thoughts concerning the 
bill before us.
<P>
	I have a comment for him. Then, I will give him the opportunity 
to respond to my comment.
<P>
	I listened very carefully to what our colleague from St. Boniface 
said. More often than not, in fact I should say usually, he takes 
things seriously. Having held important functions in Manitoba, he 
is familiar with the meaning of the words and concepts we are 
dealing with and he can fully grasp them and deal with them. He 
must know what this bill we are debating means and how 
far-reaching it is.
<P>
	Indeed, I am surprised, to put it mildly, that he is adding so much 
confusion to the debate. One thing is sure-he said so himself 
several times in his remarks, both in French and in English-the 
bill before us does not change anything at all. What we have here is 
the status quo, no change. If this bill does not change anything, why 
table it in this House? I will go into this further later today.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	You will probably be amazed to hear what has prompted the 
government to put this bill forward at this point in time. But what I 
want to emphasize right now is the element of confusion 
introduced by the hon. member for St. Boniface in his remarks by 
insisting and suggesting that this bill will actually change 
something and that a lot noise of noise can now be made around 
Quebec's new right of veto on any future constitutional change. 
That is wrong.
<P>
	At the same time, he says the bill does not change anything, that 
what we have here is the status quo, that the good people of English 
Canada, outside Quebec, have nothing to worry about, because 
there will be no change. Supposedly, all they are doing, the only 
impact this bill will have will be to give the federal government a 
new set of rules to go by, under which it will try to determine if the 
changes it contemplates would garner the support of a number of 
provinces or certain regions of Quebec and Canada. That is what he 
is telling us, but basically what he is saying is that there will be no 
change.
<P>
	I would personally like the hon. member for St. Boniface to tell 
us which part of his remarks we are to believe. Which part should 
we give credence to? The part where he tells Quebecers: ``You will 
have your veto''? Or the one intended for people outside Quebec, 
which says: ``Nothing will change''?
<P>
	Could the hon. member clarify?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to answer the hon. 
member's question.
<P>
	It was certainly not my intention to add to the confusion, and I 
apologize if I did. I thought I was clear when I said that, for 
example, provinces currently have a veto. All the provinces have a 
veto over certain issues. I also said that, as regards other issues, the 
support of seven provinces representing 50 per cent of the 
country's overall population was required. I added that this bill 
would be used to see if we could activate that 7-50 formula.
<P>
	The member who just accused me of adding to the confusion is 
fully aware of the situation. This is what is annoying and, if it were 
not also funny, I would really be upset.
<P>
	The member is the one adding to the confusion, because he 
claims that what I said is inaccurate. I invite him to check my 
notes, to look at <I>Hansard</I> and to rise in this House to publicly refute 
my comments if he thinks they are contradictory. There is no 
contradiction. It is the constitutional status quo. There is a new 
mechanism to ensure that some elements of the Constitution are 
used in a certain way. It is wrong to claim that this will not increase 
the power of Quebec, Ontario and the other provinces. The member 
knows that.
<P>
	I also want to point out that he did not allude to the distinct 
society concept. I suppose he will again accuse me of adding to the 
confusion. There is no confusion. We recognize Quebec as a 
distinct society, because of its language, culture, and unique 
institutions. There is nothing complicated in that and it is 
absolutely fair.
<P>
	If the member is willing to co-operate, I am prepared to do the 
same and to clarify our terms. It is unfair and wrong to use a term 
such as English Canada. There is no such thing as an English 
Canada. We live in a country called Canada, which includes a 
number of provinces and territories, and the member knows that as 
well as I do.
<P>
	In making such a comment, he tries to put in the minds of 
Quebecers the notion that French is spoken in only one part of the 
country. I, for one, am proud to speak French. Some people back 
home, and west of it, speak it better than I do. There are quite a few 
of them. As the hon. member knows, there is also quite a large 
number of people in Atlantic Canada who speak French and who 
are proud to do so.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	It is misleading to use the expression English Canada, as the hon. 
member did, because it is both inaccurate and wrong. I must say 
that he is not the only one to do so. I would appreciate it if he and 
his colleagues made a commitment to stop using that expression.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I remind the Chair that I will be splitting my time with the 
hon. member for Vegreville.
<P>
	As I speak to this unity debate I am very mindful that I represent 
all of the people of Edmonton Southwest. I represent everyone 
whether they voted for me or for someone else. It is absolutely 
essential that members of Parliament remember the fact that we 
represent every one of our constituents and that all 295 of us in 
combination represent all of the people of Canada, whether they 
voted for us or not.
<P>
	When I go home tonight I will be seeing my brand new 
granddaughter who I have not seen a lot of because I have spent so 
much time in the nation's capital in Parliament. Everything I do is 
directed toward my children and grandchildren. It seems 
reasonable that we in the House should have our eyes firmly fixed 
on the future.
<P>
	The tragedy is that so many people of Canada are represented by 
members in the House who have their eyes firmly fixed on the past. 
While we all recognize that the foundation of the future is the past, 
we cannot live in the past. There is nowhere to go. The past is dead. 
There is nothing in it for us. If we as a nation continue to live in the 
past, we are never going to spring into the future which belongs to 
our children.
<P>
	Our generation and preceding generations have managed to 
somehow magically saddle our children and grandchildren with a 
debt which has been built up over a number of years. In addition to 
that we have saddled them with a relationship of our constituent 
parts which has been fractious and has not worked smoothly for all 
of my adult life.
<P>
	The rest of the country has tried at various times to coerce or to 
buy the affection of Quebec through constitutional changes, 
quasi-constitutional changes, outright money or outright 
advantage. For instance, to satisfy the people of Quebec the now 
infamous CF-18 maintenance contract went to Quebec. None of 
this has worked. Constitutionally, we are still at exactly the same 
place today as we were 30 years ago.
<P>
	All the primary protagonists of this debate are from Quebec. 
Every damned one of them is from Quebec. The Prime Minister is 
from Quebec. His primary advisers are from Quebec. The leader of 
the Bloc Quebecois is from Quebec. Obviously all of the Bloc is 
from Quebec. We have to ask ourselves why the rest of Canadians 
are being dragged along as helpless spectators as these people go 
through their never ending Gordian knot they got themselves into. 
It is almost as if the leader of the Bloc and the Prime Minister both 
represent the past. They are bound so tightly to the past that they 
are unable to see the future. They are unable to see how Canada has 
grown and how Quebec has grown since the silent revolution.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	I ask myself, why in the name of God are we trying to satisfy the 
separatists? Why are we trying to satisfy people who would break 
up the country at the expense of federalists? What is it in the nature 
of this debate that causes us to be so shortsighted that we would 
risk the future of the country, that we would risk the west of the 
country in order to satisfy separatists in Quebec who will never be 
satisfied?
<P>
	It is our responsibility to build for the future, not for the past. 
Our responsibility is to our children and our grandchildren and to 
their children, not to our grandparents and our parents. It is to the 
future, not to the past.
<P>
	On the record I would like to quote from a book entitled <I>Rights 
of Man</I>, written by Thomas Paine. Thomas Paine was one of the 
architects of the American constitution. The American constitution 
has lived for all these hundreds of years because it is flexible, 
because it is living, because it has room for everybody in its 
constituent parts to grow. He states in his book:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is the living and not the dead that are to be accommodated. When man 
ceases to be, his power and his wants cease with him; and having no longer any 
participation in the concerns of this world, he has no longer any authority in 
directing who shall be its governors, or how its government shall be organized, 
or how administered.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Members would recognize the corollary of that in which he 
states: ``The vanity and presumption of governing beyond the grave 
is the most ridiculous and insolent of all tyrannies''. What he is 
saying is that each generation has the right and the responsibility to 
govern for its time and should no more bind the hands of future 
generations than our generation should be bound by the past. This 
then brings into play the whole notion of whether or not a veto is 
reasonable in a democratic federal state for anyone under any 
circumstances based on the notion of tying the hands of future 
generations.
<P>
	Everybody had a reason to vote against the Charlottetown 
accord. This was mine: I did not think it was responsible for our 
generation to tie future generations into a Constitution that would 
be so inflexible it could not be changed. Is that any legacy to leave 
to future generations? Do we have that little trust in our children 
and our grandchildren that we would bind them to a Constitution in 
cement?
<P>
	This then brings us to part two of the Prime Minister's new 
amending formula. If we saw our country from outer space or if we 
came to this country and we saw this as a blank canvas, how would 
we and what would we do to make it work? Surely in this country 
which extends over 5,000 miles from one coast to the other with 
just 30 million people in it, there is elbow room for everyone. 
Surely we can figure out a way that we can live together in peace 
and harmony and with mutual respect. Surely this is not an 
impossible situation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17023"> 17023 </A></B>
<P>
	The suggestions we have brought to the table concerning the 
amending formula or veto keep in mind that all of us, every single 
human being in this country and in this world, are equal by virtue 
of the fact that we are human beings. When we gather under an 
apple tree or when we gather in a room and we determine what 
rights we are going to have, we do not do so based on whether 
we are male or female, whether we speak French or English, or 
whether we are black or white. We gather together and through 
commonality we have governance because we are human beings, 
because it is in our best interests and our common interests.
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	How then would we go about doing this? How would we make 
our country work if we had a clean slate and we could start from 
scratch? It seems to me that if one group in our country feels 
threatened and feels that the only way the group can protect its 
future is through a constitutional veto that gives it the authority to 
ensure that nothing in the future without its consent can have 
impact on the group's language, culture, civil code or the way in 
which it has evolved as a society, what is wrong with that? It is a 
recognition of the obvious: Quebec is a distinct society. Of course 
Quebec is a distinct society.
<P>
	How do we go about recognizing that without at the same time 
suggesting to other Canadians that they are less distinct or 
somehow not favoured? We do this with an amending formula 
based on the regions of the country, but most important the 
ratification is done by the people through referenda, not by the 
Parliament and not by the legislatures.
<P>
	The reason for this is very important. Most Parliaments and most 
legislatures can have a decided majority yet that majority may only 
have received a minority of the votes cast. This Parliament is one 
such example. The Liberals have a huge majority of seats with a 
minority, 43 per cent, of the votes cast.
<P>
	The only way we can possibly ensure that changes to the 
Constitution will bear the imprimatur of the people is to ensure that 
these changes are ratified through a referendum. That is one 
exceptionally important reason.
<P>
	The regions are important because they are and have always 
been homogeneous groups. The region for Alberta, Saskatchewan 
and Manitoba has always been referred to as the prairies. 
Everybody knows that. No one has ever described British 
Columbia as the prairies. British Columbia is growing at a great 
rate and in one generation will equal the population of Quebec. 
Alberta is growing more quickly but is balanced by Saskatchewan 
and Manitoba. It works, and if it works why should we be tied to an 
amending formula which came from people who woke up from a 
Rip Van Winkle sleep and said: ``Let us just drop the Victoria 
amending formula on top of this today''. That is not the kind of 
flexibility we require.
<P>
	The final comments I would like to put on the table today have to 
do with how we got into this mess in the first place. How did we go 
about giving legitimacy to this notion of two nations? How did that 
come to pass?
<P>
	We have been blessed with some very fine Canadians over the 
years. One such very fine Canadian was Eugene Forsey. Eugene 
Forsey was a constitutional scholar. He was recognized by friends 
and foes alike as one of the paramount constitutional scholars in 
our country. All his living life he supported the New Democratic 
Party. In 1961 he left the party because of the notion of two 
founding nations which it never was; it was one nation from the 
very beginning.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in a hastily 
planned and executed press conference, the Prime Minister 
announced the Liberal government's agenda for change.
<P>
	The package the Prime Minister has put forward is both negative 
and divisive. He offers Quebec distinct society status which Meech 
Lake and Charlottetown have demonstrated to be divisive. He is 
offering the regions of Canada a veto power, which means the 
ability to stop change instead of the ability to offer change, change 
which is so badly needed in this country.
<P>
	The Prime Minister gives the provinces control over manpower 
training. While this might be a step in the right direction, he chose 
not to go all the way. He offered the provinces the responsibility 
but the federal government still controls the purse strings.
<P>
<B>(1300 )</B>
<P>
	Bill C-110 proposes to divide Canada into four regions, the 
western provinces of B.C., Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba; 
Ontario; Quebec; and Atlantic Canada. The bill gives the four 
regions a veto over any constitutional amendment which includes 
changes to national institutions and the creation of new provinces 
and amendments regarding the distribution of powers. Currently 
only the House of Commons holds a veto over most constitutional 
amendments.
<P>
	The bill is not a constitutional amendment or even an amending 
formula. It is simply an unenforceable code of conduct for the 
federal government. The bill promises the federal government will 
oppose any constitutional amendment, even one Ottawa puts 
forward, unless the amendment is consented to by the four regions.
<P>
	The four regions proposal is a slap in the face to western Canada. 
If all the west, the netherlands as the Liberal government seems to 
consider the west, is allocated as one region, obvious problems 
come forth. If sometime in the future B.C. has a population which 
exceeds the combination of the population of Saskatchewan, 
Manitoba and Alberta, and that seems very likely, Alberta, 
Manitoba and Saskatchewan will lose all real power in terms of 
constitutional change.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17024"> 17024 </A></B>
<P>
	First, they lose it to B.C. because if B.C. becomes more 
populous than the other three provinces together it will have a 
majority which will carry under Bill C-110.
<P>
	Second, under the provincial government ratification procedure 
now in place a change will be able to get the required support of 
seven provinces without getting the consent of Alberta, 
Saskatchewan or Manitoba. Clearly the three prairie provinces lose 
out under this proposal.
<P>
	Under the legislation if a region refuses consent it vetoes 
constitutional change. Because the bill is vague Quebec would be 
able to veto constitutional change through a written statement from 
the premier, a resolution from the National Assembly of Quebec or 
a province-wide referendum.
<P>
	Therefore the bill would provide a veto of any constitutional 
change the province of Quebec or Ontario did not want. This 
change gives the current separatist premier of Quebec a veto over 
any constitutional change. How much sense does that make? I will 
touch on that subject a little later in my speech.
<P>
	The bill is not part of the Constitution and therefore the existing 
amending formula still applies. If the existing formula still applies 
and we add the new formula, it would not only give central Canada 
a veto but it might require unanimity.
<P>
	Bill C-110 would create a system where there are two rounds of 
provincial ratification with little federal say in constitutional 
amendments. Under the current system each province has its say. 
The federal government, presumably acting on behalf of a united 
Canada, the country as a whole, is a necessary and vital part of the 
process.
<P>
	Under the legislation the government proposes to delegate the 
important responsibility of constitutional change not to Canadians 
but to provincial legislatures. The provinces will be consulted 
twice: once under the old amending formula and once by the 
federal government in determining whether to apply its veto in 
support of provincial concerns.
<P>
	The provinces will look after provincial interests and the federal 
government will ensure that provincial interests are respected. 
With the federal veto delegated to the provinces, no one will be 
looking out for a united Canada, Canada as one country, which is 
what Canada is.
<P>
<B>(1305 )</B>
<P>
	Can the government not see that Canadians deserve more? They 
deserve carefully thought out proposals made in the open and not 
behind closed doors and not by a top down centralist government. 
They deserve forward thinking proposals, not the reheated 
leftovers of the failed Meech Lake and Charlottetown accords.
<P>
	In contrast to this negative and certainly divisive approach by the 
government the Reform Party has offered Canadians a new and 
better Canada through our  new confederation proposal. The 
proposal includes a plan to modernize and decentralize the federal 
government by transferring certain powers to the provinces and the 
people while strengthening other federal powers.
<P>
	The proposal also includes a plan to renew certain federal 
institutions. Among the 20 proposals Reform would guarantee 
provincial control over natural resources, language and culture. 
Reform would change the federal role with regard to provincially 
administered social services such as welfare, education and health 
care. Reform would foster co-operative agreements rather than 
impose unilateral standards which are enforced by threats to 
withhold federal funding.
<P>
	In addition, the proposals would provide for a further 
decentralization of powers through an overhaul of federal 
institutions, for example Parliament, the Senate, the Supreme 
Court of Canada and the Bank of Canada.
<P>
	These measures would give the power to the people and to the 
provinces where it is needed. In turn, it would reduce duplication 
and interference from Ottawa in areas where it is not needed or 
desired. Canadians have long been concerned about the 
concentration of too much power in the hands of the federal 
executive and the cabinet. The proposals give Canadians a new and 
more accountable system of government for which they have been 
asking for some time. I believe Canadians want change. They do 
not want more constitutional wrangling. The proposals can be 
realized without reopening old constitutional wounds.
<P>
	The proposals that have been presented demonstrate once again 
the lack of a democratic approach on the part of the government. 
We have seen in the past the lack of democracy in legislation, for 
example Bill C-41 and Bill C-68, the gun control bill, where MPs 
who dared to vote against the government-

<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I should like to point out 
regardless, and particularly to bring it to the attention of our 
viewers today, that this is a historic day for Canadians and for all 
Quebecers as well, of course.
<P>
	Yesterday the Prime Minister announced recognition of Quebec 
as a distinct society. Of course, we spoke about a resolution. Today 
it was decided that we would speak of a veto right for Quebec, as 
well as for three other regions of the country, of course.
<P>
	Quebec has also experienced in recent months, in recent years in 
fact, a debate which has forced the population to make a choice. 
And the choice Quebecers  made in the referendum on October 30 
showed that they want to remain within the Canadian federation.
<P>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="17025"> 17025 </A></B>
<P>
	I count myself among those who acknowledge that discussions 
were stressful at times and that, unfortunately, the Leader of the 
Opposition did not hesitate to divide Quebecers.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	Several conclusions may be drawn, I believe. What people want 
is change. But some, Quebecers in particular, want change without 
a break-up. This is undeniably the conclusion reached from the 
referendum, its results and the interpretation we have made of them 
after consulting the pollsters. Very nearly two thirds of Quebecers 
want the Government of Quebec to reach agreement with the 
Government of Canada in order to move ahead with change, not 
only changing the Constitution but also, and above all, addressing 
economic and job creation issues.
<P>
	I listened with a great deal of attention and interest to the speech 
the Leader of the Opposition gave yesterday afternoon in this 
House. I found it regrettable that the Leader of the Opposition, who 
has always claimed to be a spokesman of sorts for some of the 
people of Quebec, does not wish to acknowledge that Quebec is a 
distinct society and is not prepared to support us, the Government 
of Canada and the people of Canada, in finally recognizing Quebec 
as a society that is distinct by virtue of its language, laws and 
culture. I find it unacceptable that a leader, a member from Quebec 
like the Leader of the Opposition, will not line up on our side to 
defend the true interests of the province and of those whom we 
represent.
<P>
	For some time now, and today in particular, I have had the 
impression that a number of opposition members will again put 
federalism on trial, but will unfortunately not take into 
consideration the progress Quebec has made within the Canadian 
federation in the last 130 years.
<P>
	We are well aware that there are only seven million French 
speakers in Quebec. I have also learned that there are nearly 
800,000 or a million allophones, anglophones and so on, who are, 
of course full fledged members of Quebec society.
<P>
	However, within the Canadian federation, despite our 
constitutional differences over the years-which I have had 
nothing to do with-we are well aware that the average Quebecer 
has made incredible gains in contrast with individuals in other 
societies and other countries, which are less well off than Canada 
and the people of Quebec.
<P>
	I believe the Canadian federation has, nevertheless, helped build 
the bases of our distinct society. We have created a 
telecommunications network, through all sorts of federal offices, 
Radio-Canada in the 1930s and the National Film Board. We 
nevertheless allowed Quebec to  look after cultural matters and 
especially to sign agreements not only with other provinces, but 
even with foreign countries in order to strengthen and guarantee 
French where I come from, that is, in Quebec. With the close 
co-operation of the Canadian government, we have assured the 
influence of the francophone culture not only within Quebec, but 
elsewhere in the country as well.
<P>
	We must not forget that francophones may be found in other 
regions of the country. I am back from a business trip to western 
Canada. I met francophones in Alberta and in Manitoba. The 
communities there are dynamic. They depend a lot on the presence 
of the federal government and on good relations with other 
communities, including the anglophone community.
<P>
	I find it unfortunate that, during the referendum, there was an 
effort to exclude and isolate the French fact outside Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	You know, there is close to one million francophones outside 
Quebec. Close to 450,000 young anglophones are in French 
immersion. I believe that this presence was intentionally 
minimized by the opposition for purely symbolic reasons, but 
mostly for political expediency.
<P>
	I believe it is important to tell Quebecers that we are not the only 
ones, that there are other francophones in Canada. As a matter of 
fact, we had the privilege to hear one of those, a member from 
Manitoba, speak in this House, in both official languages, of 
course. I often have the opportunity to listen to members either 
from Ontario or New Brunswick. I find it remarkable that, in this 
country, and especially in this House, there is an increasing number 
of members, not only anglophones but people of Italian descent or 
of other ancestries-we have members from all over the world, I 
believe-who speak French fluently.
<P>
	If we look at Canada today, especially the make-up of this House 
of Commons, particularly on this side, it is obvious that 
bilingualism has allowed French to gain ground across Canada, 
which is an important breakthrough. I got a note telling me not to 
hesitate to speak about francophones, indeed, encouraging me to do 
so.
<P>
	I noticed, during the referendum campaign and increasingly in 
the media, that Quebecers have come to one important conclusion. 
Increasingly, they have come to recognize the presence of 
francophones outside Quebec, who have a very significant role to 
play. I admit that I am digressing, but I wanted to show that 
Quebecers are not the only francophones in Canada. We must 
support and work in close co-operation with those who are 
promoting French throughout the country.
<P>
	I truly believe that, with the help not only of the people of 
Quebec, but also of people outside Quebec, we are finally going to 
recognize Quebec as a distinct society. With this in mind, we are 
inviting the Leader of the  Opposition to support us. It is very 
important, not only for Quebecers, but for francophones outside 
Quebec, who, from now on, can rely-and why should they 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17026"> 17026 </A></B>
<P>
not-on the Quebec government taking an active part in the 
Canadian federation. This is what we are seeking.
<P>
	I believe that Quebecers, and Canadians as a whole, are sick and 
tired of constitutional debates, but I believe that we must seize this 
opportunity to recognize Quebec for what it is and, of course, Mr. 
Speaker, before you rise-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Unfortunately, dear colleague, your time 
has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to give the member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine the opportunity to finish his 
speech, since I realized from his reaction that he wished to have a 
few more minutes. So, the fact that we are now moving into 
comments will certainly allow him to continue.
<P>
	However, I would like to make a few remarks concerning his 
speech because, as he rightly mentioned, what the member tried to 
do during the few minutes that he spoke was to tell us how English 
Canada-even though our colleague from St. Boniface does not 
want us to use that expression-loves us and how it recognizes the 
importance of the French fact, since he emphasized that several 
Canadians are now taking French courses, which is a fact and a 
good thing.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	It is also well known that Quebec is where we find the greatest 
number of people who can speak both languages, French and 
English. On an individual basis, everybody recognizes the 
importance of speaking both French and English. I will add that, in 
Europe, it is not two languages that most people speak, but three, 
four and even more, and sometimes very complicated languages, 
much more complicated than French and English.
<P>
	Having said that, and with all due respect for our colleagues 
opposite, that does not solve in any way the political situation in 
Canada. That does not solve the political and constitutional 
problem that that federalists have been struggling with for many 
decades, and trying to solve in all kinds of ways. It is important to 
point this out because, every time government members stand up in 
this House, they tell us that it is the separatists who are preventing 
constitutional changes. At the present time, that is the only 
argument that they are using to say that, unfortunately, they cannot 
change the Constitution. The Prime Minister, almost with tears in 
his eyes, as well as the Deputy Prime Minister, with her crocodile 
tears, tell us: we cannot bring about constitutional changes. The 
Leader of the Opposition, who will become Quebec's Premier, said 
right away that he did not want any changes.
<P>
	That is the whole debate in a nutshell. Even though I recognize 
the facts raised by the member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine concerning the importance of 
the French aspect, I wish that he would speak a little more 
substantively about the bill itself.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon (Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member opposite for his openness 
and his generosity and I hope other members will follow suit.
<P>
	There is no doubt that, in all this, Canada has been able to follow 
a peaceful approach where other countries resorted to violence. 
What I find extraordinary in our country is the fact that it is because 
we have a flexible system that we are always in the middle of some 
negotiations.
<P>
	Unfortunately, things are different in France and even in the 
United States. When it is time to make changes, to move on as a 
society, these countries are unfortunately stuck with constitutions 
which often are inflexible and very difficult to change, especially if 
the changes are to reflect the reality we face at the turn of the 
century.
<P>
	The previous speaker just said again what all Quebecers know 
already, which is that the Leader of the Opposition, once he 
becomes Premier of Quebec, will reject every constitutional 
agreement with Canada. One thing is clear: his only objective is the 
separation of Quebec, the end of Canada.
<P>
	One of the highlights of the last century has been, of course, a 
true political and economic feat, which will endure only if we can 
rely on the support of the opposition and the Leader of the 
Opposition and next Premier of Quebec, in order to recognize 
Quebec as a distinct society and to recognize its veto within the 
Canadian federation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in the House today to speak on a 
subject that is near and dear to my heart. However, I would like to 
take it in a slightly different direction and speak of my own riding.
<P>
	My riding is at the head of Lake Ontario, near Hamilton. It is 
probably as anglophone a part of the country as we could possibly 
hope to get. Yet the first European who set foot in my riding was 
René Robert Cavelier de La Salle. He came there in 1682. He came 
by canoe through Hamilton harbour, climbed the escarpment by a 
stream and visited an Indian village near the present town of 
Waterdown.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	Around my riding there are signs everywhere, vestiges of French 
explorers. Just two miles from my village there is a creek called 
Fairchild Creek. This is a reflection of the coureurs de bois who 
explored the Grand River and its tributaries in the 17th century.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17027"> 17027 </A></B>
<P>
	La Salle was exceptional. I do not wonder that my Bloc 
colleagues are very proud of their heritage when we think of this 
man who in 1682 came to the Hamilton area and then for the next 
10 years explored everywhere around southern Ontario. He was 
searching for the Ohio River, which he believed would lead to the 
orient. In doing so, he was the first man to build a ship for the 
fur trade on Lake Erie at Niagara Falls. He also became a great 
entrepreneur in the fur trade at Kingston, which at that time was 
Fort Frontenac.
<P>
	I say this to point out that the early people of New France 
represented the most fantastic spirit of adventure we could wish to 
find anywhere in the world.
<P>
	What of myself as an anglophone? I can parallel that. On my 
mother's side of the family there were United Empire Loyalists. 
They settled in the United States in the 17th century and after the 
American revolution came to my area, the same area La Salle 
explored, to settle when they fled the Americans. Here we have a 
situation of my ancestors, like the ancestors of my Bloc Quebecois 
colleagues and my Quebec colleagues, who have this wonderful 
spirit of adventure.
<P>
	I could look at my own father. My father came over to the 
country in 1924, leaving England at the age of 17. Again we have 
this sense that we share. Whether we are French or English 
speaking, we share this very Canadian sense of adventure, the sense 
of reaching out and trying brave new things to do.
<P>
	When I was a young man I tried to cross the Sahara Desert to 
visit Timbuktu. I have to say that as I crossed the Mediterranean I 
met another young man. We recognized one another because of our 
passports. He was another young Canadian from Quebec who was 
on the same type of adventure I was. There we were, doing what I 
think is one of the things that unite us as a people, whether we 
speak English or French, a people who have a true spirit of 
adventure.
<P>
	I suggest to you, Mr. Speaker, that if you travelled the world now 
you would find young Canadians, both French and English 
speaking, in every corner of the globe on similar missions of 
adventure.
<P>
	I mention this because separatism, the movement we see today 
to withdraw Quebec from Confederation, is not in the best tradition 
of our ancestors. It is a defensive reaction. It is building walls. 
Separatism today is fear rather than bravery. That is a great shame. 
What has made this country the richest nation in the world and the 
greatest trading nation in the world, whether we speak English or 
French, is our spirit of adventure we have inherited from all our 
ancestors.
<P>
	To return to my history lesson, La Salle did not find the Ohio 
River. A decade later, after running around in southern Ontario and 
making a killing on the fur trade, he crossed over to the Mississippi 
River and explored the entire length of the Mississippi. He arrived 
there in 1682  and claimed the entire territory for France. Thus, 
Louisiana was born.
<P>
	Louisiana became a far richer colony of France than Quebec. It 
was on the edge of the Caribbean. In those days the resources were 
much richer in that region than they were in the frozen north. What 
happened to Louisiana? In 1803 Napoleon sold it to the Americans. 
The Americans did not move in and change Louisiana into an 
English speaking state. They were totally laissez-faire about the 
situation. Louisiana was left alone with its language and culture. 
However then, as today, there was an enormous economic boom in 
North America. The west was opening up, the Mississippi was 
opening up and there were entrepreneurs everywhere.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	The net effect of the freedom that Louisiana had as a state of the 
United States, rather than the protection it had when it was a French 
colony, was that within a century it lost most of its French culture. 
The French language was replaced by English. Now this former 
French colony, which was bigger than Quebec, is merely a shadow 
of its French self.
<P>
	I submit that is the kind of danger that is presented by the 
prospect of Quebec's separation today. The reason why Quebec 
still exists, perhaps some of my Bloc colleagues will not agree with 
this vision of history, is that there were accommodations reached 
between Britain and Quebec right at the beginning, right after the 
conquest. This spirit of accommodation has been a characteristic of 
Canadian society ever since.
<P>
	The other thing that makes all of us Canadian is the fact that for 
centuries we have had to accommodate our differences. Our most 
fundamental difference was language, and not just in Quebec, but 
in northern Ontario and Acadia. Nevertheless, that is what has 
sustained Quebec all those years.
<P>
	We now come to Bill C-110 and the distinct society resolution. I 
feel these two things are very important moves. There is the spirit 
for separation in Quebec which has always been with us and will 
always be with us. There is nothing wrong with that but right now 
there has been a resurgence. There are more people in Quebec now 
than ever before who are afraid of losing their language and 
culture. We in the rest of Canada cannot afford to see that happen 
because so long as Quebec retains its language, its culture and its 
traditions, then the rest of Canada has to accommodate and make 
room for something that is an essential difference.
<P>
	It makes us a society that is truly tolerant and truly generous. 
That is why the rest of the world sees us as the best country in the 
world in which to live. It is not because we speak English, not 
because we speak French, but because we tolerate one another and 
we have a spirit of generosity that goes back through the centuries.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17028"> 17028 </A></B>
<P>
	I hope the people in Quebec are listening to this and understand 
that the movement toward separation is a movement that will hurt 
us all. It will hurt those who speak English as well as those who 
speak French.
<P>
	Debate is good. It is always good for us to come to Parliament or 
anywhere in this country, examine our differences and come to 
understand one another once again. However, separation is not the 
answer. The movement with respect to Bill C-110 and the distinct 
society resolution are a form of reassurance from all the people of 
Canada that we need to stay together and respect one another.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
very carefully to the speech made by my colleague opposite.
<P>
	First, I would like to tell him that for us, Quebecers, sovereignty 
does not mean establishing borders or putting up walls between us 
and the rest of the world. Quite the contrary. I think Quebec 
sovereignists have shown, through the kind of partnership they 
have proposed to the rest of Canada, that they are open, that they 
want to sit down and talk, that they want a change at this point in 
their history.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	So I hope the member has understood that also. In his speech, he 
talked about other places in the world where there are 
francophones. Louisiana in one of them. We know that Napoleon 
sold Louisiana to the Americans and that the small community 
living there at that time decided to let itself be assimilated.
<P>
	Today, the French culture in Louisiana is nothing but folklore. 
There are still some people who speak French, but they are very 
few. It must be understood that these people were assimilated 
because they were in the United States of America, where English 
is the only official language. We do not want this to happen to 
Quebecers.
<P>
	What we want is to control the economic and political 
instruments that will allow Quebec to grow and to secure its future. 
We will have to start all over again, to explain, as the member said, 
that sovereignty is something that will not die. But I want to tell the 
member that the sovereignty of Quebecers and of Quebec is 
something positive, something dynamic.
<P>
	It is a movement that is leading us into the third millennium in a 
positive way. A people who decides to take control of its own 
destiny, that is just fantastic. I remember the night of the 
referendum when Claude Ryan, former leader of the Quebec 
Liberal Party, said: ``The rest of Canada will have to recognize 
Quebec as a distinct people in the Canadian Constitution''. Today, 
what we are being offered is a motion of the House that is valid 
only if it is supported by the majority. So I think  what we are 
discussing today is entirely different from the offer Quebec would 
like to see.
<P>
	We are not afraid of losing our language and our culture, and 
sovereignty which, as I said earlier, is a positive thing, is the reason 
why we are not afraid. However, we must go about this 
intelligently. We must have the means to ensure our survival, and 
we will have them in a sovereign Quebec. As I said yesterday here 
in the House, when the Canadian Confederation was established, an 
understanding was reached. Today, more than 125 years later, it is 
time the rest of Canada realized that we are talking about the future 
and the very survival of this Canadian territory.
<P>
	So I would like the hon. member to comment and try to 
understand the position of Quebecers, which is very positive.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague. I would like to 
point out to him that sovereignty, as he describes it, and separatism 
look inward. He has to admit that the separatist movement is 
building walls around Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford):</B> It is not true.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Yes it is.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford):</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> It is walls to protect-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford):</B> You see the walls. We do not see them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> That is the problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> There are walls and the rest of the world sees them 
as walls. I tell the hon. member that those walls will be broken 
down without the protection of Canada.
<P>
	That is what happened in Louisiana. Economic forces, business 
forces and global forces destroyed the French culture in Louisiana. 
The same will happen to Quebec unless Quebec has the rest of 
Canada and the faith of anglophones like me who believe we share 
a tradition. We are generous with one another.
<P>
	If Quebec rejects the rest of Canada, including other people in 
Canada who speak French-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford):</B> That is not true.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Oh yes, it will be the end.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford):</B> C'est complètement faux ce qu'il dit là.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> The lesson my hon. colleague should appreciate is 
the lesson of Louisiana.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Ça, c'est au siècle passé.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> It happened in Louisiana in about 60 years and 
Louisiana had state rights. It was a loose federation, far looser in 
the United States at that time  than Canada today. Louisiana's 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17029"> 17029 </A></B>
<P>
culture disappeared under the pressure of economic and business 
forces within about 60 years.
<P>
<B>(1340 )</B>
<P>
	I suggest that were Quebec to separate and not have the genuine 
partnership that exists in the Canadian Confederation today, 
especially with the Americans just south of the border, there would 
not be anyone speaking French anywhere in the business 
community of Quebec. That would be a shame because it would be 
the end of a culture.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to enter this debate, since I feel it is 
important to establish the government's intentions in tabling Bill 
C-110. It is not my intention in the next few minutes to react to the 
interpretation of history given by the Liberal member who just 
spoke. I would simply advise him to do some sorting out of his 
historical reference books. Drawing a comparison between 
Louisiana and Quebec is not only nonsensical but an insult to the 
reality of Quebec.
<P>
	What I would like to do instead is talk about Bill C-110 and the 
veto.
<P>
	To begin with, as the Leader of the Opposition pointed out this 
morning, when reference is made to the right of veto, this generally 
means a procedure or rule that is a key element in a constitution. 
With such a rule, changes of a constitutional nature cannot be made 
without the agreement of one part. In the case of concern to us here, 
the case of Canada, what is involved is a part of Canada without the 
agreement of a certain number of provinces plus the federal 
government.
<P>
	This is, therefore, an important measure. So important that, over 
the past 20 or 25 years, the federalists have discussed among 
themselves on a number of occasions the necessity of arriving at a 
formula for amending the Constitution which would include this 
famous right of veto. Naturally, there was the Victoria charter, 
which referred to a regional veto, a bit like Bill C-110. The 
Pepin-Roberts Commission referred to a regional veto as well, but 
one supported by a Canada-wide referendum in which a majority 
would be required in each of the four or five regions of Canada.
<P>
	The 1982 Constitutional Act, the one that governs us at present, 
assigns to each Canadian province the right of veto in several areas 
for amending the Constitution and the institutions, among other 
things. The Meech Lake accord also contains the same right of 
veto. The Beaudoin-Edwards committee spoke of a regional veto. 
So did the Charlottetown accord.
<P>
	What I would like to point out with this reminder is that the right 
of veto has always figured prominently in Canadian political 
discussion, in the political speeches of  federalists, sincere ones, 
who wanted to improve Canada and Quebec's situation. Never, 
however, have we been able to reach an agreement that would 
respect the rights of both Quebecers and Canadians. Never.
<P>
	That is why the Trudeau government accorded the right of veto 
to all provinces in 1982, in desperation, and this is how the 
situation stands now.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	So, if we want this right of veto to mean anything, there must be 
constitutional changes. Because he could not do so-and not 
because the Leader of the Opposition may eventually go to Quebec 
City, but because he could not convince the anglophone provinces 
to agree-the Prime Minister, reacting to the results of the 
referendum on October 30, decided to table a bill in the House that 
has no constitutional significance, a bill that will force the present 
government to take certain criteria into account before it proposes 
constitutional change, if it really wants to, because it can amend its 
bill at any time.
<P>
	However, as the Prime Minister has already said he does not 
intend to make any proposals so long as the nasty separatists are in 
power in Quebec, the bill will never be implemented in any case.
<P>
	This is where I want to point out the intention of the government 
and, particularly, of the Prime Minister. This bill is nothing more 
than a hoax. I would even describe it as skulduggery, because it is 
misleading Quebecers by implying that the right of veto is a 
guarantee of Quebec's future constitutional rights.
<P>
	This is wrong, absolutely wrong, because, in the same breath, 
most of the speakers on the government side have made a point of 
saying in their speeches-the Prime Minister first and then the 
Minister of Justice this morning in tabling his bill-that the bill 
changes nothing in the existing formula, in other words, it is the 
constitutional status quo.
<P>
	Quebecers must understand that the government and the Prime 
Minister are simply trying to waste time in this House with this 
hasty bill that has no effect.
<P>
	Some will say I am being hard on the Prime Minister. With your 
permission, I would like to turn to what the Prime Minister has said 
in the past.
<P>
	Let us look first at his speech in 1990 as he was preparing to 
enter the Liberal Party leadership race. The current Prime Minister, 
who was then a leadership candidate, said, right here in Ottawa, to 
University of Ottawa students, that, as a candidate to the Liberal 
Party leadership and future head of the Canadian government, he 
was opposed to any form of veto, for any province. He basically 
said that a province wishing to oppose constitutional changes could 
do it if it had a veto. He did not specifically mentioned Quebec, but 
he was certainly thinking about that province, since Quebec has 
always been the one asking for such changes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17030"> 17030 </A></B>
<P>
	In addition to a veto power, the concept of distinct society is 
supposedly recognized in the motion tabled in this House.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	Again, this is a big joke. The Prime Minister is trying to make 
Quebecers, but particularly Canadians, believe that he recognizes 
the principle of distinct society. Yet, during the referendum 
campaign, he ridiculed that principle by making an analogy to his 
own linguistic skills. He said: ``There is no need to put the distinct 
society principle in the Constitution. Everyone knows that I am 
distinct. Just listen to me speak English''.
<P>
	At the time, the leader of the Action démocratique condemned 
the Prime Minister's comments, saying that it was contemptuous of 
Quebecers to make such an analogy between the notion of distinct 
society and one's ability, or lack of, to speak English, in this case 
the Prime Minister himself.
<P>
	This is what the Prime Minister thinks of the distinct society and 
the right of veto. Today, because it tabled a bill and a motion on the 
concept of distinct society, the government would like Quebec 
members to applaud and say: ``Mr. Speaker, the issue is finally 
settled. Quebec is now recognized as a distinct society and it has a 
veto power. Let us move on to other matters''.
<P>
	No. Quebecers are not fooled by all this. They are fully aware of 
the federal government's deceit in tabling this bill and this motion, 
and they will react strongly. In that sense, the Leader of the 
Opposition who, in a few months, will lead the Quebec 
government, was right, is right and will be right to say no to such 
trickery and deceit.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
opposite is at it again with his emotional blackmail.
<P>
	A debate at least two-months long has already been held on the 
referendum. At times, it was quite intense, very emotional. We 
heard from both sides, supporters of the yes camp and supporters of 
the no camp, those who were for Canada and those who were 
against Canada, those who wanted to give Canada a chance and 
those who did not.
<P>
	Those who wanted to give Canada a chance won. The democratic 
result of the referendum was a yes to giving Canada a chance. On 
the evening when the results were announced, I was out of the 
country, unfortunately, but I saw the Leader of the Opposition on 
television. It was a very emotional moment. I stayed up all night 
and watched the Leader of the Opposition on CNN International as 
he said: ``The democratic result of the referendum must be 
respected''.
<P>
	Interestingly that what the opposite of what Mr. Parizeau had 
said when he chose not to respect the results. At the time, the 
Leader of the Opposition and  leader of the yes camp in Quebec 
said that the referendum results were to be respected. But what is 
happening today? Just the opposite. No respect for the Quebec 
referendum results; total disregard for the basic principle of 
democracy in Quebec, in Canada and in every international 
standard.
<P>
	Nowhere else in the world do you have a group like the one we 
have here in our federal Parliament, a Parliament representing the 
people of Canada, Canadians from coast to coast.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	In no other country in the world do you see people like the 
members across the way, rise on their feet and announce with great 
pride their plans to tear apart the best country in the world. They 
want to tear apart and break up a great country, a fantastic country.
<P>
	The Prime Minister said, and my colleagues on this side also 
said so time and time again: this is not going to happen, because the 
best country in the world just cannot be broken up. What the 
government decided to do and managed to do is to present concrete 
proposals, and we expect opposition members to act with common 
sense, to respond with common sense, to respect the democratic 
result of the referendum, to sit down at the table and to negotiate 
honestly, without any hypocrisy, and to stop using the words 
``sovereignism'' and ``independance''. They should talk in a 
positive way, saying that Quebecers voted to give Canada a chance.
<P>
	Then we would have a real debate. Then we would really be able 
to talk face to face. So, I ask my colleague if it would not be better 
for him and for his colleagues of the Bloc to sit down with the 
federal government and to tell us what they really want. They are 
not satisfied with that, but what do they want exactly? They want to 
put that in the Constitution, but they do not say so. They do not dare 
say what makes sense.
<P>
	What I have heard today is nothing but blackmail, a history 
lesson, another explanation of what happened 20 years ago. Several 
members of that party voted against the Meech Lake accord and the 
Charlottetown accord. I want to ask the member-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I think the question has been put. The hon. 
member has one minute to respond. We will give him the chance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I would ask my colleague from Ottawa-Centre to sit down and go 
back to sleep, like he did the night of the referendum, since he 
obviously did not listen until the end to what the Leader of the 
Opposition said. Not only did the Leader of the Opposition, who 
will become Quebec's Premier, say that he would respect the 
results of the October 30 referendum by making sure to deal with 
the problems facing Quebec, that is, public finance, he also said 
that the federal government was expected to act and to propose real 
changes.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="17031"> 17031 </A></B>

The next time we will talk about the Constitution in Quebec, it 
will be about Quebec's Constitution in an impending referendum.

	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the 1994 
budget the government announced cuts to UI, which hit Atlantic 
Canada the hardest. Of the $2.4 billion that was cut, $634 million 
came from Atlantic Canada. Our region, with 8 per cent of 
Canada's population, suffered 27 per cent of the UI cuts. Now we 
hear it is going to happen to us again.
<P>
	A large portion of the Atlantic Canadian economy has a seasonal 
nature. I agree that we have to implement measures that allow the 
region's economy to grow and evolve, but what the government is 
proposing will not do that. Even the Liberal premier of New 
Brunswick has called the proposed UI plan devastating for our 
region. He has also said that he believes it will merely push people 
from UI to welfare.
<P>
	I support thoughtful measures to get our deficit under control. 
We need to help people to help themselves. I fear this is what the 
government's UI plan will not do. I urge it to reconsider. In fact, 
this plan is one I would expect from the Reform Party.

Environment Canada recently charged the Noranda forests mill in 
Thorold, Ontario, with 150 apparent violations of the Fisheries Act

that members of the House have not approved and the public do not 
support.
<P>
	I rise today to condemn a Liberal Treasury Board directive 
leaked last week which extends a number of spousal benefits to 
homosexual and lesbian partners who are not formally recognized 
as being legally married.
<P>
	During the debate and a free vote on Motion No. 264 in the 
House last September members refused to grant legal recognition 
of same sex couples, defeating the motion decisively. Treasury 
Board officials have defied the will of members of the House by 
giving homosexual and lesbian couples the same rights as legally 
married men and women.
<P>
	On behalf of the majority of my constituents, the majority of 
Canadians and the majority of MPs in the House I demand the 
Liberal government bring any extension of government benefits to 
same sex couple relationships to the House for a free vote.

originally constructed to accommodate Jewish refugees during the 
second world war and was later used as an internment camp. The 
organizing committee hopes eventually to rebuild the camp along 
with a museum to keep the camp's memory alive.
<P>
	Canada has a long history of accommodating refugees, a history 
of which it can be proud. However history tells us that mistakes 
have been made. We must learn from them, grow and make sure we 
recognize our international obligations to those oppressed around 
the world.
<P>
	It is important to remember what happened during the second 
world war because history must live. I commend Ed Caissie and the

promote enriching educational opportunities within Canada for the 
development of mutual respect and understanding.

the Leader of the Opposition and I attended the opening of the 24th 
convention of the FTQ, Quebec's largest labour federation.
<P>
	I think it is significant that there were 1,500 delegates at this 
historic convention, which was focussed on employment. For the 
first time, the presidents of the CSN and the CEQ were invited to 
attend. In an extremely courageous speech, FTQ president Clément 
Godbout spoke of the major challenges to the trade union 
movement now and in the years to come. The labour federation 
wants to fight against the emergence of an increasingly powerful 
right and in support of labour legislation reform, union-employer 
partnerships, and increased power over the way work is organized.
<P>
	It is therefore important to congratulate those behind such an 
initiative aimed at enabling Quebec decision makers to undertake

	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the environment minister's decision to sign an interim 
order banning the export of PCBs to the U.S. defies logic, 
especially since the EPA in the U.S. has recently reversed its 
decision to allow PCB imports for destruction.
<P>
	This reversal enables Canadian companies to safely dispose of 
their stockpiled PCB contaminated waste at the lowest possible 
price and in the safest possible manner. The minister ought to be 
elated. Unfortunately she has decided to ban PCB exports to the 
U.S. despite the fact that Canada exports over 100,000 tonnes of 
waste to the U.S. each year.
<P>
<B>(1405)</B>
<P>
	The distance now that the PCBs have to travel are much greater 
when shipped across Canada than when shipped to the United 
States. Canadian companies are also paying an extra $150 million 
to do this.
<P>
	Considering the overwhelming information in support of 
allowing PCB exports to the U.S., I urge the minister to reconsider 
her government's position, do the right thing, and stop pandering to 
the protectionist stance that does little to help the overriding goal of 
PCB removal.

	As parliamentary chair I am pleased to announce that this 
non-profit organization was able to conduct cross Canada regional 
seminars involving over 800 students. These young people met 
with industry and government experts to discuss issues involving 
science, trade and technology, and to acquire the skills needed to 
compete in the new global economy.
<P>
	In addition, the junior trade corps program allowed 18

Commerce, Canadian Heritage, the Atlantic Canada Opportunities

sovereignist artists, like Marie Laberge, getting federal funding.
<P>
	Obviously, ridicule has never killed anyone. Quebec 
sovereignists still continue to send their tax money to Ottawa. Each 
year, the federal government collects $30 billion from Quebecers. 
Do the members of the committee seriously think that the federal 
government could deny access to its programs to 50 per cent of 
Quebec's population? As Franco Nuovo put it so well in the 
<I>Journal de Montréal</I>, Canada Council grants are not given out to 
``serve the allegiance and political stripe of artists, but to recognize

abuses in China. His tolerance of forced abortions and his inability 
to pass judgment on the execution of political dissidents show 
shameful disdain for women's rights, equal rights and human 
rights.
<P>
	We must tell China that this policy is wrong. As Canadian 
Human Rights Commissioner it is his responsibility to lead, not to 
follow. He has a moral obligation to help bring about change in 
areas where the humane treatment of people is rejected. He must do 
this by showcasing Canada as a model of democratic tolerance, a 
champion of human rights and a defender of the exploited.
<P>
	We cannot sit idly by, as women, children and others suffer 
abuse at the hands of inhumane governments. Instead of resigning 
himself to indifference, Max Yalden should resign, himself. If he 
refuses, the government must remove him from office as he clearly 
lacks the courage to promote and represent Canadian values

failed to control all our levers during the referendum, the 
Government of Quebec wants to take the shortest route and throw 
itself wildly on spending to avoid sinking like the Titanic''.
<P>
	The union leader's barrage against the PQ government has

Eastern Quebec and the Atlantic provinces, these reforms will

Ottawa is about to make.

they actually said they found the approach we are taking to be quite 
praiseworthy and one they wanted to support.
<P>
	I would like to quote Premier McKenna directly: ``Several 
features of the reform will be very positive in terms of making it 
worth while to work and there are a number of elements of the 
reform that we find praiseworthy''. Mr. McKenna, after having had 
the opportunity to find out the real direction and approach we want

has been around for 50 years and over the years has developed

we are changing the system, so we can help people go to work.

detail, how much the second so-called UI reform package is out of 
touch with the labour market, where precarious jobs are no longer 
the exception but rather the rule.
<P>
	In fact, the UI reform will discourage young people by making it 
harder to qualify for benefits, with work requirements going from 
12 fifteen hour weeks to 14  thirty-five hour weeks, even in the

that one of the first and most painful effects of his reform will be to 
ensure to an even greater degree that thousands of young people, 
who often can find only precarious jobs, are excluded?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources

of Commons tomorrow the full details of the new employment 
insurance package.
<P>
	We will be, as part of our courtesy, giving a full briefing to the 
hon. member and other members of the opposition. We intend to 
extend coverage for unemployment insurance, to take into 
consideration the new workplace, where there is a lot more part 
time work, a lot more multiple jobs, a lot more people dealing in a 
workplace that has a lot more flexibility to it.
<P>
	That is part of the problem with the existing system. It was 
designed 50 years ago. It does not accommodate the new world of 
work we are into. That was one of the key recommendations of the 
committee that studied it, of which the member was a part. The 
committee recommended that we find a system that more 
accurately fits the reality of the new world of work. That is what we 
have done.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the 
minister had briefed the official opposition and the third party first, 
before briefing every member of the media in town, we would not 
have to rely on what journalists say. At least, journalists are doing a 
good job. And I doubt there would be any evidence to the contrary.
<P>
	Here is my question: Does the minister not realize that by 
making it even more difficult to have access to UI, a fact confirmed 
by every information leak, he will force onto welfare a good many 
women who are desperately trying to find a way out of poverty?
<P>

that we were briefing journalists.
<P>
	It was the hon. member who week after week was waving 
papers, studies, and leaked reports from her friends in the CSN who

and by the future premier of Quebec.
<P>
	In advance of the next referendum, will the government also be

<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of

are not salivating at the prospect of a referendum.
<P>
	The majority of Canadians and the majority of Quebecers do not 
want a referendum. What they want is for the Government of 
Canada to work in a constructive way with provincial partners 
across the country and with workers to get Canadians back to work. 
That is exactly the agenda we intend to pursue.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I hate 
to inform the Deputy Prime Minister that bad things can happen 
even if you wish they will not. It is a rule of life.
<P>
	Regardless of what the Canadian people or even the Quebec 
people think, it is clear what the plans of the Quebec government 
are. I ask the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs once again, is 
the government consulting anyone-Canadians, think tanks, the 
C.D. Howe Institute, the Canada West Foundation, the business 
community? Is the government consulting anyone on the terms and 
conditions of separation and the contingencies to plan for in the 
event the Government of Quebec goes down this path?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we know that Canada will not go down this path because 
we are taking the necessary steps and we will continue to take them 
so that Canada remains a united country.
<P>
	The group on unity, as I have mentioned, is looking at present at 
all kinds of constructive ways in which we can deal with the 
differences that exist among the various parts of the country. We do 
not want to underline these differences. We prefer to underline the 
points that are common all across Canada, among all Canadians. 
The  solutions we will bring are solutions that will help us to 
remain together.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
minister assured the House that the PQ would lose the provincial 
election. He assured the House that the government would win the 
referendum by a strong majority. None of the things this 
government has assured us have come to pass.
<P>
	This time, if it will not at least prepare its own position on the 
eventuality of another referendum, will it at least insist through a 
formal request that the Government of Quebec table its proposal 
for separation, its so-called sovereignty partnership, so that before 
a referendum all Canadians, including Quebecers, can judge the 
credibility of these proposals?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when we indicated that we were going to look at the 
results of the referendum and deal with them, we also indicated that 
we were going to look at the real solutions to present day problems. 
The real solutions are not the splitting of Canada into various parts, 
even though the Reform Party sometimes gives me the feeling that 
this would be its preferred option.
<P>
	The best way to prevent that from happening is clearly to give 
good government. We have won the referendum, not lost it. The 
best way is to deal with the problems that presently exist, not start 
planning for the worst.

workers will be the main victims of the reform about to be 
introduced by the Minister of Human Resources Development.

element of resources for people to get employed.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources

Last year, because of the change in the emphasis of our 
employment programs, the number of women in Quebec who 
participated in our employment programs actually increased. 
Furthermore the new employment equity bill which we hope the

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the Prime Minister pleaded with Canadians to support his 
Quebec package of Mulroney leftovers: distinct society and 
constitutional veto. However the government does not have the 
courage to let those very same Canadians vote directly on the 
package. Instead of trusting Canadians, the Prime Minister has 
decided to ram the proposals through Parliament.
<P>
	Because the government will not trust the Canadian people with 
the country's future, will it at the very least call off the Liberal 
whip and allow a free vote on the Prime Minister's Quebec 
package?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the fact is that the Canadian 
people are a lot bigger and a lot more generous than the Reform 
Party gives them credit for. The Canadian people support the 
initiative of the  Prime Minister. Frankly, my phone has been 
ringing off the wall with people complaining about the disgraceful 
performance of the Reform Party in the debate about Canada.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians voted no on Charlottetown and I suspect if the 
government had the courage to ask them to vote again they would 
again vote no, loudly and clearly.
<P>
	This government talks about equality but it learned absolutely 
nothing from Meech Lake and Charlottetown. If the national unity 
package is to have any hope of succeeding, it must win the support 
of Canadians. It has to be by Canadians. It needs to be for all of 
them and it must receive popular ratification.
<P>
	Canadians are sick and tired of being used as the Liberal 
government's personal political pawns. They want the first say and 
they want the final say when it comes to these things. Will the 
government commit to holding a national binding referendum on 
any constitutional change so that the Canadian people, not 
provincial governments and federal politicians, have the final say 
as they were allowed to do with Charlottetown in 1992?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, before the hon. member 
makes claims about the positions of the government, she would be 
well advised to read what her own leader had to say on the issue of 
distinct society back in 1989. He said in an interview on the distinct 
society clause: ``At a strategic level I think we could accept some 
kind of trade-off between Quebec and the resource producing 
regions''. That is what Preston Manning had to say about distinct 
society then. Why is he saying something different now?

<P>
	While I can understand that Quebec natives want to see their

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was not asking the minister whether he had seen it or 
heard of it. I was asking him whether his ADM  is responsible for 
it. Does the buck stop with him and his department or not?
<P>
	We believe in the equality of all Canadians but clearly this 
Liberal government does not. This week the Prime Minister is 
adding a new class of citizens by recognizing Quebec as special 
and giving Quebec distinct society status. Now we learn that the 
department of Indian affairs is considering granting premier status 
to Quebec native leaders.
<P>
	Apparently the Liberals intend to grant distinct status to two 
groups so far: the Quebec separatist government and Quebec native 
leaders. How many more do the Liberals intend to recognize?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a couple of weeks ago the 
Reform Party put out its policy on aboriginal people. We waited 
two years for what is now its interim policy. It was received as 
follows: Blaine Fable: ``Earth calling Preston''; Blaine Fable: 
``Silly and bizarre''; Erasmus: ``It's like reading something from 
the 1920s''; and John Edward: ``This is pretty much a bunch of 
cheap shots from the Reform Party''. These are aboriginal leaders.

<P>
	The document signed by Deputy Minister Jack Stagg, which all

government pay money to the aboriginal communities in Quebec, 
in return for their support for the federalist side in the last 
referendum, and also, in the words of the deputy minister himself, 
to buy their silence while the federal government tables 
constitutional proposals to satisfy Quebec.
<P>
	Since the media all reported on this document, I ask the minister 
if he bothered to summon this person, who is not just anybody, but 
the person responsible for his department's strategic directions and

he did in fact write this memo?

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do 
have a sense of humour, so I will let that tree comment pass.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development is a tax junkie. 
He gets his fix by funnelling billions of dollars from UI into 
wasteful job creation schemes and into deficit reductions. However 
there is hope for recovery. The minister can register today in a 
12-step program to break his tax addiction.
<P>
	Will the minister commit to breaking his tax addiction by rolling 
payroll taxes back by more than a wooden nickel?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. 
member's sense of humour. It is always nice to discover that 
somebody in this House has one. It is a refreshing change.
<P>
	However, the hon. member should check with statements made 
by the finance critic for the Reform Party. He was complaining 
about all the problems related to the deficit. Now the hon. member 
wants us to take away even more money, which would add to the

	<B>Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
has been 25 years since the Royal Commission on the Status of 
Women outlined its concern with regard to women's economic 
status, specifically, various aspects of their paid and unpaid work.
<P>
	Could the Secretary of State for the Status of Women please 
inform the House what the government is doing to improve the 
economic status for women?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism) 
(Status of Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, while it is true that the 
royal commission looked at the economic status of women and 
related that as well to ensuring that violence against women would 
be reduced, we also brought in the whole question of employment 
equity and the right of women with equal competence and merit to 
have access to fair jobs and to break the glass ceiling, as it is called.
<P>
	At the same time, we have recognized that the unpaid work of 
women and men is of great value to our society. It was an issue we 
brought to the meetings in Beijing. The issue of unpaid work and 
its value is now part of the platform for action out of Beijing. 
Canada is the first country in the world that will measure both the 
work and the value of unpaid work to our society as we push and 
promote women's economic access to independence in our country.

	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is directed to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration. Anatoli 
Delets and his family came to Canada from the former Soviet 
Union in 1992. Their refugee claim has been turned down and this 
family, despite having integrated well into Quebec society, will 
soon be deported to Moldavia. There is every reason to believe that 
they will be subject to the same persecution as they were before 
they left that country, for Mrs. Delets is Jewish and is not 
considered a Moldavian under that country's laws.
<P>
	How can the minister explain that, instead of exercising his 
discretionary powers to allow the Delets to become permanent 
residents, he has allowed employees of his department to arrest Mr. 
Delets and place him in a detention centre awaiting deportation, 
which will take place as soon as his wife is released from hospital?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the people the member refers to 
had full due process under what can argued to be the best refugee 
determination system in the world. They have also received a 
humanitarian and compassionate review from my department as 
well.
<P>
	There was also the possibility of trying to facilitate in response 
to the family, rather than going back to Russia perhaps for a 
facilitation into Israel.
<P>
	It is absolutely unfair for this member, given the statements that 
have come from that side of the House with respect to immigrants 
and the role they can play in society, to suggest that Canada has 
been unfair to them.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Mrs. Delets 
is ill in hospital. Where is Canada's humanitarian policy? Does the 
minister not believe that it is his duty to show compassion when 
there is every reason to believe that the Delets family faces 
incalculable risks, since the Moldavian embassy in Washington has 
notified them that they are no longer welcome in that country?
<P>
<B>(1455)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when it comes to compassion 
and how we treat Canadians from various ethnocultural 
backgrounds, we need no lectures, no lessons from that side of the 
House.
<P>
	No one suggested we would take her out of the hospital and 
deport her. There were rumours suggesting that we were going to 
deport part of the family and leave the other part in Canada.
<P>
	Members of Parliament from our side made representations to 
the ministry and officials with respect to a compassionate 
deportation. We have shown that compassion. We have not forced 
anyone from a hospital bed. To make such allegations is simply a 
reflection of the manipulation for which his party is well known.

	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the minister in charge of the wheat board.
<P>
	In the 1970s, farmers bought hopper cars through the wheat 
board and governments bought hopper cars because railways 
refused to supply cars for shipping grain.
<P>
	Recently the minister's SEO committee recommended that 
farmers pay $1 per tonne for the purchase of the government's 
13,000 hopper cars. Although farmers would pay for them, 
ownership would revert to the railways.
<P>
	Since the deregulated U.S. style system this government is 
emulating has one abiding rule, if you want rail service, you had 
better own rail cars, why does he not instead allow the wheat board 
to own the cars on behalf of farmers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. gentleman is referring to a 
report that has been received by the government from a group of 
senior executive officers in  the grains industry, including a number 
of farmers, which has come forward with some ideas about how to 
deal with hopper car ownership and rail car allocation issues.
<P>
	That report is presently being discussed among farm 
organizations in western Canada. As yet the government has taken 
no decision with respect to our response to that report.
<P>
	One point is important to note. The report represents a consensus 
among a widely divergent range of interests. It is not entirely fair to 
the situation to single out one recommendation relating to car 
ownership and not also observe that another recommendation from 
the SEO's group to balance that recommendation was referred to by 
the hon. gentlemen. Another recommendation from that same 
group was to maintain a maximum limitation on freight rates for a 
period of one full decade.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-110, 
an act respecting constitutional amendments, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak on this particular matter today, 
especially in light of some of the comments that were made earlier 
today by different members, in particular from the Reform Party.
<P>
	In discussing this piece of legislation we have to look at what has 
already taken place and the rules that are presently in place. We 
have to look at the existing rule, the seven, ten, and fifty rule, 
requiring seven provinces out of ten to agree, with fifty per cent of 
the population. Under this particular rule, the Atlantic provinces, if 
they all agree on not supporting an amendment, have a veto. 
Ontario has a veto simply by virtue of population. The western 
provinces, if four of them get together, effectively have a veto as 
well. The only region of Canada that does not have a veto under the 
rule is Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1505 )</B>
<P>
	It is not a matter of fairness when one region of Canada does not 
have a veto when three regions already can effectively veto 
legislation. We have to look at rectifying this situation.
<P>
	Under Bill C-110 there are four regions, which have been 
referred to many times. One has to read Bill C-110 closely to 
determine that it does not deal with vetoes; it simply deals with the 
consent that is required to effect a constitutional amendment. 
Under the bill the consent of Ontario is required, the consent of 
Quebec is required, and two or more of the Atlantic provinces that 
have a combined population of at least 50 per cent of the population 
of all the Atlantic provinces, as well as two or more of the western 
provinces that have a combined population of at least 50 per cent. 
The rules change somewhat when moving to the second step.
<P>
	I would suggest that the people of Saskatchewan now are better 
off. Under the previous rules it was quite difficult for 
Saskatchewan to stop legislation. It was difficult for Saskatchewan 
to deal with legislation because  to exercise the veto all four 
western provinces had to agree. Under this rule, however, 
Saskatchewan along with B.C. or Saskatchewan along with three of 
the western provinces can stop legislation. It is much more 
effective for the province of Saskatchewan than in the past.
<P>
	For a small province like Saskatchewan this is most helpful. The 
population of Saskatchewan is small, but it is being treated very 
well by Bill C-110. Saskatchewan's position has improved, but it 
has not improved at the cost of any other province.
<P>
	I have listened to the speeches of Reform members. They 
indicated that there should be five regions, with B.C. having a veto, 
or even six regions, with B.C. and Alberta having vetoes. It appears 
that they are willing to cut loose Saskatchewan and Manitoba 
because there should not be two provinces in one region having a 
veto with such a small population. I find it interesting that the 
Reform Party would cut loose those two prairie provinces by 
having vetoes for the two most westerly provinces. It would cut 
them loose and they would not have a say in constitutional 
amendments. Are the occupants of these two provinces simply 
chopped liver?
<P>
	The federal government has considered all the regions of the 
country and all the provinces, no matter how small the population. 
Saskatchewan was considered, Manitoba was considered, and 
provinces such as P.E.I. were considered.
<P>
	To hear Reformers speak, it certainly appears that the Reform 
Party is willing to abandon Saskatchewan. The Reform Party has 
not proposed anything for Saskatchewan and Manitoba. It has not 
proposed anything because the Reform Party has abandoned us. Let 
me remind the Reform Party that in the next election the people of 
Saskatchewan will not forget what Reform has done.
<P>
	The suggestion has been made that British Columbia may reach 
50 per cent of the population in western Canada. That is a 
possibility. If any more people from Saskatchewan move to British 
Columbia, it should reach that sooner than we may think. That has 
certainly happened in the past. However, Saskatchewan can hold its 
own and may attract a few people back to Saskatchewan from 
British Columbia and may hold its own for the next number of 
years.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	If British Columbia reaches the level of having 50 per cent of the 
population, some of the speeches made today by the Reform Party 
indicate that in effect British Columbia would have a veto and none 
of the other provinces in the west would have any effect. This is 
absolutely not true.
<P>
	Two or more provinces with 50 per cent of the population in the 
west must consent to a constitutional amendment. Yes, British 
Columbia may get a veto if it has 50 per cent of the population, but 
even if British  Columbia wants to consent to legislation, the other 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17044"> 17044 </A></B>
<P>
three prairie provinces can stop that legislation even though they do 
not have 50 per cent of the population. In effect, both areas have a 
veto. British Columbia has the veto and the prairie provinces have a 
veto.
<P>
	Again, it appears this is a little too much for some members of 
the Reform Party to indicate in the House. They want to show that 
we have not given any consideration to the prairie provinces, which 
is absolutely false. All areas of Canada have been considered by the 
Liberal Party. In particular, all small provinces have been 
considered, whether they are in the prairies or elsewhere.
<P>
	The Reform Party has complained that B.C. does not have a veto 
now, and then says that if it does the prairies will not have any say. 
As I have indicated, this is not only wrong, it is false and a 
misrepresentation of what is in Bill C-110.
<P>
	It certainly would help if the members of the Reform Party, 
before they start speaking in the House on a bill like Bill C-110, 
read the legislation. It is very short; it is one paragraph and two 
subsections. It is not very difficult to go through. It would maybe 
take a minute if they concentrated on it, half a minute if they went 
through it quickly, five minutes if they wanted to reread it. Simply 
going through it in that manner, they could and would determine 
that both areas have a veto built in. British Columbia, when it 
reaches 50 per cent of the population, would have the equivalent of 
a veto. The three prairie provinces together would also be able to 
stop legislation, because consent requires two provinces in the 
west.
<P>
	We have accomplished what the Reform Party has been talking 
about. Unfortunately the Reform Party has not seen this today.
<P>
	That is a perspective from a small province in western Canada, 
the province of Saskatchewan, which is benefiting from Bill C-110, 
as do many other regions of Canada. And it is benefiting not at the 
expense of any other province.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is very interesting to 
hear a member from the province of Saskatchewan oozing around 
this question of what the legislation will do for or to the small 
provinces. I am glad he has cleared this up, because we know that 
Saskatchewan has not been relegated to fourth class status but only 
to third class status. This is progress. I really do appreciate the hon. 
member's words.
<P>
	When he goes home to Saskatchewan and is able to present his 
case before his electors, I am sure they will be thrilled beyond 
measure by this. If the name of a certain Norwegian during the last 
war, which Beauchesne will not let me mention, is ever raised at 
one of his meetings, he will know what they are talking about.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bodnar:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is nice to hear comments from a 
member when he refers to oozing around this. Unfortunately I do 
not know what he means by the term oozing. The reference that we 
are not relegated to fourth class but to third class is absolutely false 
and shows a complete misunderstanding of what is in Bill C-110.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	Under the existing constitutional formula the province of 
Saskatchewan could only stop a constitutional amendment with 
three other provinces. That would require all four provinces in the 
west to stop a constitutional amendment. Under this legislation, 
Saskatchewan with three of the smaller provinces in western 
Canada could stop the legislation or Saskatchewan and British 
Columbia could stop an amendment.
<P>
	This is a tremendous improvement for the province of 
Saskatchewan. I simply ask that the member perhaps look at the 
legislation first.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Murphy (Annapolis Valley-Hants, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to participate in 
this important debate. Bill C-110 may be one of the smaller bills we 
will debate in the House. Although it is only comprised of one 
clause it is certainly one of the most important.
<P>
	This past Monday the Prime Minister announced three key 
initiatives: first, to recognize that Quebec forms a distinct society 
within Canada; second, to undertake changes to bring government 
services and decision making closer to citizens; and, third, to 
ensure that we do not make any constitutional changes that affect 
Quebec without the consent of the Quebec people.
<P>
	Bill C-110 is an important component of our commitment to a 
united Canada. It is also proof of our government's willingness to 
make positive and substantial changes to the way Canada works. 
As the Prime Minister and the government have proven time and 
time again, when we make a promise we keep it.
<P>
	Liberal governments in the past have offered strong support for 
regional vetoes. The action we are taking now transforms the 
principle we have long supported into reality.
<P>
	I will take a few moments to go through some of the specifics of 
the bill. As it currently stands in Canada's Constitution, only the 
federal government has the specific veto over constitutional 
change. This legislation will change that.
<P>
	By implementing Bill C-110 we will now require consent of all 
Canada's regions, Quebec, Ontario, Atlantic Canada and the west, 
before any constitutional amendments that affect them can be 
proposed in Parliament. In the case of Atlantic Canada and the 
west, consensus much be reached by two or more of the  affected 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17045"> 17045 </A></B>
<P>
provinces representing more than 50 per cent of the region as a 
whole.
<P>
	In tabling the bill our government is keeping a commitment we 
made to the people of Quebec. We also recognize that the 
constitutional amendment process is of interest to all parts of the 
country. That is why we are lending our veto to Canada's four 
regions.
<P>
	The one clear message we heard on October 30 was that the 
status quo was no longer acceptable. I have also heard this message 
from my constituents in Annapolis Valley-Hants. During the 
referendum campaign and in recent weeks I have spoken with 
many people on the issue. I have received numerous telephone calls 
and letters from constituents who have offered many valuable ideas 
and suggestions. I have moved those suggestions on to the 
appropriate people.
<P>
	In Annapolis Valley-Hants people have said clearly that they 
want Quebec to stay. They have also clearly expressed their desire 
to be heard on any future constitutional issues. The implementation 
of a regional veto will achieve both these goals.
<P>
	It responds to the concerns of Quebecers. For many years 
Quebec has called for a veto on amendments to the Canadian 
Constitution. By implementing Bill C-110 we are saying that we 
want Quebec to be an active participant in the evolution of the 
Canadian Constitution.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	The bill will also protect Quebec against amendments that could 
diminish its powers, rights and privileges. The government 
recognizes the legitimacy of Quebec's concerns. Bill C-110 offers 
strong recognition of the fact that as the nation evolves we must 
work to ensure constitutional changes are acceptable to all 
Canada's regions. We also recognize that constitutional change 
cannot and should not be made if a substantial portion of Canada's 
population does not approve.
<P>
	In the final days leading up to the no vote the nationwide 
grassroots outpouring of public sentiment was a significant factor 
in the no victory. The giant 150,000-person pro-Canada rally in 
Montreal was an emotional watershed in Canadian history. Tens of 
thousands of Quebecers came out and declared their desire to 
remain in Canada. Canadians from every province came to Quebec 
to say loud and clear: ``We want you to stay''.
<P>
	I was fortunate, along with other members, to have the 
opportunity to be at that rally. That morning I was in Dorval airport 
waiting for the unity plane to arrive from Halifax to join with my 
fellow Nova Scotians and Atlantic Canadians in delivering a 
message of unity. It gave me the opportunity to share their deep 
affection for the country. I never felt more proud to be a Canadian.
<P>
	Some people say that Canadians do not wear their flag on their 
sleeves and do not show their national pride.  When the chips are 
down Canadians are the proudest people of any nation on earth. 
Now is the time for us to repay the confidence the people of Quebec 
have shown in us. It is time to prove to Quebecers that their trust is 
not misplaced.
<P>
	It is true the initiatives we are now debating will not satisfy 
leaders of the separatist government in Quebec or separatist 
members in the House. Quebec leaders have been very vocal in 
their refusal to negotiate with the federal government. However in 
so doing they are doing a disservice to their constituents. The 
people of Quebec are more reasonable than the extremist leaders of 
the yes camp. These changes will help to restore their faith in 
Canada.
<P>
	I support the bill because it addresses the concerns in Quebec 
and the desire of citizens in all Canada's regions to be heard on 
constitutional issues. This initiative shows that we have listened to 
the call for change. We have listened to the people of Quebec and 
we have listened to our constituents. Now is the time to move 
forward.
<P>
	Canada is a continuously changing and evolving federation. By 
supporting Bill C-110 we can be sure future change will be 
beneficial to Quebec and all other Canadian regions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
advise the House that I will be splitting my time with the hon. 
member for Kindersley-Lloydminster.
<P>
	It gives me pleasure as a loyal Canadian to rise in the House 
today to speak to Bill C-110. It is a privilege to stand in the 
Chamber to outline the reasons I oppose the bill. As someone who 
was not present as a member of the House when the previous 
Parliament debated the Meech and Charlottetown initiatives, I 
nonetheless have an eerie feeling of déjà vu. If the legislation were 
some grade B horror movie they could very well have called it 
``Son of Meech''.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	I must preface my opposition to the bill by noting an old saying I 
have heard several times in the House: those who do not learn from 
the mistakes of the past are destined to repeat them. History, or so it 
would appear, is not a subject with which the framers of the 
legislation are even remotely acquainted. Those historical remarks 
come very close to describing the thoughts of all Canadians on the 
bill.
<P>
	I listened to the Prime Minister yesterday and I looked at the bill 
before the House today. I cannot help but ask myself if the Liberal 
government has not learned anything in 30 years of constitutional 
wrangling. The answer would clearly appear to be a resounding no. 
This would be much the same response Canadians everywhere 
would give to this package if, and it is a big if, they could be given 
a say in its acceptance or rejection.

	The bill does not give the power of veto to the people. It is the 
very worst kind of top down decision making because it gives the 
final say to politicians. To this I ask again if hon. members on 
the other side have learned nothing. Worse yet, this initiative along 
with the motion tabled in the House yesterday is an action born 
out of desperation. It is the worst example of so-called leadership 
we have seen in recent memory.
<P>
	Without consulting his caucus, the unity committee, the 
premiers or the Canadian people, Mr. Chrétien has unilaterally 
offered further appeasement to Quebec separatists.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. I know it was probably a slip but we refer 
to other members by their titles and not by their names.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Forgive me, Mr. Speaker. It was an oversight. I 
meant the Prime Minister.
<P>
	In any event I ask the Prime Minister and the government if they 
have not learned anything from the past. It is clear that the Prime 
Minister has not. He is determined to allow history to repeat itself. 
Following his speech yesterday on the other half of this initiative, 
the hon. member for Beaver River was moved to say it was like 
listening to former Prime Minister Mulroney defend the 
Charlottetown accord.
<P>
	In addition to telling the past, history also affords us the ability 
to gaze tentatively into the future. That is why when I look at the 
bill I see past failures along exactly the same lines as those being 
proposed here.
<P>
	The bill seeks to implement an amending formula similar to that 
contained in the Victoria charter of 1971. However, just as insulting 
to Canadians, the formula was rejected at the time by provincial 
premiers. The initiative before us does not take into account the 
realities of today's Canada, that the people of the country want a 
final say in how their Constitution is amended through referendum. 
They do not want the process controlled from beginning to end by 
the political elites of the country. That much should have been 
learned by the government following the Charlottetown accord.
<P>
	The bill would certainly place a constitutional straitjacket on any 
certain constitutional changes, no matter how desirous they might 
be. The bill would allow the federal government to withdraw its 
support for any proposed change if either the premier of Ontario or 
the premier of Quebec did not like it.
<P>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
	In addition, as this bill would not be part of Canada's 
Constitution so far, the old amending formula would apply as well. 
The combined effect of this situation means some bizarre form of 
double jeopardy would apply to proposed constitutional 
amendments. That is not good.
<P>
	Beyond that, this bill would not be acceptable to many 
Canadians because it gives the separatist Government of Quebec a 
veto over the Canadian Constitution. I ask that the members on the 
government side think about the consequences of that action for a 
moment. A separatist government would now be handed a de facto 
veto over the Constitution of a country it has decided to break 
apart. Has the Prime Minister thought about the consequences of 
such an action?
<P>
	From a personal perspective as a representative from the 
province of British Columbia, I am offended by this bill. Implicit in 
it is the notion that British Columbians are relegated to second 
class status in Confederation. I would also remind members across 
the way that along with Alberta and Ontario, B.C. is one of the 
three net contributors to Confederation. All that this legislation 
serves to do is perpetuate the mindset within the federal 
government that B.C. and the west is a colony.
<P>
	When I was a boy in Vancouver some 50 or 60 years ago, I was 
conscious of a separatist movement within British Columbia at that 
time. It came about because it was resentful of the treatment 
accorded the west by central Canadian interests. It seems to me that 
precious little has changed since then, despite the fact that B.C. is 
now the third most populous province.
<P>
	I have a warning for the government across the way. Proposals 
such as Bill C-110 before us are sure to rekindle the separatist fire 
in the west. That is something we do not want to have happen.
<P>
	In concluding, I tell members now and inform the House that as 
a loyal Canadian, I will be voting against this bill every step of the 
way.
<P>
	I further encourage members opposite to join with me and do the 
same if they think about the constitutional consequences of this bill 
for Canada, if they believe in their heart of hearts that the people of 
this country, not the governments, are the ones who know what is in 
their best interests. If they understand the lessons that 30 years of 
constitutional bickering have taught us, if they truly understand all 
those things, then they must vote against this bill. To do otherwise 
is an affront to all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Winnipeg St. James, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member from Cowichan and the Islands misunderstands 
the intent of Bill C-110. He claims that the people would like to 
have the final say in constitutional matters. Bill C-110 does exactly 
that. Let me explain to the hon. member.
<P>
	If his great province of British Columbia, a province in which I 
resided at one time, would like to cast a veto and would like to 
borrow the federal veto but before doing that it wants to go to the 
people of British Columbia in a referendum to sanction that action, 
that is allowed for in Bill C-110.
<P>
	Bill C-110 in no way stops the people of British Columbia from 
taking a decision on a constitutional  matter. That includes the veto. 
If the member wants the veto of the province of British Columbia 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17047"> 17047 </A></B>
<P>
sanctioned by the people, for heaven's sake go right ahead and do 
it.
<P>
	I can assure the member that under this legislation, if the 
province of British Columbia comes to us along with another 
province in the western region and says, we want a veto cast 
because we have held a referendum and the people in our province 
have asked for the veto, it will be respected under this law. There 
can be no other interpretation. You can respond to that if you like.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. I would encourage all hon. members to 
address the Chair instead of speaking to one another.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The 
previous speaker kept referring to something other than the motion 
before the House.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We are going to have an answer here from the 
hon. member for Nanaimo-Cowichan if he cares to have the floor 
for a minute or two.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Mr. Speaker, the main response I would have for 
the hon. member is that the intent of this bill is not directed at 
British Columbia or the west. The intent of the bill is another sop to 
the separatists of Quebec. That is its total intent. In effect, the west 
is disregarded, as it has been, as I tried to point out, for the last 50, 
60, 70 years. It is a continuation of the same old thing.
<P>
	Anything the member might say about what wonderful things 
this will do for the west I reject as nonsense.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the House for the opportunity to speak to Bill 
C-110.
<P>
	This is a serious time in the history of our country. I see all the 
empty chairs across from me. I cannot speak to members who are 
not here, but you would think there would be more than two Liberal 
members in the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> Respect the rules.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would ask all hon. members to refrain from 
mentioning whether the House is full or empty, who is here and 
who is not. There are traditions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I know that many Canadians are 
watching as we debate Bill C-110 which would give veto power 
over constitutional change to four regions in Canada, one region 
being the region I am from, western Canada, four provinces with a 
population of over eight million.
<P>
	I have been requesting feedback from the province of 
Saskatchewan. Early indications are that there is absolute rejection 
of the proposal put forward by the government in Bill C-110 and 
also in the motion we debated yesterday, the motion on recognizing 
the distinct society as a special status for the province of Quebec.
<P>
	I would hope and I would plead with this government that it 
would reverse its direction, reverse its position and walk away 
from the failures of the past, the closed door approach, and embark 
on a new course of action, an open and an honest approach with 
clear proposals that are made open to the public, that they can 
access those proposals and that they can also express their opinion 
in quantifiable ways.
<P>
	I want to talk about past performance. When we have gone down 
this road before what has happened? We have two classic 
examples, the Meech Lake accord and the Charlottetown accord.
<P>
	I grant that with the Charlottetown accord there was a 
referendum and, in fact, Canadians were able to express their 
opinions. From one end of the country to the other they said no to 
the Charlottetown accord. They said no in the province of Quebec, 
but they also said no in the province of Saskatchewan, the province 
of Alberta, the province of British Columbia and even the province 
of Nova Scotia.
<P>
	How do we come up with these concoctions, particularly the 
Meech Lake accord and the Charlottetown accord? How did we 
develop something that was rejected so adamantly by Canadians?
<P>
	It started out with 11 people behind closed doors. If you go back 
to the Meech Lake accord, it was 10 premiers and the prime 
minister. It was Prime Minister Mulroney, the Conservative prime 
minister. They got behind closed doors and began a wheeling and 
dealing session. We are opening the opportunity for another 
wheeling and dealing session with Bill C-110.
<P>
	What happens when they start wheeling and dealing behind 
closed doors? I will tell you what happened in the province of 
Saskatchewan. Premier Devine sat at the table and said: ``I will go 
along with this Meech Lake accord idea, but I want something for 
it''. What did he ask for? He got a billion dollars for the 
agricultural industry. It was a difficult time for agriculture, so he 
said: ``I will sell my soul for a billion dollars''.
<P>
	I spoke shortly after that decision with an aide of one of his 
MLAs. This was during the time of the GST debate when the 
federal government was trying to implement the GST. I said to this 
member's aide: ``Why did our provincial government agree to lend 
support? Why are we going on with the GST and why are we going 
along with the Meech Lake accord concept?'' Very honestly this 
assistant said: ``You have to do something to get a billion dollars''.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	We have paid billions of dollars in GST to get that billion 
dollars. As a province we signed on to the Meech Lake accord even 
though the people of Saskatchewan opposed it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17048"> 17048 </A></B>
<P>
	Closed door negotiations without including the Canadian public 
is wrong. More than that it is dangerous. It very costly. It detracts 
from the reputation of politicians. It gives us a bad name.
<P>
	We got our billion dollars. Newfoundland got Hibernia. Joe Ghiz 
in Prince Edward Island got the fixed link. Mr. Bourassa thought he 
was going to get a special deal for the province of Quebec. We all 
remember there was a big news story when his staffers got caught 
talking on a cell phone. They were debating whether or not he had 
sold out too cheaply, whether he gave up too much. In this cell 
phone conversation that was recorded some of his assistants felt 
that Mr. Bourassa had settled for too little.
<P>
	That tells us they were wheeling and dealing behind closed 
doors. They were wheeling and dealing with our future. It is wrong. 
It is dangerous. It is sad that this government is embarking on the 
exact same course with the implementation of Bill C-110. It needs 
to be defeated. It will not be accepted by the Canadian people if 
they have any say in whether it is a success or not.
<P>
	The same thing was going on in British Columbia. The 
wonderful thing about modern technology is that some of these 
politicians get caught. They get tripped up. One of the B.C. cabinet 
ministers, Moe Sihota, was in the interior of B.C. He did not realize 
there was a reporter or a camera there or he was not thinking. He 
talked about how B.C. had got the best of the deal at other 
provinces' expense.
<P>
	There was outrage in the province of Quebec. They realized 
there was wheeling and dealing behind closed doors. There are 
winners and losers. The winners are not the people. The winners 
are the politicians who are trying to get re-elected by making these 
deals behind closed doors. It is shameful and it is disgusting.
<P>
	What happened with the province of Alberta? Mr. Getty wanted 
something but it has not lasted. He got the election of a senator. We 
have elected one senator to the other place and that was through 
wheeling and dealing with the Meech Lake and Charlottetown 
accords. This one happened to be in relationship to the 
Charlottetown accord. That was his plum and it did not even last. 
He got one senator elected and after that we just slipped back into 
the old patronage system where friends of prime ministers are 
appointed to the other place. It was not a very valuable plum that 
the premier of Alberta received from his wheeling and dealing 
behind closed doors.
<P>
	The previous prime minister, Mr. Mulroney, has been in the 
news a great deal lately. He was involved in this wheeling and 
dealing. How did he describe this whole process? He described it as 
the rolling of the dice. Do you remember that, Mr. Speaker? You 
remember how incensed Canadians were. It began the demise of 
the former prime minister as Canadians began to realize these 
people were not looking out for the best interests of Canadians. 
They were out to protect their own hides and  wheel and deal and 
see what they could get. They were gambling with our future. It 
was repulsive to Canadians then and I assure the House, as sure as I 
am standing here, it is repulsive to Canadians today.
<P>
	If we give the regions a constitutional veto through their 
governments alone and bypass the people, there will be wheeling 
and dealing again. As sure as I am standing here there will be 
closed door negotiations. They will be sitting in a hotel room 
somewhere deciding who gets how many senators. They will 
deciding what distinct society means. They will be deciding what 
special privileges this confers on the province of Quebec. They will 
be deciding what plums the province of Ontario gets, if they go 
back to this wrongful way of deciding our country's future.
<P>
	It is time for a new direction. It is time to bypass governments 
and their whips. It can be said these 11 people represent the 
electorate because they were voted in. I have been here long 
enough to know that the way the electorate are represented in this 
House is by way of the traditional party whips who whip their 
members into voting for legislation. I have been told and I believe 
that the same thing happens in our provincial legislatures.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	In fact you have given power to eleven people without giving 
true accountability to the public if you allow the provincial 
governments to have a veto, bypassing the people and not allowing 
them to speak their minds through a referendum. In most cases 
Canadians will reject the approach of determining our country's 
future behind closed doors.
<P>
	I conclude by expressing how important this is. We are not 
talking about fishing violations. We are not talking about 
registering a pesticide. We are talking about the future of our 
country. We are talking about the operations manual for the future 
of our country. This will have an impact on my three children. It 
will have an impact on our grandchildren. It will impact future 
generations, who will ask how eleven people managed to wheel and 
deal their future away and no one rose to speak against it.
<P>
	I am standing against this process. It is wrong. It is harmful to 
Canada. It is harmful to our reputation as a democracy. It cannot go 
on. It has to stop. Canadians keep telling us to stop. When will the 
government listen and abide by the wishes of the people?
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Winnipeg St. James, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have to rise again because I cannot believe what I am hearing from 
the other side of the House.
<P>
	Bill C-110 has to do with lending the federal veto; it has nothing 
to do with enabling a constitutional initiative. This has nothing to 
do with a province wanting to change the Constitution. This is 
simply a matter of a veto, providing it through federal legislation, 
offering it to the four regions of the country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17049"> 17049 </A></B>
<P>
	I do not think a service is provided to the Canadian people when 
this kind of disinformation is disseminated across the country by 
the Reform Party.
<P>
	Let us get this straight: this piece of legislation does not change 
the Constitution one iota. This is a narrow initiative having to do 
with the veto, having to do with offering the federal veto to the four 
regions. It is as simple as that. It is unjust, it is wrong, and it 
certainly is spreading disinformation to speak otherwise.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, in responding to the hon. 
member for Winnipeg St. James let me say that we are not talking 
about a change to the Constitution, but about a new constitutional 
procedure that could be implemented under the seven and fifty 
rule.
<P>
	We are talking about using the legislatures of the provinces twice 
to try to implement something behind closed doors, rather than 
going to the Canadian people to ask them directly what their 
opinion is and then having that ratified by the seven and fifty 
formula, seven provinces with fifty per cent of the population 
agreeing to the constitutional change.
<P>
	This is a very dangerous bill. It is trying to pit province against 
province. It is trying to find out who will put forward the best deal. 
B.C. and Manitoba in the western provinces, or Nova Scotia and 
Newfoundland in the Atlantic provinces, can somehow concoct a 
deal with the federal government, with the support of Ontario and 
Quebec, to change our Constitution without going to the Canadian 
public. Once that is done, the second step is much easier, which is 
getting seven provinces with fifty per cent of the population to 
agree to the constitutional change. It is sneaky, it is crafty, and it is 
wrong. It should be stopped.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Wells (South Shore, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise in the House today to speak on Bill C-110, an act 
respecting constitutional amendments. I applaud the Minister of 
Justice for bringing forth such legislation at a time when our 
country is looking to its politicians for direction. I feel that this 
legislation is an important first step toward involving the provinces 
more directly in the introduction of constitutional amendments that 
directly affect their respective citizens.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	I was in Verdun on the Tuesday before the referendum and I 
heard the Prime Minister's commitments to Quebecers and to 
Canadians. I was in Montreal on the Friday for the incredible unity 
rally with a large delegation from my South Shore riding and with 
some of my family. I experienced the incredible goodwill and 
outpouring of affection for Quebec and of course for Canada that 
occurred in Montreal. There were 150,000 of us, but we 
represented many more.
<P>
	Those of us who were there and the many others we represented 
came away from Montreal with a renewed commitment to Canada 
and a greater understanding of  what this country is all about. We 
also recognized that there would have to be changes in the 
federation of Canada, not only a recognition but a will to see that 
this would be done. We left Montreal fearful for Canada but 
confident and recognizing that after the vote the promised changes 
would have to be implemented.
<P>
	After an agonizing Monday evening we all woke up on Tuesday 
morning realizing that we had almost lost our country, almost lost 
Canada. We also woke up with a renewed will to do what had to be 
done to ensure that Canada was not destroyed. There was a 
recognition that Quebecers voted for change but change within 
Canada.
<P>
	This bill and the distinct society motion are both a fulfilment of 
the Prime Minister's commitment made in Verdun and a beginning 
of the change Quebec voted for, which Canadians support.
<P>
	In a federation like Canada there is a delicate balance of power 
between the provinces and the federal government. Throughout our 
country's history it has not been easy to maintain this balance and 
appease the entire country. Let us face it, Canada is both the most 
decentralized country in the world and the largest. People want to 
maintain their own identity associated with their respective 
province. Yet many of our most fundamental services are 
centralized in the federal government.
<P>
	I feel very close to my home province of Nova Scotia and to 
Newfoundland, my province of birth. Yet I am most certainly a 
federalist. It is important to maintain certain services at a national 
level so that this diverse country remains the same in some ways 
and creates a common bond among all Canadians.
<P>
	I believe this bill is very important to Canada as a federation. It 
is not easy for any federal government to accommodate all facets of 
its society. This bill is a step toward hearing the voices of the 
provinces, especially in cases where amendments put forth by the 
government could be detrimental to a particular region of the 
country.
<P>
	As I said previously, Canada's federation is a balancing act. The 
desires of all provinces must be taken into consideration and given 
their due weight in the entire scheme of things. The way in which 
the veto power will work I am sure was not an easy thing to 
determine. However, the formula that has been decided upon is in 
my view satisfactory. This particular formula is a replica of the 
formula contained in the Victoria charter, which has been discussed 
in constitutional circles for decades. Even as recently as 1991 this 
formula was recommended for adoption.
<P>
	The provinces will now be doubly protected in constitutional 
matters that directly affect them. This, in conjunction with the 
Prime Minister's motion on distinct society, is part of what Quebec 
has been asking for. I believe the other provinces will be pleased to 
have the same power to veto.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17050"> 17050 </A></B>
<P>
	The balancing act I have mentioned is not only between the 
federal government and the provinces, it is also among the 
provinces. Provinces, like people, feel it is paramount to maintain 
equality with their counterparts and receive equal treatment. That 
is why I am pleased this bill will make regions within Canada 
equal to all other regions. Most important, the veto will involve 
all ten provinces, not just one. The balance has been maintained.
<P>
	Coming from a province the size of Nova Scotia, I am pleased 
that the veto has been extended to all of the regions. It will serve as 
an added protection to all provinces, especially for smaller 
provinces, as in Atlantic Canada. The fact that the provinces 
included in the regions are either alone or grouped together with 
provinces with similar demographics makes the bill both fair and 
equitable.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	The new veto is especially important to Quebec. Quebecers 
should have the right to halt a constitutional amendment that could 
endanger the preservation of their distinct culture, language, and 
civil law. It is unfortunate, however, that the Bloc Quebecois will 
not accept this bill as a first step toward what should be our 
common goals. The Bloc will do everything in its power to 
discredit this type of action, although any other action, be it 
constitutional amendment or whatever, would prove to them to be 
unacceptable.
<P>
	The agenda of the official opposition is to have Quebec separate 
from Canada. Hon. members opposite should accept reality and 
come to the realization that Quebecers voted to stay within Canada. 
We on the government side have recognized this fact and are 
dealing with it. This bill is a first step toward improving our 
country and making some necessary changes.
<P>
	While the Bloc will argue that this bill does not go far enough, 
the Reform Party will argue that it goes too far. The Reform Party 
will agree to change only if that change means nothing. There are 
some members of Parliament who would like to separate Quebec 
from Canada. There are other members of Parliament who would 
like to separate Canada from Quebec. These people will never be 
satisfied.
<P>
	The Constitution is up for review before April 1997. It will be 
counterproductive to have constitutional talks now rather than 
waiting for the review to take place so that we know if and where 
changes are needed. This bill, as I have said, is the first step toward 
fixing what needs to be fixed in Canada. I believe it will be quite 
productive to deal with one issue at a time, as the Prime Minister is 
presently doing.
<P>
	Quebecers who voted in the referendum want Parliament to 
prove we are listening to them. Canadians who wished they could 
have been at the rally in Montreal want Parliament to prove we are 
listening to them.  Canadians want Parliament to make sure we do 
not lose sight of the forest for the trees.
<P>
	I hope those Canadians who invested their hearts in the rally in 
Montreal will see that Parliament is working hard to make a 
difference for the better. I hope Quebecers and all Canadians will 
encourage their members of Parliament, regardless of their party 
affiliations, to vote for this progressive course of action.
<P>
	This bill is central to the accommodation of the diverse cultures 
that are evident in Canada's four regions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me great pleasure today to speak in favour of the 
actions being undertaken by our government to further the process 
of ensuring a united Canada. Our actions will recognize the reality 
of Quebec as a distinct society, increase veto power, and move to 
eliminate duplication in the area of training.
<P>
	Prior to the victory for national unity in the recent referendum in 
Quebec, Canadians from all provinces told us they wanted Quebec 
to stay in Canada. They told us they understood Quebec's 
frustration, understood that we must make changes to address the 
needs of our fellow Canadians in Quebec. They told us they 
recognize the depth of the emotion and they understand its source.
<P>
	We promised Quebec and the rest of Canada we would deliver 
change to them. We promised them this was not just lip service, but 
an actual desire, willingness and commitment to achieve change 
for lasting unity in Canada.
<P>
	I contrast that to the actions of the third party, whose solution to 
this problem is to pit region against region, one part of Canada 
against another part of Canada, and whose view of this nation is 
one in which national standards are gutted so that the right become 
richer and the poor are abandoned.
<P>
	We in the Liberal Party believe in Canada, a Canada that 
includes our historic First Nations, the founding European people, 
both French and English, and the many who have come since who 
have added to the diversity of this great country.
<P>
<B>(1600 )</B>
<P>
	We believe in a Canada in which its citizens collectively have 
accepted a social responsibility to maintain a social safety net, 
including health care, education, security for seniors and income 
support for the unemployed. Most of all, we believe in a Canada 
built on compassion and inclusion, not the hate and the division 
preached by some in this country.
<P>
	Part of the action we are undertaking addresses one of the issues 
of foremost importance to Quebec. It recognizes that Quebec is a 
distinct society within Canada. It recognizes those items that make 
Quebec distinct: a French speaking majority, a unique culture, and 
a tradition of civil law. These distinctions are not  new. They do not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17051"> 17051 </A></B>
<P>
exist at the expense of other parts of the country. It is time that 
Canada officially recognized this reality.
<P>
	Our initiative to recognize Quebec's distinct society within 
Canada is part of our overall commitment to change. That includes 
the concepts in Bill C-110 which gives all of the regions of Canada, 
including Quebec, a veto in matters of constitutional change.
<P>
	As a result of this bill, we will require the consent of Quebec, 
Ontario and the Atlantic and western regions before any 
constitutional amendments will be accepted by the Parliament of 
Canada. This will ensure that all provinces will be active 
participants in any evolution of the Canadian Constitution. It will 
protect the regions of Canada against amendments that could 
potentially diminish their powers, rights and privileges.
<P>
	We are also introducing measures to give the provinces 
jurisdiction over training to eliminate program overlap and to give 
all provinces the flexibility they need to deliver training 
effectively. These are strong first steps toward refining our 
relationship with Quebec and building a stronger Canada. These 
are part of our commitment to Canada and to all Canadians.
<P>
	We live in the greatest country in the world. All members and 
our constituents, we are Canada. What we do in the House affects 
all Canadians. Our goal is to preserve all that is great about Canada 
and to change that which needs to be changed. These are the 
reasons we will achieve lasting unity in this country. By working 
together, by listening to each other, by honouring our commitment 
to change, we demonstrate our commitment to each other and to 
this country. That will be our legacy to future generations of 
Canadians.
<P>
	I think we are on the right track. Members of the third party think 
we have gone too far. Members of the official opposition think we 
have not gone far enough. I believe both of these parties have not 
thought this through. They are fighting to gain control for their own 
self-serving purposes while our government is fighting for 
Canadians and for Canada. That is what is important now. Our 
actions speak louder than their words.
<P>
	Several weeks ago I was on a bus that came from my riding of 
Parry Sound-Muskoka. It was filled with constituents who 
wanted to be at the giant national unity rally in Montreal to show 
Quebecers they were committed to a united Canada and to making 
change so that Canada works better for all of its citizens.
<P>
	As parliamentarians, we are now charged with the responsibility 
and the privilege of following through with our promises, of living 
up to the faith and the trust that Quebecers and Canadians placed in 
our hands following the referendum. We will not let our country 
down. We will proceed logically and practically to build on 
Canada's strength to work for conciliation and to better the lives of 
all our citizens.
<P>
	These measures are both important and meaningful. What is 
more significant, they are achievable in the short term. We can 
simply recognize the reality that Quebec is a distinct society, that 
all regions of Canada want to have a say in constitutional change 
and we are doing that quickly and expeditiously.
<P>
	The action can later be entrenched in our Constitution if we so 
desire, providing Quebec indicates its desire to do so. Granted, if 
the Leader of the Opposition becomes the next premier of Quebec 
he has already indicated that he certainly does not want Quebec's 
distinctiveness to be entered into the Constitution.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	The member for Lac-Saint-Jean talks from both sides of his 
mouth, as they say. He demands change for Quebec but when it is 
offered, even before the details are known, he rejects not the 
proposal but the very fact that it is offered. He does not appear to 
care about trying to make Quebec a better place in which to live. He 
certainly does not care about Canada as he constantly ignores the 
oath he took when he came to this place as he tries to destroy this 
country. He cares only for power and his place in the sun.
<P>
	I believe in my country. I believe in a united Canada from coast 
to coast to coast. As proud Canadians, we will not soon forget the 
overwhelming show of support we saw for national unity across 
Canada leading up to the referendum in Quebec. We will not forget 
that historic moment on October 30 when Quebecers voted to 
remain in Canada.
<P>
	I am very pleased to add my support to my government's pledge 
for lasting national unity. I am pleased we will achieve our goals 
quickly and that we will soon return to our task of building an 
economy in which jobs and growth occur.
<P>
	I pledge my continued support for this great country, Canada. All 
of us in this place are here for what will be a blink in Canada's 
history. In that short time I have a sacred duty and an obligation to 
my children and my children's children not to let the forces 
attempting to destroy this country succeed. The people of Canada 
will stand united and the Government of Canada will ensure that 
together we remain one strong nation both proud and free.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member criticized our leader for saying he did not agree with the 
distinct society resolution proposed by the government and did not 
agree either with the veto proposal.
<P>
	I think the hon. member failed to realize that the distinct society 
proposal does not give Quebec any power, any opportunity to be 
distinct.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17052"> 17052 </A></B>
<P>
	In fact, what we want is not a piece of paper that offers 
meaningless recognition of the distinct society concept. Our leader 
reminded the Prime Minister of this yesterday. So I think the hon. 
member did not quite grasp the purport of this offer.
<P>
	First of all, it is not an offer that will be entrenched in the 
Constitution, and by the way, at the same time they are saying we 
have a veto. Today, they announced Quebec had a veto. However, 
they are giving the same veto to the other regions as well. If you 
give a veto to everyone, it is no longer a veto. It becomes 
meaningless, because the other regions could use their veto to 
block Quebec's legitimate demands.
<P>
	I think this is a trap. They would have Quebecers believe that the 
government is responding to their aspirations by offering a veto 
and recognition as a distinct society. I hardly think Quebecers will 
fall for that.
<P>
	I have this question for the hon. member. Did he realize what 
was involved or was his speech prepared by the Prime Minister's 
Privy Council Office or would he just have Quebecers believe they 
are not smart enough to understand what the government is offering 
us today?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Mr. Speaker, with all due respect to the hon. 
member, I will answer very plainly.
<P>
<B>(1610 )</B>
<P>
	If the Bloc Quebecois really believes that Quebec is a distinct 
society, if it really believes that Quebec should have a veto, if it 
really believes in the decentralization and the turning over of 
manpower training to the provinces, then Bloc members can prove 
it very simply and very clearly: vote for the resolution, vote for Bill 
C-110 and do what they say.
<P>
	When the hon. member talks as he just has, all he is doing is 
listing a series of excuses of why Bloc members will not do what 
they said all along they wanted to have happen. It is all political 
double-talk. If they want Quebec to be a distinct society, then they 
should vote for the resolution. If they want Quebec to have a veto, 
then they should vote for Bill C-110. If you want control over 
manpower training, then vote for Mr. Axworthy's reforms when he 
brings those forward. It is fairly straightforward.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Colleagues, I understand the 
member for Parry Sound-Muskoka has concluded his remarks. I 
will simply remind the House in two areas. In the one instance all 
interventions must be made through the Chair and not directly 
across the floor from one member to the other, and members should 
be referred to either by their riding or their portfolio.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with interest to the comments made by my hon. colleague from 
Parry Sound-Muskoka.
<P>
	When we look at Bill C-110 we are looking at nothing new. We 
have looked at this kind of approach to the unity question in 
Canada for the last number of years and it is a failure. If anyone 
questions the failure of this kind of approach as contained within 
Bill C-110, all we have to do is look across the floor every question 
period and see the evidence of that failure which sits 53 strong in 
this House. For years and years and years we have heard this same 
kind of approach and it has failed.
<P>
	One of the most discouraging aspects about this bill is the 
process. At least two premiers have expressed vehement opposition 
to it. If the hon. member for Parry Sound-Muskoka believes it is 
just us Reformers who are trying to split factions and have factions 
fight against factions, let me quote from the front page of the <I>Globe 
and Mail</I>. Mr. Roger Gibbins, a political scientist at the University 
of Calgary, says: ``This is little short of a constitutional coup d'état 
by the Prime Minister''. Mr. Philip Resnick, a political scientist at 
the University of British Columbia, states: ``The Prime Minister 
hasn't just got a Quebec crisis on his hands, he may also have an 
incipient revolt of the western provinces on his hands''.
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member to consider those comments. We 
are getting all sorts of comments like that from our western 
colleagues. Surely there must have been some lessons learned from 
the Charlottetown accord and the Meech Lake accord. Surely that 
top down approach in process alone spells doom and failure in 
terms of acceptance by the people of this country, particularly in 
the area where I am from.
<P>
	I ask my hon. colleague if he would respectfully address those 
areas that we have to deal with in dealing with this bill.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would simply ask the hon. 
member for Parry Sound-Muskoka for his co-operation for a brief 
response. When members are splitting their time, the time of five 
minutes for debate is very short. Therefore the questions must be 
put succinctly and we must hope that the responses are brief also.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be brief but I will not be able 
to address everything the member raised.
<P>
	This is a time in Canada when we need to put the nation first. It is 
possible to be regionalistic in an approach. It is possible to put the 
interests of our region first. However it is not appropriate in this 
case. In this case Canada has to come first. Canadians have to come 
first. That is what we ought to do.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	This plan will work. These measures will work. There is a time 
when it might need to be constitutionalized, but we are not talking 
about the Constitution today. We do not want to get into a long 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17053"> 17053 </A></B>
<P>
series of where we were in the late 1980s and the 1990s. We have 
an economy to deal  with. We have jobs to create. Let us get this 
done. Let us do it quickly and do it in the interest of Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome the opportunity today to speak to Bill C-110 which deals 
with the regional veto.
<P>
	First, we can say that this year, which is now drawing to a close, 
was the year of the referendum on the future of Quebec. In fact, on 
October 30, nearly 94 per cent of registered voters exercised their 
right to vote. It was an exemplary and laudable exercise in 
democracy. In this referendum, 50.6 per cent of the population of 
Quebec said no to the sovereignty and partnership proposal of the 
Quebec government.
<P>
	We accept the outcome, although the margin was very narrow, 
because we always said, unlike Jean Chrétien, that we would abide 
by the verdict-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I simply want to remind the 
House that members should always be referred to by their riding or 
their portfolio. In this case, the Prime Minister.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> I stand corrected.
<P>
	Unlike the Prime Minister, we always said we would abide by 
the decision of Quebecers.
<P>
	Democracy is the very foundation of the sovereignist movement, 
which will be guided in the pursuit of its ideal by a respect for 
democratic values and principles, while abiding by the democratic 
decision made by the people of Quebec. Meanwhile, it behooves us 
to keep calm and pull together after this vote of historic 
importance, until our next rendezvous with history.
<P>
	However, the extremely close results of the referendum should 
give the No side something to think about. The ball is now in the 
federalist court. They will have to move with those winds of 
change they claimed to feel, all of a sudden, during the latter part of 
the campaign when the Yes side was ahead. But they must realize 
that after this referendum, Quebecers will no longer be satisfied 
with merely cosmetic changes to outmoded and meaningless 
formulas or with vague and inconsistent administrative and 
legislative reforms.
<P>
	The vote on October 30 clearly indicated the desire of Quebecers 
to be recognized for what they are, a people. To provide that 
recognition within the Canadian federal system, major 
constitutional changes will be necessary.
<P>
	The question was, would the federal government be willing to 
make those changes and would it be supported by the provinces and 
the rest of Canada?
<P>
	The howls of protest that went up in English Canada indicated it 
would probably never respond to the legitimate aspirations of 
Quebecers. As for the Prime Minister, considering his past record, 
he seems clearly incapable of keeping his promises.
<P>
	Promises for change were hastily drafted by the federalist camp 
during the last days of the referendum campaign. These promises 
were not made in a flurry of enthusiasm; quite the contrary, they 
were motivated by fear that the yes side would win.
<P>
	Last Monday, we saw the apotheosis of a panic operation that 
started during the last weeks of the referendum campaign. As soon 
as the Leader of the Opposition came on the scene to lead the yes 
side, the federalist forces realized there was a real possibility they 
would be defeated.
<P>
	To prevent this from happening, the Prime Minister, in a last 
ditch effort, promised Quebecers that changes would be made in 
Canadian federalism if the no side won. It was the threat of defeat, 
nothing else, that forced the federal government to promise what it 
cannot deliver. That is obvious if we consider, in chronological 
order, the statements made by Prime Minister.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	Given the speech made in early October in the Maritimes, in 
which he ridiculed the idea of enshrining Quebec's distinct nature 
in the Constitution, and given his stubborn opposition, until 
October 24, to any change in the federal structure, we can only 
conclude that the Prime Minister has an aversion to the issue of 
Quebec. In fact, the promises for change he made in the last week 
of the referendum campaign were vague, and no specific proposal 
was put forward at the time.
<P>
	Remember what the Prime Minister said, on the evening of 
October 30: ``For the second time in 15 years, we just went through 
a difficult and emotional period. We must now contemplate 
innovative solutions, so as to never again go through such an 
existential crisis''. Let us not forget that, even at the very end of the 
referendum campaign, the federal government did not have any 
concrete and innovative constitutional proposal to make to 
Quebecers. The government knew that it had to make some kind of 
an offer, but that was it.
<P>
	The very narrow no side victory forced federalists to quickly 
make proposals to Quebec. The federal government hastily set up a 
cabinet committee to make such proposals. However, from the 
moment it was set up, it was clear that this was a phoney 
committee, with no real mandate and no real power. The same goes 
for the Quebec Liberal Party, which adopted a constitutional 
position, if you can call it that, only last weekend. Everything was 
done on the spur of the moment by people who are still unable to 
listen to and agree with the will of Quebecers.
<P>
	The deafness of the federalist leaders became even more 
apparent on Monday, with the federal government's proposals. 
These proposals deal with three specific issues: manpower training, 
Quebec's distinct nature, and the granting of a regional veto. In the 
Prime Minister's mind, these proposals give concrete expression  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17054"> 17054 </A></B>
<P>
to commitments made during the referendum campaign. But what 
do these proposals really mean? Nothing, absolutely nothing, 
because they will be entirely dependent on the mood of the 
government in office, since none of the proposals will be enshrined 
in the Canadian Constitution.
<P>
	At best, these proposals will become trivial motions that are not 
binding on anyone. This is what the Liberal government opposite is 
intending for the concept of a distinct society. At most, they will be 
tabled and passed in the House like ordinary legislation, which may 
be revoked at any time by this government or by some future 
government. This is where the government wants to relegate 
manpower training and the right of veto.
<P>
	What is really apparent in the November 27 proposals is the 
irreconcilability of Quebec's traditional claims with English 
Canada's position. We can see, in reading Bill C-110, that never 
before has the granting of a veto been so devoid of value. Let us be 
honest, this veto, which is apparently being offered to Quebecers is 
simply on loan, so long as Quebec does what the federal 
government wants.
<P>
	To illustrate this, we have only to look at the present position of 
our colleagues in the Reform Party on the veto for the regions and 
recognition of Quebec as a distinct society. Reformers clearly see 
Quebec as just another province and therefore will never accept the 
concept of a distinct society, even if it were to mean 
nothing-which in fact it does. Obviously, the same applies to the 
veto for the regions, which to them means giving a sovereignist 
government a veto over Canada's future, at least that is what they 
claim.
<P>
	The Leader of the Reform Party has already indicated he would 
revoke the veto of Quebec, Ontario and the other regions in Canada 
if he ever came to power. In saying so he reveals ever so clearly, 
even before it is enacted, the ridiculousness of the Prime Minister's 
proposal. Given that the veto proposed for Quebec would be 
granted only through ordinary legislation, the Reform Party, once 
in power, could simply repeal or amend it.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	Paradoxically, the mechanisms that are supposed to prevent 
amendments to the Canadian Constitution without the consent of 
Quebec could be dropped just like that. In fact, since the veto 
powers of Quebec and the other Canadian regions are not 
entrenched in the Canadian Constitution, it will always be possible 
for a political party like the Reform Party, for instance, to deprive 
Quebec of its veto.
<P>
	The same applies to the distinct society resolution. Here again, a 
future Reform Party government would have no compunction 
about revoking this simple resolution, thus abolishing a 
meaningless concept.
<P>
	The bill before us today illustrates the authoritarian and 
paternalistic approach of the Canadian government,  which is 
refusing to safeguard the interests of Quebec. All this reminds me 
of an old trick people use to play. They would take a wallet that was 
ostensibly full of money and put it on the ground, attached to a 
fairly thin thread that would be practically invisible to the potential 
victim. Then they would squat behind a bush and wait. As soon as 
the victim saw the wallet he would try to pick it up, but every time, 
the other person would jerk the thread and pull the wallet away. 
This could go on for some time until there was no more thread left 
to pull or the victim realized what was going on or simply gave up. 
In fact, until the victim gave up chasing after something he would 
never be able to get.
<P>
	This is like the Prime Minister's constitutional promises. This 
week it was obvious that he wanted to give the impression there 
was a nice package for us on the table while in fact, he has the 
proverbial thread which he can use to take the package back, if he 
wants to.
<P>
	Furthermore, and this is an important point, Bill C-110 gives the 
federal government considerable latitude when it must define what 
constitutes the consent of a province. Of course, this was all 
planned by the federal government, because it wants to keep the 
latitude it needs to test the veto granted to a region. There are at 
least seven ways for a province to signify its consent or refusal to 
Ottawa.
<P>
	It could be a resolution of the legislative assembly, an order in 
council, an order signed by a provincial minister, an order signed 
by a province's lieutenant-governor, a provincial referendum 
organised by a province, a federal referendum in one or several 
provinces, or a vote by the federal members of a given province.
<P>
	It could easily be imagined that the federal government could 
hold a referendum in Quebec to get the province's agreement, 
sidestepping the government democratically elected by the people 
of Quebec.
<P>
	On the other hand, the federal plan to give a veto to the regions is 
already meeting strong opposition on the part of some English 
provinces. For instance, Alberta is against this principle because it 
believes that all provinces are equal and, as such, it cannot accept 
not to have its own veto.
<P>
	British Columbia is also opposed to the idea of a regional veto 
since, under the present formula, it does not have one. Moreover, 
Mr. Harcourt, the province's premier, believes that British 
Columbia should have its own veto since, in his opinion, it is a 
region in itself. We can see that this right of veto-as pointed out 
recently by columnists, observers, and Quebec political analysts-, 
and the vague and insipid principle of a distinct society are far less 
than what Quebec has always asked for. Some even say that there is 
a long way to go before meeting Quebec's historical demands.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17055"> 17055 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	I would even go so far as to say this is a real setback for Quebec. 
This is unacceptable. As soon as each region obtains a veto, and is 
therefore able to impact on the decisions of the federal government, 
this government is no longer in a position to entrench the principle 
of distinct society or the special veto for Quebec in the 
Constitution. The federal government will no longer be able to 
recognize these principles in the Canadian Constitution if the other 
regions obtain a veto on all federal actions and all constitutional 
amendments. The government therefore knows that it is guarding 
itself against any constitutional entrenchment of the very principles 
it is trying to sell us today.
<P>
	At the individual level, on the subject of a veto for Quebec, there 
is evident dichotomy between public opinion in Quebec and in the 
rest of Canada.
<P>
	A Gallup poll conducted November 8 to 13, where 1,005 persons 
were polled, showed that 66 per cent of Quebecers want Quebec to 
obtain a veto. On the other hand, only 10 per cent of the people 
polled in other provinces support that concept. In fact, 78 per cent 
of respondents in the prairies, 77 per cent in the Atlantic provinces, 
70 per cent in British Columbia and 68 per cent in Ontario are 
opposed to it.
<P>
	These data clearly show that, outside Quebec, the support for a 
Quebec veto is slight. This confirms that Quebec could easily lose 
its veto after a change of government at the federal level since any 
future federal government will certainly want to obtain the support 
of all Canadians and that will be at the expense of Quebec.
<P>
	Finally, what can we say about this federal initiative launched in 
chaos and panic only a few weeks ago? As I have just said and 
explained, the Ottawa's proposals, meant to fulfil the promises the 
Prime Minister made to the Quebec people during the last 
referendum campaign, are nothing but smoke and mirrors. The 
truth is, we are facing a large scale camouflage operation whereby 
the federal government is trying, once again, to hide from the 
people the fact that it is unable to radically change the Canadian 
federal system.
<P>
	Quebec has always had legitimate demands and aspirations 
within this system. But these demands and aspirations were never 
met. Realizing that, after the referendum on sovereignty, the 
demands would be higher than ever, the Canadian Prime Minister 
did not even try to find a solution to the problems plaguing the 
country he is heading. Instead he tried a bit of sleight of hand and 
gave us crumbs.
<P>
	As I said, the Prime Minister is trying to put one over on us; he 
would have Quebecers believe that he is making a grand gesture 
towards Quebec, but what he does not say is that his grand gesture 
means absolutely nothing.
<P>
	Not only is the Prime Minister's action totally meaningless, he is 
trying to make the population believe  that he cannot do more in the 
area of pseudo-changes because the sovereignist government in 
Quebec would prevent him from going ahead with them in any 
case. For the federal government it is a way of blaming others for 
its problems.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has taken great care to avoid saying that his 
proposal for amending the Canadian Constitution would meet with 
strong opposition, perhaps an even more so from some of the other 
Canadian provinces than from Quebec itself. Instead, he has 
blamed the sovereignist government, refusing to 
acknowledge-when the federal government is asking us to 
acknowledge the people's verdict-that the people of Quebec 
elected that government democratically and legitimately and-I 
would remind our colleagues opposite-they elected a majority of 
sovereignist members in this House as well.
<P>
	Knowing that, how could we accept offers from the federal 
government that are so weak that they are light years away from the 
Meech Lake accord and from Charlottetown proposals, which also 
meant nothing or next to nothing.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	How could we accept something that is even less than what 
Robert Bourassa himself never accepted? How could we ever claim 
to have the moral and political authority to put ourselves in a 
position of extreme weakness relative to the rest of Canada?
<P>
	No, the Bloc Quebecois, which I am part of, will never agree to 
such a window dressing operation by the Canadian federal 
government. We will not be the accomplices of the Prime Minister 
of Canada in this senseless approach. The Bloc Quebecois will 
therefore vote against this bill, because it means absolutely nothing 
for Quebec. It is a meaningless bill and, furthermore, it does not 
provide any guarantee for the future, any guarantee for Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to see 
that the opposition is not necessarily ready to recognize the 
people's verdict of October 30, because the other day, as you know 
full well, members of the Liberal opposition in Quebec asked the 
Quebec government and its Premier to respect, and above all to 
recognize, that verdict.
<P>
	I find it strange that the PQ government refuses to recognize the 
fact that Quebecers have chosen to remain within the Canadian 
federation.
<P>
	Having said that, I still have a few questions for him. For 
Quebec, the motion as tabled, the resolution in question, is aimed at 
regaining a veto that was abandoned by the former PQ government, 
the 1981 government of which the hon. member for Mercier was a 
member. I find it strange that they do not want to regain this veto 
that the PQ government forsook in 1981.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17056"> 17056 </A></B>
<P>
	We are talking about change, about sincere change. The other 
day, opposition members accused us federal Liberals of dragging 
our feet. They said that they were still waiting. That the 
referendum was over. We have now come up with a serious 
proposal, which is obviously a step in the right direction, but I 
must tell you that if we are in favour of enshrining this veto, and 
especially Quebec's distinct society, in the Canadian Constitution, 
we are asking the provinces to invite the Canadian Parliament to 
entrench this concept, this Quebec reality, in the Canadian 
Constitution.
<P>
	That is why we are asking the opposition to do the same thing, 
because the Leader of the Opposition, as we know full well, 
supported the concept of Quebec's distinct society not so long ago. 
Unfortunately, they are not ready to do so, and that is why we made 
a formal commitment not to enshrine anything in the Canadian 
Constitution without the support and consent of Quebecers, and 
above all of their National Assembly.
<P>
	I urge the hon. member of the opposition to pressure his leader, 
who will likely become Premier of Quebec, into making a public 
commitment today in the House of Commons to tell Quebecers that 
he, too, will recognize Quebec as a distinct society and ask 
Parliament to ensure that this principle is entrenched in the 
Canadian Constitution.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine for his comments more than 
for his questions, since there were few questions in his comments.
<P>
	I would say that we, of course, recognized the decision made by 
Quebecers on October 30, as evidenced by the fact that we are still 
sitting as members of this House and taking part in proceedings. 
We as Quebecers are still paying our taxes to this government and 
complying with federal laws and regulations. We therefore respect 
the decision made by the people of Quebec.
<P>
	I would remind my esteemed colleague from 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine that Quebecers simply 
rejected a proposal from the Quebec government. Their no vote 
does not mean that they are willing to accept just anything. Despite 
the claims made by our friends across the way, the no vote is no 
indication of Quebecers' attachment to Canada.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	They simply rejected a proposal. That is all. One thing is for 
certain: by voting no, Quebecers did not indicate that they would be 
happy with any symbolic trifle like what the government is now 
trying to sell us. Accepting this kind of trifle does not imply a 
recognition of the decision made by Quebecers. Rather, it is the 
government that does not abide by their decision by trying to pull 
the wool over their eyes.
<P>
	As for that famous right of veto, the government continues to try 
to fool us, to have Quebecers believe  that at one time they had such 
a veto, that they could have used it but that the then premier of 
Quebec gave it up. The fact is that the Quebec premier of the time 
did not give up anything. The Supreme Court, that august assembly 
of Canadian judges, ruled that Quebec never had any veto. 
Therefore, we could not give up something we never had.
<P>
	The government wants us to believe that this bill will 
re-introduce this vague notion of veto power that never really 
existed, as confirmed by the Supreme Court. In order to be valid, 
that power would have to be enshrined in the Constitution. 
However, this is not what is proposed in the bill, quite the contrary. 
The bill ensures that neither the concept of distinct society, nor 
Quebec's veto power will ever be entrenched in the Constitution 
since the other Canadian provinces, or regions as they are now 
called by the federal government, could use their own veto to 
oppose the entrenchment of these two basic concepts.
<P>
	The member opposite should know that, traditionally, 
constitutional negotiations have always carried high expectations 
but invariably produced very little. Now, the government would 
have us believe that, for the first time in history, in spite of the 
current political situation, these meagre and minimalist proposals 
will ultimately turn into big and beautiful things for Quebec and the 
rest of Canada. It goes without saying that no one believes that 
except, of course, the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine.
<P>
	As for the concept of distinct society, the hon. member should 
know that Quebecers have reached the point where they will 
definitely not settle for anything less than their recognition as a 
nation. Quebec is a nation and wants to be recognized as such, and 
not merely by a vague and meaningless motion in this House.
<P>
	As for accepting the results of the October 30 referendum, the 
hon. member should know that we could never-as indicated by 
the current leader of the opposition and future Quebec 
premier-accept less than Meech, which was rejected, and 
Charlottetown, which Quebecers rejected. What is being proposed 
now is not even close to Meech, and not even remotely close to 
Charlottetown.

<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Winnipeg St. James, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
shed a tear for truth. From time to time in this chamber truth comes 
under great strain and I think this is one of those times.
<P>
	Earlier in his speech the hon. member for Verchères described 
himself and other separatists in the province of Quebec as victims. 
They live in the country called Canada, one of the greatest 
countries in the world and he has the gall to say he is a victim. We 
have one of the greatest charters of rights and freedoms in the 
world and he says he is a victim. He stands in the highest court in  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17057"> 17057 </A></B>
<P>
the land he spouts his separatism and his separatist complaints and 
he describes himself as a victim. Give me a break.
<P>
	The member says that the ball is now in our court. Exactly and 
what is the Prime Minister doing? He made two specific promises 
in the referendum and he is acting on those promises right now.
<P>
	The member says that Bill C-110 is a watered down approach. 
What was Meech Lake? Was it watered down? Was it acceptable to 
the separatists? No. What about Charlottetown? Was it watered 
down? Was it acceptable to the separatists in Quebec? I do not 
think so. Is there anything on the face of the earth that would be 
acceptable to the separatists in Quebec short of giving them a new 
country? The answer is no. He can answer the question, yes or no. 
If he wants to be honest he will say no.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Winnipeg St. James for his question.
<P>
	First, the hon. member would certainly do well to reread my 
speech tomorrow in <I>Hansard</I>, for I never claimed that we were 
victims. Quebec has gone far beyond that in its historical 
development. Quebec is not a victim, it is simply a people.
<P>
	I did say that the ball is now in the federalist court-I hope he is 
listening in the foyer-the ball is in the federalist court, but the 
federalists should not keep the ball to themselves.
<P>
	That being said, I would like to get back to his statement that 
separatists, as he calls them, were in disagreement with the Meech 
Lake accord and with the Charlottetown accord. First, it has to be 
said that if he goes over the history of this again and if he tries to 
remember the events that led up to the Meech Lake accord, he will 
realize that there are people who are sovereignists today who, at the 
time, were in favour of Meech.
<P>
	The Leader of the Opposition is a fitting example. He was in 
favour of the Meech Lake accord. The hon. Leader of the 
Opposition was in favour of Meech.
<P>
	The Meech Lake accord, which represented the most minimal 
conditions Quebec had ever put forward, having been rejected, how 
could we, the sovereignists, accept less that Meech with the 
Charlottetown accord?
<P>
	Of course, to answer the hon. member's question, all of the 
sovereignists were against Charlottetown.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before I hear the hon. 
member on a point of order, I just want to say that the word 
``dignified'' was used and I am very pleased to  see how dignified 
this debate in the House of Commons is.
<P>
	The hon. secretary of State on a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask, through the 
Chair, if there is unanimous consent to extend the sitting until 11 
p.m. tonight, so that we can go on with this debate on Bill C-110.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is there unanimous consent?

	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Secretary of State (Parliamentary 
Affairs) and Deputy Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it was not possible to reach an 
agreement pursuant to Standing Orders 78(1) and 78(2) with 
respect to the proceedings at second reading of Bill C-110, An Act 
respecting constitutional amendments.
<P>
	Therefore, I give notice that, at the next sitting of the House, 
pursuant to Standing Order 78(3), I will be moving a time 
allocation motion for the purpose of allotting a specified number of 
days or hours for the consideration and disposal of proceedings at 
that stage.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CONSIDERATIONOFSECONDREADING">CONSIDERATION OF SECOND READING</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the series of motions and the legislation that is before 
us today essentially come down to three items: the issue of the 
regional veto, the distinct society and attempts to further improve 
the economy of the country with more devolution and 
reorganization of economic activity between the provinces and the 
federal government.
<P>
	This all must be considered in light of the fact that in 
approximately 18 months a meeting between the provinces and the 
federal government will be required to consider the 15th 
anniversary of the 1982 agreements with respect to amendment and 
that must be borne in mind at all times. As described by the 
Minister of Justice, this is a bridge to the meeting which will take 
place 18 months hence. Those who would like to have the motion, 
the resolution and the economic measures expanded to something 
greater should recognize that.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	Some of the suggestions I have heard, particularly from the 
Reform Party, would take over a year to implement. There would 
have to be a full discussion, meetings and the whole long rigmarole 
which we remember from Charlottetown. It should be understood 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17058"> 17058 </A></B>
<P>
that this is not a substitute for the 1997 meeting which will be held 
between the provinces and the federal government.
<P>
	I point out that the distinct society definition is quite limited. 
The wording has been very carefully chosen. It is that the House 
recognize that Quebec is a distinct society within Canada and that 
the House recognize that Quebec's distinct society includes its 
French speaking majority, its unique culture and its civil law 
tradition. These are important parts of the Canadian reality which 
are generally understood and accepted across the country. 
Wherever one may be in Canada it is well known that there are 
these three elements of Quebec society which distinguish that 
society from the societies of all other provinces and territories.
<P>
	It is also important to recognize that Canada is not a 
homogeneous country. It is a country of many variations: regional 
variations, variations in its population, where it came from, how 
settlement has developed and how attitudes have developed. It is 
that diversity which we celebrate so often and which makes Canada 
one of the more unique countries of the world. It is an important 
part of the Canadian reality. It was that long before 1867.
<P>
	We have to remember that diversity means there are differing 
needs and differing aspirations in the different regions of the 
country. Historically, provincial differences have dictated the need 
for different approaches. The British North America Act and the 
changes which were implemented in 1982 with the Constitution 
have made it perfectly clear that we have historically recognized 
those differences. If we go back beyond 1841 we will find that the 
differences within Canada have always been recognized in 
constitutional documents. It is one of the reasons so much of the 
country has been able to flourish. It is the reason for which we are 
the envy of the world.
<P>
	Acknowledging Quebec as a distinct society is part of something 
perfectly logical and natural. It is not something which is being 
forced on any part of the country. It is a recognition of differences 
of which we have all known since our first days as Canadians. It is 
part of the evolution of Canada to recognize that distinctiveness 
and to make the accommodations which the bill and the resolution 
put forward. It is also a recognition of the affection and 
considerable pride which Canadians have in Quebec, which we saw 
in the few days before the referendum vote.
<P>
	I would like to speak about the veto. These changes have not 
come completely out of the blue. They have been discussed before. 
Veto provisions were discussed at the time of the Victoria charter in 
1971. Vetoes have been discussed at many constitutional 
conferences, in the press and elsewhere. In no way is this some 
sudden imposition of a formula which has been devised. It is a 
responsible recognition that over that long period of time certain 
basic understandings of the nature of the country have become 
evident with respect to the Constitution and the veto, particularly 
with respect to the 1982 changes.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	Again I would stress that the current formulae for changing the 
Constitution are in four categories. You have some changes which 
would require the federal government and all the provinces before 
there could be a change. Others affect only a single province and 
the federal or perhaps even single provinces themselves and their 
neighbour. In addition you have this category which is the seven 
provinces and 50 per cent of the population.
<P>
	All that is being put forward is that the federal government is 
limiting itself by legislation in the manner in which it will exercise 
the federal veto. It is not a constitutional change and that should be 
recognized. It is not a question of embarking on some great 
adventure as has been attempted by previous governments with 
Meech and Charlottetown where there were many things 
incorporated as well as the issue of the veto.
<P>
	I will turn to the veto with respect to western Canada and in 
particular, with respect to British Columbia, my home province. At 
the present time for British Columbia to succeed it would have to 
impose a veto on constitutional change under the seven and fifty 
formula. It would have to have the support of three of the smaller 
provinces, so there would be four provinces opposing. In other 
words, the seven provinces requirement would not be met. Or else 
British Columbia would have to go in with one of the bigger 
provinces and thus, get 50 per cent of the population opposing.
<P>
	The present proposal which does not change the Constitution is 
that if British Columbia opposed a constitutional change and it got 
one of the three western provinces to agree with it, then the federal 
government would not proceed with the constitutional change. 
Thus there is the so-called veto. The veto remains with the federal 
government but it would be exercised in that way. That is very 
important.
<P>
	There is a substantial change proposed with respect to the 
powers of British Columbia on the veto. That is why I thought it 
appropriate that the headline in the newspaper pointed out that B.C. 
and Quebec were getting changes and the two provinces were listed 
side by side.
<P>
	Second, when British Columbia gets to the position of having 50 
per cent of the population of western Canada, then of course it will 
essentially have the veto of its own in the same manner as Quebec 
and Ontario.
<P>
	At the present time British Columbia is about one-third the size 
of Ontario and about one-half the size of Quebec. In the not too 
distant future, because currently British Columbia has a about 44 
per cent of the population of western Canada, it will reach 50 per 
cent; when, I do not know. All I know is that over the last 15 years 
British Columbia has dramatically expanded with an increase in 
population of something approaching 29 per cent. It is important to 
recognize that there has been  substantial gains and this trajectory, 
this trend is likely to continue.
<P>
	I will turn to the point that has been raised that this will 
somehow prevent future constitutional change because there will 
always be provinces which will oppose it. Obviously we will never 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17059"> 17059 </A></B>
<P>
get constitutional change, for example, with respect to the Senate. 
To this I say I do not think we should sell future generations of 
Canadians so short. They will be capable of making intelligent 
decisions, just as we have been, just as our forefathers and mothers 
and all past generations have been.
<P>
	Why do we have to suggest that they will be unable to handle the 
matter of constitutional change to take care of the differences that I 
spoke about at the outset of my speech in an acceptable manner? 
Obviously they will be able to do that and we should trust them to 
be able to do that.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I am sharing my time with the hon. Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development. This is a responsible 
package which will help hold us as a country together and allow 
that diversity and development and ability to continue to remain 
the world's leading country in the future.
<P>
	We want a united Canada in British Columbia. We are willing to 
recognize that there have to be some trade-offs. Not everybody can 
get everything all the time. There has to be some recognition that to 
keep Canada going we cannot simply be a people who say no to 
everything.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	When we have a whole country to govern there must be 
trade-offs. This country we are trying to govern happens to be the 
best country in the world. I think it is well worthwhile to make the 
trade-offs to keep it together and that is what this package is all 
about.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before proceeding to the 
five minute question allocation to the hon. minister, it is my duty 
pursuant to Standing Order 38 to inform the House that the 
questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as 
follows: the hon. member for Jonquière-Committee chaired by 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs; the hon. member for Parry 
Sound-Muskoka-Confederation Life Insurance Company.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, according to 
the minister of National Revenue, the veto will improve the 
Canadian economy and, since Canada has a highly diversified 
make-up, this diversity will also help to improve the Canadian 
economy. He never mentioned that the most important aspect of 
this diversity is that Canada is made up of two nations. They never 
say this. He did not mention it.
<P>
	He also said that Canada is the best country in the world, that we 
are the envy of the world. I find it strange  to still hear that today 
when Canada has an 11 per cent unemployment rate and when there 
are more people on welfare in Quebec than at any other time in the 
history of our country. This is beginning to sound strange.
<P>
	He also said that the veto will help to amend the Constitution. I 
find that strange and utterly unacceptable since the more vetoes 
there are, the lesser the chance we have to amend the Constitution. 
To me, what the government is proposing and what the minister is 
saying all boil down to the fact that these numerous vetoes will 
mean that it will be impossible to amend the Constitution. It is as 
simple as that. This a trap that the federal government is setting for 
the Quebec government because, with this veto, it will be 
impossible to amend the Constitution.
<P>
	Would the minister please tell me how these vetoes will make it 
easier to amend the Constitution? As you know, it is quite the 
opposite. I would like him to prove that.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anderson:</B> Mr. Speaker, the first point made was that 
somehow the veto was linked to the economy. Let me put it this 
way. The economy will benefit dramatically from getting the 
wrangling of constitutional issues such as the referendum and 
separation out of the way. The economy will improve when we deal 
with these measures here in the House quickly and get back to the 
real agenda for all Canadians, whether they live in Quebec, 
Ontario, British Columbia or any other province. We must get the 
economy back in shape, get interest rates down and get the 
unemployed that the member's party has never linked before to the 
issue of constitutional development. Fortunately you now have and 
I think it is about time that you recognized the linkage between 
the-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I just want to remind hon. 
members to make their interventions through the Chair. Sometimes 
it can be very helpful.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anderson:</B> Mr. Speaker, you will note that the hon. member 
for the first time is linking these constitutional issues with 
unemployment. It is about time the Bloc recognized that because it 
is very important.
<P>
	The member goes on to say that there can be no change and 
vetoes will be there. Vetoes provinciate, he is right. Does he regret 
that we are giving or establishing a veto for Quebec so that the 
constant refrain that Quebec will be forced to accept changes from 
other parts of Canada will suddenly disappear as a complaint, a 
whine, a constant background noise that we hear from the Bloc 
Quebecois? Maybe that is the Bloc's concern. The issue is that if 
there are major changes the regions of the country, Quebec, 
Ontario, the maritimes, the west, or British Columbia do not want, 
then there is no point in proceeding with the changes because they 
are unacceptable to the overall.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17060"> 17060 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1705 )</B>
<P>
	Let us not get entirely hooked up on the issue of constitutional 
change. These are not constitutional measures. It is an example of 
the ingenuity of Canadians. It is an example of the ingenuity of the 
Prime Minister in overcoming problems without necessarily going 
back to the Constitution. If in the future people would like to see 
changes, administrative arrangements that would improve the 
system of government of Canada, I will bet that future generations 
of Canadians will be just as good as we are at arranging them 
outside as well as inside the Constitution.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to stand here 
today to enter this debate. As Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development, I will start by repeating what the Prime 
Minister said yesterday vis-à-vis aboriginal people:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As it concerns the aboriginal people of Canada, my government is clearly on 
record as respecting their aspirations. We recognize the unique legal position of 
aboriginal people, including the protection of aboriginal and treaty rights in the 
Canadian Constitution and the inherent right of self-government.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What does that mean? It means we must listen, and I address the 
separatists, when Grand Chief Matthew Coon-Come of the Cree 
says that ideological separatists will not treat them like cattle, 
moving them from one territory to the other. We must listen when 
the Inuit vote 95 per cent no and when the Crees vote 96.3 per cent 
no, and when the Montagnais vote 99 per cent no. We will listen.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has proposed that Quebec be a distinct 
society. He has proposed that we will make no constitutional 
change that affects Quebec without consent and he has delivered. I 
want to be here when the leader of the Bloc stands up and does not 
support this because it tells me his agenda is simple separation. It 
tells me that when he looks out his window to look at the French 
fact in Canada, the only thing he sees is his own reflection.
<P>
	Maybe I am losing it. I sit here day after day and see the hon. 
member for Bourassa who is from Chile. He is a political refugee 
who has come to this country. Oddly enough, this country Canada 
is an Iroquois name that means the village. Quebec is a Micmac 
name which means where the water overflows. The hon. member 
for Bourassa sits here and he debates and thinks in a British 
institution whether he should be called by a Mohawk name or an 
Iroquois name, while taxpayers pay his salary. If he thinks long 
enough and gets re-elected he will get a pension. Only in this 
country Canada would we be that tolerant. What a democracy, but 
that is a fact.
<P>
	Oddly enough, 15 years ago I gave my maiden speech in this 
House. I was sitting over there. The maiden speech is a member's 
most important speech. You come with your life experience and 
you want to say what is  important to you. My maiden speech was 
about the French Canadian fact in Canada, their contribution to the 
national character of this country. I had come off the CRTC where I 
sat with Rhéal Therrien who was the vice-chairman then. He would 
say to me: ``Ron, a country is not a piece of paper; it is a frame of 
mind''.
<P>
	It was so important to me to get my life experience on the record. 
As the member of Parliament for Sault Ste. Marie I spoke about the 
French Canadian fact in Canada. I spoke about the importance of 
biculturalism and multiculturalism. To that I would add the culture 
and the aspirations of the First Nations people of this country.
<P>
	You see me every day fighting for aboriginal rights, but I fought 
just as hard for French Canadian rights because I come from a part 
of this country with 700,000 franco-Ontarians. You do not want to 
even seem to acknowledge that there are places-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Colleagues, order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Irwin:</B> The Bloc does not want to even acknowledge that 
there are places like Dubreuilville, Chapleau, Timmins and 
Sudbury in Ontario where there are 700,000 francophones. What is 
going to happen to them? The Bloc does not care.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	We have lived with these people for generations. They are our 
family. They are our neighbours. We share our schools with them. 
Bloc members do not care. I am convinced of that. They do not care 
about the Acadians. They do not care about the franco-Manitobans. 
They only care about their agenda.
<P>
	Members of the Bloc talk about Cartier, Champlain and LaSalle. 
These are Canadian heroes and they are as important to my history 
as they are to any separatist. The Guy Lafleurs and the Cardinal 
Légers and the giant French Canadian community in industry and 
science and on the international stage. I remember them.
<P>
	I remind the separatists that except for a few months, in 25 years, 
in a quarter of a century of leading this country, all of the Prime 
Ministers have been from Quebec. I remind the Bloc that we are the 
party of Laurier who cared about French Canadians in Quebec, who 
cared about French Canadians outside Quebec, who cared about 
Canada on the world stage. If Laurier were looking down today at 
the leader of the Bloc, he would weep.
<P>
	I cannot say much more for the Reform members who thought 
Meech was too extensive. They opposed Charlottetown because it 
was too extensive. Today, I heard they cannot support this because 
it is a single page. I saw the way they voted on the aboriginal 
issues. I see how they treat the francophones here.
<P>
	I was shocked when the Reform Party that wants us to sing ``O 
Canada'' in this House said that 50 per cent plus one on a faulty, 
fraudulent question divides and  destroys this country. This 
generous, historical piece of property on this planet, and Reformers 
would destroy it with 50 per cent plus one. I used to find the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17061"> 17061 </A></B>
<P>
Reform interesting. I now think the Reform is dangerous if that is 
the philosophy its members are spreading across the country.
<P>
	I do not know how I can convince the Bloc members. What they 
are destroying is the spirit of the French Canadians. These are the 
people who were at the foothills of the Rockies, who explored 
Hudson's Bay, who opened up the Mississippi.
<P>
	I returned from Williams Lake, Alberta the day before yesterday. 
North of Williams Lake is the town of Quesnel, British Columbia. I 
just happened to be there. I remember this point from 15 years ago. 
Maybe it was part of the point I was going to speak on today. Who 
knows how the creator works. Fraser is the explorer who found the 
mighty Fraser. He got it named. He had a better publicist but those 
people, all nine of them, who paddled his canoe were French 
Canadians and the aboriginal people in that area showed him the 
way.
<P>
	That is my Canada. That is my concept of who we are. It has 
been 15 years that I have been prepared to fight in my area of 
northern Ontario for the aspirations of francophone minorities until 
the very day I die. I am prepared to stay here and reaffirm my 
commitment.
<P>
	When I vote personally on the resolution next week, I will not be 
doing it with timidity. I will not be doing it as the leader of the 
separatists say, because it is politically expedient. I will do it with 
pride because I believe it is important to my country.
<P>
	There were 150,000 people who came to the Montreal rally. 
There were French Canadian federalists there. It is a misconception 
when we say that the people in Quebec are separatists. There are 
staunch French Canadian federalists in Quebec and they were at 
that rally, but we were there together. Why? To say that we love this 
country.
<P>
	The leader of the separatist party mocks that love. He mocks it. 
He tries to destroy former Prime Minister Trudeau by mocking 
him. He tries every day by mockery to destroy our present Prime 
Minister. If Louis St. Laurent or Laurier were here today, the 
separatists would do the same thing. I see it every day. That is their 
agenda.
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	In my city of Sault Ste. Marie we had 2,000 steelworkers show 
up at an opening on a Friday or a Saturday. There were two days 
that went together. They took their hats off when we were singing 
the national anthem. It was amazing. I have never seen that. It was 
cold. The next day 1,000 people showed up in Sault Ste. Marie. 
They raised Canadians flags and Quebec flags. I looked down and 
saw young people there saying ``We love you, we want you to 
stay''. It was the first meeting  for these little kids, and they looked 
at me and said ``Do not destroy this country''. That is my Canada.
<P>
	The Haida people of B.C. have a creed. They say ``We do not 
inherit this land from our ancestors, we borrow it from our 
children''. That should be our creed.
<P>
	My forefathers came from Italy and Ireland. They were very 
poor. From the Irish I learned that we have to pay something back. I 
am the fourth politician in my family. My grandfather Alfred was a 
councilor; my uncle Tom was a mayor; my uncle Fred was a 
councilor; I was a mayor. They said ``You must pay something 
back''.
<P>
	From the Italian side, my grandmother, without even knowing 
the language, had to go from Rome by train, then by boat to Halifax 
all the way up to Sault Ste. Marie to meet my grandfather. She 
could not speak the language. She had eight kids. If she could be 
here and see today that her grandson is a member of Parliament she 
would be so proud. She taught me that this country is the best 
country in the world. It is.
<P>
	I do not know if there is an afterlife. I hope there is. If there is, I 
am sure that Laurier, my grandmother, and my grandfather are up 
there saying ``Go for it''. That is what we should be doing.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I just want to 
comment briefly on what the Minister of Indian Affairs said.
<P>
	First of all, there is something I do not understand although I 
have been here in Ottawa for a number of years. Why is the federal 
government using aboriginal peoples in many cases to discredit 
Quebecers? Perhaps he will admit it today, since only yesterday, his 
deputy minister admitted they would have to give aboriginal people 
in Quebec financial compensation for voting no.
<P>
	I also remember that a few years ago, they used aboriginal 
people to file claims in New York, to prevent the Great Whale 
project from going ahead.
<P>
	It is rather amazing to see the minister stroking aboriginal people 
today and trying to tell Quebecers that he loves them and wants to 
promote economic and social development, when meanwhile, the 
same minister is using aboriginal people to prevent Quebec from 
developing its hydro potential, for instance. Those are a few 
examples.
<P>
	Of course, it is not easy to prove all that, but anyone who is the 
least bit intelligent and has an interest in economic development 
and politics is aware of this, and Quebecers are very much so. 
Aboriginal people were consistently used to obstruct megaprojects 
in Quebec, probably to promote other sources of energy like 
uranium or western oil. This is atrocious.
<P>
	If the Minister of Indian Affairs thinks we can trust him, he is 
wrong. We have seen too much evidence to the contrary, and 
Quebecers are not easily fooled.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17062"> 17062 </A></B>
<P>
	He referred to the people in Sault Ste. Marie, and I agree with 
what he said and I want to thank them. I suppose they wanted to 
apologize for what they did two or three years ago, when they 
trampled Quebec's flag. I imagine he remembers that. Of course 
these people wanted to apologize, and I understand that and 
appreciate it. We remember very well what happened. It was on 
all the tv channels. The people of Sault Ste. Marie trampled the 
Quebec flag two or three years ago. Today, they want to apologize. 
We are pleased that they did, and we appreciate the gesture. But 
people should stop trying to fool us.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Irwin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would ask the hon. member to read 
my speeches and look at my record. I would not be here in the 
Prime Minister's cabinet if I in any way felt the way this member 
says I do.
<P>
	Why are they worried about the separatists in Quebec? It is 
because you have a premier talking about ``the ethnics''. You have 
a vice-premier, and you know what he did. You have a member in 
the Quebec legislature who calls the aboriginal people gypsies. You 
have Max Gros-Louis, chief of the Hurons, who is saying the 
separatists are racist.
<P>
	The separatists are living a lie. They say that Canada is divisible 
but not Quebec. That is a lie. There is such a thing as the 1898 line. 
There is such a thing as territorial integrity. There is such a thing as 
Cree territory, Mohawk territory, Abenakis territory, Micmac 
territory. Every time the separatists put that lie out, this minister is 
going to repeat what I said in Quebec at every house, at the UN and 
at Geneva.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I must now resume debate. 
Having passed, I believe, the five hours of debate, we now go to the 
next stage of debate, which is ten minutes without questions or 
comments.
<P>
	If I might ask the House for its co-operation, it is 5.23 p.m. and 
the hon. member for Calgary Southeast would be given a full ten 
minutes. I would not see the clock at 5.30 p.m. until three minutes 
past, so she would have her full ten minutes.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the consent of the House on that suggestion.
<P>
	The last thing I heard last night before I went to sleep was Jason 
Moscovitz on ``The National'' talking about the dreariness of this 
debate and how we were again looking at the discussion that had 
come up during Meech and the Charlottetown accord. There was a 
dreariness in all of this discussion because the House was mostly 
empty, the galleries were devoid of people, and there was  no one 
around with any passion or enthusiasm to talk about the matter of 
Canada.
<P>
	When I woke up this morning I thought I wanted to capture some 
of that in what I have to say today because I think it is important we 
remember what brought us here. I thought I would like to direct my 
comments from where I sit. Where I sit in the House of Commons 
is a very special place for me, because I have watched for two years 
the House of Commons work together, pull together when we 
needed to and have debates that were reasoned.
<P>
	Over time something has happened. Now we have this 
rancorous, bitter exchange across the floor of the House of 
Commons. I wondered about that as I reflected on the throne 
speech of January 1994. I recall what the leader of the official 
opposition said that day about his responsibility as an opposition 
party: ``We intend to take these responsibilities seriously and we 
will do so loyally, correctly, and with due resolve. We know that is 
what Quebecers expect us to do, and they would never forgive us if 
we deviated from this path''.
<P>
	Although that was a very tough foreshadowing of this debate 
today, I believe that what the hon. Leader of the Opposition was 
saying that day was that he wanted to work within a democratic 
environment for the good of his constituents and for the rest of 
Canada. His vision was one we should never forget to respect, 
because his vision is his own vision, as the Prime Minister's vision 
is his vision and the leadership of our party carries our vision.
<P>
	None of us respect that. We have forgotten that we should 
co-operate and that our professional lives are within these walls. 
The rhetoric we hurl across the floor has become meaningless. No 
wonder everyone feels so embittered.
<P>
	On that day the Prime Minister said: ``By working 
co-operatively to create economic opportunity, by restoring 
common sense to our public finances, by rebuilding a sense of 
integrity in government, and by pursuing a positive and innovative 
agenda for our society, my ministers are convinced that Canadian 
unity will be preserved and enhanced''. Where have we come from 
that day to today, when we are talking about constitutional 
amendments, constitutional veto, distinct society? He made a 
promise to Canadians two years ago that it would not be that way in 
the House of Commons.
<P>
	Our leader, prior to the election, said on October 12, 1993: ``I 
personally believe that the Canadian people have the capacity and 
the desire to define not only what this election should be about, but 
what kind of Canada they want for themselves and for their 
children for the 21st century. In other words, I believe it is possible 
for a new vision of Canada itself to emerge from the bottom up if 
we begin to truly let the people speak their hearts and minds''.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="17063"> 17063 </A></B>
<P>
	We came here as a different party with a different vision. We 
never were told that the difference was a good thing; we were 
always told it was bad. No one could define that difference in 
terms of a new idea, a new vision, a different way of looking at 
this country. We were always told we were bad. We were poor 
performers in the House of Commons. The press gallery said that 
our ideas were poor. How could a bunch of hayseeds or rednecks 
from the west ever have a good idea to put forward? It was our 
vision and it should have been respected in that context, but it 
never was. Part of the reason it never was is why we are here today 
debating constitutional matters and distinct society.
<P>
	I ask all members to remember why we are here. Our 
constituents sent us here. We have forgotten about that 
representation. We are not simply preparing for an election in 
1997; we are renewing and retooling Canada for 2050. That is 
something we absolutely must not lose sight of in this debate, that 
we are retooling our vision for this country for the next 
millennium, for our children and for their children. We are really 
leaving them with one hell of a mess. Excuse my language.
<P>
	The issue of unity does not reside in a unity committee, a small 
committee with a small number of people who have small ideas. 
Those ideas are going to capture the hearts and minds of the 
country if they go out to the people. It is the people of the country 
who are going to make the difference. They are the ones who drive 
the engine and the heart of Canada. We can sit here and debate this 
issue until we are all white with exhaustion and fatigue and we can 
be embittered. But I believe we have a country that is worth 
working together for.
<P>
	It must be that westerners understand there is an opportunity to 
become involved in a debate, but so too must Quebecers and 
easterners recognize there is an opportunity for us all to debate. It 
should be taken out of the House of Commons and placed into the 
hands of the people of Canada.
<P>
	Eugene Forsey wrote in his memoirs: ``I have faith that 
Canadians, both English-speaking and French-speaking-would be 
able to face the future united-`One equal temper of heroic 
hearts<I>-strong in will</I> To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield'''. 
That is what we must do in the House. The bitter rhetoric we hear 
every day must give way at some point to argument that is 
reasoned, to ideas that are new, to a vision that will take us into the 
next millennium. My fear is that we are not moving in a direction 
whereby we are recognizing one another as colleagues and as 
Canadians.
<P>
	The hon. member of the official opposition has become a very 
embittered politician. I have seen that over two years and from 
where I sit it is sad to see.
<P>
	The Prime Minister, this man who had the hopes, hearts and 
tremendous support of Canadian people, has become shrivelled in 
his ideas, in his demeanour and in  his approach to the country. We 
are back to this dreary Meech and Charlottetown debate.
<P>
	I am not saying that the Reform Party has all the answers, but 
until we start talking together as Canadians even the best of visions 
will have no place to go but in its own entrenched little part of a 
balkanized country. It is my hope and prayer that will not happen.
<P>
	I cannot support the bill because it would concentrate the power 
in the hands of governments and not of Canadians. I remember why 
I was put here by my electors in Calgary Southeast. It was to carry 
their hopes, their dreams and their visions for a Canada into the 
third millennium.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 5.30 p.m. the House 
will now proceed to the consideration of Private Members' 
Business as listed on today's Order Paper.

OBTAINED BY CERTAIN CORPORATIONS ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from October 26 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-315, an act to complement the present laws of 
Canada that protect the privacy of individuals with respect to 
personal information about themselves obtained by certain 
corporations, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak in the House tonight on an issue of 
grave importance, the protection of personal information. I am 
pleased to participate in the debate on Bill C-315, an act that will 
help to protect the privacy of Canadians. Since Bill C-315 was last 
in the House much has happened on the issue. Several groups have 
called for federal government action to protect the personal 
information of Canadians.
<P>
	First, the Canadian Standards Association has expanded on its 
voluntary privacy codes and its desire for implementation of those 
codes.
<P>
	Second, the Public Interest Advocacy Centre based in Ottawa 
released a document entitled ``Surveying Boundaries: Canadians 
and their Personal Information''.
<P>
	Third, the Information Advisory Council established by the 
Minister of Industry continues to push for recognition of its privacy 
recommendations.
<P>
	The protection of personal information is a serious concern for 
all Canadians. If we do not begin to address the unauthorized 
collection and exchange of personal information about 
unsuspecting Canadians now, we may not be able to stop it at all in 
the future.
<P>
	Bill C-315 gives us the opportunity to counter the invasion of 
personal privacy before it gets out of control.  New technology and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17064"> 17064 </A></B>
<P>
universal access to the Internet have accelerated the problem and 
immediate government action is critical.
<P>
	I quote from <I>The Economist</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Individually, most new technologies are introduced for perfectly benign 
motives. Their cumulative effect, however, is to cast a shadow over personal 
privacy. Is it really acceptable for most of your actions, even the most mundane, 
to be recorded and then sold to the highest bidder? Most people take their 
privacy for granted but are outraged when it is breached.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The growth of computer technology makes tasks easier for 
Canadians, but at what cost? I am very concerned that Canadians 
have their privacy compromised every day without their 
knowledge. Companies routinely collect information about them 
every time they use a credit card, buy something over the phone or 
subscribe to a magazine.
<P>
	An Industry Canada paper released in October 1994 stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>While each technology brings different capabilities, they all contribute to a 
completely unprecedented capacity for the surveillance of every man, woman 
and child, whether as a customer, student, employee, patient, taxpayer, or 
recipient of government services. It is this growing trend for information 
systems to place limits on our freedom, on our life's potential, that privacy 
advocates and science fiction writers alike find utterly chilling.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	Just what will Bill C-315 do? It specifically tries to curb the 
collection and exchange of personal information. This could 
include names and phone numbers, business addresses and phone 
numbers, any identifiable physical characteristic, religion, national 
or ethnic origin, age or other information about education or 
financial history. The information is recorded in many ways: 
electronically such as on a floppy or hard disk, manually on paper 
or microfilm, or virtually such as in computer memory or an 
electronic network.
<P>
	Bill C-315 would require all companies covered by the Canada 
Labour Code to abide by some very strict privacy protection 
guidelines. Before selling any list containing an individual's 
personal information, the person would be sent a notice that, first, 
personal information about the individual as listed in the notice is 
held by the company; second, permission is needed to keep the 
person's name on the list; and, third, the person shall be told his or 
her name can be removed at any time at no cost.
<P>
	In addition, any corporation using a purchased list shall send to 
everyone on the list a notice containing the source of the 
information, a description of the information held and a statement 
outlining how individuals can have their information removed. 
Companies receiving a removal request must comply within 10 
days and confirm with the individuals that their requests have been 
acted on.
<P>
	Non-compliance will result in a summary conviction. For a first 
offence a company or individual would face a fine of up to $5,000. 
A repeat offence could double the maximum fine to $10,000. 
Charges would have to be laid within one year of the offence.
<P>
	The member for Cariboo-Chilcotin who introduced the bill 
would be amenable to increasing the sentences if the industry 
committee studying the bill believed that they are too weak. It 
might also look at strengthening the bill to prevent the rental of 
information lists.
<P>
	In September the Canadian Standards Association released a set 
of privacy codes after wide consultation with several agencies and 
associations. It sought to develop its code at a time when there was 
growing debate about the range of innovative approaches to the 
protection of personal data on the information highway.
<P>
	There is one big problem with the code. Adherence is strictly 
voluntary. While the code may be good, it is merely a band-aid 
solution and has no teeth to protect consumers from greedy 
companies with no regard for their personal privacy. By the 
association's own admission none of the codes has any explicit 
statutory force in contrast with the privacy codes developed under 
the mandate of legislation and the oversight of a data protection 
agency.
<P>
	In addition, the association also admits that ultimately the 
success of the CSA model code will depend on the various 
incentives that might operate to encourage registration. Several are 
noted and discussed: moral suasion, the desire to avoid adverse 
publicity and the use of the privacy standard for competitive 
advantage.
<P>
	Is this realistic? Companies that profit from a $300 million a 
year industry will hardly be overcome with moral suasion or a 
concern about adverse publicity. While the CSA code may 
convince some organizations to operate more responsibly, most 
organizations will only use it when it is convenient for them or if 
they must comply.
<P>
	The CSA notes that in New Zealand and the Netherlands where 
privacy codes have been complemented by statutory regulation, 
there is more effective protection of their citizens. In Canada 
combining the CSA's code with the legislative teeth of Bill C-315 
will provide consumers with real privacy protection.
<P>
	The Public Interest Advocacy Centre is a non-profit group that is 
also focused on the protection of personal information. In a recent 
paper it investigated whether there is a problem. It found that 76 
per cent of Canadians believe they have less control over their 
personal information than they did 10 years ago; 95 per cent of 
Canadians want to be informed about collection processes and 
about the uses to which their personal information may be put; 94 
per cent insist permission be sought and given before any informa-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17065"> 17065 </A></B>
<P>
tion is passed on to  another organization; and 86 per cent want to 
understand how new technology can affect their personal privacy. 
It is clear from the research done by the organization that 
Canadians are very concerned about their privacy.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-315 would establish statutory protection without the 
requirement for any new taxes. It is the missing link advocates are 
calling for. The member for Cariboo-Chilcotin has assured me he 
would support changes the industry committee might suggest when 
it examines the bill. We must act soon. Every day we dawdle, more 
personal information about private citizens will be collected and 
sold.
<P>
	I conclude with a quote from a book called ``A Consumer's 
Survival Guide to a Cashless World'':
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As consumers we often feel powerless to change the status quo, but public 
pressure can succeed when enough people get excited about practices they feel 
to be wrong or unfair. The only way it will change is for us as consumers and 
citizens to demand fuller disclosure, stronger privacy protections and better 
security procedures.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We can wait no longer. Consumers and citizens want and need to 
see changes to the rules that protect personal information. Bill 
C-315 is an answer to a concern that each and every member of 
Parliament shares with his or her constituents. I urge the House to 
support the bill so we can begin to protect the personal privacy of 
all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Winnipeg St. James, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when Bill C-315 was first debated in the House in the month of 
October I must say I was impressed with the information the hon. 
member brought to us in support of the proposed bill. I understand 
the original complaint brought to the hon. member for 
Cariboo-Chilcotin was from an individual who found himself on 
the mailing list for pornographic materials and was unable to stop 
the material from arriving. While this may not be the most 
damaging type of abuse of personal information, many Canadians 
would agree it is one of the most annoying and can leave people 
feeling helpless and frustrated.
<P>
	The bill the hon. member has put forward, however, would do 
nothing to stop this kind of privacy invasion. While I share the 
concerns expressed by the Reform Party about this kind of abuse, if 
Parliament is to intervene with new legislation, we had better be 
sure we are doing something which actually fixes the problem.
<P>
	Here are some of the flaws in Bill C-315. First, it would apply 
only to corporations. Many operators who do this kind of thing are 
individuals or small partnerships and would not be covered by the 
legislation.
<P>
	Second, it applies only to the narrow range of corporations 
engaging in a federally regulated activity. This would include those 
in the banking,  telecommunications and broadcast industries but 
not small entrepreneurs.
<P>
	Third, it does nothing to solve the problem of operators setting 
up outside our jurisdiction, such as across the U.S. border.
<P>
	Fourth, it addresses only the issue of people's names appearing 
on lists or nominative lists, as the practice is referred to in the 
Quebec privacy legislation that covers the private sector.
<P>
	Technologies are changing and developing quickly these days. 
Information is being collected and messaged in new and different 
ways. It may soon be out of date to talk about lists because 
information travels easily and is gathered automatically. It is no 
longer necessary to hand someone a computer tape to trade 
information.
<P>
	In addressing the protection of personal privacy we ought to talk 
about the use of personal information in the broadest possible 
ways. The rules we come up with should address every sector of the 
economy, not only the direct marketing industry.
<P>
	Instead of working on the bill we should support the work that 
has been ongoing for several years at the Canadian Standards 
Association, the CSA. The consensus committee passed a model 
privacy code in September of this year, the result of three years of 
work in a committee with representation of industry, consumers 
and federal and provincial governments.
<P>
	This code of fair information practices is soon to be published as 
a national standard for Canada. This initiative has the support of a 
broad range of private sector organizations including the Canadian 
Direct Marketing Association.
<P>
<B>(1745 )</B>
<P>
	In fact, on October 3 of this year the president of the Canadian 
Direct Marketing Association called on the Minister of Industry to 
introduce legislation in the House that would use the CSA standard 
as the basis for legislation federally and to encourage the provinces 
of Canada to do the same in their jurisdictions.
<P>
	I understand that the issue is being studied by the departments of 
industry and justice with a view to developing solutions that will 
work for the protection of personal information in all sectors of the 
economy and across the country. This is a huge and complex issue 
because the increasing availability and use of personal information 
and consumer profiles to target service delivery affects virtually 
every sector of the economy in some way or the other.
<P>
	The protection of personal privacy was identified as a key 
priority early in 1994 when my colleague, the Minister of Industry, 
established the Information Highway Advisory Council to advise 
him how to make the most of the new possibilities brought to us by 
the communication networks. The council studied the issue,  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17066"> 17066 </A></B>
<P>
consulted experts and produced a number of recommendations on 
privacy.
<P>
	I will read them now. First, the federal government should act to 
ensure privacy protection on the information highway. This 
protection shall embody all principles of fair information practices 
contained in the Canadian Standards Association draft model code 
for the protection of personal information. To this end, the federal 
government should continue to participate in the development and 
implementation of effective national voluntary standards based on 
this model code.
<P>
	Second, the federal government must take leadership in the 
implementation of these principles through the following actions: 
in co-operation with other levels of government that share 
responsibility for various sectors of activity on the information 
highway, it should establish a federal-provincial-territorial 
working group to implement the privacy principles in all 
jurisdictions.
<P>
	It should create a level playing field for the protection of 
personal information on the information highway by developing 
and implementing a flexible legislative framework for both public 
and private sectors. Legislation would require sectors or 
organizations to meet the standard of the CSA model code, while 
allowing the flexibility to determine how they will refine their own 
codes.
<P>
	In co-operation with the CSA working group on privacy, and 
other interested parties, it should study the development of 
effective oversight and enforcement mechanisms; establish a 
working group to co-ordinate the development, demonstration and 
application of privacy enhancing technologies for the provision of 
government services and information; update and harmonize 
appropriate privacy protection policies, legislation and guidelines 
applicable to its own operations and to the delivery of government 
services and information.
<P>
	Third, Industry Canada should establish a working group that 
includes representation from the private, provincial and federal 
governments and consumer organizations for the purpose of 
increasing public awareness and understanding about privacy 
issues and personal privacy rights through the preparation and 
dissemination of educational materials and encourage the CSA to 
advance its privacy standard in international standards fora.
<P>
	There are several other recommendations on encryption, 
educational and health records but I will not take up more time to 
read them. As members can plainly see, this is already a tall order 
that the advisory council for the information highway has presented 
to my colleague, the hon. Minister of Industry. I know the 
Department of Industry is engaged in discussions with other 
departments involved in the privacy issue, notably the Department 
of Justice.
<P>
	This is a complex issue. Serious work has already been 
undertaken by the government to address the problem. I believe we 
should wait until the Minister of Industry has studied the 
recommendations and can report to us on progress.
<P>
	Finally, we need more protection for personal information than 
is offered by Bill C-315. I say we should get on with the work and 
not take a detour down this path.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy to participate in this debate on the 
bill tabled in this House by our colleague, the hon. member for 
Cariboo-Chilcotin, which is aimed at protecting the privacy of 
individuals with respect to personal information about themselves 
obtained from certain corporations.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	This is a very important issue in the world in which we live, an 
issue that, too often, is not taken seriously but that has major 
consequences in people's lives.
<P>
	It is no secret that just about any personal information is now 
available for all kinds of purposes to almost any individual or 
corporation wishing to obtain this information. In the business 
world, everyone knows that our personal credit records can be put 
under the microscope by all kinds of institutions interested in 
digging into our past. Everyone also knows that, more often than 
not, information on our lifestyles and consumption patterns falls 
into the hands of all kinds of individuals and corporations whose 
goals may be questionable, without most governments being 
concerned about it.
<P>
	In this regard, I say right off the bat that although the bill tabled 
by our Reform colleague does not, as the hon. member for 
Winnipeg St. James just pointed out, meet all our expectations with 
respect to this problem, it places it in the public domain and urges 
the federal government, which so far has been negligent in this 
area, to examine the problem and, hopefully, come up with more 
restrictive legislation in the near future.
<P>
	What I also like about our Reform colleague's initiative is that 
he refers to the Quebec legislation. In introducing his bill, he 
referred to the fact that, in 1994, Quebec enacted legislation to 
protect personal information not only from public institutions but 
also from private enterprise. This legislation was Bill 68, which, as 
I mentioned, was enacted in 1994.
<P>
	I said earlier that Bill C-315 is quite commendable as far as its 
goals are concerned, but that it has flaws that should be pointed out. 
First of all, the bill refers to the sale of information. Any federally 
registered company wishing to sell information on a group of 
individuals would have to notify each of these individuals of its  
intention and of the personal information in its possession, and to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17067"> 17067 </A></B>
<P>
obtain his or her consent. Never can we in any way prevent 
companies from providing information or exchanging lists, 
provided the lists are not actually sold.
<P>
	So, there is some kind of a loophole there that should be looked 
at and plugged if at all possible. There is also, as I said earlier, the 
requirement to send a notice concerning the sale of any list of 
individuals. But, even if this bill is passed, nothing will stop 
companies from selling information on one individual at a time.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	These two examples show that there are deficiencies in the bill 
put forward by our friend from the Reform Party, deficiencies that 
must not be overlooked. As the hon. member from the Liberal 
Party suggested earlier, perhaps in a future bill we can take all of 
this into account and come up with ways to prevent this kind of 
problems.
<P>
	Another point I wanted to raise is the small fines for 
non-compliance. The bill provides for fines of $5,000 to $10,000. I 
was listening to the hon. member from the Reform Party who spoke 
before me talk about the huge profits generated by the sale of this 
kind of information. It stands to reason that imposing such small 
fines is not likely to discourage companies from breaking the law. 
We should therefore make sure that fines are much larger, stiffer.
<P>
	Another deficiency of this bill concerns the type of personal 
information covered by the act. A full list, a rather long list in fact, 
can be found in clause 2 of the bill. Again, it is not quite complete.
<P>
	The problem in making a list is that you can forget to include 
major elements. I would like to point out that there is no mention, 
in this list, of political affiliation. I gather that this information is 
not considered personal in nature. Criminal record, work 
experience, place of birth, sexual orientation and mother tongue are 
not included or listed either in clause 2 of the bill, while I would 
think this information as strictly personal information that needs to 
be protected under a bill like this one.
<P>
	To conclude, as I said at the outset, although the bill contains 
major deficiencies, it at least has the merit of being a first. It is a 
step in the right direction, as the first piece of legislation 
introduced by the federal government to protect personal 
information.
<P>
	This debate is also an opportunity to alert the public to the real 
danger of not having legislation on the subject. In a way, as limited 
as its scope may be, it is difficult not to support this bill.
<P>
	I would like to point out, since our colleague from the Reform 
Party referred to the Quebec legislation, that the latter is much 
more meaningful and precise. I would hope that when this act, if 
passed of course, is amended  in the future, we should be able to 
refer to the Quebec legislation to ensure that personal information 
is better protected.
<P>
	This goes to show, once again, if you do not mind my saying so 
without a trace of parochial spirit, that in many areas like this one, 
Quebec's know-how can easily be exported. People are welcome to 
refer to our legislation; they will not be disappointed.
<P>
	I will close on this, just adding that the Bloc Quebecois supports 
the bill put forward by our colleague from the Reform Party.
<P>
<B>(1800 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Raymond Bonin (Nickel Belt, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, while I 
agree with the spirit of Bill C-315, I am not in a position to support 
its content, which I find narrow and burdensome, particularly in 
consideration of the much broader and flexible measures presently 
being looked at.
<P>
	Bill C-315 has a narrow focus when broad based measures are 
needed to ensure the level playing field for industry while 
protecting the privacy of Canadians. With advances in information 
and telecommunication technologies, the privacy of consumers is 
at risk, but this bill does not provide the type of broad based 
protection which is necessary.
<P>
	As part of a global economy, we can expect that cross-border 
consumer transactions will increase and with them a related growth 
in direct to home sales of the type which make regular use of 
mailing lists in order to gain access into the homes of Canadians.
<P>
	Mailing lists, when combined with other transaction related 
databases such as credit ratings and financial accounts, can be 
assembled into profiles of individuals. These records can cross 
national borders, be exchanged, resold, reused or integrated with 
other databases, often without consent or remuneration, for 
purposes unrelated to those for which the data were originally 
collected.
<P>
	Consumers are frustrated and angry when subjected to perceived 
intrusions by commercial interests into their personal domain. 
Personal information privacy is an issue of considerable 
importance to Canadians as has been revealed by numerous surveys 
in recent years.
<P>
	Bill C-315 has a very narrow focus. It applies only to the sale of 
lists containing personal information when in reality the normal 
business practice is the rental of such lists. The bill focuses 
narrowly on lists when in fact a vast amount of personal data can be 
blended and put together from the type of consumer transactional 
data currently exchanged between firms or within large 
organizations.
<P>
	The bill only applies to federal corporations when in fact mailing 
lists and other information is often transferred between provincial 
corporations, individual proprietorships and partnerships.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17068"> 17068 </A></B>
<P>
	If passed, the result would not be a level playing field of clear 
and consistent privacy rules applying to all sectors, but rather a 
patchwork quilt of uneven privacy obligations from sector to 
sector, firm to firm and jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
<P>
	Other initiatives currently under way might provide a better 
approach. We are currently studying these options. Most notable is 
the Canadian Standards Association model privacy code. The CSA 
code sets out 10 principles governing how personal information 
should be collected, retained, kept up to date, used and disclosed by 
the private sector.
<P>
	Adoption of the code by firms using mailing lists would tend to 
ensure that consumers are informed of the existence of such lists, 
given the opportunity to consent to their use and verify their 
accuracy.
<P>
	The CSA code is voluntary, but I propose and support that it 
become the basis for flexible framework legislation. The Canadian 
Direct Marketing Association, the Information Highway Advisory 
Council and Canada's privacy commissioner all agree. The CSA 
model privacy code represents a potential basis for the 
development of flexible national standards.
<P>
	I agree with the spirit of Bill C-315 and applaud the efforts of the 
hon. member in this regard. However, I am not in a position to 
support its contents as I find it too narrow, particularly in 
consideration of the much broader, flexible and less costly 
measures available to us.
<P>
	I will continue to work to convince the government to introduce 
broad based and enforceable privacy protection for Canadians' 
personal and financial information in the marketplace. I feel that 
such legislation is important to my constituents. It is important to 
all Canadians. The legislation that we can accept must be 
enforceable, must have teeth and must apply to institutions like 
banks. It must also consider new technology like the Internet.
<P>
	I believe that this bill is too narrow and does not create a 
comprehensive framework to deal with the real privacy concerns of 
all Canadians. I commend the hon. member for his efforts but I fear 
that his bill does not go far enough.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on this bill. I must start off by saying that I 
applaud this initiative on the part of my colleague and can see the 
good intentions behind it. I do, however, also believe, having seen 
the criticisms of it, that it contains certain weaknesses which I 
would like to point out. At the same time, I would like to review the 
entire matter, propose some potential solutions, and point out why 
it will be very difficult to proceed with such a bill.
<P>
	As I have said, this is a well intentioned bill but one with a 
number of weaknesses which have already been described by a 
number of my party colleagues and by at least one member of the 
opposition.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I believe that if we were to send this bill to committee and try to 
correct it we might lose some significant time trying to redirect an 
approach which some people would believe is too narrow to 
address all of the concerns Canadians continue to express about the 
protection of their privacy. That is not for me to decide by myself. 
Let me share with the House why.
<P>
	Every time we open a newspaper we see another story about the 
abuse of personal information with the potential that new 
technology has to invade our privacy and provide surveillance of 
our every movement. Even the chairman of Microsoft, Bill Gates, 
in an article which appeared in the Ottawa <I>Sun</I> on September 20 of 
this year pointed out the need for government action and indeed 
legislation to protect privacy in the face of new technologies which 
he would be well placed to understand.
<P>
	He used the example of software programs which would replace 
human travel agents and track customers' tastes and preferences to 
give the best possible service.
<P>
	He states in the last two paragraphs of that article: ``The 
marketplace may be able to resolve some of these issues. For 
example, customers may learn to avoid travel agencies that don't 
share personal profiles, or that share them too freely''.
<P>
	``But the marketplace won't resolve every privacy issue. Neither 
will technology. What's needed is a great deal of unrushed debate, 
leading to intelligent public policies''.
<P>
	I doubt that these new automated travel agents would be covered 
by Bill C-315 and we need to consider how serious a problem this 
might be.
<P>
	I applaud the hon. member for bringing the issue of privacy 
protection to the attention of Parliament. I believe that he has done 
what he ought to do. I believe that we could follow Mr. Gates' 
advice and start a process of unrushed debate leading to intelligent, 
profound public discussion on a policy that will meet the needs of 
today's society, not necessarily by accepting this bill and fixing it 
but by building on the work that has been done in Canada where we 
have among other initiatives the first data protection legislation in 
North America to cover the private sector. I refer to Bill 68 in the 
province of Quebec.
<P>
	We need a far more comprehensive approach to these problems. 
The government has been doing the groundwork necessary to 
provide greater privacy protection. I would like to talk a bit about 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17069"> 17069 </A></B>
<P>
this work and  about a better way perhaps to address the hon. 
member's concerns.
<P>
	My first point is that the Canadian Standards Association model 
privacy code provides a basis for a broad based approach to privacy 
protection.
<P>
	The Information Highway Advisory Council has recommended 
to the government that it bring in flexible framework legislation 
based on this code and that it work with the provinces to find a way 
to get a standard of fair information practices incorporated in the 
areas where it does not have jurisdiction.
<P>
	On October 3 the Canadian Direct Marketing Association 
echoed this, calling on my colleague, the Minister of Industry, as 
minister responsible for consumer affairs, to table framework 
privacy legislation in the House of Commons. The CDMA has been 
a key player in the development of this national standard for the 
protection of privacy under the aegis of the Canadian Standards 
Association. I applaud not only its efforts in helping to develop this 
code but the leadership that it has shown in recognizing the merits 
of the legislation.
<P>
	The House will recognize that it is not often that industry calls 
for more legislation. I think this action underlines the importance 
of privacy in the minds of consumers and the need for us to look at 
it carefully in all of its aspects. In particular, I believe that we must 
respect both the rights of the citizen and the information needs of 
industry when we think of legislation.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	There are legitimate needs for personal information gathering in 
each sector. Banks need to gather information to assess credit risk, 
medical researchers need to conduct long term health studies to 
determine the effects of drugs, environmental concerns and health 
practices. Direct marketers do not want to send special offers for 
lawn mowers to folks who live in apartment buildings. Market 
research helps us as a society to tailor product innovations to the 
needs of consumers. These are good uses of personal information 
and we do not want to shut down the use of personal information.
<P>
	Bill C-315 could shut down federally incorporated businesses 
doing direct marketing through the use of lists because while the 
bill speaks of obtaining the consent of each consumer, which 
sounds to be a reasonable enough option, the administrative burden 
and liability involved in this process would cause businesses to 
drop the activity altogether in a number of cases.
<P>
	This may or may not be the goal of the hon. member but I believe 
both consumers and Canadian business deserve a more careful 
approach to the problem and one in which they can actually 
participate.
<P>
	The Information Highway Advisory Council made a number of 
other recommendations concerning the protection of personal 
information, including the use of  technologies which protect 
privacy. It called for the banning of scanning devices which 
monitor cellular transmissions. It called on the federal government 
to form a federal-provincial-territorial working group to start a 
dialogue about some of these important issues and work together 
for harmonized solutions. It called for the CSA to continue its work 
and for the consensus group which crafted the model privacy code 
to work together to develop meaningful oversight.
<P>
	These are all thoughtful suggestions from a group of experts who 
took the time to study the issue in some significant depth. I believe 
that we should wait for the government response to these 
recommendations before we jump the gun and attempt to start 
legislating privacy protection.
<P>
	As I come to the end of my remarks, I would like to share with 
the House a letter which was given to me that I think speaks to the 
issue. It is as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Please share the following message with government MPs who will be 
speaking today on Bill C-315.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Members of the Canadian Direct Marketing Association agree that a 
legislated comprehensive set of privacy principles is needed to guide business 
in their activities to respect the rights of the individual. There is an excellent 
model to accomplish this in the 10 principles of the new code for the protection 
of personal information of the Canadian Standards Association.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The current bill before Parliament, Bill C-315, while formatted with the best 
of intentions, is so fundamentally flawed that it cannot be saved by any 
amendments. The bill would not accomplish the fundamental purpose of 
protecting personal privacy; would seriously limit an individuals' freedom of 
choice and would be an unnecessary and destructive interference in the 
marketplace.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>CDMA is very concerned that if this bill is allowed to proceed to committee, 
the consensus among business, consumer groups and government which 
produced the CSA code after two years of hard work and compromise, will 
entirely collapse.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is signed, John Gustavson, President and Chief Executive 
Officer.
<P>
	It is up to the members now to decide how to proceed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to Bill C-315. I 
should begin my complimenting the hon. member for having put 
the bill before the House. I believe that its intent is good and that 
the idea of trying to protect consumers and ensure that the personal 
information we supply as individuals to corporations and other 
entities is not just used willy-nilly in whatever fashion somebody 
other than an individual may decide.
<P>
<B>(1815 )</B>
<P>
	It no doubt is disconcerting for consumers to go to large 
institutions and buy a product or get a service of some sort and all 
of a sudden appearing in their mailboxes the next month, and 
oftentimes for the next decade, are solicitations of one sort or 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17070"> 17070 </A></B>
<P>
another. Obviously consumers are not anxious to see that happen. 
They are  not anxious to have that practice continue to the extent it 
obviously is. In that respect, I want to compliment the hon. member 
for putting together a private member's bill to deal with that.
<P>
	The bill and the process of correcting the problem needs to go 
beyond the recommendations that are in front of us here today. We 
need to continue a process that has already been undertaken by the 
government. There is a consultative process that many of my 
colleagues have talked about previously in the House, where the 
industry department is working on this issue and in coming up with 
the solution is trying to be as comprehensive as possible to deal 
with this problem in a way that finds a good workable solution and 
finds a solution in a way that is not going to by itself create a 
burden for the consumer, is not going to create new government 
bureaucracy, is not going to result in a situation where adherence to 
the new rules will be so expensive that invariably and inevitably 
that kind of increased expense would be passed on to the consumer.
<P>
	In reviewing the bill, there are a couple of places where I think 
we need to step back and ensure the problem is dealt with more 
comprehensively. As has been mentioned by a number of 
government speakers previously, one of the concerns with the bill 
in the format it is being presented to the House is that the definition 
of personal information is too narrow. We want to make sure that 
when we address the issue of privacy and confidentiality we do it in 
as broad a manner as possible and capture as many of the situations 
that are occurring out there as possible. We do not want to deal with 
this piecemeal, where we deal with one aspect of the problem and 
then have to come back and deal with others. We want to make sure 
that the definition of personal information is indeed as broad as 
possible.
<P>
	We also want to make sure that in solving the problem we do not 
create a new problem. I know the hon. members of the third party 
would agree with me that the last thing we want to do is create a 
new regulatory regime, a new regulatory infrastructure that places 
an enormous burden on businesses. The way this bill is drawn up 
and the amount of consultation and notification that would have to 
take place when we are trying to delete specific information would 
create an enormous burden for individual businesses. There is 
probably a more efficient way to do it, a way that would not create 
quite as much of a workload and create such additional burdens on 
the private sector.
<P>
	In coming up with the solution for the problem in this particular 
bill, it is going to call for a whole new amount of direct mailing as 
you ask for permission from the consumer to use their particular 
name. If the list is being sold then people have to write to the 
consumer and ask for their permission and then they have to write 
back. That seems like a very difficult and cumbersome type of 
situation.
<P>
	There is a concern about capturing a very narrow portion of the 
market, those corporations that are federally incorporated. 
Obviously there are a lot of other entities that exchange and use 
information, right from an individual through partnerships, 
provincially incorporated entities.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	It is important we ensure we have as broad a scope as possible in 
the bill. As I mentioned earlier, we have to ensure we address as 
vast a range as possible of consumer privacy concerns. I really 
believe we have to deal with this problem in as comprehensive a 
manner as we possibly can, making sure all of the issue is dealt 
with.
<P>
	As I said in my opening remarks, obviously the intent of the bill, 
the desire to ensure consumer protection, is excellent. It is one the 
constituents in my riding of Parry Sound-Muskoka and I am sure 
all Canadians want to have addressed. They are genuinely 
concerned, particularly in these days of computerization. 
Information can be transferred electronically and in great amounts 
from one institution to another. They are concerned in that kind of 
environment that their privacy be protected.
<P>
	As the hon. member who introduced the bill knows, it is 
important that the consumer receive protection in this respect. That 
is why I believe it is important to broaden this initiative. When we 
address the problem we must ensure that we address it in the fullest 
possible way. When we have done our work we must ensure we 
have covered as much ground as possible in order to protect the 
greatest number of consumers we possibly can.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville-Milton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
we consider Bill C-315 we should review what the government is 
doing in this area.
<P>
	Industry Canada and the Department of Justice are working on a 
comprehensive approach to privacy protection to respond to the 
recommendations of the information highway advisory council. 
For this reason, I do not want to support Bill C-315. I would rather 
wait until the Minister of Industry tables his response to the 
information highway advisory council.
<P>
	Both that council and the Canadian Direct Marketing 
Association have called for comprehensive legislation based on the 
Canadian Standards Association's model privacy code. It seems to 
be more advisable to start from this consensual base and start the 
work that needs to be done to get broad-based support in the full 
community for action in this area.
<P>
	I understand that the ministries of industry and justice are 
examining the recommendations I just mentioned. They are trying 
to come up with a broad based approach to the issue that both 
consumers and business would prefer. Any such approach would 
encompass existing voluntary efforts and the many excellent codes 
business has already put in place in a voluntary fashion. We  should 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17071"> 17071 </A></B>
<P>
take the time to allow this process to unfold and not start working 
on quick fixes to one problem after another.
<P>
	This is not to underestimate the work of my hon. colleague who 
brought forward the legislation, but rather to pull the threads 
together of work that is being done in many areas of government on 
this issue. For example, my colleague, the hon. member for Nickel 
Belt, has also called for a national privacy law, building on the 
work of the Canadian Standards Association. He has also called for 
a working group to be struck to work on the drafting of such 
legislation, ensuring that it is enforceable and that there is an 
independent body for oversight. I commend his interest in this 
issue and I would suggest that we build on the work that is already 
going on in government.
<P>
<B>(1825 )</B>
<P>
	Bill C-315 would require that an organization notify each 
individual on a mailing list each time that list is sold to another 
organization and ensure that the individual's consent has been 
received. In addition, it requires that the organization selling the 
list also notify that same individual that his or her name has been 
obtained. The legislation deals only with the sale of mailing lists.
<P>
	Organizations would have 10 days to comply with requests from 
individuals to have their names or certain elements of information 
removed from the list. Fines for repeated offences could reach 
$20,000.
<P>
	This legislation would affect the marketplace narrowly, in that it 
focuses only on personal information linked to mailing lists. It does 
not provide protection for personal information involving the vast 
majority of marketplace transactions.
<P>
	The role of the federal government could be open to 
constitutional challenge, in that the regulation of personal 
information provided as part of a contract could be interpreted as a 
provincial responsibility. Quebec has already made such a claim in 
establishing privacy legislation applicable to all personal 
information gathered as a result of marketplace transactions.
<P>
	A government infrastructure would be required to enforce the 
legislation. The sheer number of names contained in mailing lists 
suggests that there would be numerous complaints to be handled by 
the federal government. The resulting bureaucracy could be very 
costly.
<P>
	Some have said this legislation is too narrowly focused to 
provide adequate protection of personal information. Lists are 
more commonly rented than sold today, and the legislation fails to 
address rentals. The legislation would be costly to enforce and 
cannot deal with nominative lists originating with organizations 
based outside of Canada.
<P>
	A recommendation from the information highway advisory 
council on establishing framework privacy legislation is currently 
under consideration.
<P>
	I know the minister does not support the passage of the bill at 
this stage, as he is hoping for a broader response to this very current 
issue that affects consumers. As a result, I am not going to be 
supporting this bill, although I would like to thank the hon. member 
for bringing this important issue forward to the front burner of our 
national agenda. I believe we should ask the Minister of Industry to 
report back to the House on the work that is in progress rather than 
cut short his efforts and those of the justice minister by starting 
fresh work in a new and more limited direction.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is the House ready for the 
question?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I had understood Reform Party 
members wanted to put up an additional speaker. I was leaving that 
time available. However, if they do not intend to speak then I would 
certainly wish to debate this bill. If they could perhaps indicate 
whether they do have another speaker, I would be happy to stand 
down.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I am not here as a negotiator, 
just as a Speaker. I am simply putting the question to the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mayfield:</B> Mr. Speaker, it was my understanding that there 
would be another speaker from my party. If the debate has come to 
a conclusion, I would like an opportunity for a brief summary.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> There may come a time for 
that to transpire, but right now we are simply resuming debate. I 
give the floor to the chief deputy whip and there is approximately 
one minute remaining.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one 
obviously cannot speak a great deal on this important issue in one 
minute. However, let me just take the minute to acknowledge the 
importance of the issue that has been brought forward: the 
protection of the privacy of individuals in an increasingly 
technologized world.
<P>
	I do not think any of us can go through a day without being aware 
of how much very personal information about us is available to a 
myriad of people without our knowledge and the fact that the 
putting together of that information can jeopardize our privacy 
extensively. That is precisely why the Minister of Industry is 
addressing this extremely important issue and fully anticipates 
bringing measures forward to the House earlier in the new year.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	The bill is well intentioned. It has some flaws in it, however. It 
would be appropriate for the proposer of the bill to engage in 
another hour's debate on the matter, to make some points as have 
been made in the debate so far  that he believes need to be 
considered by the government in drafting the bill, and to take the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="17072"> 17072 </A></B>
<P>
points forward in debate on legislation that will come before the 
House. Potentially there will be amendments. We are open to 
having appropriate action on the matter for the protection of 
Canadians and their privacy.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. 
Pursuant to Standing Order 93 the order is dropped to the bottom of 
the order of precedence on the Order Paper.

AFFAIRS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on November 
24, I put a question to the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. I 
asked him whether the interim report he transmitted to the Prime 
Minister on behalf of this committee included the option of putting 
before the House a simple resolution on the distinct society concept 
and whether that option was the one favoured by his committee.
<P>
	As usual, the minister evaded the issue, saying it was not up to 
him to reveal the results of the work of this committee and that 
later on, at the appropriate time, the opposition would see whether 
that was the Liberal government's option.
<P>
	We asked this question because we wanted to warn the 
government against proposing to the House a simple resolution to 
recognize Quebec as a distinct society within Canada. We simply 
wanted to tell the Liberal government that it was useless, that it was 
an entirely symbolic gesture that would in any case fail to satisfy 
Quebec because it did not go far enough and would be rejected by 
English Canada because it would involve too many changes, 
according to them.
<P>
	We wanted to say this because in Quebec, the distinct society 
issue was raised in the Liberal Party's platform around 1984 or 
1985. Robert Bourassa, who was subtle in his approach, had found 
this expression and used it as a synonym of the concept of the 
Quebec people, to make it palatable to English Canada. Basically, 
Mr. Bourassa thought that Quebecers would agree, saying that it 
was in fact a synonym of the Quebec people and that English 
Canada would agree in the belief that it meant nothing. History has 
shown that English Canada was right.
<P>
	At one point the concept surfaced in the Meech Lake accord. It 
has often been said that this particular concept was more important 
than the one in the federal  government's current proposal, the 
claim being that it would affect the way the Constitution was 
interpreted and that the concept of distinct society in the Meech 
Lake accord would even take precedence over the charter of rights 
and freedoms.
<P>
	This was far from obvious. Eminent legal experts in English 
Canada, including Professor Peter W. Hogg at York University, 
claimed the opposite was true, and said quite clearly: ``The new 
section does not take precedence over the charter of rights and 
freedoms. In fact, as a straightforward interpretative clause, it is 
subject to the charter''.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	Had the Meech Lake accord been accepted in its day, we would 
have found ourselves again before the Supreme Court, which 
would-contrary to what Premier Bourassa said-again have 
concluded that the agreement Quebec had signed in good faith did 
not take precedence over a fundamental element of the 
Constitution, namely the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	Obviously we have nothing against a constitution's containing 
sections aimed at defending citizens' rights, but nevertheless the 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms has been useful to those wishing to 
block the aspirations of Quebec, to restrict its development 
culturally and linguistically.
<P>
	That charter has helped these people, whom I could almost 
describe as malevolent, to hobble the development of Quebec and 
to make it so that today Quebec has no other solution than to 
promptly and firmly reject any notion of a distinct society and to 
come up with the proposition that was ours during the last 
referendum, which is to state loud and clear that Quebec is not a 
distinct society but a people, period.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
November 24, the member for Jonquière asked the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs a question on the federal government's 
intentions regarding Quebec.
<P>
	The Minister responded, quoting the Prime Minister, who had 
said the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>To ensure the change and modernization of Canada, no change is excluded.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Prime Minister promised he would act on the matter of a 
distinct society and the matter of a veto. He acted on these two 
promises very quickly, and Quebecers have seen that the Prime 
Minister is a man of his word, who keeps the promises he makes.
<P>
	The committee discussed the matters of a distinct society and a 
right of veto, and we have already seen the initial results, which the 
Prime Minister announced Monday. The distinct society clause is 
one Quebec has long sought.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="17073"> 17073 </A></B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister of Canada's resolution finally accords 
Quebec Canada's full recognition, because Parliament is the only 
place representing all Canadians from all regions.
<P>
	The Prime Minister had promised during the last week of the 
campaign that he would act to reinstate the right of veto that René 
Lévesque had lost. We will reinstate it, and this is a big step toward 
resolving Canada's problems.
<P>
	The changes required can and must be made within Canada. This 
is the message sent to all Canadians, including the members of the 
official opposition, by the October 30 vote.
<P>
	As the minister said yesterday in the House, his committee is 
currently studying other questions, including rationalizing powers 
among the provinces and Canada, and will submit 
recommendations to the Prime Minister when they are ready.
<P>
	Our aim is not to destroy Canada, but to build it. This is what the 
majority of Canadians and Quebecers have asked us to do, and, 
because we believe in democracy, we will try to continue to build 
Canada.

	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, following on my question to the Secretary of State for 
Financial Institutions, I wish to emphasize that many of my 
constituents in the riding of Parry Sound-Muskoka have had their 
retirement savings jeopardized by the collapse of Confederation 
Life. They have come to ask for assistance because as every day 
passes they are suffering financial uncertainty as a result of the 
collapse of this financial institution.
<P>
	Obviously what has happened as a result of the collapse of 
Confederation Life has affected each and every one of them, but 
some are paying a higher price for the collapse because of their 
own personal financial circumstances. It is for these people that I 
urge a speedy dissolution of the assets of Confederation Life, an 
expedited liquidation process, so that all Canadians affected by the 
collapse receive their money as quickly as possible.
<P>
	Not long ago I presented a petition in the House with over 500 
signatures on behalf of a group of Bell Canada pensioners who 
were frustrated not only with the collapse of Confederation Life but 
also with their inability to convince their employer, Bell Canada, 
that it had an added responsibility to the company's pensioners. 
These pensioners believe that because Bell Canada not only chose 
Confederation Life as the administrator of its group RRSP but also 
encouraged its employees to participate in the plan, it must now 
take responsibility for those actions.
<P>
	The petition I presented calls upon Parliament to initiate an 
investigation into the collapse of  Confederation Life with 
particular reference to Bell Canada's responsibility toward its 
employees' funds. I too would like to see this matter resolved 
expeditiously.
<P>
	Unfortunately, this whole matter is essentially in the hands of the 
liquidator and the government's ability to intervene is somewhat 
limited as a result. We know that when a financial institution goes 
into liquidation it ceases to be a regulated financial institution and 
responsibility for the distribution of the estate passes to the 
liquidator under the court's supervision.
<P>
	My concern right now is with the length of time it is taking to get 
through this liquidation process. One of the greatest priorities is to 
recover as much per dollar as is possible by getting the best price 
on the sale of assets. That is a given. It is my hope this process can 
be hastened in the interests of those who have been affected by the 
collapse. We need to get those funds that are guaranteed paid back 
to the investors, the men and women in this country who put their 
faith in this company, Confederation Life.
<P>
	Retirees with the Bell group RRSP investments below the 
CompCorp limit will eventually be fully compensated for the time 
value of their money. The failure of Confederation Life did not 
affect Bell's principal pension plan, but in the case of amounts 
above the $60,000 CompCorp limit, until the liquidation process is 
completed it is impossible to determine the proportion of benefits 
that will eventually be paid.
<P>
	Granted, in the two previous liquidations of life insurance 
companies in Canada, policyholders received a significant portion 
of the benefits owed by the companies, but this is small comfort to 
those whose life savings are now in jeopardy. These funds are of 
significant concern to my constituents and many other Canadians. I 
appreciate their difficulties and I want to do all I can to help resolve 
this issue and to encourage Bell Canada to accept the fact that it has 
an obligation to work with its employees and former employees to 
come to some kind of understanding or compromise.
<P>
	It is my sincere hope that Bell Canada will address this issue 
with its present and past employees and will work judiciously to 
resolve what has become a contentious matter.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I realize 
that this is a particularly touchy subject for my colleague and for 
those affected by this problem, of course.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I recognize this is a very difficult issue for those Canadians, 
including Bell pensioners, who had investments in Confederation 
Life. There are several factors that should serve to diminish the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="17074"> 17074 </A></B>
<P>
adverse  consequences of the failure of Confederation Life on Bell 
pensioners.
<P>
	First, the funds at issue were part of a supplemental savings plan 
that were intended to augment pension income for Bell pensioners. 
Bell's principal pension plan is separately managed and was not 
affected by the failure of Confederation Life.
<P>
	Second, I am informed by the Canadian Life and Health 
Insurance Compensation Corporation, CompCorp, that the group 
RRSP in question is guaranteed by CompCorp to a maximum of 
$60,000, including principal and interest. Amounts over $60,000 
will be recoverable through the liquidation process.
<P>
	Finally, a hardship committee has been established by the 
liquidator to review requests in cases of unusual financial hardship. 
The intention is to ensure that funds are immediately available to 
those most in need.
<P>
	Regarding whether anything can be done to speed up the 
liquidation, responsibility for the liquidation of Confederation Life 
is a matter for the liquidator under the supervision of the court. As 
such it would be inappropriate to intervene.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> In accordance with Standing 
Order 38, the motion to adjourn the House is deemed to have been 
passed. Accordingly, the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 
10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.44 p.m.)
