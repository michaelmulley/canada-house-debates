<P>
Question No. 28-<B>Mr. Forseth:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Regarding the spraying of gypsy moths by Agriculture Canada in the 
McBride/Sappleton area in New Westminster, British Columbia: (<I>a</I>) what is the 
exact ingredient of the formulation Btk, (<I>b</I>) what were the gypsy moth counts 
before and after spraying over the past 10 years in the general urban area, (<I>c</I>) 
what specific notification procedures and what education programs have been 
conducted over the past six months to constituents living in the affected area, 
and (<I>d</I>) what alternative forms of dealing with the gypsy moth are available and 
what is the cost-effectiveness ratio of each?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> (a) Btk: Due to proprietary information 
exemptions in the Access to Information Act, Agriculture and 
Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) cannot disclose the total contents of 
Foray 48B, the particular formula of Btk used for the eradication of 
gypsy moths. What we can say is that the active ingredient is a 
bacterial insect disease, Bacillus thuringiensis Kurstaki-Btk. 
Small amounts of chemicals are used in the commercial 
fermentation process, and the bacteria metabolize these into 
complex and simple sugars and water in the final formulation. The 
final formulation has been examined by Health Canada and 
Environment Canada and has been proven safe; it is even certified 
for use by organic growers.
<P>
	(b) Treatment Effectiveness: European gypsy moths (also knows 
as North American gypsy moths) have been accidentally moved to 
British Columbia on household effects numerous times in the last 
17 years from infested areas of eastern North America and 
elsewhere. Thirty-nine male moths wer caught in 
pheromone-baited sticky traps in B.C. in 1994 and again in 1995; 
prior years moths trapped have numbered over 200 males. (The 
pheromone is a sexual lure used to attract male gypsy moths only.) 
When gypsy moths are trapped at low density (one or two in a trap 
with no moths in surrounding traps), the figures do not necessarily 
indicate a sustainable population and therefore eradication is not 
necessary. However, the area surrounding such finds is always 
closely monitored for two subsequent years to determine whether 
the population is increasing or has failed to develop.
<P>
	British Columbia is uniquely placed in that it has the pressure of 
introductions of North American gypsy  moths by land and air from 
eastern North America and of Asian gypsy moths by sea and air 
from countries to the west. The Asian gypsy moth threatens its 
habitat far more than the European gypsy moth, being a more 
aggressive feeder, feeding on a wider host range, and having 
females capable of flying before they deposit their prolific egg 
masses. It was multiple catches of the Asian gypsy moth on the 
Vancouver waterfront that launched the intensive spray program in 
1992. Asian and North American gypsy moths are capable of 
cross-breeding, the result of which is a North American gypsy 
moth with females capable of flying. Prior to determining a 
treatment response, it is thus essential to determine whether the 
gypsy moth is of the Asian, European, or hybrid genotype; this is 
done through genetic fingerprinting.
<P>
	The following shows the number of male gypsy moths trapped 
before and after spraying during the last 10 years in the greater

 	(xi) consultation with local medical health officers;<BR>
 	(xii) detailed information sent to B.C. Environmental Appeal 
Board in response to appeals against AFFC's pesticide use permit.
<P>
	(d) Alternative Treatment Information: An aerial application of a 
chemical insecticide is the most cost-effective and efficacious 
method of eliminating gypsy moths. However, these chemicals 
tend to affect a wide range of non-target organisms and to raise 
public concerns about human health. While AAFC chooses not to 
use these alternatives and therefore does not know the 
cost-effectiveness ratio for such a treatment, it can be deduced that 
the treatment would be cheaper because chemical insecticides are 
cheaper than bacterial insecticides and only one spraying is needed 
to eradicate the moths.
<P>
	Mass pheromone trapping is a non-viable alternative for 
eradiction because of the fact that it is not a legal option in Canada. 
It is an experimental approach of using huge numbers of traps to 
interfere with mating: 5,000 traps per square mile are set out two 
years running at a current cost of around $100,000/square mile.
<P>
	For the eradication of the gypsy moth population indicated in 
Sapperton, the British Columbia Regional Office of Food 
Production and Inspection Branch of AAFC has chosen to use an 
efficacious ground-spraying program of Btk to take into 
consideration public discomfort with the aerial application of a 
pesticide. This year, the cost-effectiveness ratio of a ground 
application compared with an aerial application of Btk is 8:1, 
though this varies with the size of the areas.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to ask the government House leader when I will receive answers to 
Questions Nos. 2 and 4. It was not clear to me yesterday. I have 
been waiting for 80 days for these replies. Prior to the prorogation 
of the House, I waited for 71 days without an answer.
<P>
	The answers are a matter of public safety. They include 
government liability for injuries suffered by prisoners under its 
care and the unsafe storage of firearms by police and armies. When 
can I get an answer to these two important questions?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Zed:</B> Mr. Speaker, as I explained to my colleague yesterday, 
both of those answers are being finalized. I regret there has been a 
delay, but we are attempting to make the answers as fulsome and as 
responsive to the member's request as possible. He will be familiar 
with the fact that neither issue can have just a yes or no answer. 
They deal with policy matters and need appropriate replies.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the House endorse the declaration of the Prime Minister of Canada, who 
stated in 1985, ``If we don't win, I'll respect the wishes of Quebeckers and let them 
separate''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, to begin with, as the Standing Order 
allows, I would like to request that all speeches from here on be 
split into ten minute segments.
<P>
	Now, to explain the context of this motion before the House, let 
us say that, recently, the Prime Minister has acquired the bad habit, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2854"> 2854 </A></B>
<P>
if I dare describe it as that, of going back on his word about certain 
things he has said,  explaining to the public that, of necessity, in 
political life sometimes commitments cannot be met, and that 
politicians must not be required to keep their word.
<P>
	We have seen that in the GST matter, where the PM had 
promised to scrap the GST and where, finally, the government's 
decision was quite different. It was the opposite, in fact: to expand 
the GST. Since the federal government is digging itself further and 
further into a constitutional hole by cosying up to Guy Bertrand in 
contesting the legitimacy of a Quebec referendum, we thought it 
worthwhile to review the statements the Prime Minister has made.
<P>
	For this reason, we are submitting the matter to the House, and 
are asking our hon. colleagues, both those in the Reform Party and 
more particularly those in the Liberal Party, to join with us in 
ensuring that the House deals with a statement made by the Prime 
Minister, when he said in 1985 that ``If we don't win, I'll respect 
the wishes of Quebeckers and let them separate''.
<P>
	This is a quote from <I>Straight from the Heart</I>, written by the 
Prime Minister himself. In 1985, the Prime Minister waxed most 
eloquent, saying: ``We'll put our faith in democracy. We'll 
convince the people that they should stay in Canada and we'll 
win''. It is normal for a politician to believe in what he is 
proposing, normal for him to think that he can win in his political 
undertakings. But he ends up saying: ``If we don't win, I'll respect 
the wishes of Quebeckers and let them separate''.
<P>
	That is the quote, and the book, behind today's motion. The 
question being asked of our colleagues across the way is this: Are 
we going to take steps to ensure that the House in its entirety, 
through a majority vote or, who knows, even by a unanimous vote, 
endorses these words by the Prime Minister? Is what the Prime 
Minister promised, stated, in 1985, still endorsed, first of all, by 
himself-something we might well wonder-and then by his 
ministerial colleagues, of whom solidarity is required, and his 
caucus colleagues, who are also supposed to be in solidarity with 
their Prime Minister on a matter as basic as this?
<P>
	To facilitate the decision, I shall be making use of some more 
quotes by the Prime Minister, for this is not the first time the Prime 
Minister has made a statement on this matter. Doing so may 
perhaps help them see that this was not just an unfortunate slip of 
the tongue that got past the Prime Minister in an angry moment, or 
in some speech or other, but indeed something that he felt 
profoundly, or at the very least, something he wanted to get across 
to his fellow citizens by writing it down and repeating it in a variety 
of ways.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	During the proceedings of the Bélanger-Campeau Commission, 
on December 17 1990, which is even more recent, the Prime 
Minister declared, and I quote: ``I am a democrat. I said in 
numerous speeches in 1980 that if  we had not recognized that 
Quebec had the right to opt for separation, we would have acted 
differently. There were powers we could have used but we decided 
not to''.
<P>
	Therefore the hon. members across will appreciate that the 
Prime Minister formally recognized for a second time that Quebec 
has the right to separate. By saying that there are powers which 
could have been used but were not, he also excluded resorting to 
legal guerilla warfare as a means to challenge the referendum.
<P>
	We feel concerned because unfortunately the Prime Minister 
went back on his word, on this point. We all know that this 
government decided to team up with Guy Bertrand in a legal war 
which could result in denying Quebecers the right to make a 
decision on their future. In 1990, the Prime Minister repeated his 
statement of 1985 according to which Quebec has the right to 
separate.
<P>
	Even more recently, on October 24 1995, the Prime Minister 
declared in the speech he delivered in Verdun on the eve of the 
referendum: ``Next Monday we will have to decide if we are ready 
to abandon a country which personifies them better than any other 
country. Think twice before voting''. This means that the Prime 
Minister explicitly recognized that the referendum vote was 
decisive. Indeed, he declared: ``Think twice before voting. Next 
Monday we will have to decide if we are ready to break away from 
our country''. Therefore, on the eve of the referendum, on October 
24 1995, the Prime Minister repeated what he had written in 1985 
and reiterated in 1990.
<P>
	On October 25 1995, in his address to the nation, the Prime 
Minister said: ``The vote on Monday will determine the future not 
only of Quebec but also of Canada as a whole. This is a serious and 
irreversible decision''. Once more he recognized what he had 
already admitted in 1980, 1985, 1990 and on the previous day, on 
October 24 1995: ``Canada, our country and heritage, are in danger. 
Breaking Canada apart or building this country, remaining 
Canadian or becoming foreigners, staying or leaving, those are the 
issues at stake in the referendum. When we make our choice, we all 
have the responsibility and the duty to understand the impact of our 
decision''.
<P>
	In the mind of the Prime Minister, therefore, a referendum in 
Quebec is legitimate and its results are binding. The outcome of the 
referendum must be respected.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has the support of one of his colleagues in 
cabinet, the super minister of the Quebec referendum, the present 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, who said: ``We have 
always said that Quebecers were entitled to have their say on 
Quebec's future inside or outside Canada. Ours is a democratic 
country, and we will respect the outcome of the vote''. So the 
minister supports the Prime Minister.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2855"> 2855 </A></B>
<P>
	In closing, since my time is running out, any doubts the Liberals 
may have had as to a vote in favour of this motion calling for the 
House's endorsement of the Prime Minister's declaration: ``If we 
don't win, I'll respect the wishes of Quebecers and let them 
separate'', are fading.
<P>
	I will close by saying that, if it might reinforce their conviction 
that they must support what the Prime Minister has said, I will 
quote his speech to the nation on October 25, 1995.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	In this last quote, the Prime Minister said, and I suggest they 
think about it: ``My friends, we are facing a decisive moment in the 
history of our country. And people all across Canada know that 
decision lies in the hands of their fellow Canadians in Quebec''.
<P>
	In all that he has said since 1980, in 1985, 1990 and 1995, he has 
been consistent repeatedly. He has always said that Quebecers had 
the right to decide their future themselves and that a referendum 
would be decisive, binding and would change the nature of things 
in Canada.
<P>
	Accordingly, there is no reason for the Liberal members to think 
the House will not endorse the statement he made in 1985. We 
could have taken all the ones he has made since then, but we chose 
1985: ``If we don't win, I'll respect the wishes of Quebecers and let 
them separate''. We will see whether the GST is the only issue 
where the Prime Minister reversed himself or whether, in the 
constitutional matter as well, he will suddenly deny all he has said 
on different occasions over a very long period of time.

	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I would ask the Chair to rule on 
an issue which was brought to our attention a few moments ago, 
whether it is either customary or even procedurally acceptable that 
members share their time on the original motion.
<P>
	It has been customary in the past for the length of speeches of all 
members to be 20 minutes. Later on, for subsequent speakers, in 
particular during the second round, the whip can rise, and I believe 
under the rules only the whip can do it, to invoke Standing Order 
43, by which he or she will then state members can from that point 
on share their time.
<P>
	What occurred this morning was irregular in two ways. I would 
like the Chair to consider this and rule on it later. The initial 
speaker indicated to the Chair that he wished for all Liberal 
members to have their time shared. I believe that proposition is in 
itself irregular and that it must be done by the whip.
<P>
	Occasionally members have between themselves agreed to share 
their time, but that was not the proposition advanced this morning. 
That proposition was  put forward by an MP who is not the whip. 
He asked that all members of his party be allowed to share their 
time. I do not believe that is provided for in Standing Order 43.
<P>
	The second point is that I do not believe the Speaker has 
entertained that proposition in the past at the request of the initial 
speaker on any particular motion. It has always been done with 
subsequent speakers.
<P>
	In any case, Mr. Speaker, I ask that you consider the two points I 
have brought to the attention of the Chair and to rule whether the 
suggestion by the hon. leader of the opposition is acceptable under 
our rules. I contend it is not and I ask the Chair to rule on that issue.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, speaking of custom, I will not go back to times 
immemorial in this House but simply to March 20, 1996, which is 
not so far back. The same thing happened then. The hon. member 
for Medicine Hat shared his time. He was the first speaker, and the 
issue was the GST. Imagine that. He shared his time with the 
member for Capilano-Howe Sound who moved an amendment. 
This was on March 20, 1996.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	The Chair did not see anything irregular in that. That time, our 
Liberal friends did not rise to protest. I understand that they may 
have regretted it afterward. They had some problems with the GST, 
but this was on March 20, 1996. I suggest to you, Mr. Speaker, that 
this double standard is unacceptable. Even a triple standard, a rule 
for the third party, a rule for the party in power and another one for 
the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	On March 20, 1996, everything was clear. Unless there is an 
error in <I>Hansard</I>, nobody spoke up. I note that the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons was present. He made no objection. The member shares 
his time, the member with whom he shares it amends the motion. 
This was on March 20, 1996, not so long ago.
<P>
	Beauchesne did not deal with this issue, he did not have the time. 
I suppose that if he had, people on the other side would have risen 
to protest that it did not make sense. Let us not try, by devious 
means, to prevent the opposition from holding a political debate of 
great importance.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, there are a few points I want to bring 
to your attention.
<P>
	First, it is well-known that one case does not make a precedent. 
The Speaker has not ruled and so no jurisprudence can be invoked. 
If Mr. Speaker does not rule on the previous case no one can claim 
that it is good precedence.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2856"> 2856 </A></B>
<P>
	I would argue the following and invite you, Mr. Speaker, to 
consider this. If this-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Your French is very good.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I want to tell the member opposite that I have no 
reason to be ashamed of the chance, the honour and the privilege I 
have, in this country, to speak both official languages. I do not have 
to apologize to him. I think I am competent in both languages and I 
am free to choose the one that pleases me. As a Canadian, it is my 
privilege and my right, a concept-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I ask all those who want to 
speak to this matter to be co-operative and to stick to the point of 
order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I ask the Chair to consider this 
proposal: if what was just done is allowed under our rules, it 
could-and I invite the Chair to think about this carefully-make it 
impossible to amend this motion or any other opposition motion in 
future. The first speaker could table his motion and the following 
one, from the same party, could ask the previous question, which 
would preclude all amendments.
<P>
	That is why, Mr. Speaker, I ask you to do whatever is necessary 
to invalidate what the opposition leader asked for this morning. 
Otherwise, it would completely change the rules of the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, since this concerns me primarily, I 
would like to make a few points for your consideration. First, our 
Standing Orders are full of provisions which, when used properly 
by the House, shorten debates or prevent the taking of a vote, make 
it compulsory to have a debate or prevent debate.
<P>
	The Standing Orders are full of provisions which, when used 
properly by parliamentarians, as is usually the case here, have an 
impact on the nature and the course of the proceedings.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	Therefore, it is not justified to strike this particular provision 
from the Standing Orders or overturn the ruling already made, 
otherwise the Standing Orders would have to be reviewed entirely 
and many provisions amended. If the hon. whip wants to embark on 
such an operation, he should consult his House leader, and we will 
see. But for the time being, this cannot be taken into account, 
otherwise it would also apply to a lot of other provisions.
<P>
	Second, I would like to respectfully point out to the hon. 
government whip that, before going ahead in this manner, mindful 
as I always am to follow not only the spirit but also the letter of our 
Standing Orders, I consulted the Chair and the Principal Clerk of 
the House, and they both confirmed, rightly I must say-they could 
just as easily have ruled otherwise-that the ruling  already 
rendered and the practice of the House allowed me to ask that we 
all share our time.
<P>
	Therefore, I followed the directive of the House, on the 
recommendation of its principal officer and on your 
recommendation, Mr. Speaker, and therefore I do not know why-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> The Liberals had no objection.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Indeed, there was no objection from anyone 
when I did it. Moreover, the hon. whip raised his point after I had 
finished speaking. If he had any objection, some of his colleagues 
were there across the way when you agreed to my request and 
everybody thought it was all right.
<P>
	Why all of a sudden, once I have finished my speech, would I no 
longer be allowed to do it? Mr. Speaker, I am asking you to take 
these elements into consideration in your ruling.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
while I understand the comments made by my hon. friend, it is 
important to mention that it was out of respect for the fact that he 
was in the middle of making his speech that no one rose at that 
time. It was a courtesy to the hon. member. We felt that it was 
important not to get up in the middle of his speech over one 
comment. Otherwise, we would be always standing.
<P>
	While I accept the point that my hon. colleague made, I do not 
think that the Chair should take it too seriously. The points that the 
chief government whip made amply demonstrate some of the 
difficulties that we would endure if the Chair were to rule in a 
different way.
<P>
	My hon. friend, the opposition House leader, has talked about a 
recent decision, but there was no decision of the Chair. It was a 
practice; not a decision of the Chair. It is only one practice. It does 
not make a ruling. There has been no ruling of the Chair.
<P>
	There is no ruling and the chief government Whip has made that 
point. There is no precedent. If there were a precedent, then I would 
suggest that the chief government whip would not have risen at all.
<P>
	I believe respectfully that the Chair should consider this matter 
in due course and we should be given an opportunity to hear what 
the Chair's ruling might be in this matter.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think you authorized it by allowing 
the Leader of the Opposition to split his time. It is done regularly 
by members of the House. The whips do not always say: ``Our 
members will be doing that''. The members just rise and say: ``I 
will share my time with my colleague''. Liberals do it regularly.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2857"> 2857 </A></B>
<P>
	If the member is so courteous today, I imagine it is only 
because, as a former leader of the rat pack, he experienced a 
special surge of politeness.
<P>
	Nobody objected. They could have done so before the beginning 
of the speech and they did not. They realized later on that, since 
nobody had offered any opposition, a second member would speak. 
This member has the right to present amendments or not, just as 
much as any other member in this House.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	I repeat there should not be two sets of rules, one for the party in 
office and one for the opposition. Next time, be prepared; that is all 
I can say.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I will take the question 
under advisement and the Chair will rule on it later today.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I want to thank the chief government whip and the parliamentary 
secretary to the government House leader on the government side 
for their interventions on this point of order.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would also like to thank the hon. Leader of the Opposition and 
the House leader of the official opposition for their statements on 
this very important issue. The Chair will study those statements 
very carefully.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> We should suspend our proceedings.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I do not think there is reason 
to suspend the proceedings of the House at this time. I do not have a 
crystal ball, but if the scenario suggested by the chief whip occurs 
and the second member to speak does present an amendment to the 
amendment, I will then take that new amendment under 
advisement, just as I will do so for the statements, as I said before. 
The Chair will then come back to the House with its final ruling as 
soon as possible.
<P>
	Resuming debate. We were at questions and comments 
following the first statement of the Leader of the Opposition.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is the first time I have had 
the opportunity to ask a question of the leader of the Bloc. This is a 
major problem which at some point has to be addressed.
<P>
	Within Quebec there are aboriginal peoples: Abenakis, 
Montagnais, Cree, Innu, Algonquin, Mohawk, Huron, Micmac, 
Malecite. According to Mr. Turp, the former adviser to the Bloc, 
they have the superior right to self-determination. Everyone knows 
about the outcome of the referendum taken by the Montagnais, 
Cree and  Innu. They are Quebecois. They are aboriginal people 
living in Quebec.
<P>
	Within Montreal, for instance, there are 450,000 Italian 
Canadians. These are Canadian citizens living in Quebec. 
Twenty-three of the 30 ridings in Montreal voted no. The people in 
Hull, the Pontiac and eastern townships want to remain part of 
Canada.
<P>
	How does the Leader of the Opposition intend to deal with this? 
Is he saying that 50 per cent plus 1 takes away the rights of all these 
people who want to remain Canadian citizens? It is a very difficult 
question.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to get a question 
from the minister of Indian affairs because, for once in an exchange 
between the two of us, an answer will be given.
<P>
	It is unacceptable for a politician, all the more so one invested 
with ministerial responsibilities, to continually disrupt major 
political debates with remarks which do not make any sense. Let 
me explain.
<P>
	First of all, Quebec is an entity, Quebec is a territory, and Canada 
is made up, as far as I know, of ten provinces and two territories. 
When Canada was founded, it was not by the reunion of pieces of 
land to form Canada, leaving the rest to form a separate country. 
Recognized territories in their own right, provinces joined together 
to form the Canadian confederation. The last example is 
Newfoundland. Newfoundland joined as one, not as separate 
pieces, even though it had to go through a second and third 
referendum which passed with a majority of only 52 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	When the Minister brings up the concept of partition, he knows 
full well that, should he venture on such grounds, what is true for 
Quebec would also be true for the rest of Canada. Canada is a 
collection of entities, Quebec being indivisible, just like 
Newfoundland and Ontario are indivisible. These complete entities 
constitute a whole, they are not the amalgam of small pieces of 
regions which form Canada.
<P>
	When Newfoundland held a recent referendum to put an end to 
denominational schools, did the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development, with his wonderful logic, rise to say that 
we should not take religion out of all Newfoundland schools? Some 
regions voted for it, some massively against it, and others where 
almost evenly divided. Did he rise to say: There is a problem in 
Newfoundland, we cannot take religion out of all schools, because 
there was not a majority everywhere?
<P>
	He should understand that, in Quebec, the same logic applies. 
The people of Quebec, as his leader said on several occasions, has 
the right to decide its future. Should it decide to separate, so be it. 
Besides, what we  are asking him to support is what his own leader 
said: ``That the House endorse the declaration of the Prime 
Minister of Canada, who stated in 1985: 'If we don't win, I'll 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2858"> 2858 </A></B>
<P>
respect the wishes of Quebeckers and let them separate''. The 
Prime Minister did not say: ``I will accept the separation of small 
parts of Quebec'', he said ``I will-let them separate.
<P>
	I quoted that statement on several occasions, and the Prime 
Minister always said the same thing. If the Indian affairs minister 
has difficulties with his leader's statements, that is his problem, but 
I would simply remind him that, on October 25, 1995, not long ago, 
his leader said: ``Dear friends, Canada is now at a decisive moment 
in its history and people throughout Canada know this decision is in 
the hands of their fellow citizens in Quebec''. The Prime Minister 
never used the logic of the minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, and he never said Canada's future was in the hands 
of some citizens in some small parts of Canada that will go. Never. 
This is only the minister's logic.
<P>
	The referendum that brought Newfoundland into the 
Confederation brought the whole province into it. The last 
referendum in Newfoundland to make schools non-denominational 
will bring about measures throughout the province of 
Newfoundland, even though there are some places where people 
did not vote in favour of that.
<P>
	And the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development 
would want it to apply to only bits and pieces. That does not make 
any sense.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the motion put forward by the Leader of the Opposition is 
very important. The big fuss made by the government this morning 
about the way we are proceeding shows how significant and 
important this motion is.
<P>
	Later this afternoon we will see if the Prime Minister will vote 
against his own democratic philosophy. We will also see if Liberal 
members will disavow their own Prime Minister's statement by 
voting against the motion. Above all, we will know where the 
Prime Minister stands between his fine rhetoric and his concrete 
actions.
<P>
	For us, democracy is sacred. It is one of the greatest political 
legacies we can leave to our children, and we will fight for this 
democracy, as our ancestors did in Quebec. That is why we are 
saying straight out that democracy has precedence over the law. 
The rule of law does not stand up to a democratic verdict.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	When a people hands down a democratic decision, no 
government, no court, not even a constitution can stop this people. 
This kind of decision is so important that the federal government 
has intervened in both Quebec referendums. In 1980 and again in 
1995, the federal government felt the need to intervene in Quebec's  
referendum debate because it knew that, in making a decision, the 
people of Quebec were showing how important the democratic 
action of casting a ballot was to them.
<P>
	In 1980-I will not insist on this because I think we all know our 
history, but it is still worthwhile to remind the members across the 
way who seem to have forgotten-in 1980, democracy was so 
important, the referendum was such an important event that the 
federal government had to intervene. Seventy-four out of the 75 
Liberal members at the time put their seats at stake and made 
promises to Quebecers. Why? Because democracy is important, 
because the referendum results were important.
<P>
	In 1995-a very recent event in everyone's memory-the 
federal government intervened once again. Once again, it made 
promises to the people of Quebec, including three major promises: 
distinct society, a right of veto, and the decentralization of powers. 
Everyone in Quebec knows that what was said in November and in 
the days following the referendum is rubbish; they did not keep the 
promise they made, in October 1995 for example.
<P>
	Democracy will judge this government as it did following the 
unilateral patriation of the Constitution in 1982. It is democracy 
that will judge this government. It is also democracy, at the level of 
the Quebec people, that will decide whether or not Quebec will 
become a sovereign country.
<P>
	What this means, I guess, is that the federal government took 
these two referendums seriously. It was fully aware of the 
implications. Moreover, just days before the last referendum, the 
Prime Minister of Canada addressed the nation, saying: ``The 
decision the people of Quebec are about to make will be 
irreversible''. That is quite a statement.
<P>
	Indeed, in a democracy, when the people have spoken, it must be 
acknowledged and taken seriously, without interpretation. You do 
not come out and say that the result is not valid, because the 
question was not clear or what have you. You speak up when it is 
time to speak up. In 1980 and in 1995 for instance, the members 
opposite were involved in the debate. They participated in it. They 
should acknowledge the result, as they will have to acknowledge 
the result of the next referendum, which, this time, the people of 
Quebec will win.
<P>
	The Prime Minister knows it. In his 1985 book entitled <I>Straight 
from the Heart</I>, he clearly stated: ``If we don't win, I'll respect the 
wishes of Quebeckers and let them separate''. There is no room for 
interpretation in there. This is the same man and he will accept 
separation if that is what the people of Quebec wish.
<P>
	Why would he change his tune? In Quebec, we are used to 
hearing the Prime Minister make contradictory statements. But this 
week, he really surpassed himself. He has one version for Quebec, 
another one for English  Canada and we learned he has yet another 
for the international community. Interviewed on an American 
program rebroadcasted in Mexico and Australia, he held a totally 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2859"> 2859 </A></B>
<P>
different view of democracy, a view which may be more in keeping 
with international law and with the statement he made in his book 
in 1985.
<P>
	The Prime Minister's rhetoric changes depending on the 
circumstances: before or after a referendum. He does not give the 
same definition of democracy in the days leading to a Quebec 
referendum and in the days following a Quebec referendum. His 
rhetoric and his definition of democracy change when he is the one 
planning a unilateral move, as in the case of the patriation of the 
Constitution in 1982. As far as I know, he had not been given any 
democratic mandate to patriate the Constitution, but he did just the 
same.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	Now, when a majority of Quebecers decide through a democratic 
referendum that they want a country called Quebec, the Prime 
Minister will say it is illegal, or that Quebec cannot unilaterally 
decide to become independent. This makes no sense.
<P>
	It did not really surprise me to hear the Prime Minister tell 
Quebecers, on the eve of a referendum, that their choice would be 
irreversible. Nor was I surprised to then hear him say that Quebec 
could not unilaterally declare its independence, and to find out that 
there is another version for international affairs.
<P>
	What surprises me though is the government's strategy to take 
Quebecers head on. This surprises me. I am also surprised to see 
the Prime Minister join forces with a character such as Mr. 
Bertrand. This surprises me, considering the declaration made by 
the Prime Minister about the motion moved by the Leader of the 
Official Opposition.
<P>
	I would like to propose an amendment to the motion. I move:
<P>
	.TPC Amendment
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by adding the following, immediately after the 
word ``stated'':</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>in <I>Straight from the Heart</I>,</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Why do I move this amendment? Simply because I want the 
government to know exactly where the quote comes from. When 
we make a claim, we can prove it. When the official opposition 
makes a claim, it can prove it. The declaration referred to in our 
motion is in the book <I>Straight from the heart</I>, which the Prime 
Minister may have written at a quieter and less emotional time, 
probably when he was getting ready to run against John Turner for 
the leadership of the Liberal Party of Canada.
<P>
	This statement is undoubtedly a more accurate reflection of the 
democratic spirit of the Prime Minister. I do not doubt for one 
moment that the Prime Minister is a democrat and that he really 
means what he wrote in  1985 in <I>Straight from the heart</I>. Given the 
motion moved by the leader of the opposition and my amendment, 
members opposite have all the necessary information to make their 
decision.
<P>
	I hope they will not disavow such an important statement from 
the Prime Minister. I hope the Prime Minister will not go back on 
his own word and will support the Bloc Quebecois motion, which 
reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the House endorse the declaration of the Prime Minister of Canada, who 
stated in <I>Straight from the heart</I>, in 1985, ``If we don't win, I'll respect the 
wishes of Quebeckers and let them separate.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is what democracy is all about.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The Speaker takes this 
amendment under advisement and will inform the House of its 
decision as soon as possible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened carefully to what my hon. colleague said, as I always do. In 
his view the Prime Minister has three different speeches for three 
different audiences.
<P>
	Did his former leader, the now premier of Quebec, Mr. 
Bouchard, not have a different speech or a different commentary 
when he was in California trying to explain the concept of 
sovereignty to the American audience? In describing the concept of 
sovereignty in the United States he was trying to liken it to the 
sovereign state of California, and the Americans could not quite 
understand that.
<P>
<B>(1100 )</B>
<P>
	I am wondering whether my colleague wishes to comment on the 
confusion which occurs. Perhaps it is planned with crooked 
questions that are being put to people, with questions that are 
confusing, with questions that in fact supplant democracy. We 
believe in democracy, as my hon. colleague knows. However, when 
my colleague talks about different kinds of speeches he might want 
to reflect in the mirror or have his leader reflect in the mirror about 
the kinds of speeches his leader is giving to the ethnic communities 
and business communities in Quebec City and Montreal, the 
Toronto business community or to the California community.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's comments 
regarding Quebecers are quite scornful. Quebecers have made the 
distinction and they have no trouble understanding the words of the 
present Quebec premier, Mr. Lucien Bouchard.
<P>
	The hon. member referred to Mr. Bouchard's visit to California. 
What the premier said there was consistent, for it was exactly what 
he said in Quebec, which is: ``Yes, we must separate from Canada 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2860"> 2860 </A></B>
<P>
to become a  sovereign country.'' A sovereign country is never tied 
to another country.
<P>
	Quebec does not wish to be more sovereign than France or 
England. To become a country, it must separate, of course. It is 
obvious from the speech of the member opposite that history keeps 
repeating itself: as they do not know history, Reform members 
have no idea of what is really at stake or, rather, they did not follow 
the referendum debate in Quebec.
<P>
	I remember the hon. member in the Jacob case. Here again, 
Reform members do not know the background. They are unaware 
of the Referendum Act and of the tripartite agreement. They do not 
know what the question was, and now they criticize us.
<P>
	No part of Mr. Bouchard's speech can be compared with the 
contradictory and inconsistent speeches made by the Prime 
Minister who, within one week, on the same subject, on an 
extremely important issue concerning democracy, said three totally 
different things. The hon. member would benefit from reading his 
leader's speeches to see how different they are.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
going to begin my speech by noting that the government has passed 
up its own first slot in terms of speaking in this debate. Obviously it 
wants to gauge what all the parties are going to do before it has a 
position. This is fairly typical of the government and on this 
particular question it is totally irresponsible. Let me make that 
absolutely clear.
<P>
	The motion states that the House recognize or adopt as its own 
the statement by the Prime Minister in 1985: ``If we do not win, I 
will respect the wishes of Quebecers and let them separate''. I draw 
the attention of the House to the French version which reads ``will 
accept separation''.
<P>
	I am rising today on behalf of my party to oppose this motion. 
However I do want to thank the official opposition for bringing this 
motion before the House for a couple of reasons. It will allow some 
frank discussion of what is an important subject. There should be a 
clear communication between Quebecers and other Canadians on 
this. I also thank the official opposition for drawing the attention of 
the House to the inconsistencies of many Quebec federalists on 
these matters, particularly the inconsistencies of the Prime 
Minister.

<P>
	The Prime Minister's position on these kinds of issues over the 
year has been an absolute mishmash of confusion. During the 
referendum itself he said, as has been pointed out, that the 
referendum result would be irreversible and that it would lead to 
separation. Then he also insisted that separation could never 
actually happen. He even suggested it would never be tolerated.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has said recently that he opposes a unilateral 
declaration of independence. Then of course there is the 
aforementioned quote and others which suggest he would be open 
to accepting it. There is a pattern by the Prime Minister in 
particular of very dangerous vagueness, of a lack of clarity and 
outright contradiction on a subject that probably more than any 
other subject before the House requires absolute precision.
<P>
	Instead, over the years, when it comes to relations between 
Quebec and the rest of Canada, between English Canadians and 
French Canadians, we have seen from many traditional federalists 
dishonesty, vagueness and the outright manipulation of political 
and ethnic symbols. Probably the best example of that is the entire 
debate on the distinct society clause, which I hope to address in my 
remarks today.
<P>
	The history of contradiction and mixed messages reached a 
dangerous crescendo in the last referendum. The Prime Minister 
was asked by the leader of the Reform Party at the beginning of the 
campaign whether he would take the results of the referendum 
seriously, whether he would recognize that the vote would be either 
yes or no, one way or the other. The term was 50 per cent plus one. 
The leader of the Reform Party also asked if the Prime Minister 
would recognize that the vote had important and lasting 
consequences.
<P>
	The Prime Minister, who only days before had said the vote was 
irreversible, in a sudden about face refused to give a straight 
answer to that question. Instead he attacked the leader of the 
Reform Party saying that it would be irresponsible to break up the 
country on a single vote, et cetera. He went on to suggest that he 
would not even recognize a vote to separate under any 
circumstances, although of course he was vague on that.
<P>
	That was a very interesting response. It set the tone for the entire 
referendum campaign. It is so typical of the way the Quebec 
Liberals have handled this debate. In making that kind of an answer 
he was, as he always is, deliberately sending mixed messages to an 
English speaking audience and to a French speaking audience.
<P>
	In English speaking Canada he was taking the position that the 
country was indivisible, that it was certainly not divisible by this 
tiny vote and that he would stand up against it. He would stand up 
against the Bloc and the Reform Party to ensure that the country 
stayed together. However, in French Canada he sent a very different 
message. The message was that voting for separation really would 
have no consequences. It was a message that undermined the entire 
federalist campaign. As we know, every street corner in Montreal 
had a sign that said ``separation''. All of a sudden they could vote 
yes and there would not be separation.
<P>
	It ultimately led to the Prime Minister's complete about face at 
the end of the campaign. Far from waging a campaign simply 
against separation in Verdun, he began  to make all kinds of 
promises about constitutional and other changes. Actually, he did 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2861"> 2861 </A></B>
<P>
not promise constitutional change, as he has pointed out. He sort of 
hinted at it. He was actually just promising change, but he wanted 
people to think it was constitutional change. Then he tried to get 
out of that after the referendum. That is his pattern of behaviour.
<P>
	More important and something the Prime Minister still does not 
seem to realize is that he sent a mixed message on both sides of the 
question. It is impossible for him to get up and say that he does not 
recognize 50 per cent plus one, without sending the message that he 
does not recognize it either way. When in the end, the result was a 
very small victory for the no side, the Prime Minister's message 
that small votes do not count meant that he had snatched defeat 
from the jaws of victory. It is not surprising that no one accepts the 
result of the referendum as final. He himself said it was not, 
especially when it was by a small majority.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	The contradictions do not end there. Since the last referendum 
the Prime Minister has made a statement to the Government of 
Quebec which does reflect the views of Canadians both inside 
Quebec and outside Quebec. He said that the Government of 
Quebec should forget about sovereignty, get on with the economy 
and respect the results of two referendums which have rejected 
sovereignty. I would agree with that.
<P>
	However, the Prime Minister himself insists on resurrecting 
elements of his own constitutional agenda which have been twice 
rejected. The distinct society clause was rejected in Quebec and 
outside of Quebec in a national referendum on the Charlottetown 
accord. In the case of the Meech Lake accord, it was rejected 
without a referendum vote because nobody in the Conservative 
government would even dare put that to a referendum. It is 
important to note it was rejected in the Liberal leadership race by 
the Prime Minister himself who ran against it and got elected by 
being against it. He now wants to resurrect it. It is absolutely 
incredible. And we wonder why there is mistrust among Canadians 
on subjects like this one.
<P>
	The government has intervened in the Bertrand decision, the 
case that brought this matter to the fore. My party and I have said 
that we support the intervention on the narrow issue that the 
Minister of Justice is intervening on. That is the issue that the 
Constitution and Canadian law must be respected and do have a 
role to play in any process of secession by a province. Even here 
there are contradictions.
<P>
	I asked the Minister of Justice, what is the precise role laid out 
by the Constitution? What is the process of separation which they 
are defending? He said that he did not know. Experts have different 
opinions, the government has none. There is a role for the 
Constitution although we do not know what it is.
<P>
	It is even more contradictory than that. I asked the government 
this very question in October 1994. I posed questions to the then 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, who is now President of the 
Treasury Board, on October 17, 1994. On October 19, 1994 during 
the adjournment debate, I received an answer from the then 
parliamentary secretary which contained this statement: ``The 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, for whom I am answering, 
believes that the Constitution acts do not provide any rules or 
procedures for secession of one of the provinces''.
<P>
	In other words, the government then had a position which was 
almost identical to the position of the Government of Quebec: that 
the Constitution is silent on these matters, and it is a political 
question. If we read the rest of the answer that is precisely what the 
government stated, although now it has changed its position. It has 
changed its position to the correct position, nevertheless it has 
changed its position once again.
<P>
	Yesterday the leader of the Reform Party moved a motion in the 
House to assert that this House will not recognize a unilateral 
declaration of independence. Unbelievably, I was asked by 
members of the press why we would possibly want this motion 
moved and voted on. It is for the simple reason that this 
government and the Prime Minister cannot stick to a line on this 
issue for more than a month. That is why. Let us get it on the 
record.
<P>
	My view reflects the fact that I believe there is a serious split in 
cabinet on the entire issue. It is not a split only between soft liners 
and hard liners. It is a split between certain ministers from Quebec 
and certain ministers from the rest of Canada who I will not name.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	It is a dangerous game. We have had this problem from the 
Quebec Liberals, not only federally but provincially, for some 
years. They want to take a position that is federalist and 
pan-Canadian, but only from Quebec's perspective. It is the 
dangerous game of being very unsure whether we defend the rights 
of Canada as a country and as a nation.
<P>
	That is why we have, as we see once again this week, Mr. 
Johnson in Quebec City and the Quebec Liberal Party constantly 
being led into position where they are parroting the constitutional 
framework of the Parti Quebec, the framework of 
self-determination.
<P>
	This has led particularly to the Quebec Liberals and traditional 
federalists in Quebec putting all their eggs in the basket of the 
distinct society clause. This in itself is a perfect example of why we 
have misunderstanding and distrust in this country.
<P>
	It is a nationalist slogan. What would be the purpose of putting 
the distinct society clause in the Constitution? The purposes are 
unspecified. When we say it means special status, the government 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2862"> 2862 </A></B>
<P>
says it does not mean  special status. When we amend it to make it 
clear that it does not mean special status, the government says it 
would have no legal weight. We ask would it unify the country. 
Yes, but it would be a first step. A first step to what?
<P>
	The basic reality is, as we have seen so many times with this 
issue, that when we are speaking in French in Quebec, the distinct 
society clause means everything. When we are speaking in English 
outside Quebec, the distinct society clause means nothing.
<P>
	In the process Quebec federalists repeat in effect the very 
assertions of the separatist movement that Quebec's language, 
culture and civil code have never been recognized in Canada. That 
is absolute nonsense. Nevertheless it is the very basis on which the 
proposal for the distinct society clause is made.
<P>
	Let me move to our position. It is clear. As Reformers, we would 
not accept simple separation on a simple majority vote. We voted 
on this issue in the House in December 1994 when we voted on the 
concept of self-determination. Only a few months ago we had a 
debate on whether Quebecers constituted a people under 
international law and therefore possessed the right to 
self-determination.
<P>
	In both cases we took the position that Quebec does not have a 
unilateral right to separate on its own terms. This has always been 
our position. We took that position consistently.
<P>
	At that time the government in those votes and debates also took 
that position. It is important for English Canadians to understand 
that the Progressive Conservative Party has not taken that position. 
It has taken the opposite position. It has consistently skipped 
debates and votes whenever that issue has arisen.
<P>
	Although we do not accept a referendum result in Quebec as a 
mandate to separate, we accept it as a mandate to negotiate 
separation. We would expect the federal government to respond in 
good faith. We would go farther. Canadians, including Quebecers, 
are fooling themselves if they believe a yes vote would lead to 
anything other than separation.
<P>
	It would begin an inexorable path that would lead to separation 
in one form or another. We would maintain one probably not 
satisfactory to either Quebec or to the rest of Canada. It would 
probably damage our interest. Nevertheless it would lead in that 
direction.
<P>
	We have also made clear that we would accept majority rule as 
the basis for that mandate to negotiate. No other position will really 
be tenable as a practical political matter.
<P>
	Let me make some reference to the last referendum. I would 
qualify it to this degree. In the last referendum the Government of 
Quebec was measuring 50 per cent plus  one. It was measuring a 
majority as a majority of the valid votes cast.
<P>
<B>(1120 )</B>
<P>
	We say a majority should be measured as a majority of all votes 
cast. In other words, a majority cannot be attained through the 
elimination of ballots or through invalidating ballots. That must 
never be allowed to happen. The majority must be absolutely clear 
in the sense that it must be a majority of all votes.
<P>
	Let us recognize the political realities. We know the 
demographics in the province of Quebec. The majority of votes 
cast for a sovereignty mandate should be the majority of the 
population, which represents not only the majority of the people 
and the majority of the Government of Quebec but a majority of the 
ridings and, I know this is heresy, a majority of the ethnic base of 
the francophone Quebec voter.
<P>
	Not that I consider that any more legitimate than anybody else's 
vote, but we have to face facts here. No matter what the Bloc 
Quebecois says, we are dealing with an ethnic nationalist 
movement and it is seeking an ethnic nationalist mandate. That is a 
political reality.
<P>
	I also point out for those federalists who accuse me or the 
Reform Party of being weak on Canada by accepting a majority 
vote, it is not Canada which suffers from this position. It is the 
government and the people of Quebec who suffer from this 
position, as I pointed out during the referendum debate.
<P>
	If the Government of Quebec chooses to go into a negotiation in 
which it has 51 per cent or 52 per cent support, it puts itself into an 
extremely weak bargaining position with the rest of the country. 
The rest of the country does not want separation. Many people, if 
not most, are extremely hostile to Quebec's separation. Therefore 
Quebec will face the rest of Canada which is united. It will bring 
Quebec to the table in a position where Quebecers are extremely 
weak and divided.
<P>
	The final deal would have to be ratified by all partners to the 
Constitution. Our preference is that it would be through a 
referendum. However, let me be clear this is not to stop Quebec 
from leaving. It is my opinion that if Quebec ever voted to leave the 
rest of Canada would want Quebec gone. That would be the attitude 
that would take hold after a few weeks.
<P>
	What the rest of Canada would insist on is a settlement that 
respected its interests. The rest of Canada has lots of bargaining 
chips if it would choose to go to the table and would receive a 
settlement that would reflect its interests. Ultimately Quebec 
would be in a far worse position than it would be if it simply stayed 
in Canada and negotiated a renewed federalism.
<P>
	Canadians and Quebecers should back away from extreme 
positions on this. One extreme position is that we can respect 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2863"> 2863 </A></B>
<P>
democracy without respecting the rule of  law. Some sovereignists 
say that. Some federalists say we can respect the rule of law and 
somehow work around the democratic will. That is also a 
dangerous position and the thinking of some Liberals.
<P>
	The only position if we ever get into this secession thing deeper 
is to proceed by respecting both. Even Mr. Lévesque in 1980 
insisted there had to be a mandate to negotiate and there would 
have to be a second referendum. I ask the sovereignists to look at 
their own history on this matter.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what the hon. member opposite has just said worries me. I 
wonder if he has seriously considered the implications.
<P>
	The hon. member told us that if an unspecified majority of 
Quebecers were to vote yes in a referendum, he would prefer 
Quebec to leave Canada as quickly as possible, or something of the 
kind.
<P>
	Has the hon. member seriously considered the implications of 
what he has just said? Does he not think those are irresponsible 
comments, especially on the part of someone who claims to be a 
federalist, and that comments such as these are almost as difficult 
to swallow and as contemptuous as those made by the Bloc 
Quebecois? Would it not be appropriate for the hon. member to 
reconsider his remarks to the effect that, in a matter of weeks after 
a referendum, Canadians in the rest of the country would like to get 
rid of Quebec as a member of the Canadian federation?
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	Does he not think a close association that lasted more than 130 
years is worth more than a few weeks before we decide to get out of 
it? Does he not think, after reconsidering, that his remarks should 
at least be left out of the Debates of the House of Commons?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to draw to the 
attention of the Chair the fact that the whip has used the word 
``contemptuous'' about the Bloc Quebecois, and therefore about 
members in this House. Could he please withdraw these words?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> With all due respect, I think 
the hon. member for Richelieu is on a point of debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, this position is in no 
way different from the one I have expressed in the past, even on 
national television. I am saying that we have to abide by the rule of 
law and the democratic will. If a majority of Quebecers vote for 
separation, it will be impossible to ignore that reality.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> But the same thing holds true for 
Quebec. Even if separatists are applauding, it is  just the same for 
Quebec. If a large proportion, if millions of Quebecers vote no, that 
political reality cannot be ignored in the separation process, and 
that is why there is a partitionist movement. That is a reality.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am surprised the member finds this shocking. Of course 
Canadians want to keep their country together. They do so on the 
assumption that all Canadians want to be a part of this country. We 
have been told for years, and I think the majority of Canadians 
believe it, that in spite of the separatist movement and its power the 
majority of Quebecers want to remain Canadians.
<P>
	However, if the majority of Quebecers express themselves in a 
democratic referendum and make it absolutely clear they do not 
want to be Canadian, it will change the attitudes in the rest of the 
country.
<P>
	If we have intelligent leadership that cares about the interests of 
the rest of the country, we will then negotiate sovereignty in a way 
that is quick, peaceful and in the best interests hopefully on both 
sides but particularly in the best interests of Canada.
<P>
	We will not go to the barricades and have civil strife and unrest 
so that we can keep a bunch of Liberals sitting in power in Ottawa.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the speech made by the hon. member for Calgary West 
reminded me why the referendum results went from 40 per cent in 
1980 to 49.4 per cent in 1995. Why is it that Canada has not been 
able to adapt to this change?
<P>
	Does the hon. member think that the results were affected 
somewhat by the message the current Prime Minister has been 
sending for some time now, when he says that there is no 
constitutional issue to be resolved in Canada, and that the problems 
between Quebec and Canada will solve themselves if we have a 
good government?
<P>
	Is it not also the result of trying to hide the fact that the Canadian 
Constitution is outdated and needs to be changed, from a federalist 
point of view-need I remind you that I am a sovereignist-but 
from a federalist point of view, after 16 years of inaction on the part 
of the federal government?
<P>
	Is it not the best message that could be sent to Quebecers to let 
them know that the system cannot be changed from the inside, but 
more importantly, outside Quebec, in the rest of Canada, does the 
message sent by the current Prime Minister not lead Canadians to 
believe that there is no problem, when in fact we are still faced with 
a problem and all we see are the Prime Minister's efforts to create a 
diversion?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2864"> 2864 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
a federalist reformer, I have said several times that we do 
recognize the need to overhaul the federal system.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	That, by itself, cannot explain the influence of the sovereignty 
movement, because there is also dissatisfaction with the federal 
system in Western Canada, although there is no sovereignty 
movement. Of course, the situation is different over there.
<P>
	I agree that the message the Prime Minister sent during the 
referendum campaign was a factor in the increased support for 
sovereignty. What I am saying is that if Quebecers had voted No, 
they would have obtained nothing. It would have meant the status 
quo, of course, the end of everything, but no reform and no 
promises.
<P>
	In his speech in Verdun, the Prime Minister said that if 
Quebecers were to vote No, they would get some constitutional 
concessions, and that a Yes vote would not be dangerous since 
separation would never occur.
<P>
	With messages such as these, we can easily explain, I think, why 
the undecided voted Yes. I hope we can change things around, but it 
will not be easy. We will try to convince Quebecers of two things: 
first, that the federal system can be significantly changed for all 
Canadians, and second, that sovereignty will not change the 
important stuff and will not be in the best interest of the province of 
Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> I want to thank the 
hon. member for Calgary West who at least understands and is 
honest enough to say that he does not agree with referendums that 
lead to separation but that he would accept that kind of outcome. If 
Quebecers really vote for Quebec sovereignty, he will respect their 
decision. What is important to him is not simply a fistful of money 
or his own job as a member of Parliament but the will of the 
Quebec people, and I want to thank him for this.
<P>
	However, he has encouraged us to continue negotiating. I want to 
remind him that we have been trying to change the federal system 
since 1763, since 1838. Only recently, as he said himself a moment 
ago, the Prime Minister promised real changes during the 
referendum campaign. Everything was recorded but we did not get 
anything.
<P>
	Does the hon. member really believe that it is possible to change 
the federal system? I do not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is not an easy 
question. We suggested reforms to the federal system and I note 
two things. The Prime Minister made commitments for reform 
during the referendum campaign but he did not have a mandate 
from the rest of Canada to do so. Moreover, do not forget that it was  
Lucien Bouchard himself who spoke about a partnership with the 
rest of Canada. This was his basic platform during the last 
referendum campaign.
<P>
	To have a partnership you need partners. A partnership is 
negotiated among partners. It is impossible even for the 
sovereignist movement to go on with its own plan without 
negotiating or getting the consent of the rest of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, having had the honour of being elected by the citizens 
of Saint-Laurent is particularly relevant to what I am about to say 
in my maiden speech in the House of Commons.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	I will never be able to express my gratitude sufficiently to the 
constituents of Saint-Laurent-Cartierville for having chosen me 
to represent them. This diverse and harmonious community 
inhabited by over 50 different nationalities fully integrated into 
Quebec society intends to exercise its right to remain in Canada.
<P>
	I dedicate what I am about to say to all the young people I met 
during my election campaign last March. Sometimes speaking in 
French, sometimes in English, and often in one or two other 
languages, a sign of how well equipped they are for the next 
century, these young people sadly told me that they were not sure 
their future lay in either Saint-Laurent or Montreal. They belong in 
Montreal and to the surrounding area, that is their home.
<P>
	And rather than leave, they must convince their fellow 
Quebecers that belonging to more than one group is a source of 
strength, not a contradiction. They must convince their fellow 
Canadians in other provinces that recognizing the distinct nature of 
Quebec is not a threat to Canadian unity, but, on the contrary, a 
wonderful way to celebrate one of Canada's fundamental 
characteristics.
<P>
	The theme of this first speech will be democracy, which the 
opposition invites us to consider this May 16, 1996, by presenting 
the following motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the House endorse the declaration of the Prime Minister of Canada, who 
stated in <I>Straight from the Heart</I>, in 1985, ``If we don't win, I'll respect the 
wishes of Quebeckers and let them separate''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This quotation is taken out of context by the official opposition. 
It goes back to 1970, and was repeated by Mr. Chrétien in 1985. In 
the same passage, the current Prime Minister also said: ``We'll put 
our faith in democracy. We'll convince the people that they should 
stay in Canada and we'll win''. We'll put our faith in democracy. 
This reliance on democracy is an invitation to us to consider the 
meaning of the word, and to ponder the teachings of the classics.
<P>
	Let us begin with that great prophet of democracy, Alexis de 
Tocqueville, and I quote: ``I consider unjust  and ungodly the 
maxim that, in matters of government, a majority of the people 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2865"> 2865 </A></B>
<P>
have the right to impose their will''. De Tocqueville is saying that 
democracy cannot be limited to the rule of the majority, because it 
also includes the rights of minorities, and of the smallest minority 
of all, the individual, the flesh and blood citizen.
<P>
	The second classical author I call on is Jean-Jacques Rousseau. I 
will quote him in English.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The more important and serious the decisions, the closer the 
prevailing opinion should be to unanimity.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	What Rousseau is setting out here is not obviously the rule of 
unanimity, which clearly is impracticable. What he is showing us is 
that the more a decision threatens the rights of individuals, the 
more irreversible it is and the more it involves future generations, 
the more stringent must be the procedure democracy selects for the 
adoption of this decision.
<P>
	This brings me to the fine quote of Montesquieu linking 
democracy tightly with universal solidarity. And I quote: ``If I 
knew of something that could serve my nation but would ruin 
another, I would not propose it to my prince, for I am first a man 
and only then a Frenchman-because I am necessarily a man, and 
only accidently am I French.
<P>
	Tocqueville, Rousseau, Montesquieu. With these three French 
authors, no one can accuse me of distancing myself from 
francophone tradition. In fact, however, the principles these three 
set out are universal and have guided constitutional democracies in 
establishing their rules of law. These principles are the reason that 
the supremacy of law is a vital component of democracy.
<P>
	Let us apply these principles to the issue dividing us in Canada: 
secession. It is defined as a break in solidarity among the citizens 
of a common country. This is why international law in its great 
wisdom extends the right of self-determination in its extreme form, 
that is the right of secession, only in situations where a break in 
solidarity appears <I>de facto</I> to be incontrovertible.
<P>
	Let us quote, in this regard, the five experts who testified before 
the Bélanger-Campeau Commission. I quote: ``Legally, Quebec's 
eventual declaration of sovereignty cannot be based on the 
principle of the equality in law of peoples or their right to 
self-determination, which permits independence only to colonial 
peoples or to those whose territory is under foreign occupation''.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	The secessions that have taken place to date have always arisen 
out of decolonization or the troubled times that follow the end of 
totalitarian or authoritarian regimes. It is not simply a matter of 
chance that no well established democracy with a minimum of ten 
years of  universal suffrage has ever faced secession. Such a break 
in solidarity appears very hard to justify in a democracy. 
International law and democratic principles encourage the people 
to remain united, not to break up.
<P>
	While democracy infers that a group of people cannot be forced 
to remain within a country against their will, it also sets strict rules, 
which, under the law, maximize the guarantees of justice for all. 
That is what we learned from near-secessions that have taken place 
in stable democracies. It may be a good idea to review the 
procedure by which Switzerland, a fine example of democracy, 
managed to separate the Jura from the canton of Berne while being 
fair to all. We could also look at how the U.S.A. intend to consult 
the Puerto Ricans on their political future. Closer to home, we 
might consider the approach taken recently by Canada to transfer 
title, in all fairness, on lands in the north.
<P>
	Now it the time to calmly set, under the law, mutually acceptable 
secession rules. Not two weeks before a referendum. The 
Government of Canada does not deny in any way the right of 
Quebecers to pull out of Canada, if such is their explicit wish. 
However, the Government of Canada does object to the Quebec 
government's plans to unilaterally set and change as it pleases the 
procedure according to which this right will be exercised and 
expressed. A unilateral declaration of independence would fly in 
the face of democracy and the rule of law.
<P>
	What is not known is whether the secessionist leaders are able of 
entering into a calm, level-headed and reasoned discussion process. 
The coarse language used recently by the Premier of Quebec, who 
compared Canada to a prison, or Quebec's Minister of Finance, 
who compared the Canadian government to former totalitarian 
communist governments, is an insult to the memory of the East 
German and North Korean people who were killed trying to escape 
totalitarian prisons. Independentist leaders must take a grip on 
themselves and make responsible statements. Otherwise, they 
should be prepared to call every constitutional democracy a prison, 
as well as the separate entity they want to make of Quebec, whose 
territory they consider indivisible and sacred.
<P>
	With mutually consented rules in place, Quebecers could then 
examine with some clarity the argumentation used by secessionist 
leaders to try to convince them to break their ties of solidarity with 
their fellows citizens of the maritimes, Ontario and western 
Canada. It is my belief that Quebec will find this secessionist 
argumentation very shaky.
<P>
	Exploitation cannot be used as an argument to justify secession, 
when the Canadian federation is one the most generous for 
have-not regions. Neither can self-determination, or the lack of it, 
be used as an argument, as few other federal components in the 
world benefit from as much autonomy as Quebec does within the 
Canadian federation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2866"> 2866 </A></B>
<P>
	The only argument secessionist leaders could put forth is the 
fact that, according to several established criteria, Quebecers could 
be considered as a people and that each people must have its own 
state. This idea that any group of people that is different from the 
others must have its own state is terribly untrue.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	The flawed equation ``one people, one country'' would blow up 
the planet. Experts have estimated at around 3,000 the number of 
human groups with a recognized collective identity. But there are 
fewer than 200 states in the world.
<P>
	Quebecers and other Canadians should reflect on this fine 
statement by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and I 
quote:
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	If every ethnic region or linguistic group claimed statehood there 
would be no limit to fragmentation, and peace, security and 
well-being for all would become even more difficult to achieve.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canada is the last place in the world where identity-based 
fragmentation should be allowed to prevail. In the eyes of the 
world, this country symbolizes better than any other the ideal of 
how different people can live together in harmony in a single state. 
In this regard, let us listen to President Clinton, who said, and I 
quote: ``In a world darkened by ethnic conflicts that literally tear 
nations apart, Canada has stood for all of us as a model of how 
people of different cultures can live and work together in peace, 
prosperity and understanding. Canada has shown the world how to 
balance freedom with compassion''.
<P>
	Many others have said the same thing about Canada. I will give 
just one other quotation:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canada is a land of promise and Canadians are people of hope. It 
is a country celebrated for its generosity of spirit, where tolerance 
is ingrained in the national character.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
``A society in which all citizens and all groups can assert and 
express themselves and realize their aspirations''. These words, 
which have the ring of truth and could have come from Sir Wilfrid 
Laurier or Pierre Trudeau, were pronounced on July 1, 1988, by the 
then Secretary of State, the Hon. Lucien Bouchard.
<P>
	The Canadian government's priority is to help Quebecers and 
other Canadians reconcile. They must speak to one another, stay in 
closer contact, clear up misunderstandings, find ways to make their 
federation work better, and celebrate Quebec's distinctiveness 
within Canada. They must reconcile, not only as fellow  citizens 
but also as inhabitants of this poor planet. Let us bet on democracy.
<P>
	Therefore, if the amendment put forward by the hon. member for 
Berthier-Montcalm is deemed to be in order, I, seconded by the 
hon. member for Simcoe North, move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting the words ``in 1985'' and by 
substituting for those words the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``in the 1970s and in 1985 as outlined on page 150 of his book <I>Straight from 
the Heart</I>: ``We'll put our faith in democracy. We'll convince the people that 
they should stay in Canada and we'll win''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, I respectfully submit that one cannot 
move an hypothetical amendment, like my colleague just did, 
because he said ``if''. The issue is under advisement.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	It is under advisement and as long as you have not ruled on the 
original amendment, the only thing one can do is to move an 
amendment to the amendment by the member for 
Berthier-Montcalm. In this sense, you have to rule on that matter.
<P>
	Should you decide-and I do not think that your ruling will be 
along this line-but should you decide that the amendment is out of 
order, another amendment could then be moved by a member. This 
is very clear when you look at citation 581 which deals with 
amendments to amendments; it says that you cannot move an 
amendment when there is already one that has not been disposed 
of. This is the case now, and the issue is under advisement.
<P>
	You must make a ruling. Once this is done, the whole series of 
amendments and amendments to amendments will start over again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I agree that there can be only one amendment. However, 
must I remind the Chair and the House that the Speaker has not yet 
ruled on the amendment? If the amendment is out of order, which it 
is not at this very moment, the minister is certainly allowed to 
propose another amendment.
<P>
	The Chair, with the help of the Table officers, is considering 
whether the first amendment is in order, for two reasons: first, with 
regard to the substance of the amendment and, second, with regard 
to the point of order I raised as to whether the member had the right 
to propose an amendment when he did. Once the Chair rules that 
the first amendment is in order, if this is indeed the case, then the 
minister's amendment will clearly be out of order.
<P>
	But until the Chair rules on the first amendment, there is no 
amendment before the House and, therefore, the minister has the 
right to propose an amendment as he did.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2867"> 2867 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Once again, I thank the 
House leader of the official opposition, the hon. member for 
Laurier-Sainte-Marie, and the chief government whip, the hon. 
member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell.
<P>
	First of all, I want to address the amendment brought forward by 
the official opposition. I believe it is in order in terms of substance. 
As for its timeliness, that issue is being considered as we speak. 
Therefore, there is no amendment before the House at this moment.
<P>
	As for the amendment proposed by the minister, I will take it 
under advisement based on the ruling I will give in the first case 
and also on whether it is in order.
<P>
	I will read to you the text of the amendment proposed by the 
minister: ``That the motion be amended by deleting the words ``in 
1985'' and by substituting for those words the following: 'in the 
1970s and in 1985 as outlined on page 150 of his book Straight 
from the Heart: ``We'll put our faith in democracy. We'll convince 
the people that they should stay in Canada and we'll win''. The 
whole matter is being considered, and the Speaker will give his 
ruling to the House as soon as possible.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to remind the minister and the House that the 
Prime Minister's answer followed a question which reads as 
follows: ``At a town meeting-a-Liberal got up and said 
'Chrétien, when will you tell the separatists that there will never be 
independence, that the federal government will never allow it to 
happen?'.'' And the answer was: ``But I did not agree-it is Mr. 
Chrétien who is speaking-. 'We'll put our faith in democracy,' I 
said. 'We'll convince the people that they should stay in Canada 
and we'll win. If we don't win, I'll respect the wishes of 
Quebeckers and let them separate''.
<P>
	Can the minister explain to us why, in the amendment which he 
proposed and which may be in order, he deleted the part of the 
quote which appears in the Prime Minister's book: ``If we don't 
win, I'll respect the wishes of Quebeckers and let them separate''.
<P>
	Why did the minister delete that part of the quote? In that quote, 
there are two parts: if we win, we will do this; if we lose, we will do 
that. That is how democracy works, it is making a choice between 
the two.
<P>
	That is the question I am asking the minister, but I have one last 
comment to make.
<P>
	In his speech, he said that Canada is practically the best country 
in the world. I would like to submit to him, for his consideration, a 
few examples of what Quebecers and French speaking Canadians 
experienced in Canada.
<P>
	The first example is the assimilation process in Manitoba, where 
the French language was forbidden for many years, with the 
acceptance of the rest of Canada for a very long time.
<P>
	The second one is conscription, which was imposed on 
Quebecers despite their decision not to take part.
<P>
	The third one is that, ever since unemployment rates have been 
calculated, unemployment in Quebec has always been 2, 3 or 4 per 
cent higher that the national average. Is that an interesting 
economic result? Is that acceptable?
<P>
	For the fourth example, I will ask why, since 1982, all the 
successive governments in Quebec, whether federalist or 
sovereignist, never accepted to sign the Constitution that was 
patriated without Quebec's consent? Do you really think that this 
makes for an interesting country for Quebecers?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dion:</B> Mr. Speaker, the moment you mention the possibility 
of winning, it infers the possibility of losing.
<P>
	As I said before, what is at issue here is not the right of 
Quebecers to leave Canada if they so desire and clearly state it, but 
the Quebec government's claim to unilaterally choose and change 
at will the process through which this right will be exercised.
<P>
	Let the official opposition name one constitutional democracy 
that would accept a unilateral process of this kind.
<P>
	As far as the examples mentioned by the hon. member, countries 
have their problems, but it is no reason to split. If you want to go to 
the UN and explain why you want to secede, you will have to come 
up with more serious reasons than this. You will not get anybody to 
shed any tears over the problems we have had with the 1982 
Constitution. As a matter of fact, other countries will be very 
surprised to hear your objections, since Quebec representatives in 
the federal government supported the new Constitution, since we 
can produce polls showing that at the time Quebecers tended to 
support Mr. Trudeau rather than Mr. Lévesque, since Mr. Lévesque, 
instead of calling a referendum, appeased his own party, since in 
the following elections the separatist party got only 2 per cent of 
the votes; if you add up all this, you will not get anybody in the UN 
to shed any tears with your arguments.
<P>
	All they will say is that Canada is a normal country, a democracy 
where there are disagreements, and that these disagreements must 
be settled through mutual consent and within the law.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before continuing with 
questions and comments, I would like to remind all the members 
that they are to address their comments to the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I first 
want to say that I am outraged at the lack  of respect shown by the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2868"> 2868 </A></B>
<P>
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs to 49.4 per cent of 
Quebecers who voted yes, when he said that it would not make 
anyone cry.
<P>
	To exercise a democratic right is not to try to make people cry.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	But to try to sell an idea such as that of secession is more serious. 
Still, I should thank the minister for his excellent ``Politics 101'' 
lecture and for referring to three great classics: Tocqueville, 
Rousseau and Montesquieu. His speech took me back to my 
university years. I want to quote someone whom the minister 
probably considers to be a great classic too, the current Prime 
Minister.
<P>
	Let us put things in their proper context with this more recent 
statement from the Prime Minister: ``I am a democrat. I said it in 
1980 in many speeches to that effect. If we had not recognized that 
Quebec could make the decision to separate, we would have acted 
differently. We could have used some powers. We did not use 
them''. This is from the Bélanger-Campeau report, December 17, 
1990, page 1515.
<P>
	I have a question for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
Is he now telling us, after two referendums, after saying twice that 
the rules were fair and legal, after recognizing that we were 
democrats, that this is no longer the case and that the federal 
government will use the other powers alluded to in 1990? If so, 
what are these powers?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dion: </B>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's ideology makes him 
incredibly touchy. It is an ideology based on paranoia, an ideology 
that makes people feel constantly insulted, humi-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The 
minister, who just recently arrived in this House, should not only 
learn its rules, but also the basic rules of politeness and respect for 
others. It is unacceptable on his part to use such words, first 
because he is insulting a colleague and, second, because he is 
insulting those who suffer from this disorder. It is unacceptable and 
the minister should retract himself and show that he was well 
brought up.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I did not hear anything that 
would lead me to ask the minister to retract. However, I will take a 
look at the blues and deal with the issue if need be. I think we are 
engaged in a very important debate.
<P>
	Both sides of the House stressed the importance of being 
respectful of each other. It may be even more important in the case 
of debates such as this one, on the official opposition's motion.
<P>
	I am giving the floor back to the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dion:</B> Mr. Speaker, I talked about an ideology based on 
paranoia. I would never say that the people themselves were 
paranoid and I do not want the hon. member to believe that I was 
talking about him personally. I just wanted to say that the ideology 
he supports makes people feel constantly insulted and under attack. 
I would say that the members' reaction and their request to have me 
gagged and to make me apologize show that I am right to point out 
how paranoid their ideology is.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out that the 
minister explained what he meant by ``an ideology based on 
paranoia'' by saying: ``Your ideology makes you feel paranoid'', so 
that refers more-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Again, this is more a matter 
for debate than a point of order. I would remind the House that 
when some expressions or words are aimed at a group, they are 
deemed acceptable. However, when they are directly aimed at 
another parliamentarian, that is, as we say in Cornwall, a horse of a 
different colour. So, with due respect for this debate being held in 
the House of Commons during the 35th Parliament, I would ask the 
minister to resume his speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dion:</B> Mr. Speaker, to say that some part of my speech was 
insulting to Quebecers is really paranoid, because, the 49.4 per cent 
of Quebecers who voted Yes did express their views. What was 
unfortunate during the last referendum is that we did not know 
exactly what a Yes vote would mean, because the rules of the game 
were not quite clear, as evidenced by the fact that the leader of the 
Yes side, Mr. Parizeau, on the night he lost the referendum, said 
that the 49.4 per cent was the result of the indépendantiste vote, an 
expression he never had the fortitude to use during the campaign 
itself. Rest assured that the Government of Canada is very worried 
about such a process that any constitutional democracy would find 
irresponsible.
<P>
	As regards the quotes the opposition likes to use, which are in 
essence its only argument, I would like to point out that all the 
quotes the opposition have come up with show that Canada is quite 
ready to respect democracy but would never accept what any 
constitutional democracy would also find unacceptable, which is 
the violation of the law and a unilateral declaration of 
independence.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister can test the theory he has just described on the public to 
find out if they see it the same way. I put my seat on the line and 
invite him to try and get elected in my riding with its francophone 
majority. In order to get elected, the minister had to go through the 
side door. But let him face the people, let him try his luck in my 
riding. I wager my seat against his theories. He will see just what 
the public thinks of his wonderful philosophy. Democracy is a 
majority vote, the desire of a people to  become sovereign or 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2869"> 2869 </A></B>
<P>
remain in a federation. When the Russian federation broke up, the 
first government in the world to recognize all the small sovereign 
countries was the Canadian government. But when the same thing 
happens at home, it is a different story? Come on. What sort of 
respect for democracy is that?
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dion:</B> Mr. Speaker, the first government in the world to 
recognize the new republics created after the fall of the soviet 
empire was the Russian government. If I were happy with the state 
of opinion in Quebec and in Canada, I would be at the university 
today.
<P>
	I am well aware that numerous francophones in Quebec believe 
that it is a contradiction to identify themselves both as Quebecers 
and as Canadians, and that they must resolve this contradiction by 
leaving Canada.
<P>
	I intend to do everything in my power to convince my fellow 
Quebecers that they must not give up on Canada. If ever I fail, after 
rules expressing clearly and unambiguously what the people of 
Quebec want, we should take steps in a manner that is fair to 
everyone to bring about what for me would be a very sad thing, the 
secession of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member for Saint-Laurent-Cartierville just made an interesting 
speech in some respects, even though parts of it were rather 
shocking. It was interesting because this man, who has his own 
vision of Canada, concluded his speech by saying that if he cannot 
convince Canadians that his vision is the right one, he will be sad.
<P>
	The problem is that, since 1960, Quebec's premiers of all 
political stripes have repeatedly tried to find a real place for 
Quebec through negotiations with the rest of Canada. And they 
have repeatedly failed to obtain satisfactory results.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker: </B>I am told the member for Mercier will 
have the floor to resume debate after questions and comments. The 
minister has 30 seconds to respond and I will then give the floor to 
the member for Mercier.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dion:</B> Mr. Speaker, from what I understood, the member 
just said that Quebecers and Canadians have had an ongoing 
dialogue for 30 years, which is normal in any federation, and that, 
according to her, this dialogue would justify the break-up of 
Canada.
<P>
	Well, I will repeat what I have been saying since the beginning. 
We are talking about Canada, one of the most decentralized 
federations in the world. In my mind Canada is the most 
decentralized. Experts recognize that it is one of the most 
decentralized federations.
<P>
	When we talk about one of the most independent federations in 
the world, if Quebecers let themselves be persuaded that it is not 
enough and that they have to separate from the rest of Canada, one 
of the problems  they would face is that they would have to explain 
to their own minority that they refused one of the most generous 
independent status in the world without even being able to give 
them the same status. It would be sad and very difficult to swallow. 
A reconciliation within Canada would be so much better.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member for Saint-Laurent-Cartierville is not the first to enter 
politics and to think that, because he is a politician, he will 
convince Canadians. I also have a great perception of Canada.
<P>
	I came to the conclusion that the best way for this country to 
continue to give an example it has often given is to recognize, 
given its nature, that it cannot and does not want to give Quebecers 
the place they believe is necessary and, consequently, that it is 
better at this time, as many authorities in English Canada are 
starting to say, to make preparations to recognize that Quebec can 
become sovereign, and to negotiate an agreement with it. This 
agreement is called a partnership in Quebec and can be called 
otherwise elsewhere. This is where the real solution, the real hope 
lies. Not in plan B which the minister himself has flirted with.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	Not in plan B that, unfortunately-and I was extremely sad 
about this because I know many colleagues opposite-the Liberal 
caucus discussed in Vancouver. The latest episode in plan B is the 
government's involvement, I do not know on whose advice, in 
lawyer Guy Bertrand's case.
<P>
	I would like to point this out: for all lovers of democracy, what is 
Mr. Bertrand's logic? It is that Quebecers, who are a people, used 
their right to self-determination in 1867? So much for democracy. 
What referendum took place in 1867?
<P>
	Guy Bertrand is saying: ``Quebec used its right to 
self-determination once, when members of Parliament voted for 
Confederation'', but we know that Confederation was a colonial 
act, the British North American Act. This Constitution was only 
patriated in 1982 and Quebec parliamentarians unanimously voted 
against it.
<P>
	When Guy Bertrand says Quebec used its right to 
self-determination, when only members of Parliament voted for 
Confederation, he is leading the government down a road it may 
not wish to take, as it has spoken of letting Quebec clearly express 
its will.
<P>
	This issue of democracy is central to the evolution of the 
sovereignist movement in Quebec. And I can even tell you that, 
over several years, I heard Guy Bertrand say repeatedly and 
eloquently that the 1982 Constitution was loathsome and that the 
National Assembly of Quebec could declare independence alone, 
without a referendum.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2870"> 2870 </A></B>
<P>
	On the contrary, the sovereignist movement is the full 
embodiment of democracy. Over the years, it has, to quote a 
prominent French politician ``accepted that its progression is the 
progression of the slowest''. This was said by Michel Rocard, 
who, at that time, confessed that he had great respect for our way 
of doing things. Yes, Quebec's sovereignist movement accepts all 
the demands of democracy. And its behaviour has been exemplary 
in that regard.
<P>
	Quebecers are becoming increasingly aware that they have no 
future for them unless they become masters of their own destiny, 
because they cannot take it any more, as many Canadians are tired 
of constantly discussing the basic conditions required for Quebec's 
recognition. Canadians are fed up, Quebecers are fed up, but this 
situation must be resolved once and for all.
<P>
	We are a people and a nation. This is an inescapable fact. This is 
a historical fact. This is a fact the hon. member recognizes when he 
says that, sadly, it must be acknowledged that sovereignty is 
desirable, because the people of Quebec are the ones who will 
choose to become sovereign. The inescapable fact is that we are a 
pluralistic people and nation, which accepts and includes everyone 
living on its territory.
<P>
	We equate sovereignty with the quest for the majority's 
approval, an approval that has been sought long and hard, with all 
the difficulties we went through.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	To come out with statements to the effect that Quebecers would 
not make anybody cry is to ignore the emotions felt worldwide 
during the last referendum, where, I would say, the world admired 
the open and honest debate that went on and the way people 
accepted the result. Even if it was extremely close, there was no 
expression of indignation from the many Quebecers, not only 
francophones but also people of other origins with whom I have 
worked for a long time, from all those people who, for years and 
years, have dedicated their life to this cause in which they strongly 
believe.
<P>
	The government has to stop trying to prevent Quebecers from 
proposing to Canada the ideal image that the minister should 
commit to, and that is to ensure that Quebec and Canada, once 
sovereignty is achieved, negotiate a partnership that will allow 
everybody, both Canadians and Quebecers, to address the most 
pressing issues that we have to set aside until this situation is 
resolved.
<P>
	I have a series of amendments. If the Bloc amendment is 
rejected, I propose the following amendment to the amendment 
proposed by the member for Saint-Laurent-Cartierville:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the following be added after the word ``win'':</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``adding that he would recognize the independence of Quebec if he lost''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	If the amendment put forward by the member for 
Berthier-Montcalm is deemed to be in order, I move an 
amendment to the amendment.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the amendment be amended by adding the words ``the book'' between 
the words ``in'' and ``<I>Straight from the Heart</I>''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	If both amendments are defeated, I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by adding the following immediately after the 
word ``stated'':</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``in his book, <I>Straight from the Heart</I>, on page 150''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> My colleagues, this is becoming very 
complicated. We will consider the matter and give an opinion as 
soon as possible. In the meantime, we can talk about any other 
subject related to today's debate.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member quoted a well known French 
political figure, Michel Rocard, to support her argument. I am 
always pleased to hear the extraordinary variety of points of view 
that come to us from that great pluralistic democracy, the Fifth 
French Republic, which proclaims itself an indivisible whole, and 
whose Prime Minister was recently quoted as finding the very idea 
of holding a referendum in Corsica on the future of Corsica 
ridiculous.
<P>
	The truth is that the Canadian government's position on the right 
to secede is more conciliatory than that of many other western 
democracies. It is not saying that secession is always forbidden, but 
rather that a decision such a secession by one province cannot be 
made unilaterally. It must be done with the consent of the parties 
concerned and within the law. That was the position of the 
Government of Quebec and of the Government of Canada in 1980, 
and it is still the position of the Government of Canada.
<P>
	Mr. Bouchard needs to get hold of himself. Instead of insulting 
the East Germans and the North Koreans who lost their lives in 
escaping totalitarian regimes, instead of saying that Canada is not a 
real country, he ought to keep in mind that, in free societies, in 
democratic and peaceful societies, the usual way to arbitrate 
disagreements and to settle conflicts is to plead one's case before 
the courts and to recognize the right of one's adversaries to do 
likewise.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to tell the hon. 
minister, who no doubt is much more aware of this than I, having 
taught political science for a long time, that facts come before laws, 
and that before there were constitutions there were peoples who 
constituted themselves before creating constitutions.
<P>
	The people of Quebec are a people and a nation, one which, I 
repeat, has never subscribed to the Constitution. The Constitution 
began by being colonial, and when it was brought to Canada 
through the good graces of  Trudeau, the National Assembly in its 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2871"> 2871 </A></B>
<P>
entirety rejected the 1982 Constitution. Since that time, in Canada, 
in Canada outside Quebec, there has been a debate on how Quebec 
will, or will not, be allowed to rejoin the ranks of the Constitution.
<P>
	During his term, Prime Minister Mulroney, regardless of what 
other qualities or shortcomings we ascribe to him, tried to make 
room for Quebec in the 1982 Constitution. This gave rise to Meech, 
this gave rise to Charlottetown.
<P>
	This is the truth, a fact, not just a notion. What needs doing is not 
to convince Quebecers that Canada is an ideal country, but to find a 
concrete solution so that Quebec will at last have the powers it 
requires to develop as it is entitled to develop.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dion:</B> Mr. Speaker, the whole basis is there. What law is the 
hon. member speaking of? It is not international law, which extends 
the right of secession only in cases of decolonialization or manifest 
exploitation. It is not Canadian law, which does not give a province 
the right to secede unilaterally.
<P>
	So, if she is not speaking about a formal law, she should 
recognize that it is high time we talked calmly about rules that 
would be acceptable to everyone in order to ensure that Canadians 
are treated fairly in all circumstances.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, never in this fairly long stretch 
separating us from the two referendums has the Government of 
Canada said such things. It always distinguished between politics 
and the Constitution.
<P>
	Why, when we almost won the latest referendum, did it change 
its opinion? I hope with all my heart that my colleague opposite is 
not the person advising this government to change its attitude, 
which was the right one in a democracy.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, to start with I would like to recall the thrust of the 
opposition motion. In the seventies the Prime Minister of Canada 
said, as reported in his book <I>Straight from the Heart</I>, ``We'll put 
our faith in democracy. We'll convince the people that they should 
stay in Canada and we'll win. If we don't win, I'll respect the 
wishes of Quebeckers and let them separate''. The aim of the 
opposition motion is to have the whole House repeat this statement. 
It is to have the Prime Minister confirm that the rules he believed in 
in the seventies, and stated in his book, will still apply tomorrow. 
This is the objective of the motion.
<P>
	We can safely say that when the present Prime Minister made 
that statement in the seventies, he probably had data telling him 
that the sovereignist side would never win a referendum. This is 
probably what he had in mind, given the numbers he had. But the 
inability  of the federal system to reform itself has resulted in the 
sovereignist vote increasing from 22 per cent in 1970, during a 
Quebec election, to 40 per cent in the 1980 referendum to 49.4 per 
cent last year. Each time we make progress because federalists 
make promises they do not keep.
<P>
	Obviously I understand the fear of the present government when 
it says that it cannot change the structure and come up with a 
proposal that will please Quebecers. If the present government 
were to say that it was going to negotiate between peoples, that it 
was going to enshrine in the Canadian Constitution the recognition 
of the two founding peoples of Canada, and that it would allow 
Quebec to develop-
<P>
	Quebecers have been making these claims for a long time, but 
proposals never came to anything because they did not meet the 
needs of both peoples of Canada. We can understand this and there 
is a solution to it, which is what we are proposing. The aim of 
today's motion however is to make sure it will be done 
democratically.
<P>
	I would like to clarify something the Prime Minister keeps on 
repeating. He says: ``You lost the referendum twice, now respect 
democracy''. Democracy does not mean we have to stop believing 
what we believe in when we lose an election, democracy is keeping 
on trying to convince people we are right and they are wrong. To do 
this, you need tenacity. Evolution of thought is important also. In 
Quebec, mainly at the suggestion of René Lévesque, we gambled 
on the profound belief that we would solve the issue 
democratically. We accepted the 40 per cent result of 1980 and the 
more recent 49.4 per cent.
<P>
	The current premier of Quebec was the first to accept the results. 
We play according to the rules of democracy. We are sovereignists 
and we say so very clearly. We will call an election, we will win 
and we will prove to Quebecers that this is the right solution, 
because you cannot make a flower grow by pulling on it, you have 
to nurture it. We are ready to follow the pace of the people and to 
present arguments to convince them.
<P>
	What we need now is for the government, and particularly the 
Prime Minister, to confirm their respect for democracy because, 
over the last few days, we have heard all sorts of contradictory 
statements saying that it cannot be done with just over 50 per cent, 
that other conditions will have to be met. The federal government 
and Quebec must agree on the question.
<P>
	There is a paternalistic attitude now, just as there was in 1982. 
The rules of democracy were followed then. In 1982, the 
government said: ``We are legitimate, we have 74 federalist Libreal 
members out of 75 seats. Therefore, we have the right to do so. And 
we will put our seats on the line during the next election''. 
Democracy prevailed because after the following election, they 
were all gone. Since then, the movement has gathered momentum. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2872"> 2872 </A></B>
<P>
We went from nationalist members within the Conservative Party 
to the 53  sovereignists we now have, because of the Meech Lake 
accord demise.
<P>
	There will be sovereignists until Canada solves the problem with 
Quebec and, for us, the solution is sovereignty. If the government 
has another solution to propose, it should put it on the table and let 
Quebecers judge its relevancy. At the present time, the game is not 
played on the rink. The federal government is trying to change the 
rules and the players' position on the rink. That is no solution. It 
does not solve anything. It is like negotiating a collective 
agreement, when, instead of agreeing at the negotiating table, 
people start negotiating the back-to-work protocol, the strike issue, 
etc. That is irrelevant.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	So, the objective of the opposition motion is to allow the Prime 
Minister, the current government, to reaffirm what he said in the 
1970's and 1980's, that is, if they do not win, they will let 
Quebecers separate.
<P>
	The current Prime Minister made that statement. When he says: 
``I'll let Quebeckers separate'', which in his vocabulary is about the 
most terrible thing that could happen, there is a fundamental 
recognition that, if the results make sovereignty possible, it will 
have to be accepted by the Canadian government.
<P>
	It is also important to let everyone see clearly that we do not live 
in a society that has always existed as such. Canadian 
Confederation is not timeless, it did not come into existence at the 
same time our planet did. It is the result of compromises that led 
British colonies to become allied in a kind of organization in 1867. 
It was finalized by a vote in their respective legislative assemblies. 
That is when it was decided to found Canada.
<P>
	In a sense, Quebecers could be said to be overdoing it. They have 
developed an acute sense of democracy. After joining the Canadian 
confederation by a vote in the legislature, they saw fit, in light of 
the evolution of political thinking, to impose upon themselves as a 
requirement that a democratic vote be held in which more than 50 
per cent of the population should vote in favour.
<P>
	Come to think of it, the result in 1995 was fantastic. Ninety-three 
per cent of Quebecers voted in the referendum, a participation rate 
unsurpassed anywhere in the world. It was a tight vote. The verdict 
came in. And we said: ``We shall continue to be a part of Canada 
according to the wishes of the majority''. The majority expressed 
its wishes and we acknowledged the referendum results.
<P>
	We also tolerated, without displaying any violence, having 
20,000, 25,000 or 30,000 persons-the exact number was never 
determined- come to Montreal to tell us in an ultrapaternalistic 
way that they would decide in our place what we want. I think that 
we can be proud of  our democratic process in Quebec. It is fair to 
say that this may be behind the largest consensus in Quebec.
<P>
	While realizing there are differences of opinion, we are prepared 
to live with them and to defend them. We are even prepared to take 
up the fight once again and to accept what comes of it. We are 
asking the Liberal government to take our lead. It should simply 
respect whatever decision Quebecers make and stick to its guns.
<P>
	In conclusion, I move as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by adding, immediately after the word ``stated'', 
the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``in his book entitled <I>Straight from the Heart</I>, on page 140''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I also move the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the amendment moved by the hon. member for Mercier be amended by 
adding the word ``autobiographical'' immediately before the word ``book''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
I move this amendment to an amendment.
<P>
	I hope that members will rise in this House to tell us that, first 
and foremost, they are liberals and democrats and that they will 
respect whatever democratic decision is made. Being a democrat 
must take precedence over being a federalist or a sovereignist. In 
the decisions facing us, it is of paramount importance that the 
wishes of the people be respected.
<P>
	I expect the current Prime Minister of Canada to do so and to 
reaffirm by voting in favour of this motion that he still holds the 
same views on the matter, that democracy will prevail in his 
decision and that he will accept the result of the next referendum, 
which will see Quebec become a sovereign state.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> We shall carefully consider the official 
opposition's latest initiatives. We will settle everything at the same 
time, and as quickly as possible.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will be very brief to compensate for the length of the 
official opposition's speeches and their repetitive, rhetorical 
arguments as they pretend not to realize they have lost this debate.
<P>
	In this matter, the Government of Canada defends the right of 
Quebecers and other Canadian citizens to be treated fairly under 
the law whatever the circumstances. As I just said, the official 
opposition is pretending it does not realize it has lost the debate. 
They can quote the Prime Minister of Canada as much as they 
want; all this would do is show that, as a good democrat, the Prime 
Minister has no intention of keeping a people against its will once 
this people has clearly expressed its desire to leave Canada.
<P>
	At the same time, it has been clearly demonstrated in this debate 
that a unilateral declaration of independence would violate the rule 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2873"> 2873 </A></B>
<P>
of law and go against democratic  principles and would not be 
recognized by any constitutional democracy on this planet.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have an interesting proposal for the 
minister. If, as he claims, the Prime Minister is indeed a good and 
great democrat, then let us hear him reassert his position. He 
simply has to vote in favour of the motion. The Prime Minister 
simply has to tell his government colleagues that he is not afraid of 
repeating what he said in 1970 and wrote in 1985. This is what we 
are asking him to do on this opposition day.
<P>
	The minister also says that we lost the debate. The fact is that the 
democratic and political debate is not over in one day. This is not 
the society of a thousand years, as former Prime Minister Trudeau 
once said. We have a right to democratically discuss ideas. We had 
a good example of that last week. The debate on the issue of sexual 
orientation as a prohibited ground for discrimination lasted for over 
25 years in Canada.
<P>
	People maintained their position and, thanks to their tenacity, 
finally got what they wanted. This is how changes are brought 
about in the political process. This is what we were taught in the 
past by very democratic people, in Quebec and in Canada. We 
learned that political debates are the way to go, that battles are won 
by convincing people with good arguments.
<P>
	Right now, new arguments come up every day and more and 
more people are in favour of Quebec's sovereignty. It is so because, 
in the days that preceded the October 30 referendum, the Prime 
Minister, speaking for the current federal government, said to us: 
``We will make major changes''. It is the second time in 15 years 
that we are told major changes will take place, and this time again 
there are no changes. Each time, some people realize they made a 
mistake by voting no, and the next they will vote yes. This is the 
reality. This is the real political debate, and we will win it.
<P>
	The people of Quebec has been forging ahead for a long time. 
The fact that sovereignists have been here for over two years is not 
a coincidence. For a long time, we believed that we could become 
sovereign by simply forming the government in Quebec City. We 
realized it was important to send a message to Canada and to make 
the country realize that sovereignty was not a folksy thing in 
Quebec, but a deeply rooted feeling. Such was the message sent by 
Quebecers to all federalists at the 1993 election.
<P>
	Quebecers said: ``We want to be represented by a majority of 
sovereignists, and we want Canada to know that. We will make 
decisions accordingly and we will always do so in the respect of 
democracy''.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	Today, we are merely asking the Prime Minister to say that, yes, 
he will continue to respect the rules of democracy. The decision 
rests with him.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the member has used the pronoun nous or we many times: 
We in Quebec want this, we in Quebec want that. He and I both 
agree there is a lot of democracy going on here now and then.
<P>
	When he uses the term ``we'' is he not also trying to speak for the 
majority of Quebecers who voted no in the last referendum? How is 
he able-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> I can tell my hon. colleague that when I say ``we'' as 
democrats, I am referring to the vast majority of Quebecers. Last 
October's referendum, in which 93 per cent of the population went 
to the polls, shows very clearly that we Quebecers are democrats. I 
would add that Canadians, too, are democrats. What we are asking 
today is for the Prime Minister and the Government of Canada to 
reaffirm that they still stand for democracy and that they are always 
ready to accept the rules of the game, even though they are feeling 
the heat.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Halifax, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will share my 
time with my colleague, the hon. member for St. Boniface.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am very pleased to take part in the debate today. I am glad the 
hon. member from Scarborough asked the hon. member from 
Kamouraska the question about to whom the term we refers. When 
I look at the quote in the original motion, I remind hon. members 
opposite that in 1985 we did win, just as we did win in 1995. As far 
as I am concerned we refers to all Canadians, whether you live in 
Quebec, British Columbia, or the Yukon, whether you speak French 
or English, the we includes all of us from sea to sea to sea.
<P>
	The Bloc motion seeks to sow confusion once again among 
Canadians, then blame it on the federal government. I draw to the 
attention of the House and the attention of Quebecers in particular 
to the true intention behind the words of the secessionists. I will 
deal briefly with a number of myths that they enjoy circulating.
<P>
	First, let me talk about transfers to the provinces, the first myth 
we have to deal with. Quebec's current finance minister said when 
he tabled his last budget that Quebec is the most indebted province. 
Indeed, its economy generates revenues for the provincial 
government which fall below the Canadian average.
<P>
	It is precisely to remedy the inequalities this situation could 
cause over time that the federal government provides Quebec with 
generous and completely unconditional equalization payments 
every year. A federal system can afford to do that, unlike a separate 
and separated heavily indebted country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2874"> 2874 </A></B>
<P>
	Quebec is not the only province that receives federal transfer 
payments. My province of Nova Scotia does, as do Prince Edward 
Island, Newfoundland and New Brunswick. It is because we are 
a federation, it is because as a federation we believe in assisting 
each other.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you will remember there was a time when 
Quebecers and maritimers, eastern Canadians in general, paid $5 a 
barrel over the world price for oil in order to get the Alberta oil 
industry moving. That is what a federation is about, helping one 
part of the federation when it is needed.
<P>
	Transfers to the provinces represent a substantial part of the 
federal government's program spending. We could therefore not 
reasonably streamline the spending in the last budget without 
touching those transfers, but they are still there and will continue to 
be there.
<P>
<B>(1250 )</B>
<P>
	Nevertheless, the cuts in transfers to the provinces that were 
made are far from disproportionate. They will require from all the 
provinces an effort to adjust that is well below the one that the 
federal government is imposing on itself. Thus, in the next two 
years the federal government intends to reduce its own spending by 
7.3 per cent while the main transfers to the provinces will be cut by 
only 4.4 per cent. In other words, the federal government is being 
much easier on the provinces, Quebec included, than it is on itself.
<P>
	The Bloc is also trying to make people believe that cuts in 
federal transfers affect Quebec more than the other provinces. 
However, it has taken pains not to mention Le Hir study which 
stated that Quebec's share in that regard has remained stable for 15 
years at around 30 per cent, which is clearly greater than Quebec's 
proportion of the Canadian population.
<P>
	Moreover, the Bloc is also not mentioning that the reform 
announced in the last federal budget in this regard even gives 
additional protection to the seven less wealthy provinces, which 
include Quebec, because equalization payments to these provinces 
will continue to increase in the next four years. Equalization 
payments to Quebec will thus increase by around $200 million for a 
total of $4.05 billion in 1996-97. Yet another myth that just does 
not cut it.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois and the Parti Quebecois refuse to respect 
the will of Quebecers, a majority of whom have twice chosen to 
stay in Canada and work to renew it.
<P>
	However, the Bloc and the péquiste keep singing the same tune. 
For example, their unsubstantiated inflating of the cost of overlap 
and duplication to $3 billion is another deliberate attempt on their 
part to discredit Canadian federalism and to hoodwink the people 
in the province of Quebec. Yet they will never admit that.
<P>
	In the vast majority of cases where the two orders of government 
are active in the same field of activity, their  actions complement 
one another because they serve different clientele or provide 
different services to the same clientele. This federalism works and 
works well for the people of Quebec as it works and works well for 
the people of every province and territory in this great country.
<P>
	Furthermore, they are very reluctant to tell people that the few 
serious analyses of the subject show that the savings achieved 
would be less than $1.7 billion and that those are gross savings 
which would be offset in the event of secession by the loss of 
economies of scale and by higher interest rates on government 
borrowing.
<P>
	The overlap being described to Quebecers is much less than our 
friends across the aisle would have them believe. It certainly is not 
worth destroying a country for. We intend to minimize unnecessary 
overlap while ensuring that we effectively manage overlap that is 
inevitable.
<P>
	There are other myths too. Our opponents across the aisle like to 
suggest that Canadian federalism is responsible for the high 
unemployment in Quebec. That has nothing to do with the 
Canadian system. Everyone, except it seems the Bloc, seems to 
know that unemployment is a problem for all western countries. 
Some unitary states have unemployment rates much higher than 
Canada. Canada is taking the necessary measures to implement the 
fullest employment policy possible.
<P>
	The IMF forecast of a 2.9 per cent economic growth in 1997 is 
good news for all Canadians and for the Canadian government, 
whose main objective is to revitalize the economy and improve our 
economic union. The standard of living of all Canadians depends 
on it.
<P>
	The secessionists may not like it but Canada actually works a 
whole lot better than their highly speculative smoke and mirrors. If 
federalism is so harmful to the economy and jobs in Quebec why 
do economists unanimously conclude that the job situation in 
Quebec would worsen considerably following separation?
<P>
	The secessionists like to suggest that the Government of Canada 
gives Quebec money only for unemployment insurance, social 
assistance and seniors. Yet the federal government has always 
invested considerable sums of money in Quebec year after year in a 
large number of projects that are essential to its social, economic 
and cultural development. Furthermore, statistics show 
unequivocally that Quebec within Canada is very profitable for 
Quebecers. In fact, Quebec provides 21.7 per cent of the federal 
government's revenues and receives more than 24.5 per cent of 
federal spending.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	Let me give a few examples of that spending: 47.5 per cent of 
Canadian industrial milk quotas go to Quebec farmers; 32 per cent 
of Canada Council funding is distributed to Quebec, specifically in 
the literary and  publishing field, Quebec receives 40 per cent of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2875"> 2875 </A></B>
<P>
council funding; more than 50 per cent of financial assistance from 
the Department of Canadian Heritage for publishing and 
distribution of publications goes to Quebec; 37 per cent of Telefilm 
Canada funding is distributed in Quebec; 33 per cent of federal 
funding for the reception and integration of immigrants goes to the 
Government of Quebec, even though Quebec receives less than 20 
per cent of the immigrants who come to Canada each year; $204 
million is earmarked for the economic development of the regions 
of Quebec by the Federal Office for Regional 
Development-Quebec.
<P>
	How can the Bloc seriously claim that federalism is hurting 
Quebec's development and keeping it in a state of dependency? It is 
beyond understanding. It is smoke and mirrors. It is a sham and one 
that I do not think Quebecers believe any more than other 
Canadians do.
<P>
	Canada is seen as the jailer of Quebec. That is the latest outrage, 
to compare Canada to a prison in which Quebec is being held 
against its will. Is this a strange sense of humour, or are the 
secessionists serious? Indeed, how can Quebec want to separate 
from their jailers today and yet want to reassociate with them 
tomorrow?
<P>
	Belonging to an political and economic union brings with it the 
obligation of co-operation and consultation. In today's 
interdependent world, doing what I like is not the objective of any 
responsible government. It is not even feasible.
<P>
	Quebecers have twice chosen with their hearts and with their 
heads not to mortgage their future and their children's future when 
they benefit from economic and political association with Canada 
and are part of the country with the best quality of life in the world.
<P>
	If our friends across the aisle want to help Quebecers, they will 
have to do their part, abandon their completely unrealistic ideology 
and work with the majority of their fellow citizens who want and 
will help us all to build a better Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened carefully to what the hon. member had to say. I can tell you 
that her speech will not go down in history since she constantly 
changed subjects and contradicted herself. Let me quote some of 
her comments. She talked about confusion. If there is someone who 
is confused in this House, it has to be the Prime Minister. We were 
given an example earlier. We were told that in 1970 he did not do 
the same thing as he did in 1985.
<P>
	One day, he says something, the next he goes back on his word. 
Let me give you an example. Not so long ago, the Prime Minister 
said in this House that we would ``have to face the music'' at the 
next referendum. At the time, he was sure he was going to win. 
When you are sure to win, there are rights, no such considerations. 
He was sure to win, so he could say anything.
<P>
	The situation has changed since then, with the growing 
popularity of the sovereignist movement, the results of the last 
referendum and the things yet to come. After the next referendum, 
it will be over. Why? Because the federal government has not been 
able since 1867 to deal with federalism as it should have. Initially, 
within the federal system, the federal government and the 
provinces were supposed to share Canada's sovereignty. Little by 
little however, the federal government got involved in areas of 
provincial jurisdiction, so much so that we now have a dominating 
and centralizing federal government.
<P>
	As for the hon. member's conclusion, we will come back to that. 
I see, Mr. Speaker, that you are indicating I have only one minute 
left. I will not be able to say much, but let me sum up what I wanted 
to say. When we are told that we lost the last referendum, I always 
answer that federalism did not even exist in 1867.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	Everybody agreed more or less with what was put on the table. 
But in 1980 the results were 44 per cent and in 1995, 49.6 per cent. 
Quebecers are becoming aware that, within the current system, we 
are not progressing, we are moving backwards, and at the next 
referendum, I am convinced we will get between 55 per cent and 60 
per cent of the votes.
<P>
	I just wish people would understand one thing: the only way to 
put an end to the constitutional debate is for federalists to propose a 
real program if they have one, but unfortunately, they do not have 
any.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand our difficulty. The hon. 
member suggested that I was confused and contradicted myself. He 
did not give any examples, ergo I cannot refute his utterly 
ridiculous charge.
<P>
	He said that we do not share. I gave eight examples of where the 
federal government not only shares but shares most generously in 
federal funds with the province of Quebec without even getting into 
the transfer payments.
<P>
	Finally, our federation certainly has its problems as do other 
federations. I know we can overcome these problems because on 
this side of the House we have faith in the sense and sensibility and 
the good hearts of all Canadians whether they live in Quebec or 
anywhere else in the country. I am sorry the hon. member over 
there does not. However we will prevail.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to add my voice to those trying to describe the ties of 
affection that have long existed, and that still exist, between 
Canada and Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am adding my voice in the House today to those of my 
colleagues in the government, first to set the record  straight for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2876"> 2876 </A></B>
<P>
Canadians, especially Quebecers, and at the same time to respond 
to the disinformation that is continually being put forward by the 
Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	The Bloc would have Quebecers and other Canadians believe 
that Canada is a prison, that the federal government is a jailer 
keeping Quebec bound and gagged and thus preventing it from 
expressing itself on issues that are important to its future. Nothing 
could be further from the truth. That is the type of hysterical 
rhetoric we have become used to hearing from the Bloc as it 
defends its now secessionist position.
<P>
	Let us look at the motion tabled by the Bloc today which is yet 
another example of that kind of disinformation. The Bloc would 
like the government of a country that has flourished for 129 years 
to remain mute, absolutely mute with regard to a unilateral 
declaration of independence that would flout the Canadian 
Constitution in the courts.
<P>
	Accordingly, the Bloc would like to see the 23 million Canadians 
outside of Quebec stand idly by and give the secessionist 
government a blank cheque by abstaining from discussing this 
matter. It is now the secessionist government itself that has brought 
us to this point. The Government of Canada now has an obligation 
to respond even though a majority of Quebecers have expressed yet 
again their desire to remain within the Canadian Confederation.
<P>
	As Mr. Daniel Johnson, the leader of the opposition in Quebec 
has said, this is a phoney problem. But because the PQ has 
instigated this legal debate, let us do it calmly and coolly. That is 
the position of the Canadian government. Anger and emotion must 
not win out over reason. Unfortunately that is how the BQ and the 
PQ are reacting.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Let us talk about some myths. I will read you a quotation: ``We 
must separate from Canada, this prison, and fly on our own. Once 
separated, we will re-establish our association with our good 
partners in Canada''. This is what is really behind the Bloc's 
motion. We are accused of hiding our true motives, while, for them, 
duplicity and camouflage are the order of the day.
<P>
	The motion introduced by the Bloc Quebecois today is proof yet 
again. The public is not fooled. It is well aware that the official 
opposition enjoys in this House considerable freedom of 
expression that only a country as democratic as Canada would 
tolerate. It can also tell the difference between reality and the 
myths the Bloc Quebecois delights in spreading.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	I will now speak about the vitality of the federal system.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Bloc is trying to make people believe that Canadian 
federalism is outmoded, that it has not changed at all, that it is 
keeping Quebec in a straitjacket. The truth is very different. 
Members opposite may not like it but the federal system is doing 
very well indeed.
<P>
	The Fathers of Confederation who came from Quebec and three 
other provinces wisely chose for Canada in 1867 the model of a 
federal state in order to pool the assets and channel the energies 
that existed in our wide geographic space. Above all, they wanted 
as a population to be able to live and evolve within a political 
system that would be able to adapt, improve and renew itself over 
time and as needed. It was a system in which each part preserved its 
distinctiveness but the whole was more than the sum of its parts.
<P>
	The evidence has been in for a long time that the flexibility of 
the Canadian federation has allowed and still allows all provinces 
to develop in accordance with their priorities and their specific 
characteristics while ensuring that they enjoy the benefits of 
belonging to this great country of Canada.
<P>
	Throughout our history the sharing of powers, which has been 
revised on an ongoing basis, has yielded many benefits in the form 
of flexibility, innovation and initiative. For example, it has allowed 
the federal government to set national goals and standards which 
apply to all Canadians, while leaving it to the provinces to ensure 
that services best correspond to their own realities.
<P>
	Quebec has been no exception to that rule, as evidenced by the 
tremendous progress it has made particularly in the past 30 years. 
The quiet revolution took place inside a united Canada, yet in all 
that time Quebec was indeed a part of that same Canadian 
federation the Bloc is now denouncing.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The distinct nature of Quebec. From its very beginnings, Canada 
has always striven to improve, to modernize and to secure for its 
citizens the best possible quality of life. Quebec's contribution to 
this process has been unflagging and unique, especially because of 
its French roots. But it has also derived benefit from belonging to 
Canada, through such things as the support of federal institutions in 
matters of culture, which has given it considerable influence on the 
world scene.
<P>
	Quebec is an asset to Canada, a treasured part of our country. 
Canadians are attached to the distinct character of Quebec. It is 
recognized and encouraged by the Canadian government.
<P>
	It is therefore in this spirit that the Prime Minister asked 
Parliament to make commitments regarding Quebec and to pass in 
this House a resolution recognizing Quebec as a distinct society. By 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2877"> 2877 </A></B>
<P>
so doing, the  Parliament of Canada made official one of the Prime 
Minister's commitments and, as the only body that can speak on 
behalf of all Canadians, gave a solemn undertaking. It thus 
recognized an obvious reality, the distinct character of Quebec, 
based on its language, its culture and its legal system.
<P>
	This open-mindedness of the federal government with respect to 
the distinct character of Quebec is part of what distinguishes 
Canada from its neighbour to the south.
<P>
	I would now like to look at the division of powers, because this is 
an area in which we differ greatly from a number of other 
federations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the wake of significant changes it initiated to modernize the 
federation, the government announced in the speech from the 
throne that it intended to open a new chapter in federal-provincial 
relations. From now on the watch words will be respect, dialogue, 
consensus and co-operation. We will be partners in serving 
Canadians.
<P>
	Those are not just empty promises. The federal government's 
commitment has already been translated into tangible measures, 
such as the approval of detailed action plans to improve federal and 
provincial services, an action plan that has been rejected by the 
secessionist government whose avowed aims are to make people 
believe that the federal government serves no purpose and to break 
up Canada.
<P>
<B>(1310 )</B>
<P>
	The same secessionist government wanted us to withdraw from 
labour market training. After investing $1.5 billion in that field in 
1995-96 and $433 million this year, we agreed that we would 
withdraw from labour market training. We did not want to do that 
to make the secessionists happy. What was important to us at the 
end of the day was for the governments' actions to complement one 
another so that high quality services are delivered at the lowest cost 
to taxpayers by the government in the best position to do so.
<P>
	The Canadian government has also indicated its firm intention to 
withdraw from other fields of activity, such as forestry, mining and 
recreation and to transfer its responsibilities to local or regional 
organizations or the private sector.
<P>
	The federal government will respect provincial jurisdiction by 
limiting its own spending power with regard to co-financed or 
shared cost programs in fields of provincial responsibility. 
Together with the provinces, it is also seeking out new forms of 
consultation and joint management in certain areas, such as 
environmental management, social housing, food inspection, 
tourism and freshwater fish habitat. It is also actively pursuing the 
establishment of a Canadian securities commission.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I see that my time is up. In closing, I therefore invite my 
colleagues across the way to reconsider this federation, to look at 
what it has done for us and what it can still do if we work together 
with the goal of improving it.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first, what 
stands out from my hon. friend's intervention is that he regrets that 
Quebecers do not see Canada his way. Indeed, the 49.4 per cent of 
Quebecers who voted Yes in the referendum already knew what the 
hon. member wants them to be convinced of. This is not the issue.
<P>
	When the hon. member talks about the distribution of powers, he 
should remember that the main power, which makes the 
constitutional power sharing illusive, is spending power. Spending 
power radically changed the distribution of powers originally 
negotiated by the Fathers of Confederation.
<P>
	Finally, the hon. member should recognize that, when the Prime 
Minister wants to limit the use by Quebec, which is not just another 
province but a people and a nation in its own right, of its 
democratic right through a referendum, the 1867 Constitution was 
originally an act passed by Great Britain for its colonies, achieved 
through negotiations between politicians from each colony, mainly 
because, after the 1837-38 rebellion, in the so-called union of 
Canada, that is, a forced union of what is currently known as 
Ontario and Quebec, nothing worked any more.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I feel that I have nothing to regret in 
what I have said. What is happening is that we have two totally 
different views. What I am calling for is a look at what a federation 
is. Twice, the majority of Quebecers have agreed with what I have 
said, every bit of it.
<P>
	What I find regrettable is that I have heard nothing good said 
about this federation. I find it incredible that even an Opposition 
member cannot say ``Here are three or four very good aspects''.
<P>
	Now, about the Prime Minister again, he has said: ``We will be 
democratic, we will respect Canadian law and international law''.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	As you know, in his 1985 book <I>Straight from the Heart</I>, on page 
140, the Prime Minister says ``We'll put our faith in democracy. 
We'll convince the people that they should stay in Canada and 
we'll win''. That is what he says.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to have the floor, and I would like to ask my colleague opposite to 
explain, since he has been talking for a while now about the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2878"> 2878 </A></B>
<P>
beautiful great country Canada  is, why their popularity in Canada 
has dropped by 7 per cent compared to last month, according to the 
polls.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleague will admit that 
this is a beautiful great country, a country held in esteem by 
everyone on this planet. I trust that he did not want to indicate that 
it was anything other than that.
<P>
	As for the polls, I would be prepared to compare our polls and 
yours across Canada, if that is what you want to do. We must pay 
some attention to polls, but we must not let ourselves be led by 
them. The most important poll of all is the one held on election day 
itself.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
both proud and sad to take part in today's debate on the motion 
moved by the official opposition, which reads as follows and 
quotes the prime minister: ``We'll put our faith in democracy. We'll 
convince the people that they should stay in Canada and we'll win. 
If we don't win, I'll respect the wishes of Quebeckers and let them 
separate.'' This is the subject of our motion based, you will have 
understood, on a quote from page 150 of a book written by the 
Prime Minister entitled Straight from the Heart.
<P>
	I am proud because this is a very important debate, and sad 
because this debate is part of the constitutional debate, which today 
takes a threatening turn, as it has for some weeks now. Indeed, the 
situation is extremely serious and these are difficult times for the 
Canadian democracy. 
<P>
	Both the Prime Minister and the Minister of Justice told us these 
past few days that, in the event of a yes vote in a democratically 
held Quebec referendum, the Canadian government would not 
recognize it because the present Constitution makes no provision 
for one part of Canada to secede.
<P>
	What is important to remember is the underlying meaning of 
such statements. This means that, in the mind of the Prime Minister 
of Canada, the wishes expressed by Quebecers will be subject to an 
amending process requiring the unanimous consent of the 
provinces in order to be recognized. This means that the wishes of 
Quebecers will eventually be subject to the will of Canadians, and 
this supports the argument in favour of not recognizing the 
existence of a Quebec people on this planet.
<P>
	This is in keeping with the evolving federalist thinking. Over the 
last 30 years, we have been a bit annoyed by the growing 
sovereignist movement which English-speaking Canadians have a 
hard time explaining and understanding; then there were different 
theories like cooperative federalism, flexible federalism, 
asymmetrical federalism, cost-effective federalism, the age-old 
renewed federalism, which the Prime Minister mentioned again 
recently, and now we have carping federalism. Carping federalism 
is based on confrontation, on the B plan we could now call the 
Bertrand plan.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	This confrontation is the antithesis of the other movement which 
briefly prevailed and which, after referendums in Quebec, could 
have created a momentum whereby English Canada would have 
found ways to implement the changes promised by Pierre Elliott 
Trudeau in 1980 and by the present Prime Minister in 1995. They 
would have come up with offers acceptable to the majority of 
Quebecers and would have made space for Quebec in the new 1982 
Constitution. But that movement did not endure.
<P>
	There were a few efforts, like the distinct society, but it was a 
distinct society without any content or powers. The Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs said it himself after a conference in 
Vancouver where he almost whispered to his audience that the 
expression ``distinct society'' meant nothing. Maybe he forgot he 
was being filmed, but we saw him on TV in Quebec. This killed the 
rose in the bud because Quebecers quickly caught on that the 
distinct society concept was an empty shell.
<P>
	There was also the term ``principal homeland'' which appeared, 
again through the initiative of the new minister, but it was 
short-lived. Right from the beginning, it sounded fishy.
<P>
	Finally there was a vote on a veto, but giving a veto to each and 
every province meant essentially that they were refusing to 
acknowledge the specific characteristics of Quebec and to 
recognize Quebecers as a people.
<P>
	It is very important to keep in mind the significance of plan B. 
With plan B, instead of encouraging Canadians to think, the federal 
government prefers to attack Quebec. It prefers to attempt to make 
Quebec smaller. It prefers to attack its institutions, its laws, its 
democratic traditions, its right to self-government, which is, once 
again according to the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, only 
valid within Canada. We see he has studied the issue for a long time 
and is very generous toward Quebecers.
<P>
	With plan B, the federal government prefers to go to court 
instead of going to the people of Quebec, especially to a court that 
does not fall under the Quebec government, but under the federal 
government, even though it is called the Superior Court of Quebec, 
a court where judges are appointed by the federal government. So, 
given the process by which judges are appointed, these people are 
part of the federal government and of the federal system. These 
judges will have to make a decision based on the Canadian 
Constitution, which was almost unilaterally repatriated by Ottawa 
without Quebec's consent, a Constitution Quebec does not 
recognize and which it did not sign. By this Constitution, these non 
elected and non accountable judges are being given, no doubt 
sometimes against their will, major political and decision-making 
powers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2879"> 2879 </A></B>
<P>
	Conversely, when a referendum is held democratically, the 
opposing forces, both from the yes side and the no side, have equal 
financial means, at least when Quebec law is respected. When it 
is violated, as the federal government did in October 1995, we 
get the results we have seen.
<P>
	So, a referendum held democratically is called a consultation 
exercise, the will of the people being subjected to the colonialism 
of the courts.
<P>
	It should be pointed out that, for Guy Bertrand, the new ally of 
the federalists, the mere idea of holding a referendum on Quebec's 
future would be illegitimate, undemocratic, abusive, immoral, 
fraudulent and anarchic. With such allies, who needs enemies. This 
is as quoted by Mrs. Lise Bissonnette.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	I will conclude by quoting an editorial writer with <I>La Presse</I> of 
Montreal, who is far from being a sovereignist. Mr. Alain Dubuc 
wrote on May 14, two days ago, in his last paragraph: ``Beyond 
their disagreement on Quebec's future, Quebecers agree on 
believing an honest referendum is not merely a consultation 
exercise and also, that Canada cannot legitimately prevent Quebec 
from leaving Canada if it chooses sovereignty. It is this consensus 
the federal government has attacked through its silences and 
contradictions.''
<P>
	Given the attitude the government has taken by sanctioning plan 
B, the Bertrand plan, I dare hope the Liberal Party of Canada will 
pay the political price one day.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to respond to the comments made 
by my hon. colleague from the Bloc.
<P>
	I believe the majority of the constituents of Prince 
George-Peace River, whom I am pleased to represent in the 
House, want to see Canada remain united. They want to see Quebec 
stay a part of Canada.
<P>
	However, from conversations I have had with them over the last 
couple of years, they are sick to death of this issue. It is dominating 
the agenda of the entire country and dominating the agenda of this 
place.
<P>
	My constituents want Quebec to decide once and for all if it is in 
or out. They have a universal cynicism that the issue will never be 
settled or decided. The Reform Party, the constituents of Prince 
George-Peace River and I are in favour of referenda. We have 
demonstrated that.
<P>
	However, the Prime Minister, the Liberal government and the 
separatists have fuelled the cynicism that exists. When the Prime 
Minister and the government say they will honour and respect 50 
per cent plus one provided it is a no vote, and the separatists say 
they will honour and respect 50 per cent plus one if it is a yes vote, 
but neither  side will respect the results if they do not go its way, 
what will be accomplished by holding a referendum? This is was 
asked last fall. What is the point? What does it solve?
<P>
	Last fall's referendum proved there is a lot of confusion in the 
minds of Quebec voters. There is a lot of confusion in that province 
about what exactly people were voting on. The hon. member 
referred to an honest referendum, which is what we would all seek.
<P>
	What result will it take? How many times do Quebecers have to 
say no before the separatists give up on their foolish agenda to try 
to destroy the country?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, some questions are made to seem 
basic but they mean nothing. The people of Quebec have always 
had respect for the democratic process. When a question is decided 
by a 50 per cent plus 1 vote, as it was just recently, we accept the 
referendum results.
<P>
	What we hope and expect is for Canada to do the same, should a 
referendum result in a majority voting in favour of achieving 
sovereignty.
<P>
	I also detect in the remarks made by my hon. colleague from out 
west a lack of understanding of how the sovereignist movement has 
developed. Sovereignty is nothing new in Quebec, it was being 
contemplated long before 1993. The movement emerged in the 
early 60s. In 1963, the Laurendeau-Dunton Commission, chaired 
by two distinguished Canadians, concluded that two solitudes 
coexisted. At that time, there were a few hundred Quebecers who 
advocated Quebec's sovereignty.
<P>
	From a few hundred, our numbers have grown to thousands and 
now a few hundred thousands. When asked to vote on the matter, 
millions of Quebecers vote for sovereignty.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	It would be wise not to apply the Ostrich Principle and think that 
Quebec's will to become sovereign is something that sprang up 
overnight, a creation of the mind. Probably ever since the events on 
the Plains of Abraham, there has always been a desire in Quebec to 
self-govern and to take charge of our destiny, throw off our 
shackles, our British shackles in this case.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, although I am extremely pleased to rise today to speak to 
this motion, I do so with some sadness.
<P>
	I do so with some sadness because I cannot imagine how this 
debate can take place in this Parliament where sat Henri Bourassa, 
in this Parliament whose members, especially those on the 
government side, extol the merits of democracy in detail at every 
opportunity. What is democracy if not our collective ability to 
decide what we are?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2880"> 2880 </A></B>
<P>
	Do you think that, if Henri Bourassa, Lionel Groulx, André 
Laurendeau, René Lévesque were taking part in this debate, they 
would not say that each of them worked in his own way, in 
accordance with his own philosophy and through his own 
contribution to political life, so that in the end we Quebecers can 
democratically-repeat, democratically-determine our own 
future?
<P>
	I cannot imagine for a single moment, even during my most 
eccentric musings, that there are Quebecers in this House who, like 
us, received a public mandate under the election process and who 
do not fully agree with the underlying philosophy behind the 
motion put forward by the official opposition, which we are 
reiterating very clearly. The fact that the official opposition in this 
Parliament was democratically elected on the basis of a very clear 
program, which, as you know, is still to promote Quebec's interests 
and ultimately to achieve statehood, is quite meaningful.
<P>
	I hope that all of us tonight will have a sense of history and agree 
with the current Prime Minister's diagnostic at a public meeting in 
Alma in the early 1970s, when he said: ``Let us be democratic''. He 
was right to say that. The intensity of constitutional options can 
never compete with what should be the purpose of communities, 
namely the ability to recognize a democracy freely expressed 
through its most legal forum, a referendum.
<P>
	That is what the Prime Minister said in 1970 and that is what we 
want to see recognized. That is why, in our opinion and in the 
opinion of others-But I challenge any member of this House, 
including Quebec members, to find a single decision maker-be it 
an editorialist, a journalist or a member of the business 
community-who supports what the Canadian government is about 
to do by getting involved in the Bertrand court case.
<P>
	No one supported this decision. Even <I>La Presse</I>, which is not 
known for its sovereignist sympathies, said, through some of its 
editorial writers, that this approach was stupid. Why is it stupid? 
Because we know full well that international treaties recognize the 
right to self-determination.
<P>
	The people on the other side are proud to say that Canada 
contributes $200 million to the operations budget of the United 
Nations, they are proud to uphold international law along with its 
main supporters at the United Nations, and that reminds me of what 
the Secretary General of the United Nations, Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali, said when he came to Montreal. He said that the 
most accomplished type of collective organization, even though we 
are at the dawn of a new century, is still sovereignty.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	Here is what he said and what caught our attention. He said: 
``Sovereignty is the basic principle of universal organization. It is 
the art of making equal powers that are not equal.'' That is what we 
have in Canada, two nations  within the same political 
organization. There cannot be two nations within the same political 
organization, because one is then subordinate to the other.
<P>
	In essence, with this motion today and with the message it has 
conveyed here for the last three years, the Bloc has remained loyal 
to these principles and to the principles of international law.
<P>
	The principles of international law and international covenants 
stipulate two things concerning human rights, and especially the 
right to self-determination. When one reads about international 
law, it is interesting to see-and I have the privilege of sitting next 
to a legal expert-that it is always subject to human rights. This is 
so true that this issue is always discussed, year after year, at the 
International Conference on Human Rights in Geneva.
<P>
	So there is a very important relationship between human rights, 
collective rights and the right to self-determination which, 
according to the UN charter, is the first attribute of peoples.
<P>
	If we follow the government's logic, it means that, by the end of 
the day, unless the Liberals are hypocrites, which is always a 
possibility, they should, if they are logical with themselves, rise in 
this House and say that they do not believe Quebecers are a people. 
From the moment it is recognized that Quebecers are a people, it 
means that they have a right to self-determination even under 
major international law.
<P>
	The right to self-determination is not always but often exercised 
through a referendum. But the law also says, and I think this should 
be our first consideration in this House, that the right to 
self-determination, in addition to the legal considerations, is first 
and foremost a matter of political legitmacy, which can be 
exercised under certain conditions.
<P>
	Of course, you need to have a history. You need to control a 
territory. You need to have the will to live together collectively. 
You need to have a legal tradition and, once sovereignty is 
achieved-and this was said clearly by the Bélanger-Campeau 
Commission and was repeated many times during the referendum 
debate-you need to have effective control of a territory under the 
state continuity rules.
<P>
	Which member will rise in this House, whether he is from 
Ontario, Newfoundland or the Magdalen Islands, and say that 
Quebec does not meet these conditions?
<P>
	What interest does the government have in joining forces with 
the man who will no doubt go down in history as the greatest crank 
of our times?
<P>
	I remember very well that in 1987, just to give you a few 
biographical details, I was responsible for running Francine 
Lalonde's campaign for the leadership of the Parti Quebecois, and I 
came into contact with Guy Bertrand, who had just been campaign-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2881"> 2881 </A></B>
<P>
ing all over  Quebec telling us that we had the right to decide our 
own future.
<P>
	This man ran for the leadership of the Parti Quebecois on a 
single theme, Quebec's right to decide its own future. He was so all 
over the map that, had we been in a different century, he would 
have been sent to see a doctor. But we are not in another century, 
and everyone has the freedom of expression.
<P>
	That being said, there is something deeply offensive and hurtful 
in the action taken by the justice minister, who has always seemed a 
courteous man, and the approval given by this government, in 
trying through legal subterfuge, to deny Quebec's right to decide its 
own future. If the action by the Government of Canada is taken all 
the way, I can certainly promise you that something very serious 
will happen in our political society, both for Quebec and for 
Canada, and that will be the refusal to recognize the legitimacy of 
this decision.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	It is not true that since 1960-there are even people who trace 
the quest for sovereignty back to the 18th century-well, certainly 
for 30 years, Quebecers have been preparing themselves as they 
have, only to be denied the right to self-determination, now that 
they have democratically elected representatives to this House.
<P>
	Still, it is sad that the government has been so lacking in 
judgement, perception and the most basic political tact, that it has 
failed to recognize that this is a profound question of political 
legitimacy. It is not by trying to transfer the debate to the legal 
arena that the government will achieve its ends.
<P>
	You know, not more than two years ago, there was a declaratory 
judgment, because a member of the First Nations, Ovide Mercredi, 
not to name names, also tried to have a possible referendum 
declared unconstitutional. The judiciary was extremely clear on 
this subject, by virtue of what democracy is, but also by virtue of 
what should prevail in a society such as ours, that is the distinction 
between the judiciary, the executive, and the legislature.
<P>
	So let us hear from these Liberal MPs with ridings in Quebec, in 
the coming days, in a public forum-they can choose the time, the 
date, the place-let them tell Quebecers they do not have the right 
to decide their own future. Let them come and say it in Montreal or 
in the regions. Let them for one moment tell Quebecers that they do 
not exist as a people, that what they have accomplished over the 
last 30 years is all in their heads, a political fantasy.
<P>
	It takes a justice minister from Toronto, a Prime Minister like the 
one we have now with his own very personal view of history, to 
support a motion such as the one before us, which is profoundly 
irresponsible and profoundly disrespectful towards Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to the hon. member talking about separation and 
self-government. Not long ago in this Chamber, I remember a vote 
supported by all Bloc members under aboriginal self-government 
and self-determination.
<P>
	Will the hon. member respect a vote if the aboriginals in Quebec 
decide to deal with self-government and allow them to stay with 
whomever they choose democratically?
<P>
	Another question I have for the hon. member is this. When he 
has a chance to go forward with this referendum, will he be looking 
at population? Is he more inclined to go poll by poll? This would 
make a big difference in how the rest of us would look at the 
situation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe what the Bloc says is 
logical and consistent. Once we recognize the right to 
self-determination, we also recognize that this right can be 
exercised by any group having the characteristics of a people.
<P>
	If we finally recognize that legally speaking native nations have 
the characteristics of a people, this means implicitly and explicitly 
that they also legally have the right to self-determination, within 
the legal territorial boundaries set for Quebec.
<P>
	This being said, I am not sure I fully understood the second 
question.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	The hon. member wishes to add a supplementary because, as we 
know, there is a fair amount of excitement in the ranks of the 
Reform Party, these days. Does he want a supplementary, Mr. 
Speaker? I am always ready to answer.
<P>
	This being said, it seems to me that my friend's second question 
creates some confusion because one thing is very clear and clearly 
affirmed by all leaders of Quebec: Quebec's right to 
self-determination will be exercised in a referendum. The rule of 
50 plus one will apply. The hon. member was asking if we would 
proceed by way of a vote. I believe you understood the same thing. 
Of course, the referendum process requires that we count the votes 
and the final result will bring us victory or defeat.
<P>
	Hon. members will recall, and I think this will be my most 
important moment today, the famous words of the current Prime 
Minister immediately after taking office. He said something I will 
never forget. He declared that for Quebec, a no means no. I would 
like to tell the Reform Party that if one day the answer is yes, it will 
mean yes.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise on debate on today's 
opposition motion. I to make a comment on behalf of all of my 
constituents. It refers to a comment made by the former leader of 
the Bloc Quebecois. He basically said Canada is not a real country.
<P>
	On behalf of my constituents and I believe the vast majority of 
Canadians, I state clearly and unequivocally Canada is a country, 
Canada is a nation and will remain so, absolutely, not only in the 
months and weeks ahead but in the years, decades and centuries 
ahead. It will because we are a nation.
<P>
	Despite what we hear from the other side, Canada is a nation. It 
is a nation because we share many things in common and we share 
this great land is Canada. We share a common geography from 
coast to coast. We share our natural resources such as mining, 
whether it takes place in Quebec or in Ontario, and the 
development of energy and the development of agriculture. These 
natural resources are things we share as a nation.
<P>
	We have a common history on the north side of the North 
American continent where together Canadians of all stripes, of all 
ethnic origins, have built a strong distinct Canada, a distinct nation 
with values and beliefs unique to us as Canadians.
<P>
	We share some very important concepts from one end of Canada 
to the other. We believe in the rule of law and we share this belief 
among all Canadians. We believe in social justice. We believe as a 
nation, as a government and as a people there are responsibilities 
we hold to each other. We believe as Canadians that below a certain 
level we will not allow people to fall.
<P>
	When people walk into a hospital they are not asked how much 
money they have. They are simply asked how sick they are. People 
do not go hungry for a lack of food or shelter. We help those people. 
Those are values we share as Canadians from coast to coast 
whether one happens to live in the English speaking part of Canada 
or in the French speaking part.
<P>
	We believe in certain freedoms. We believe in the freedom of 
thought, belief, expression and assembly. We share those core 
beliefs as Canadians and they make us a nation.
<P>
	We have differences in Canada, but they are not differences that 
need divide us. They do not separate us one people from another 
people. They are differences which make this country unique 
among nations.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	Canada in its history, for 130 years, has shown the nations of the 
world what can be accomplished, what can be done with a nation of 
several peoples. We have shown the world our success. We have 
shown the world we are a nation that works and can sustain itself.
<P>
	As a nation Canada recognizes that it has differences. The people 
of Canada recognize there are two founding peoples, the English 
speaking Canadians live in Quebec and francophone Canadians 
live outside of Quebec. We are an integrated nation, English and 
French from coast to coast. We have been joined by many peoples 
from around the world to make the fabric of Canada strong, a 
nation which is integrated, open to change, one which accepts and 
evolves over time.
<P>
	As a nation, as a government, as Canadians we recognize we 
need to make accommodation for different peoples. We recognized 
and made the clear statement that Quebec is a distinct society. We 
have recognized the importance of regional variance and evolved a 
veto system. We have come to understand that different institutions 
work differently in different parts of the country. We understand 
there needs to be a division of power, that some things are done 
better at the provincial level as opposed to the federal level.
<P>
	When Parliament as recently as December made these 
suggestions and showed we will evolve as a nation, that we will 
accommodate our differences, the Bloc voted against it. Members 
of the Bloc voted against the fact that Quebec was a distinct 
society. They stood in the House and said: ``No, Quebec is not a 
distinct society. No, Quebec should not have a veto. No, Quebec 
should not have its own institutions''. Those statements were made 
by their votes. That was terribly wrong.
<P>
	What is at stake here? Canada. What is their base argument for 
wanting to destroy the country? Politics is a big part of it. They 
want to destroy the country over whether Mr. Bouchard is to be 
called a premier or a president. Those are grounds to break up the 
country? I think not. Those are not valid grounds for breaking up 
the country.
<P>
	Members of the Bloc said we need to have a more efficient 
federation. Are we to break up the country because of the 
mathematical formula for transfer payments?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I assure the hon. member for 
Parry Sound-Muskoka he will have the time remaining after 
question period to conclude his remarks.
<P>
	The chair is now ready to rule on the point of order raised earlier 
today by the chief government whip relating to the interpretation of 
Standing Order 43(2), which provides for a 20 minute speech to be 
divided in two.
<P>
	A cursory review of our practice shows that motions have been 
moved by both members sharing a 20 minute period. I refer 
members to cases that occurred on March 25, 1993 and April 19, 
1993.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It has also been common practice for a period of time now for 
members to share the first speech on supply  days. A quick check of 
our proceedings reveals that the first speech was shared on 
February 10, 1994 and subsequently on May 3, 1994, November 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2883"> 2883 </A></B>
<P>
22, 1994, March 16, 1995, March 26, 1995, May 11, 1995, 
November 22, 1995 and, most recently, March 20, 1996.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	What has changed since March 20, 1996 is that the second 
speaker from the same party has proposed an amendment to the 
motion tabled by the first. This is the reason for the chief 
government whip's point of order. The question he raised with the 
Chair is whether, under the spirit of the Standing Orders, the main 
motion may be subject to an amendment from a second speaker in 
the same initial period of the debate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I quote from Standing Order 81(22), which provides the time 
limit on speeches for supply days:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>During proceedings on any item of business under the provisions of this 
standing order, no member may speak more than once or longer than twenty 
minutes. Following the speech of each member, a period not exceeding ten 
minutes shall be made available, if required, to allow members to ask questions 
and comment briefly on matters relevant to the speech and to allow responses 
thereto.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Furthermore, Standing Order 43(2) provides for periods of 
debate to be divided in two:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The whip of a party may indicate to the Speaker at any time during a debate 
governed by this standing order that one or more of the periods of debate limited 
pursuant to section (1) of this standing order and allotted to members of his or 
her party are to be divided in two.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is clear from Standing Order 81(22), that the first speech on a 
supply day is limited to 20 minutes. If we apply the letter of 
Standing Order 43(2), we may logically conclude that the first 
speech on a supply day may in fact be divided in two.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Chair has reviewed the standing orders and has been unable 
to find any other standing order which would imply the first speech 
of a supply day cannot or should not be divided in two.
<P>
	Consequently, in light of the practice that an amendment may be 
moved when a 20 minute period is divided and in light of the well 
established practice that the first speech on a supply day has many 
times been divided, it is difficult to accept the argument advanced 
that it ought not be done today.
<P>
	If the House considers this to be an anomaly, then the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs has the means to 
address the review of the wording of the standing orders.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That said, the Chair allows the amendment proposed by the hon. 
member for Berthier-Montcalm, Mr. Bellehumeur, and I will put 
it to the House. The other amendment proposals made earlier in 
anticipation of this ruling will not be put to the House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I thank all hon. members who have made a contribution on this 
point.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member for Berthier-Montcalm, seconded by his 
colleague for Laval-Centre, moved that the motion be amended by 
adding the following, immediately after the word ``stated'': 
<I>Straight from the Heart</I>.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to clarify the matter of 
the Chair's acceptance of the amendment by the member for 
Saint-Laurent-Cartierville in the event the amendment by the 
member for Berthier-Montcalm was not allowed.
<P>
	Is this indeed what happened? Logically, therefore, it seems to 
me that the amendment to the amendment by the member for 
Berthier-Montcalm is also allowable, since we said that, if one 
were not, the other would be. Since an amendment to an 
amendment was tabled, it seems to me that it-the one taken under 
advisement-is the logical conclusion of the amendment tabled, in 
the logic of the ruling we have just been given.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleague, I heard what you said. I will 
take the question under advisement and will return to the House 
with another ruling after question period.
<P>
	It being two o'clock p.m., the House will now proceed to 
statements by members pursuant to Standing Order 31.

	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today the 
federal government is in court attempting to get fishermen ejected 
from fisheries offices in British Columbia.
<P>
	The place for the minister to talk to fishermen is across the 
negotiating table, not in the court room. Despite infrequent visits to 
B.C., the minister is imposing a plan on the commercial fishery 
which will seriously impact the lives of fishermen and the 
economies of coastal communities. What is even more disturbing 
is the minister's refusal to go to British Columbia and seriously 
defend his plan.
<P>
	The minister's newly appointed adviser has recognized 
shortcomings of the plan. He notes that the plan contains no 
support for local communities, no protection against concentration 
of control of the fleet, and uncertainty about the commercial share 
of catch in the face of treaty negotiations.

Development has shown us his insensitivity, his thoughtlessness 
and his blindness with his decision to eliminate subsidies to 
agencies that help the disabled.
<P>
	Yesterday, in this House, he even had the audacity to state that he 
considered it more important to help the disabled than the

these organizations do a good job. Where is the logic? I do not 
know.
<P>
	The minister talks about the federal government's willingness to 
negotiate with the provinces to find a solution. It is one thing to 
negotiate transfers, but it is another thing to cut subsidies without 
giving any consideration to the adverse consequences of such a 
decision on the organizations and the disabled.

<P>
	I provided the minister of agriculture with two specific examples 
in which to support my complaints I quoted recent sale prices for 
nearby land. In each instance I received a robotic ministerial reply 
stating, without any reference to my evidence, that agri-land does 
not engage in such practices. If the minister or his buddy Don 
Jackson make dogmatic statements, they are holy writ regardless of 
any contrary evidence.

<P>
	Central America has made great strides in the areas of peace

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister has thwarted democracy once again. Earlier today 
he appointed another new senator from Alberta.
<P>
	The Prime Minister was fully aware that Alberta Premier Ralph 
Klein intended to hold an election to fill Alberta's vacant Senate 
seat. Rather than wait for Albertans to elect their own senator under 
Alberta's Senates Election Act, the Prime Minister has used an iron 
fist and smashed Alberta's right to have a democratic election. This 
is tantamount to a dictatorship.
<P>
	In a recent response to the leader of the Reform Party, the Prime 
Minister stated in this House: ``I will name a senator who I will 
choose and who will represent my party in the House of 
Commons''. We can only assume this is exactly what the Prime 
Minister has done in his latest patronage appointment which 
occurred earlier today. This is aggressive arrogance on behalf of 
the Prime Minister. It is an injustice to all Albertans and all 
Canadians.
<P>
	Allow me to remind the House that the late Senator Stan Waters 
would be ashamed of this appointment. He was the only truly 
legitimate accountable senator in Canada's history. I say long live 
the memory of Senator Stan.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I appeal to you once again. We should 
as much as possible refrain from making comments about the other

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last week the minister of revenue refused to suspend the 
decision of Revenue Canada on the taxation of capital gains, which 
led to the transfer of $2 billion to the United States tax free. In total 
contradiction with the deputy minister of finance, the auditor 
general said this morning that action in this matter was urgently 
needed in order to prevent the loss of millions of dollars in tax 
revenues.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Will he acknowledge 
the urgency of acting to prevent the flight of capital on the basis of 
the precedent set by Revenue Canada?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would remind the hon. Leader of the Opposition that 
even though this decision was one made by a government previous 
to ours, we have acted in an urgent fashion. We have asked the 
finance committee to review these concerns the auditor general has 
drawn to our attention. We asked the committee to do it the very 
day the auditor general's report came down.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are talking about billions of dollars, and the minister 
of revenue talks about the previous government and about 
convening the Standing Committee on Finance, but not in any 
hurry. That takes the cake.
<P>
	This morning the auditor general said action had to be taken 
immediately, whereas the deputy minister of finance thinks 
September will be time enough.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Since this is a matter 
of urgency and the decision by Revenue Canada has yet to be 
suspended, who is the Minister of Finance going to listen to: his 
deputy minister or the auditor general?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I agree with the hon. member that the case is urgent. I 
would therefore ask him why one of his own members walked 
away from the committee saying there was nothing important to do 
there.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, for the past two weeks the opposition finance critic has 
been calling for the committee to sit, and the government is 
interested in having it sit only for minor matters.
<P>
	I do not know if the minister of revenue is aware, but we are 
talking about dollars leaving the country untaxed, billions of 
dollars leaving the country untaxed. When ordinary people are 
involved, there is a great rush to nab them, but when billions of 
dollars are involved, there is no cause for alarm.
<P>
	Given the urgency of acting and as a show of good faith, will the 
minister of revenue, the Minister of Finance or a responsible 
minister in this government undertake to put a stop to these flights 
of capital in order to stop billions of dollars going to the United 
States?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I cannot understand why the hon. member would deny 
that the best place for these questions to be reviewed would be in a 
very public forum where members who are elected by Canadians 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2888"> 2888 </A></B>
<P>
across the  country have a chance to look at the law and make 
recommendations to the Minister of Finance.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance, who, I hope, is much more 
familiar with this issue.
<P>
	On March 16, Revenue Canada made public its advance ruling 
allowing rich families to move their assets to the U.S. without 
paying Canadian taxes. This morning, the auditor general reiterated 
that the government needed to act quickly to avoid losing hundreds 
of millions of dollars in taxes once again.
<P>
	Does the minister confirm that, since the decision was 
announced, it has been possible to move large pools of capital out 
of the country every day and that this situation will prevail until the 
minister finally decides to act?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, indeed this is not the case.
<P>
	Let me repeat the tax law is very arcane and complex. It needs 
time to be reviewed, understood and the implications determined 
not only for Canadians who have $2 billion in assets but for those 
who may have only $2.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, while 
the government and its ministers are skating around the issue, rich 
families are consulting with their lawyers, their accountants, their 
tax experts, and preparing to tax-shelter their assets by moving 
them out of Canada.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance or the Minister of 
National Revenue. Would one or the other agree to suspend 
Revenue Canada's advance ruling, which could be used as a excuse 
to move major assets out of Canada? Would he or she agree to 
suspend this decision, yes or no?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there are too few Canadians who have $2 billion in assets. 
I suggest that if Canadians continue their confidence in us, there 
will be more money in the country.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Constitution, secession and the rule of law require 
precise interpretation. But the Prime Minister continues to muddy 
the constitutional waters with his off  the cuff comments about 
possible guidelines for future referendums on secession without 
saying what those guidelines are.
<P>
	Yesterday the Prime Minister said: ``If ever we have a 
referendum by any province, I hope there will be a discussion 
beforehand to make sure the rules are known by both sides''.
<P>
	I am wondering if the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs can 
explain what the Prime Minister was trying to say. In particular, 
what discussions or negotiations was he talking about, who would 
take part, and precisely what would be discussed?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister of Canada during the 1970s 
delivered a speech that is reported in his book in 1985. I have the 
quotation in French:
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
``We'll put our faith in democracy. We'll convince the people that 
they should stay in Canada and we'll win. If we don't win, I'll 
respect the wishes of Quebeckers and let them separate''.
<P>
	I am very proud of my Prime Minister and proud to show what a 
great democrat he is. A unilateral declaration of independence 
would not be acceptable in any way, shape or form in a democratic 
system. Democracy implies a mutual agreement to respect rules of 
law. And we will work with all Canadians to ensure that these rules 
are established in a context of calm co-operation between all 
concerned.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister said there will be negotiations on 
ground rules for the next referendum but provides no details at all.
<P>
	He says 50 per cent plus one is not enough to separate, but he 
does not know what percentage would be acceptable. He says the 
federal government would never acknowledge a unilateral 
declaration of separation but cannot seem to outline the grounds for 
a democratic and legal secession.
<P>
	Either the Prime Minister is making this up as he goes along or 
the federal government does have ground rules governing the next 
referendum on secession and is not disclosing them.
<P>
	Which is it? Does the government have firm ground rules for 
governing a future referendum on secession? If it does, will it table 
them in the House?
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2889"> 2889 </A></B>
<P>
	The point is for now the debate is, yes or no, whether a 
unilateral declaration of independence is supported by 
international law and accepted by Canadian law? The conviction 
of the government is that the answer is no.
<P>
	When this is clear that will be the time to look at the specific 
issues which the hon. member is speaking about. However, for now 
the priority of the government is to work with all Canadians in 
order to reconcile Quebecers with Canadians to ensure they will 
improve the federation, that they will celebrate Quebec's 
specificity within Canada and that they will stay together for the 
next century.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if I understand the minister correctly, if that is the only 
guideline the government is firm about, will the minister then 
introduce a motion in the House declaring the House will not 
recognize a unilateral declaration of secession by any province in 
Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is the conviction of the government that a unilateral 
declaration of independence would not be supported by 
international law and would be against Canadian law.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the minister of defence.
<P>
	They are at it again. In an internal memo, Lieutenant-General 
Armand Roy urged 140 or so senior officers to get cracking to help 
the chief of defence staff, General Boyle. The memo also states that 
a political decision had been made to muzzle the general and that 
only the minister of defence would be allowed to make public 
statements about the Somalia affair.
<P>
	Does the minister realize that silencing General Boyle-a fact 
confirmed by his spokesman, Steve Wills-is not only an act of 
political interference but, worse yet, in direct contravention of the 
military rules and procedures behind which he hid on Tuesday and 
which state that the chief of defence Staff is the only official 
spokesperson of the armed forces?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I stated in the 
House some time ago-I think it was back in the fall of 1994 when 
this issue came up-that all members of the armed forces are not, 
as a condition of service, entitled to make public comments about 
their duties.
<P>
	With respect to the incidents in Somalia, I advised the House that 
anybody who had anything to add to the  situation, any evidence to 
give, should do so before the commission. That is consistent. That 
applies to everybody in the armed forces. It applies to the chief of 
defence staff.
<P>
	However, the chief of defence staff has the unfettered right to 
communicate with his troops at any time. General Boyle exercised 
that right a few weeks ago but has since taken the position, the 
correct position and the one I directed in the House of Commons, 
that any commentary on Somalia should not be made in an external 
forum such as Parliament or in the news media but to the 
commission of inquiry.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, when 
will the minister come to the realization that a serious conflict of 
interest does justify suspending the chief of defence staff on a 
temporary basis, since he is personally under investigation by his 
own military police for allegedly having authorized the 
falsification of documents?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we dealt with 
this question a few weeks ago. The chief of defence staff is doing a 
very good job and is working extremely hard. At the appropriate 
time he will come forward to the commission to answer all of its 
questions.

	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple

Foreign Affairs tried to justify excessive awards of CIDA contracts 
to Quebec entities by citing cultural and linguistic ties to 
francophone countries receiving Canadian aid. However, public 
documents show that Quebec companies have major contracts in 
Central America, Indonesia, South Africa, China, Egypt, the 
Philippines and Bolivia.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	Why will he not admit these deals have absolutely nothing to do 
with our ties to the francophonie and everything to do with trying to 
buy the loyalty of Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, many of the companies and NGOs who work out of 
Quebec have been very effective in providing aid and assistance 
around the world representing this country as Canadians.
<P>
	In the government we do not buy into the kind of regional 
divisiveness the hon. member and the hon. member from the Bloc 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2890"> 2890 </A></B>
<P>
buy into. We think it does not  matter where you come from in 
Canada; if you do a good job, you get the contract.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I take it from the hon. 
minister's answer that Canada has only one region.
<P>
	What we have over there is a government that is absolutely 
adrift. It is scrambling to find a national unity strategy and it is 
coming up empty handed.
<P>
	Why will the minister not stop trying to explain away this blatant 
attempt at vote buying and admit his government has no policies 
that will convince Quebecers to stay in Canada and is trying to 
resort to bribing them instead?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, a few weeks ago the word bribe was 
used in the House. I think it is the kind of word which causes us to 
escalate the rhetoric on both sides. I wonder if the hon. member 
would withdraw the word bribe.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would be happy to withdraw that 
word.
<P>
	Will the government stop trying to curry favour with Quebec by 
providing it with money?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will overlook the primitive nature of the hon. member's 
remarks and instead focus on the central issue which is what is the 
development program about.
<P>
	Today the Prime Minister is hosting a meeting of the six heads of 
state of Central America who in the last five or six years have 
fought valiantly to establish democracies in that region of the 
world. Canada has been a full partner using its development 
programs. There have been Canadians from Quebec, Canadians 
from Alberta, Canadians from the Atlantic provinces all working in 
Central America to help those countries find democracy. That is the

<P>

talking with these groups regarding their future and their funding.
<P>

step further and to restore their funding?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources

position to continue operating, because funds are still available to 
them. As we said on many occasions, we made a commitment. We 
informed the organizations concerned that the government intends 
to withdraw its financial support to several of them.
<P>
	Originally, several agreements provided for funding over periods 
of one, two or three years. We will, as usual, continue to consult all 
our partners and discuss the issue with them.

	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead,

Speaker, since the beginning of the week, the Prime Minister has 
told us three things: first, that Quebecers would not be allowed to 
decide their future on their own, that all of Canada would have to 
get involved; then, that the majority at a referendum would now 
have to be more than 50 per cent plus one; and lastly, that he would 
want to negotiate the referendum question with Quebec. In brief, 
the Prime Minister is getting himself bogged down in a 
constitutional debate and is dragging us in with him.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister realize that the process he is suggesting 
could, ultimately, mean 13 referendums, in 13 provinces and 
territories, perhaps with 13 different questions, so that we would 
have to interpret 13 different results?
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

There have been two referendums where Quebecers have expressed

and the rest of Canada a confrontation such as there has never been 
before?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on the contrary, what I want is very simple. I would like 
the Government of Quebec to show some respect for the people of 
Quebec, by asking them a clear and honest question, that would be 
acceptable to everyone, instead of asking a winning question to try 
to encourage Quebecers to vote against their own wishes.
<P>
	I would invite the Government of Quebec to do so and I am sure 
that-As we saw this morning on television, people throughout the 
world wonder why a province like Quebec is not happy to live in 
the best country of the world, that is in Canada.

using, and this is to their competitive disadvantage. Canadians eat 
this food. In the Niagara region our entire peach crop is at risk 
because of increasing resistance to current pesticides.
<P>
	What measure is the government taking to expedite the pesticide 
approval procedures in this country and to harmonize approvals 
with the United States?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to compliment the 
member on his continuing concern about this matter.
<P>
	He will know that representatives from the pest management 
regulatory agency met with peach and apple growers last week on 
the question of reaching solutions to pest management problems in 
orchards. That same agency is already looking at alternative 
candidates for the control of pests. As well, it is in consultations 
now with the United States EPA to look at joint efforts for pest 
control management in the coming year.
<P>
	With his vigilance and his support we will get the agency and our 
American counterparts to look for long term solutions to pest 
management control.

	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister likes to go on and on about page 22 of the red book, 
which everyone knows is another broken promise.
<P>
	I would like to remind him of another broken promise on pages 
23 and 24. This Liberal government promised to protect the steel 
industry, the pork industry, softwood lumber and other products. It 
said it would renegotiate the free trade agreement and NAFTA to 
obtain a subsidies code, an anti-dumping code and a more effective 
way of resolving disputes.
<P>
<B>(1445 )</B>
<P>
	Would the Prime Minister admit that this was his first broken 
promise?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have been working with a trade remedies 
working group that involves our partners from the United States 
and Mexico toward doing the very things that the hon. member has 
talked about.
<P>
	We are fully committed to dealing with the reform of trade 
remedy laws to cut down on the use of countervail and 
anti-dumping duties so that we can have a free trade system. That is 
our position and that is what we continue to work toward.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
point out that these working groups have been working for eight 
years and have failed to come up with a subsidy definition.
<P>
	In fact, the red book says nothing about working groups at all. It 
says that the Liberals were going to renegotiate NAFTA and the 
free trade agreement before they signed it. They promised to 
demand an open market for steel and an anti-dumping code.
<P>
	This Liberal broken promise has really hurt the people in the 
steel industry in particular. When will the government honour its 
promise to produce a level playing field for Canada and the United 
States in this industry?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I cannot agree with the preamble to the 
question.
<P>
	The government is working not only through NAFTA but 
through the World Trade Organization to help improve the rules 
based system. The government is committed to liberalization in 
trade and a rules based system. It will continue whether it is with 
the working groups, the WTO, the OECD or whatever other 
vehicle, to bring that about.

Mr. Speaker, what the Government of Canada is after in this matter 
is to ensure that, under all circumstances no matter how difficult, 
the rights of citizens are respected and negotiations are always held 
by mutual consent under the protection of the legal order.
<P>
	Democracy is indissociable from the legal order. What we want 
is to ensure that, if ever the option of the opposition were to win 
out, we would not find ourselves in a situation where there would 
be a legal vacuum. That would be very dangerous for both the

	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday I had 
a call from the fishermen occupying the DFO offices in downtown 
Vancouver. They are outraged that the minister has broken another 
promise.
<P>
	On May 9 the minister said that his plan would not be used to 
take fish away from the commercial fleet, would not be used to 
reallocate fish. Then yesterday fishermen  received a letter from 
the minister reneging on that commitment.
<P>
	First the minister flip-flopped on conservation, now he flip-flops 
on allocation. When will the minister admit that his plan will not 
work and dump it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the allocations letter which was sent to fishermen was 
in response to meetings held in Vancouver two weeks ago at which 
we met with eight groups.
<P>
	If there was any commonality among these groups it was that 
there should be a further indication and reaffirmation of the 
allocations policy for the commercial salmon fishery this year.
<P>
	There has been no flip-flop. This allocations policy letter went 
out under my signature. My understanding from the fishermen I 
have heard from is that the allocations letter does what it was 
intended to do, which was give greater confidence to the fishermen 
of the allocation of commercial salmon they will have this year.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister 
would do well to read his own press releases. Then he would know 
what flip-flop is about.
<P>
	The minister's newly appointed adviser described the minister's 
plan as a cold shower, a plan where everything happens at once, a 
plan where fishermen are forced to make decisions in the face of 
uncertainty. As the minister's adviser pointed out, this includes 
uncertainty about the allocation question.
<P>
	Will the minister admit that fishermen cannot make informed 
decisions about his plan by his May 24 deadline?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has agreed with me that the 
commercial salmon situation and the condition of the salmon 
stocks in British Columbia are desperate.
<P>
	The capacity to catch salmon is overheated. I understand that 
when a situation is overheated, a cold shower is often quite useful.
<P>
	The description of the cold shower by Dr. Pearse was meant in a 
positive sense. I mentioned to the hon. member a couple of days 
ago that Dr. Pearse is very much in support of this plan. Contrary to 
the words of the hon. member, Dr. Pearse is confident, as are most 
members of the House, that the plan will work.

today with the Central American presidents is another step in 
keeping the red book promise to expand into the western 
hemisphere the influence, opportunity and activity of this country.
<P>
	The discussion today dealt with how we can use our resources 
through CIDA to helping environmental sustainable development

accord the same treatment to people with disabilities?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, as 
far as business is concerned, not only did we set up a commission 
this year to look at all the facts, but, in our first three budgets, we 
took very stringent measures regarding an increase in taxes for 
major corporations, an increase in taxes on banks and the abolition

price of wheat and barley by refusing to end the wheat board 
monopoly on grain marketing.
<P>
	On November 20, 1995 the Prime Minister promised farmers a 
plebiscite on the future of the wheat board monopoly. In the last 
election campaign the agriculture minister also promised farmers a 
plebiscite.
<P>
	Did the minister have any intention of keeping his promise? Was 
he prevented from doing so by an act of God or was this whole 
thing just another hollow Liberal promise to get elected?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. gentleman's outraged 
indignation hardly sells well before an audience that knows the 
details of this issue.
<P>
	The hon. gentleman should know what were the comments made 
during the 1993 election campaign with respect to a plebiscite. 
Those comments specifically said that the government would not 
consider adjusting the mandate of the Canadian Wheat Board in 
any fundamental way without first consulting producers by way of 
a plebiscite. Obviously that is a commitment that we intend to 
honour.
<P>
	At the time that the comment was made the previous government 
was in the process of amending the jurisdiction of the Canadian 
Wheat Board without the legal authority to do it. This government 
honoured the law and I would advise the hon. gentleman to honour 
the law as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, how long 
does this minister plan to consult? Already a commissioner has 
resigned from the wheat board in disgust because of the way barley 
is being handled by the board. He said that there is a very narrow 
fringe that rejects outright any compromise on this issue, a very 
narrow fringe of which the government is a part.

monopoly power of the wheat board is hurting their interests,

side of the argument to which the hon. gentleman refers.
<P>

<P>
	On the occasion of the resignation of that former commissioner 
of the Canadian Wheat Board, he went out of his way to indicate 
that he had a concern about the process for barley pricing. He also

marketing and does not deserve the abuse that people like this

Experience Canada, the hon. member is demonstrating his

<P>

more than half of it from the private sector. Young Canadians from 
all provinces and the territories will be able to become involved in

<P>
	In addition to learning about the country, they will be getting job 
experience which will look very good on their CVs as they seek

to that member's constituency.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1505 )</B>

alcoholic beverages, which passed second reading in the House on 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2896"> 2896 </A></B>
<P>
December 7, 1995, was  reinstated as Bill C-222 after prorogation 
on March 5 and was referred to the Standing Committee on Health. 
Accordingly, I believe my point of privilege satisfies section 92.
<P>
	I further refer Mr. Speaker to Beauchesne's section 93:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is generally accepted that any threat, or attempt to influence the vote of, or 
actions of a member, is breach of privilege.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I have evidence that would appear to violate the provisions of 
section 93 with regard to Bill C-222. First, during the consideration 
of the bill the representatives of the alcohol beverage industry 
circulated two customized pieces of literature and other formal 
communications to all members of Parliament urging them to 
reject Bill C-222.
<P>
	Second, on or about Tuesday, May 14 certain members of 
Parliament were each sent a baseball and tickets to a baseball game 
and a communication from the alcohol industry relating to its 
position on Bill C-222.
<P>
	The third and most important point, the alcohol lobby 
spokespersons in their literature and other written communications 
and in committee testimony on this bill stated that if the 
government mandates health warning labels to be placed on their 
containers, the money spent on responsible use programs, 
advertising and educational programs, some of which are cost 
shared by the government, will be reduced or eliminated to recover 
the costs of mandating labels.
<P>
	This appears to pose a threat or adverse consequence directly to 
Health Canada and therefore to the minister of health, and therefore 
attempts to affect their position regarding Bill C-222.
<P>
	I believe these examples violate section 93 of Beauchesne's sixth 
edition and therefore violate my rights and possibly the rights of 
many other members of the House. I am prepared to provide the 
Chair or to table with the House all relevant documents in my 
possession if so ordered.
<P>
	It would appear the lobbyists on behalf of the beverage alcohol 
industry are responsible for these apparent violations of section 93 
of Beauchesne's. Therefore I respectfully ask that my rights as a 
member of Parliament and indeed the integrity of the House of 
Commons be defended by having a thorough investigation

appropriate.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion; and of the 
amendment; and of the amendment to the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, continuing with my speech, I will make two final points.
<P>
	The first point is that Canada has a Constitution which has 
evolved over 130 years. In fact many of the conventions and 
concepts which are incorporated in the Constitution had evolved 
before Canada officially became a country in 1867. A constitution 
is the base law on which this country and other countries around the 
world operate. It is incumbent upon us as a nation, as a people, to 
adhere to the Constitution.
<P>
	As was said in the speech from the throne not that many weeks 
ago, the whole issue of Canada, our Constitution and our political 
make-up is a discussion for all Canadians. It is not for just one 
segment of Canada but for all Canadians no matter where they live, 
no matter what their ethnic background is, no matter what their 
language is. It is an issue for all Canadians. That is important to 
remember.
<P>
	The second point is a personal one. It deals with the work I am 
undertaking in committee, a study on rural economic development. 
When I talk to Canadians, whether they are from British Columbia, 
Manitoba, the maritimes or Quebec, we share values as rural 
Canadians. It is not as rural Canadians from English Canada or 
rural Canadians from French Canada, we share values as rural 
Canadians. We share that special quality of life which is rural 
Canada whether it is in the Laurentians, the Eastern Townships or 
my area of Muskoka. We share important rural traditions which 
stretch from coast to coast to coast whether it is in Quebec, Ontario 
or somewhere else in Canada. Together we share our attempt to 
overcome those special challenges as rural Canadians.
<P>
	Canada and Canadians are a nation and a people from coast to 
coast to coast. Although we have specific challenges to solve as 
Canadians we know and experience this nationhood every day. It is 
time for members of the Bloc Quebecois to stop their political 
posturing and to do their duty and take actions which are in the best 
interests of all constituents, people who live in Quebec and people 
who live in the rest of Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
very carefully to what the hon. member for Don Valley North said 
and I cannot help wondering how an Armenian man of all people 
can question the right of Quebecers, as a people, to 
self-determination.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> He is not Armenian.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> I am told that the hon. member is not Armenian, 
please forgive me.
<P>
	At any rate, not so long ago, the Armenians were mentioned, and 
the hon. member for Saint-Denis also mentioned Macedonia, 
Serbia and other countries in that  part of the world. It is strange 
how individuals from an ethnic group, members of an ethnic 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2898"> 2898 </A></B>
<P>
minority in Canada, claim elsewhere the very thing they are 
denying us here. I have a great deal of trouble with that.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member, who nevertheless made an 
excellent speech and professed his faith in Canada, if he could help 
me understand what would be the point of having a Canada in 
which Quebec would be forced to stay against its will, after voting 
for sovereignty, all because of some legal texts, a Constitution it 
never signed or entered into. Do you think this makes for a healthy 
country? Is that healthy?
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	Do you think the great and beautiful country you refer to three 
times every half hour in this place will be able to keep projecting 
the same image internationally if it forces seven or eight million 
people to stay in your great and beautiful Canada? That is my first 
question.
<P>
	As for the second one, I was listening earlier to the members 
who spoke before the hon. member for Parry Sound-Muskoka. 
They talked about a Canadian nation. I have a very hard time 
understanding how they can talk about a single nation when we 
have two languages and when the central part of this country does 
not understand its neighbours on either side, in the east and the 
west. They talk about a country with a single nation but two 
different languages. That is not easy to understand. As someone 
pointed out to me earlier, it is like an egg with two yolks, it does not 
give two chicks. Only one develops.
<P>
	Please help me understand how a single nation can have two 
languages. Yet the concept of nation and the use of a given 
language are closely linked. One nation, one language, I can 
understand, but one nation, two, three, five languages, I cannot. 
The Prime Minister denied the existence of a Quebec nation. That 
is probably what the hon. member for Parry Sound-Muskoka was 
referring to.
<P>
	Anyone who considers that Quebec does not exist in the first 
place will obviously have a problem admitting that it could leave. 
Could you clarify this point for me please?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleague, I remind you that you must 
address the Chair.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will start by saying that what my 
ethnic origin might or might not be or what the ethnic origin of 
anyone who sits in this House might be is totally irrelevant to the 
debate today and at any other time. The member ought to realize 
that.
<P>
	The member asks what kind of a nation are we and what kind of a 
nation will we be. We are a people and a nation that for 130 years 
have worked in the northern part of North America to build a strong 
and vibrant country. We have not done it because we are all the  
same, that we all look the same, that we all speak the same, that we 
are all the same colour. No, we have done it because we have 
learned the importance of partnership. We have learned the 
importance of working together. We have learned the importance of 
addressing our challenges together.
<P>
	We have done what many nations in this world envy. We have 
succeeded in creating a country that, although it has its problems 
from time to time, is admired as the best nation in the world, 
according to the United Nations.
<P>
	Members of a family are different. I am different from what my 
brother was. I am different from my sister. My parents are different 
from each other, as are my children. We do not allow those 
differences to divide us. We celebrate those differences. It is what 
makes us unique as a family. It is what makes us special. We build 
upon those differences so that together we are more than what we 
are individually. That is what we do as a family. That is what we do 
as Canadians and that is why we are a great nation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réginald Bélair (Cochrane-Superior, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first I want to thank the hon. member for Parry 
Sound-Muskoka, who just spoke, for sharing his time with me.
<P>
	Today, I address this House, and the Bloc Quebecois, as a French 
speaking person living outside Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	Canada is the most decentralized of all modern federations. 
During the sixties, a series of agreements between the federal and 
Quebec governments triggered a decentralization process, and it 
was not necessary to amend the Constitution. These changes have 
allowed Quebec to extend its jurisdiction to areas that traditionally 
came under federal jurisdiction. Examples of this are the selection 
of immigrants and the fact that Quebec is represented at the 
Francophonie summit as a participating government.
<P>
	In a study prepared for the Bélanger-Campeau Commission, 
professor Edmond Orban, an expert on federalism, said that &quot;the 
autonomy of Canadian provinces and their possibilities are, in fact, 
relatively greater than that of the German Länders and particularly 
the Swiss cantons''.
<P>
	Mr. Parizeau himself said the following when he was a Quebec 
minister and delivered a speech at the University of Edinburgh:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``And because rather often in Canada we tend to talk of the 
abusive centralized powers of Ottawa, we tend to forget that in 
reality, Canada is highly decentralized''. This quote is from the 
<I>Globe and Mail</I> of December 9, 1977.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2899"> 2899 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In light of this evolution of the Canadian federation, and in line 
with the changes already made, the government pledged to clarify 
the roles and responsibilities of the various levels of government, 
so as to modernize the federation and make it more respectful of 
the provinces' priorities and areas of jurisdiction.
<P>
	Building a federation that is more receptive to the needs of its 
citizens and better adapted to the realities and challenges of our era 
is our government's goal.
<P>
	The measures announced in the throne speech seek to implement 
the commitments made by the government to improve relations 
between the federal and provincial governments, including 
Quebec, and to truly modernize the federation.
<P>
	Canadians want their country to work. They want the various 
levels of government to be effective and to perform their respective 
roles.
<P>
	The federal government has already brought about important 
changes. It will continue to do whatever is necessary to achieve this 
modernization, in co-operation with the provinces and with all the 
people of Canada.
<P>
	The government has promised, on the one hand, to undertake a 
retooling of the federation on four fronts, and, on the other, to limit 
its spending power. The plan is as follows: first, the government 
intends to withdraw from certain fields of activity, such as 
manpower training, forestry, mining, and recreation, and to transfer 
responsibility to local or regional authorities or to the private 
sector.
<P>
	Second, the involvement of the federal government is no longer 
necessary in certain sectors. The federal government will therefore 
transfer management of these sectors to other levels of government 
or to the private sector.
<P>
	I see, Mr. Speaker, that you are replacing the Speaker of the 
House. This is perhaps a first, having a member of the Bloc 
Quebecois occupy the Speaker's chair in the House of Commons.
<P>
	To continue what I was saying, this is the case for part of the 
transportation infrastructure. Operational control of transportation 
systems and facilities, now a federal responsibility, will be 
transferred to local and private groups. Thus, we will reduce the 
cost, and the services provided will address Canada's real 
transportation needs.
<P>
	Third, in a spirit of increased co-operation with the provinces 
and greater respect for provincial jurisdiction, the government 
intends to work with the provinces to find new forms of 
co-operation and co-management in certain fields, such as 
environmental management, social housing, food inspection, 
tourism, and freshwater fish habitat. The government will also 
explore the possibility of setting up a Canadian securities 
commission, thus ending the proliferation in that sector.
<P>
	However, such initiatives will not be introduced unless a number 
of provinces express an interest. As well, participation is voluntary.
<P>
	Fourth, the government intends to ensure greater harmonization 
of federal and provincial policies.
<P>
	All these measures have as a goal the harmonization of federal 
and provincial initiatives, thus eliminating overlap. They will mean 
significant savings and more efficient services to the public.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	No doubt the most eloquent example of the government's 
intention to respect provincial jurisdiction is our intention to limit 
the federal government's spending power in co-financed programs 
that come under provincial responsibility.
<P>
	The federal government will not use its spending power to create 
new co-financed programs without the consent of the majority of 
the provinces. Provinces setting up and providing equivalent 
programs will be compensated.
<P>
	This is an unprecedented initiative on the part of the federal 
government, which, for the first time ever, is acting on its own 
initiative to limit its spending power, unequivocally, and outside 
constitutional negotiations.
<P>
	The federal budget for 1996-97 consolidates the government's 
initiatives and intentions in this regard. Measures proposed give 
effect to the government's commitment to assume its fiscal 
responsibilities and reduce the deficit to two per cent of the gross 
domestic product for 1997-98 through ongoing reduction of its 
expenditures.
<P>
	The government is also providing long term predictable and 
increasing funding to the provinces for social programs under the 
Canada health and social transfer. What is more, the 1996 budget, 
like the previous one, contains no tax increase.
<P>
	In addition to these measures, the budget confirms the federal 
government's commitment not only to spend less but to spend 
better. In fact, the creation of agencies like the Canada Revenue 
Commission is part of the federal strategy to modernize the 
federation and to better define the respective responsibilities of the 
various levels of government.
<P>
	This government has made every effort to lay a solid foundation 
by bringing the deficit under control, avoiding tax increases, 
cutting red tape, and rationalizing government services to 
Canadians. Its priorities remain job creation, economic prosperity 
and stable social programs. Achieving these goals involves 
modernizing and reinforcing the economic and social union that 
brings all Canadians together.
<P>
	We also firmly believe that changing the way the federation 
works, improving federal-provincial relations, and bringing all 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2900"> 2900 </A></B>
<P>
Canadians closer to the decision making  process will eliminate the 
need for another referendum on secession and the break-up of this 
country.
<P>
	This government has resolutely embarked on a 
co-operation-based process of change. These are the values that 
will guide Canada and help it take on with confidence the 
challenges of the 21st century. The measures and initiatives put 
forward by this government will open a new chapter in 
federal-provincial relations by emphasizing open-mindedness and 
dialogue.
<P>
	The process of change under way is part of an aggressive action 
plan put in place by the Canadian government. It clearly shows that 
the federal government wants to be pragmatic and that it is not the 
great centralizing force portrayed by the official opposition.
<P>
	Canada is a success story, although we agree that our federation 
needs some changes. We are ready to take up the challenge, to roll 
up our sleeves and to get down to work, but we need the 
co-operation of all our Canadian partners. We sincerely hope that 
the Quebec government will be open-minded and agree to act as a 
full-fledged partner of Canada and work with our government to 
modernize the Canadian federation. That was what Quebecers told 
their provincial government on October 30.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	We must continue to build this country and make it stronger. The 
initiatives undertaken by our government clearly show its intention 
to bring about changes that fulfil the aspirations of all our fellow 
citizens.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. 
member was a bit off the mark today. He extolled the virtues of 
Canada. There may be some advantages to living in Canada, but the 
question is whether or not Quebec has the right to decide its own 
future. That is what the questions I will put to him will be about.
<P>
	It feels strange to hear members of this Liberal government 
speak today, given that they had previously recognized 
referendums as a means of decision making. When Quebecers lost 
the referendum in 1982, the federal government acknowledged the 
referendum result.
<P>
	Same thing again with the referendum on the Charlottetown 
accord. Quebecers won, the federalists lost. The government's 
proposal was rejected and, once again, the verdict was readily 
accepted. The question is why does the Prime Minister keep 
repeating day in and day out that a referendum is nothing more than 
a means of public consultation and that any decision made is not 
final.
<P>
	Strangely enough, this change in attitude coincides with a very 
tight vote, with 49.6 per cent of Quebecers voting for sovereignty. 
It took these tight results to notice all of a sudden that the 
government is changing the rules of the democratic game. The 
credibility of democracy  and of our financial institutions are at 
stake here. That is why we are debating this very important issue 
today.
<P>
	Why did it take two referendums before NewFoundland 
eventually joined the Confederation? The first results were not very 
high; they were closer the second time around. The decision to join 
the Constitution in Newfoundland was made on the basis of a very 
close vote-50 or 51 per cent, 50.5 per cent-in a referendum. 
While a 50 per cent plus one verdict is good enough to join the 
Confederation, it is not good enough when you want out.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to tell me why, if it takes 50 per 
cent of the votes plus one to join the Confederation, the same rule 
does not apply for leaving the Confederation. I would like to hear 
what he has to say on this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélair:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to answer this question. 
The hon. member referred to the referendums held in 1982 and 
1995. It is true that Quebecers spoke and that their decision was 
respected.
<P>
	Let me go back to the 1992 Charlottetown accord. At the time, I 
was a member of this House, and so was the hon. member who just 
asked the question. Now, I wonder why Quebec rejected the 
Charlottetown accord, given that it included the distinct society 
concept, a delegation of powers-in the mining, forestry, 
recreation and housing sectors-, an elected Senate, and several 
other major changes.
<P>
	After the 1995 referendum, the Prime Minister said he would 
hold out his hand to Quebecers. We did it by passing the resolution 
on the distinct society, that Bloc members rejected. One has to 
wonder what they want.
<P>
	As for the 50 per cent plus one rule, the Prime Minister also held 
out his hand to Quebecers last week and this week when he told 
them that, should another referendum be held, there would have to 
be agreement on the question. The Prime Minister is talking about 
co-operation. I do not know whether you will accept his offer. 
Probably not.
<P>
	Personally, I would go a little further regarding the percentage 
that should be required, because I really wonder if, from a legal 
standpoint, it is acceptable to destroy a country with a majority of 
just one vote.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	I firmly believe that the percentage required should be higher. 
However, we should, in a spirit of co-operation, agree on this 
percentage, as well as on the question itself.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on the motion before us. It states that the House 
adopt as its own the statement made in 1985 by the current Prime 
Minister. The quote is: ``If we don't win, I'll respect the wishes of 
Quebecers and let them separate''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2901"> 2901 </A></B>
<P>
	That is a very open statement, ``if we don't win''. The term win 
is not identified as what would be a win. It has still not been 
identified some 11 years later. The term ``let them separate'' gives 
no indication of how that tragic action, if it were to take place, 
would take place.
<P>
	The Reform Party cannot support this motion. As a party we 
have said that we will respect a yes vote if that is the vote of the 
people of Quebec, but we have also said that we can only respect it 
if there is an honest question, and if there is honest debate on the 
consequences of the question. If it does happen, it is critical to 
follow the rule of law as much as it can be applied to answering the 
question.
<P>
	We are discussing this motion today largely because of a lack of 
leadership by this government. There is no vision for the future of 
Canada and there certainly is no plan for the future of Canada. The 
lack of leadership, lack of vision and lack of any plan is not only 
reflected in the failed unity issue. It is also reflected in the jobs, 
jobs, jobs which have yet to materialize for Canadians both inside 
and outside of Quebec. It is reflected in a failing economy that still 
has not been revved up to its full potential or anywhere near it. 
There has not been any plan for major changes to our criminal 
justice system that is failing Canadians.
<P>
	While we talk about the failure to address the economy and 
create the jobs which Canadians are so desperately looking for, the 
failure in both those areas plays into the hands of the separatists. 
They can point to the failures in Ottawa and suggest that they could 
do no worse on their own.
<P>
	I recall some 30 years ago when the B and B commission was 
first introduced. The government of the day appointed it in an 
attempt to unite our country, to bring us together as one country. I 
supported the commission which was originally the B and B 
commission but became B and multiculturalism commission. I 
supported it 30 years ago because I thought that was what we must 
do to unite the country and get Canada moving on to the greatness 
that could be ours.
<P>
	After 30 years it is very evident that what has been done over this 
period of time is not working. As a country we have never been 
further apart. The October 1993 election in which 54 Bloc 
members were elected on a mandate to take Quebec out of Canada 
is living testimony, is living proof of the absolute failure of past 
policies, of the status quo. It is not working, yet no one is asking 
why we should be changing.
<P>
	Going back to October 1993, not just 54 Bloc members were 
elected, 205 new members of Parliament were elected to this place, 
an unheard of turnover. Again the vote was a vote for change. 
Canadians were telling Ottawa: ``We are not happy with the status 
quo. We want changes to be made, not just a change of faces, but a 
change of policies and a change of thinking''.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	That message for change was not just reflected in October 1993, 
it was the message Canadians delivered when Meech was rejected 
and when Charlottetown was rejected. Those were very strong 
messages from the voters of Canada that the status quo was not 
going to get us through.
<P>
	With Charlottetown something unheard of happened. The three 
major parties came together in support of a position, as well as the 
major media. All of them said to the voters of Canada to vote for it. 
The Canadian people rejected it.
<P>
	We must never forget the Spicer commission. The government 
of the day put the commission in place after the failure of the 
Meech Lake accord to determine the mood of the Canadian people. 
The taxpayers spent $27 million for Mr. Spicer and his 
commissioners to go all across Canada and talk to hundreds of 
thousands of Canadians to find out what was the mood of the 
country and what was bothering Canadians. Probably all members 
of Parliament have read the report. The message very clearly was 
that we in this place must change.
<P>
	The most important part of the report is the very last quote. It is 
not a quote of Mr. Spicer's or of one of his commissioners; it is a 
quote from one of the hundreds of thousands of Canadians who 
were interviewed. It appears on page 137 under the heading 
``Conclusion'': ``No hyperbole or political hedge can screen any 
member of any legislature who thwarts the will of the people on 
this matter. The voters are watching and waiting''.
<P>
	That was in June 1991. Those were very prophetic words indeed 
when we consider what happened in October 1993. The politicians 
ignored the warnings in that report and because they did not 
respond to the wishes of the Canadian people, 205 new members of 
Parliament were elected.
<P>
	Let us review the October 30, 1995 referendum. There was no 
understanding on the part of the government of the message that 
was delivered in the October 1993 election. The government felt 
that the status quo, good government, would carry the day: ``Do not 
worry, be happy. It is a family feud. Stay out of it. Do not get 
involved. We will win. We do not have a problem''. Politicians 
were encouraged to stay out of Quebec. As a matter of fact, when 
we tried to raise our concerns in the House of Commons we were 
accused of fearmongering. How tragic that almost was on October 
30.
<P>
	As we are doing today, we will continue to debate the yardstick 
for breaking up a country, the 50 per cent plus one. There were 
statements made in the House yesterday which were not accurate. I 
will take a minute to clarify exactly where we are on the question of 
50 per cent plus one, or what percentage of votes is required to 
break up a country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2902"> 2902 </A></B>
<P>
	Actually, it started in the province of Quebec with the leader 
of the Liberals in Quebec. Mr. Johnson said that he was prepared 
to accept 50 per cent plus one because no yardstick had been 
defined. We had gone into this without clearly outlining what the 
number should be, but the Liberal leader in Quebec said that he 
was prepared to accept 50 per cent plus one. At that time the 
Minister of Labour who was leading the government's position in 
Quebec and is now the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
also indicated publicly her support for 50 per cent plus one. Two 
major players in the October 30 referendum were saying to the 
people of Quebec that yes, they would respect 50 per cent plus 
one.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	However there was a lack of a plan or leadership. Mr. Bouchard, 
then the Leader of the Opposition, challenged the Prime Minister to 
back up the quotes that had been made by the minister and Mr. 
Johnson, the leader of the Liberals in Quebec. Tragically the Prime 
Minister backed away from the commitment of both of these 
people and said he did not think he would accept 50 per cent plus 
one. He did not say what he would accept.
<P>
	The tragedy is that the Prime Minister played right into the hands 
of the separatists. He was telling them there would be no 
consequences to their rejection of Canada, that he may or may not 
accept their position. The battle was lost to a great degree right 
there in not making it very clear whether or not the government was 
going to accept the 50 per cent plus one, the will of the voters.
<P>
	We need to clarify that at no time did anyone from my party say 
that it should be 50 per cent plus one. We challenged the 
government to clarify its position on the issue. When the Leader of 
the Opposition challenged the government as to whether it would 
accept 50 per cent plus one, the government missed that great 
opportunity.
<P>
	It is this failure to understand the need for change that has 
brought us to the unfortunate position we are still in today. We as a 
party understood that the status quo was not sufficient, that there 
was going to have to be change.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> What did your party do in the referendum 
campaign?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> A gentleman on the other side of 
the House is questioning our part in the referendum. The 
contribution we made to the referendum campaign was one for 
positive change. We did not stick our heads in the sand saying that 
the status quo was going to carry the day. We realized far better 
than anyone on the government side that change was going to have 
to be made.
<P>
	As part of our contribution to the referendum campaign we 
prepared a list of 20 positive proposals for change that would go a 
long way toward keeping the country united. We went so far as to 
publish the 20 proposals in a full page ad in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> so 
that  all Canadians could see that what we were saying was that the 
status quo was not going to do it, change had to be made and these 
were the changes that would keep the country united.
<P>
	We produced the same ad in French and offered it to many of the 
Quebec print media. Some of them chose not to run it, some did. 
We wanted to get the message to the people in Quebec who wanted 
to reject the separatists that there were 52 members of Parliament 
who agreed with them that the status quo was not going to carry the 
day. We understood the desire and the need for change.
<P>
	We were asked to stay out, that this was a family feud. In the 
11th hour when the government finally realized that its plan was a 
disaster, that it was going to lose the referendum then there was this 
great cry to go to Quebec to try to save it. Whether that worked or 
not is still open for debate. It may have hurt the cause. However we 
did make a contribution toward keeping the country united by 
running those ads.
<P>
	In the 11th hour when the government realized the status quo or 
good government was not going to carry the day, we did see the 
government agree to change and what did it come up with? Distinct 
society and veto. Both already had been rejected by the Canadian 
people and the government was now going to bring them in the 
back door. Never mind what the people of Canada said, the 
government was going to bring them in whether Canadians liked it 
or not. That is a major problem here in Ottawa which has to change.
<P>
	Imagine giving a veto to a separatist government. How was the 
Liberal government able to justify that? How could it give a veto to 
a separatist government whose mandate is to break up our country? 
Unbelievable, but it was done by the government.
<P>
<B>(1555 )</B>
<P>
	We are facing one more battle. The separatists said on the night 
of October 30 that they will be back, that they have one more battle 
to fight and it will be the final battle. We had better be better 
prepared for that one than we were for the October 30 referendum 
or we will lose it. If anything good is going to come out of this 
debate, it is that we are talking about this threat because while it is 
coming, we just do not know how much time we have to prepare for 
it.
<P>
	It has been seven months since that vote on October 30 and the 
Liberal government has yet to come up with a plan to deal with the 
separatists. Day to day it has been going from policy to policy and 
has nothing yet to put before the Canadian people.
<P>
	Our party came up with a plan that we have had published and 
out for months. It is our 20-20 plan, a vision for a new 
Confederation. In producing this document we took a twin track 
approach to dealing with the separatist threat.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2903"> 2903 </A></B>
<P>
	One track is the 20 positive proposals for change that we could 
make to keep Quebec in Canada. There are two common elements 
to those 20 positive proposals for change. One is that they have 
broad acceptance both inside and outside of Quebec. These are 
changes that all of the provinces are looking for, British Columbia, 
Ontario, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, as well as Quebec.
<P>
	They are changes which are going to happen whether we like it 
or not. I say that because these changes mainly involve eliminating 
the duplication and overlap which are taking place between the 
federal government and the provinces. It is going to happen 
because of the fiscal crisis this country is in. We are going to have 
to find a better way of doing a better job with fewer dollars which 
means eliminating a lot of the overlap and duplication.
<P>
	In our 20 positive proposals for change we see a win-win 
situation for keeping the country united. We are going to be dealing 
in a major way with the deficit and debt. The other common 
element is that the changes do not require opening up the 
Constitution. These changes can all be made by a willing 
government. While we have high unemployment and a fiscal crisis, 
we certainly have to look after both of those problems before 
dealing with the Constitution.
<P>
	We have been talking to people about our plan. As I said, it is a 
twin track approach. There is the positive side and the other track 
has the realities of any province leaving this great country of ours. 
That was not on the table prior to the referendum but it certainly 
should have been. Had it been, the separatists would have been 
rejected resoundingly on October 30. Again the government's do 
not worry, be happy, stick its head in the sand attitude resulted in 
our not facing the fact that change was being demanded by the 
Canadian people.
<P>
	What are the realities of breaking up a country? It is important 
that the people in Quebec understand the consequences of their 
vote. All Canadians must understand the consequences of a vote to 
break up the country because it would be painful for all Canadians.
<P>
	In holding my town hall meetings to talk about unity and how to 
keep Canada united, there are those who ask: ``Why are we talking 
about it? Just let Quebec go. Who needs all this discussion?'' I say 
to those people to listen to and read about the consequences of the 
action they are suggesting. It is not just the people of Quebec who 
are going to be affected. All Canadians would be affected if we 
were to break up this great country of ours.
<P>
	These things have to be understood. We certainly have to have 
that debate now. In no way do we want the people in Quebec voting 
in the next referendum without a clear understanding of the 
consequences of that vote. How could we do anything less and look 
at ourselves? How could we not do that and expect the people in 
Quebec to make an informed decision on such a vital and important 
question?
<P>
	We have outlined our plan and as I have said, it has been out for 
months. We have been going across Canada talking to Canadians 
about it and inviting their input: Do you agree or disagree? Is there 
something that we have missed?
<P>
<B>(1600 )</B>
<P>
	The difference between the government and ourselves is it does 
not have a plan. The government is critical of us and it is within its 
right to question us. However, I ask the government, where is your 
plan? Sadly it is not there.
<P>
	Canadians are demanding some clarity to this question. 
Canadians are looking at a government that has no plan. Its plan is 
made up on the run. When we are dealing with such an important 
question, when we are dealing with Canada's future, it just is not 
good enough.
<P>
	The people inside and outside of Quebec are demanding that this 
government start acting in a responsible way and show some 
leadership.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with a great deal of interest to my colleague, 
and, do you know, I understand his federalist reactions when he 
criticizes the position of the Liberals, who lately, to our great 
delight, seem to be committing one mistake after another, to the 
detriment of their cause. I am speaking, for example, of their 
intransigence that even the federalist premier of Alberta has just 
criticized, saying that he does not understand their stubborn 
insistence on interfering in the fields of education and health in 
particular, as these are provincial jurisdictions, and that it is 
harming the cause of federalism.
<P>
	Before that, there were the blunders about the distinct society 
that was not, and the right of veto that seemed equally imaginary. I 
therefore understand very well the position of my hon. colleague, 
who is a federalist and who sees the other federalist party 
stubbornly blundering on and harming the cause of federalism. I 
have only one explanation to give him, and it is this: Whom God 
would destroy He first sends mad.
<P>
	Now, I have a question to ask. Newfoundland was mentioned 
earlier. Newfoundland became a province of Canada as a result of a 
referendum won by a close margin. First of all, I would like my 
colleague to enlighten me on a constitutional point. Back then, did 
the Constitution provide for the arrival of a new member in 
Canada? And if not, why is it constitutional that Newfoundland is a 
member? Would it not be in order to throw it out by force of arms, 
as it has no business being in Canada, having entered it 
unconstitutionally? That is my first question.
<P>
	I have a second question. At the time-I was not yet in Canada 
unfortunately-was the opinion of the nine provinces already there 
sought, because the Prime  Minister is telling us that there is no 
question of allowing Quebec to separate without the consent of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2904"> 2904 </A></B>
<P>
nine other provinces? Was the consent of the nine other provinces 
sought before Newfoundland was allowed into Canada?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
comments of the hon. member. He started out agreeing with the 
Reform position and with the fact that the government is standing 
pat, still sticking its head in the sand and believing that the status 
quo will carry the day. That is wrong and we agree with the hon. 
member on that.
<P>
	Where we disagree is that if we work together we can bring 
about the change needed to keep Canada united. Quebec does not 
need to leave, as the Bloc is suggesting. The problems can be dealt 
with and Canada can remain united.
<P>
	Distinct society and the veto are not what will keep this country 
united. We are going to go into the next century as one country of 
10 equal provinces. That is the way we will face the future.
<P>
	The hon. member asks about a province joining Canada, such as 
when Newfoundland joined Canada. I brought Newfoundland up 
because I was talking about the fact that all provinces are looking 
for the positive changes that we have outlined in our proposals. 
They want more control over areas under our Constitution for 
which they have responsibility.
<P>
	I do not have the background on the mechanics used to allow the 
province of Newfoundland to come into Canada. I would suggest it 
is a different scenario when an existing country is enlarged and 
when a country is destroyed or broken up. If I am correct, the basis 
of the hon. member's question is if it is 50 per cent plus 1 to bring a 
province in, why would the same formula not apply to a province 
that wants to leave? My party and I have not taken a position on 
what the percentage should be, on whether it should be 50 per cent 
plus 1, 55 per cent or 60 per cent. The point we are making is that in 
breaking up a country, those rules should be clearly identified now, 
in advance of the referendum. That is not the sort of debate to get 
into once the referendum has been called.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	The rules must be clearly identified so that the voters understand 
going in if it is going to be 50 per cent plus 1 or 60 per cent. They 
also must have put before them an honest, straightforward question 
about whether they want to stay as part of Canada or leave. Those 
are the two points that I want to make.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
tell the hon. member that the first parliamentary institution in 
Quebec dates back to 1792,  which means that there has been a 
Quebec Parliament for 204 years. It predates Confederation by 75 
years. It must, therefore, be acknowledged that the people of 
Quebec have been in existence as an entity for a very long time. 
The day that certain people in Quebec decided to join Upper 
Canada, there was no referendum held. There was no referendum at 
all. A little group of people in Quebec and Ontario decided to 
create Confederation by joining together the two peoples.
<P>
	Today, they are trying to sell us on the idea that the people of 
Quebec are not a people, whereas they have existed as a people for 
204 years. We are not merely an ethnic group, we are a people who 
have been in existence for at least 204 years, with a parliamentary 
institution. We are one of the first peoples in North America to 
have our own parliamentary institution. All that seems to be getting 
forgotten.
<P>
	So now, trying to make us swallow the idea that the people of 
Quebec are not entitled to get out of the Canadian Confederation 
with 51 per cent, that is 50 per cent plus 1, is like considering that 
this people no longer has its powers as a people, whereas we are the 
oldest people in North America. Before that, there were the native 
people, but they were made up of a number of smaller peoples, 
whom the French Canadians of the time respected, while the 
English Canadians hated them. They were always at war with the 
English, but they always got along well with the French. We have 
always dealt freely with them.
<P>
	This is the big issue. If the agreement between Upper Canada 
and Lower Canada and the two founding peoples had been 
respected, and if it was still respected nowadays, perhaps we would 
not be holding this debate in the House at this time. Over time, 
particularly after the last world war, the federal government started 
to levy taxes, impose its legislation, meddle in the areas of 
education, unemployment insurance, health and so on, all of which 
were areas of jurisdiction of the people of Quebec.
<P>
	When I listen to the speech of the hon. member for Simcoe 
Centre, it does not hold together. He is off topic. That is not the 
subject for today, it is whether the people of Quebec are entitled or 
not to separate with 50 per cent plus one.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for his question. Certainly no one in our party has 
suggested that the people of Quebec are not a people. What the 
numbers should be to take a province out of Canada is a matter for 
debate.
<P>
	Personally, I do not believe it should be 50 per cent plus 1. 
Whatever it is going to be, it has to be outlined in advance of the 
question. We cannot go into a referendum with that question up in 
the air.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2905"> 2905 </A></B>
<P>
	As to the right of Quebecers to leave Canada, Quebec does not 
belong only to Quebecers. Quebec is part of Canada. It belongs 
to all Canadians. When the hon. member talks about taking 
Quebec out of Canada, Canadians are incensed that someone wants 
to destroy their country. When it was suggested that Quebec may 
be divisible, the argument heard from the Bloc was that it was 
not divisible. It cannot be both ways. If Canada is divisible in your 
eyes, then by the same argument Quebec must be divisible.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will be splitting my time with the hon. member for Nunatsiaq.
<P>
	I welcome the opportunity to remind the House of the great 
strength and flexibility of Canada's constitutional structure and 
justice system, and the primacy of the rule of law, of democracy in 
this great country of ours. Too often in the debate about the future 
of Canada, the constitutional and legal foundations of our country 
are characterized as irrelevant, ineffective or to be discarded.
<P>
	This country's Constitution and justice system form the bedrock 
of our society. They are powerful vehicles for preserving the values 
that underlie life in a democratic society. They are in large part 
what makes Canada the much admired country that it is. They were 
built by generations of Canadians, including Quebecers. Our 
Constitution and justice system are not without their legitimate 
critics, but we should consider the motivation of those proposing 
this motion.
<P>
	Too often we hear criticisms of a system that has served 
Canadians well for over a century and a quarter, a system that has 
made Canada's justice system among the most admired in the 
world. Too often we hear the defamation of a constitutional 
framework and a modus vivendi within that framework that has 
made us the envy of the world.
<P>
	We must not be seduced by too clever rhetoric, surreal 
perceptions of this country. We must not ignore the reality of how 
well this country does, in fact, work. We must not ignore how well 
this country has served Quebecers, whose interests the Bloc 
Quebecois professes to represent.
<P>
	It is essential for all Canadians, those in every province and 
territory, to appreciate the strength of the values that underlie our 
Constitution and justice system.
<P>
	Have Canadians from whatever corner of this land done so badly 
by our constitutional principles, by our justice system, by our 
commitment to freedom and the rule of law and by our much 
admired ability to compromise to serve the interests of all 
Canadians? The answer in every case is clearly no.
<P>
	Canadians are the beneficiaries of one of the most egalitarian 
justice systems in the world, and all this in a country that is among 
the most prosperous and peaceful in the world. In a world beset by 
economic turmoil and violence, should we not consider ourselves 
among the very fortunate, despite the musings of the members of 
the official opposition?
<P>
	Our political structure and justice system have not been imposed 
on Canadians. They are a product of continual debate and 
well-intentioned compromise. Decades of effort by Canadians 
from all walks of life, be they elected representatives, public 
servants, members of interest groups or ordinary Canadians, have 
produced a confederation that serves Canada well today and will 
continue to do so in the future.
<P>
	Those who participated in this process of building the 
underpinnings of Canadian society have strived to make our 
systems workable and flexible. All have fought to establish the 
democratic freedoms and human rights that we now take for 
granted. Quebecers have been at the fore of the many legal and 
political advances that have shaped this country. They too have 
built this country and its institutions. Now members of the 
opposition would have us believe that these institutions, the 
development of which so strongly was influenced by the minds and 
souls of Quebecers, come from outside or do not serve them.
<P>
	Canada is populated by diverse cultures, by diverse groups, yet 
our Constitution serves them all. It is not a prison preventing the 
realization of the aspirations of Canadians. It is our home. Our 
Constitution is a flexible vehicle that permits the goals of all 
Canadians to be accommodated. It is a vehicle that allows the 
values so important to the many cultures within Canada to be 
respected and maintained.
<P>
	What are the underlying values in Canada's Constitution and its 
justice system? Certainly, foremost among these values is the 
preservation of freedom and respect for human dignity. Those who 
created Canada shared a fundamental commitment to freedom, 
representative democracy and the rule of law. This commitment not 
only laid the basis for the Constitution of 1867, but set the direction 
for its continuing evolution.
<P>
	Canada is also a peaceable society. Surely this is one of our most 
enduring characteristics. Canada was built out of accommodation, 
not revolution. It endures through the same process today.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	Our legal system is built on the foundation of the rule of law. We 
have a strong an independent judiciary, one that reflects the 
character of our nation. Three of the nine judges of the Supreme 
Court of Canada come from Quebec. No other province has such a 
guarantee. As the President of the Treasury Board said so 
eloquently in the House in December 1994, the soul of Quebec will  

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2906"> 2906 </A></B>
<P>
continue to influence and define Canada as a country for a long 
time to come through its impact on the Supreme Court of Canada.
<P>
	Thus Quebec not only continues to influence the direction of the 
supreme court, but our highest court itself is the product of a 
society based on the rule of law and respect for individual rights. 
We are blessed by a trusted judiciary that permits us to resolve our 
disputes in a civilized, lawful manner. All this we accomplish 
under the fundamental notion of the rule of law.
<P>
	As I stated earlier, Canada's governments and its justice system 
must conform to the fundamental requirements of the charter of 
rights, another reflection of our respect for the rule of law. Our 
charter provides fundamental freedoms, the right to freedom of 
expression, freedom of peaceable assembly and freedom of 
association among them. It asserts the democratic rights of all our 
citizens. It protects accused persons in their interactions with the 
state through safeguards on arrest, detention and interrogation. It 
ensures that criminal proceedings are carried out in a manner which 
respects the rights of the accused.
<P>
	The charter provides equality before and under the law and 
affirms French and English as the official languages of the country. 
Never forget the Supreme Court of Canada required Manitoba to 
ensure its laws were written in both official languages in 
accordance with the Constitution. New Brunswick has enshrined 
similar rights. Let us not forget the Canadian model of federalism 
which has brought such strength to the country.
<P>
	Let us remember Canada's federalism creates a common identity 
and purpose that can transcend differences without replacing joint 
local identities and local communities. Federalism provides the 
structure of an economic union but places it under control of a 
democratic legislature.
<P>
	Federalism allows minority groups to exercise democratic 
control over their communities and to tailor laws and government 
services to meet their own needs and goals. Federalism allows 
Canada to care for all its people. It allows different communities 
within Canada to resolve various issues while at the same time 
offering their elected representatives the chance to be part of 
national policy making.
<P>
	Canadian federalism today is very different from that of the time 
of Confederation. Contrary to the rhetoric of the official 
opposition, federalism is flexible.
<P>
	Federalism is capable of listening and responding to the needs 
and goals of its members. It can adapt and evolve to serve the 
changing needs of Canadians, but federalism must always serve to 
reinforce the many sided character of Canada: a home for many 
peoples, a land of two linguistic majorities, a free and democratic 
society, a strong economic community, a community that provides  
equal opportunity and economic security, and an important player 
on the international stage.
<P>
	Amidst all these democratic institutions as an integral part of 
Canadian federalism, under a legal system premised on respect for 
individuals and the rule of law, Quebecers have prospered. They 
have shared in the creation and evolution of these democratic 
institutions. They have shared in the progress that has brought 
Quebecers to the highest offices of the country, to unsurpassed 
success in education and culture, and to the heads of many of 
Canada's largest and most productive corporations. All this they 
did within Canada, within the present democratic, constitutional 
and legal framework.
<P>
	Has Quebec done so badly under this system, as members of the 
opposition would like Quebecers to believe? The answer is clearly 
no. Canada is a country of freedom, tolerance and compassion. 
Quebecers, like their fellow citizens across this great country, have 
benefited from a governmental system that serves their historical 
cultural interests within the community of cultures that constitutes 
Canada.
<P>
	The government's vision for Canada is one that builds on its 
finest traditions and grows to serve all Canadians and all of Canada 
in its wonderful diversity.
<P>
	I assure the House the government will continue to abide by the 
true principles of democracy and by the rule of law in its dealings 
with the many issues facing the country, including those brought 
forth by the members of the opposition.
<P>
<B>(1620 )</B>
<P>
	We intend to follow the principles that have made this country 
strong, democratic and tolerant as we deal with those who wish to 
tear us asunder. We will not stoop to measures that would do a 
disservice to the principles on which our country was founded.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to direct a question to my 
colleague from Prince-Albert-Churchill River, but first I would 
like to make a comment, because, on a number of occasions in his 
speech he referred to the primacy of law, to the rule of law, to 
justify his government's intervention in the celebrated case of the 
person we can now identify as Mr. ``B'', in reference to plan ``B'', 
that is the Bertrand plan.
<P>
	I am well aware that the member for Prince-Albert-Churchill 
River is himself a lawyer. He is the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Justice. I have not taken law myself, but I believe the 
first thing we learn when we study law is the principle of the 
separation of powers. There is a very clear distinction to be made 
between the political and the judiciary.
<P>
	The member for Prince-Albert, a lawyer and a politician, can 
make this distinction, I am sure. He is well  aware that, in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2907"> 2907 </A></B>
<P>
present debate, the Bertrand case is essentially a political matter. 
All the commentators in Canada agree that it is a political case.
<P>
	This is my comment. Perhaps he could react to it. Since the rule 
of law is so important to him, I would like to hear his comments on 
the reaction of his colleague, the government whip, and of the 
premier of Newfoundland, Mr. Tobin, his former colleague, when 
they say they could not care less about the Quebec referendum act 
and that they did not respect it in the past and will not in the future. 
What does the rule of law mean in such a case?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. As I indicated many times in my speech, it is the 
government's stated intention and we will carry through with that 
intention in all times, in all places and in all circumstances to obey 
and adhere to the rule of law.
<P>
	The hon. member referred to a court case. The actions of the 
federal government with respect to that court case were simply in 
response to the actions taken by the Government of Quebec, taking 
what has been viewed as a rather extraordinary position that the 
rule of law, the Constitution of Canada, the courts of the nation do 
not have any say or any impact on the unilateral declaration of 
independence.
<P>
	It is out of a desire to provide information to the court, to assist 
the court and in response to the actions taken by the Government of 
Quebec that the federal government is involved at all in this 
litigation.
<P>
	Why do we always talk about things that drive us apart and 
emphasize differences? When we look across this great nation what 
are the things that tie us together? Right across the nation we 
believe in tolerance. Right across the nation we believe in working 
together. Right across the nation we believe in generosity and 
helping those who cannot help themselves. These are the 
fundamental principles that underlie our Canadian heritage, our 
Canadian citizenship. These are the values that unite us.
<P>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
	Let us talk about the things that unite us and bring us together 
instead of that which divides and we will find that when we can 
truly bring to the fore these values in a concrete fashion not only 
will it be good for the country in human terms, it will be good for 
the country in economic terms as well.

	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my colleague from Prince-Albert-Churchill River told 
us that this country has been good to Quebecers. So why has 
sovereignty made so much progress?
<P>
	I have been an independentist for more than 35 years. At the 
beginning, in the 1960s, we were seen as crackpots. In the 1966 
provincial election, the Rassemblement pour l'indépendance 
nationale or RIN, which was led by Pierre Bourgault, garnered 
nearly 8 per cent of the vote. In 1970, 23 per cent of the people 
voted for the PQ. In 1973, the PQ received 30 per cent of the vote 
and, in 1976, it came to power.
<P>
	Did the hon. member for Prince-Albert-Churchill River ask 
himself why there are so-called ``separatists''-although we prefer 
to use the term ``sovereignist''-in Quebec?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> Mr. Speaker, perhaps the hon. member would be 
better placed to answer that question. As I have indicated, we on 
this side of the House place our faith in democracy, democratic 
principles, the rule of law and the application of our courts. We are 
sure we will be able to convince all people they should stay in 
Canada and that ultimately we will win.

<P>
	Mr. Speaker, whenever I hear about the two founding nations I 
think of Christopher Columbus stumbling on to America by 
mistake thinking he was somewhere else and finding out there were 
already people here in 1492. Therefore when I hear about the two 
founding nations I think of the Inuit and the Indian people of North 
America.
<P>
	However, I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak on the 
Bloc motion regarding Quebec separation and the wishes of 
Quebecers. I ask the Bloc today to respect the wishes of Quebecers, 
who have twice voted to remain in Canada, and to continue the 
development of the Quebec society within Canada.
<P>
	The right to choose one's political destiny is not an exclusive 
solitary right. It cannot be exercised in isolation from its 
surrounding framework. The right to choose one's destiny does not 
belong to only one part of the population. The right to choose 
belongs to all of the population. Just as the population of Quebec 
has the right to express its views on its political future, so too the 
people of Canada have the right to express their opinion on their 
political future.
<P>
	We are all in this together. Our past, our present and our future 
are shared and our destinies are intertwined.
<P>
	Canadians, including a majority of Quebecers, have made it 
abundantly clear they want their political leaders to work together 
to make positive changes to improve our collective future. Yet the 
separatists refuse to accept and recognize this expression of the 
collective will. They do not respect the wishes of those in Quebec 
who voted against separation and for a renewed Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2908"> 2908 </A></B>
<P>
	I focus today on the wishes and the rights of the aboriginal 
peoples of Canada who live in Quebec. They maintain strongly 
they have the right to choose to remain affiliated with Canada. 
What does the Bloc Quebecois say about aboriginal people's right 
to choose? Does the Bloc Quebecois believe the Inuit, the Cree, 
the Montagnais and the Mohawk have the right to choose their 
own destiny? Does the Parti Quebecois believe in the right of 
aboriginal peoples in Quebec to choose? The actions and the words 
of the Bloc Quebecois and the Parti Quebecois on this issue are 
somewhat contradictory and illogical.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	I remind the Bloc Quebecois of the words written in 1992 by 
Daniel Turp, who by the way was the Bloc candidate in the recent 
federal byelection in Papineau-St. Michel. Mr. Turp wrote a 
chapter in a book of essays on secession. He made some interesting 
statements about the right of aboriginal peoples within Quebec to 
choose their destiny:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In exercising their right to self-determination, the native nations may, like 
Quebec, use consultation mechanisms to freely determine their political status, 
which could include exercising their right to democratic secession. If Quebec 
were to object to sovereignty measures democratically approved by the native 
nations, these nations could undoubtedly claim that their democratic right to 
self-determination and to secession had been violated.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For the right of self-determination, it is up to the majority population of a 
given territory to determine its political status. Where members of the 
Quebecois are in the majority, the future of such territories would likely be 
determined more by these individuals than by the native nations. On the other 
hand, where members of native nations are in the majority, the status of these 
territories would be freely determined by the majority of the individuals living 
there.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If the Quebecois and the native nations were to claim the same land, as may 
well happen, arbitration would be necessary to ensure that all people living in 
the territory of Quebec were able to exercise the right of self-determination as 
established by international law.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Yet despite these pronouncements of one of their own, time after 
time throughout the last referendum, before and after it, other 
representatives of the Bloc Quebecois and the Parti Quebecois have 
denied the right of aboriginal peoples in Quebec to choose.
<P>
	Last fall, the House will recall, the Inuit of northern Quebec, the 
Cree of northern Quebec and the Montagnais held their own 
referendums and voted massively in support of choosing to remain 
in Canada. The Montagnais leader, Guy Bellfleur, said: ``The 
message is clear. We will refuse the forcible inclusion of our people 
and traditional lands in an independent Quebec state''.
<P>
	Northern Quebec Inuit leader Zebedee Nungak stated: ``We will 
not follow you in any journey toward Quebec sovereignty. We are 
one people, determined not to be  bandied about from jurisdiction 
to jurisdiction. We believe very firmly that our rights are protected 
in a way that cannot be snipped by a pair of scissors called Quebec 
sovereignty''.
<P>
	In response the Parti Quebecois said it would not respect the 
aboriginal no votes and denied that the aboriginal peoples could 
remain attached to Canada in the event of Quebec's secession. 
Earlier this year northern Quebec Cree Grand Chief Matthew 
Cooncome stated clearly his peoples' view on the secessionist 
proposal: ``Quebec would be separated from Canada and from the 
Cree. In that situation our lands would still be ours and we have the 
right to choose to remain with them, and the resources they contain, 
in Canada''.
<P>
	This past March at the annual general meeting of the Makivik 
Corporation in Inukjuak Zebedee Nungak reaffirmed the right of 
northern Quebec Inuit to decide their own destiny. At that meeting 
Quebec's native affairs minister, Guy Chevrette, outlined the limits 
of his government's position: ``The continuation of future 
negotiations will be based on principles that our government has 
always advocated, including the respect of the authority of the 
National Assembly and the integrity of Quebec's territory''.
<P>
	Respect needs to be given in order to be gained. The separatists 
cannot continue to deny and ignore those whose views do not 
coincide with their own. Reality must be accepted. Aboriginal 
peoples in Quebec, as in the rest of Canada, have real rights that are 
constitutionally recognized and affirmed. A relationship exists 
between the aboriginal peoples of Canada and the Government of 
Canada. That is real and cannot be wished away.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	Canada is a real country from sea to sea to sea. It is filled with 
real people, aboriginal and others, who care deeply about it and 
about making it work for the benefit of all. Just as one person's 
junk is someone else's treasure, so one person's prison is someone 
else's beloved homeland.
<P>
	For these reasons the Government of Canada rejects the 
opposition motion as amended. The opposition motion has taken 
the Prime Minister's words out of context. The quote properly 
reads: ``We will put our faith in democracy. We will convince the 
people they should stay in Canada and we will win''. The 
opposition motion does not reflect the government's positive action 
to renew the federation.
<P>
	We need to stop antagonizing and offending one another with 
sharp words and fabricated political crises. Let us work together in 
mutual respect, recognizing we all have a stake in what happens.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with interest to my hon. colleague's comments 
as he address the specific part of the country's problem with which 
he is certainly very familiar.
<P>
	It occurred to me this really points to some of the problems and 
some of the reasons the separatists in Quebec feel it is their God 
given right to divide the country. The Liberal government has seen 
fit to enter into agreements with Indians and Inuit to set up separate 
governments across the nation.
<P>
	We are setting up small self-governments in various parts of the 
country based on race. Is it any wonder the people in Quebec would 
be led to believe they should be accorded this same right to divide 
the country and to have their separate government as well? Where 
does it eventually lead?
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member would address that. By its very 
actions the Liberal government is creating and fostering this 
environment across the nation of separateness, of divisiveness.
<P>
	Since we are talking about the possibility of another referendum 
to decide the future of Quebec in Confederation, what percentage 
would be acceptable? Since his leader said 50 per cent plus one is 
not an acceptable level to recognize the right of Quebec to secede, 
what would it be, 70 per cent, 80 per cent?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anawak:</B>
<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Inuktitut.</I>]
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, it is not a matter of percentages that needs to be 
determined today. It will be determined over the next number of 
months if necessary. We do not need to get into percentages today. 
What we will have to determine is what will happen over the course 
of the coming months or years if there is another referendum.
<P>
	On the first question, obviously the hon. member has property 
that as far as he is concerned is his by right. If he does not, I would 
be surprised.
<P>
	Let us say he has a property, a farm or a house with a back yard, a 
front lawn and what not. I am bigger than he is and I come along 
and say: ``we are taking three-quarters of your land but in the 
corner you will have a little area to live on''. I would bet the first 
thing the member would do is say he owns that land legally and 
lawfully.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	We are dealing with the law and legalities and maybe we cannot 
really say that is exactly what happened in the past. We did not 
have legalities for land and we had a poor immigration system. In 
1492 we allowed in all sorts of people.
<P>
	Three-quarters is a conservative figure. If 75 per cent to 80 per 
cent of his land were taken away from him, I am sure the hon. 
member would object very strongly and would cry foul. If 
somebody did that to him I am sure he would know exactly how the 
aboriginal people in Canada feel.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member is leading us to the issue of territorial integrity, which 
is indeed a very important issue. With the right to 
self-determination also comes the right of a people to live within 
clearly defined boundaries.
<P>
	The Canadian Constitution currently guarantees our right to 
clearly defined boundaries. The boundaries of each province 
cannot be altered without the consent of the provincial legislature 
concerned, and not the consent of a municipality, or of the people 
who live on a specific part of the territory governed by this 
legislature. If the legislature wants to consult with the people 
before making a final decision, so much the better.
<P>
	On the day after a yes vote, our borders will be clearly defined. If 
there are suggestions that people living near the Quebec border, 
either in New Brunswick or in Ontario, should apply to join other 
entities, it is not the people of Quebec who will be the 
troublemakers but those acting as agents provocateurs. It is 
therefore in no one's interest to raise these Swiss cheese theories to 
partition Quebec. The dispute over raw-milk cheese has been 
resolved, so let us quit while we are ahead.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anawak:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member spoke of the 
security of borders. Should we not apply that to Canada? The hon. 
member and his party say the boundaries of Quebec are indivisible. 
If the hon. member thinks the boundaries of Canada are divisible, 
surely democratically the boundaries of Quebec should be divisible 
as well. Otherwise that is being hypocritical and discriminatory 
against one or two groups of people that would like to remain part 
of Canada should Quebec ever decide to separate, which I think 
will not be the case ever.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, since the October 30 referendum, the true face of this 
government has emerged. It does not care about the legitimate 
aspirations of Quebec as a people. In fact, all the federalist parties 
represented in this House have been trying to do is bring Quebec in 
line by changing the basic rules of democracy. If we take a look 
back on the constitutional issue these past few years, we notice that 
never before has the federalist camp dared to challenge the 50 per 
cent plus one rule, a rule universally recognized in the democratic 
world.
<P>
	During the 1980 referendum campaign, the current Prime 
Minister was a more than enthusiastic player on  the no side, 
recognizing ipso facto both the validity and legitimacy of the 
referendum 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2910"> 2910 </A></B>
<P>
process. In 1985, in his book entitled <I>Straight from the Heart</I>, the 
Prime Minister wrote, referring to an eventual referendum on 
Quebec's sovereignty, and I quote: ``If we don't win, I'll respect the 
wishes of Quebeckers and let them separate''.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	Again in 1990, he made remarks along the same line before the 
Bélanger-Campeau Commission, when he said: ``I am a democrat 
and I said so repeatedly in 1980, in many speeches to this effect. 
Had we not recognized that Quebec could decide to separate, we 
would have acted differently''.
<P>
	As we can see from such statements, as well as from the massive 
involvement of federalist forces in the referendum campaigns, the 
Prime Minister believes in democracy, that is to say the process by 
which citizens participate in deciding their collective future and in 
whatever comes of it, or at least he did at the time when he made 
these statements. If the whole exercise had been illegal, do you 
think the Prime Minister of Canada and the federalist parties would 
have participated in it with such determination?
<P>
	No. During the last referendum campaign, the federal 
government kept repeating that a victory for the yes side would 
trigger an irreversible process. In the famous speech he made in 
Verdun a few days before the referendum, the Prime Minister said 
that a victory for the no side would mean three things: first, the 
recognition of Quebec as a distinct society; second, a veto power 
for Quebec over any constitutional amendment; third, a 
decentralization of federal powers.
<P>
	Six months later, what happened to these promises and to the 
government's democratic attitude? In December, the government 
pretended to recognize Quebec as a distinct society by passing a 
resolution in this House. This concept does not recognize that 
Quebecers form a people. It has no constitutional value. It is 
merely a statement of principle. It is wishful thinking. The same 
goes for the veto power, which is not included in the Constitution.
<P>
	As for decentralization, this government simply continues to 
interfere in areas of provincial jurisdiction, with measures such as 
the establishment of a securities commission. The promises made 
in Verdun had the same value as those made regarding the GST. 
The government certainly shows a great deal of consistency in this 
respect.
<P>
	However, the same cannot be said regarding Quebec's right to 
self-determination. Given the Liberal government's decision to 
support Mr. B's appeal, it is obvious that those in favour of plan B, 
led by the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, now have the 
upper hand over the democrats in the Liberal Party and the 
government.
<P>
	When he was the Prime Minister's adviser, the current Minister 
of Intergovernmental Affairs said, on March 17, 1995 that, should 
the yes side win the referendum, the federal government should 
make Quebec suffer as much as possible. This same minister 
endorses threats to partition Quebec and claims that Quebec has no 
right to decide its future, even through a democratic process 
recognized by all, except by him and his confederates. Who calls 
the shots in this government? Is it the Prime Minister, who claims 
to be democratic, or the member for Saint-Laurent-Cartierville, 
who is denying Quebecers the right to decide their own future.
<P>
	It is important that this House adopt the motion presented by the 
Bloc Quebecois this morning. There must be a clear signal that the 
Liberal Party is prepared to respect the decision of the people of 
Quebec about their future. If there is not, it would be a spiteful way 
to conduct the debate, an irresponsible way of governing.
<P>
	It is, in fact, worrisome to see this government getting into bed 
with Mr. ``B'', Guy Bertrand, in a legal manoeuvre designed to 
prevent democratic debate. It is just as worrisome to hear the Prime 
Minister call into question the very ground rules of our democratic 
system as it is to see him interfere in Quebec's move toward 
sovereignty.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	It is even more alarming to see this government sit quietly by 
and listen to threats of partitioning Quebec, in the event of a yes 
vote. The government's actions leave no room for doubt. It will 
support those who oppose sovereignty duly obtained through a 
democratic process.
<P>
	Sovereignists respected the verdict last October 30. The 
Government of Quebec did not declare sovereign the regions in 
which a majority voted yes. This would have been anti-democratic.
<P>
	As for the federal government, its promises were so much hot 
air. For it, what the sovereignists are doing is illegal. It 
unequivocally gives its support to the partitionists and those who 
oppose a democratic verdict. It is completely irresponsible. Either 
this government does not know what it is doing and is the 
sorcerer's apprentice of democracy, or it knows very well what it is 
up to with its plan B, and has no intention of observing the most 
elementary rules of democracy. This government is therefore either 
blind or just plain irresponsible. Clearly, Canada must be very 
worried.
<P>
	This motion thus gives the Prime Minister and his colleagues an 
opportunity to reaffirm the democratic values that guide their 
actions. Once and for all, they must stop calling into question the 
democratic rules known to us all. What we are asking is that 
democracy be allowed to operate freely. The sovereignty of Quebec 
is a political debate in which the people of Quebec have 
participated and will participate, under the terms of the 
Referendum Act. 
<P>
<HR>

The national question will be resolved  in this manner, not in a

<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I must say that, listening 
to the Bloc Quebecois member-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> You were impressed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> No, Mr. Speaker, I was not impressed at all.
<P>
	The member says that they are the protectors of democracy, that 
they accept the democratic decision made by Quebecers on October 
30. Yet, that same evening, then Quebec premier Parizeau clearly 
said ``See you next time'', while the current premier threatened us 
again just recently.
<P>
	I promised a constituent of mine that I would ask a question on 
his behalf. The question is: If Bloc Quebecois members truly 
respect democracy, why have there been two referendums, in which 
Quebecers expressed their will to remain Canadians? How could 
separation be achieved with only one yes win in a referendum?
<P>
	The question was asked by a wise nine year old, my son Marco.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Very good 
question.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dalphond-Guiral:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for Vaudreuil-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> You should thank my son.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dalphond-Guiral:</B> Mr. Speaker, could I please thank 
whom I want and in the manner that I wish to?
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for Vaudreuil. I know the riding very 
well, since I grew up there. Children in Vaudreuil are indeed bright 
kids.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	It is true that two referendums were held, one in 1980 and one in 
1995. These two referendums did not result in Quebecers choosing 
to form a country. Quebecers voted no because they were fooled, in 
1980 and in 1995, by federal politicians who promised them a 
Garden of Eden. Fifteen years after the first referendum, it had 
become obvious that the Garden of Eden was still a thing to come. 
Therefore, a second referendum was held. Again, promises were 
made.
<P>
	Someone may tell Quebecers: ``Vote no and Quebec will really 
be recognized as a true society. You will have a veto power; you 
will really be in heaven''. However, if that does not happen, what is 
the logical thing to do? The logical thing to do is to say to 
Quebecers: ``Choose to become a state. You will be able to pass 
your own laws, and to pay your taxes to your elected government''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> Answer the question.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dalphond-Guiral:</B> The hon. member is truly adorable. 
This is extraordinary. Democracy is based on respect, and respect 
implies that promises are kept. When a government such as the one 
to which the hon. member belongs does not keep its promises, it is 
like a slap in the face. The next time, Quebecers will say yes, and 
they will do so loud and clear.
<P>
	I hope that answers Marco's question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is really 
unbelievable that the hon. member claims to have answered the 
question. I think the question was very clear. My colleague wanted 
to know, because her child asked her, how come Quebecers have 
voted twice to stay in Canada and yet separatists continue to ask the 
same question again and again.
<P>
	If Quebecers were to vote yes, can the hon. member tell us 
whether they will have a chance to vote again, or will this be the 
last time?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I can say that it is clear that the day Quebecers choose to 
be a country, they will be one, with everything that entails. What I 
mean is, the promises to be a country, we will keep them 
collectively. It will not be like the federal government's story of 
unkept promises, which is their reality.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 
38, to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight at the 
time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce-Employment Equity Act; the hon. 
member for Fredericton-York-Sunbury-public service of 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am both delighted and privileged to rise on this motion 
by the official opposition and to debate with some of my 
colleagues.
<P>
	I hope people will pay particular attention to what I say here. I 
would like to try to clarify, once and for all, the famous question 
the Prime Minister has been harping on in response to our 
questions and the question our eminent colleague has just asked my 
colleague for Laval-Centre.
<P>
	There were indeed two referendums in Quebec, and they were 
both democratic. They followed the principles of democracy. In 
1976, the Lévesque government was elected on its promise to hold 
a referendum in its first term of office, a promise the Lévesque 
government kept.
<P>
	During the election campaign, Mr. Trudeau and 74 of 75 of his 
followers came to Quebec and put their head on the block.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	I even remember Mr. Trudeau saying: ``Hark ye well, Canada. 
We are not going to ask Quebec to vote no and then drop it. You 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2912"> 2912 </A></B>
<P>
will look after it afterwards. You will  find a solution for Quebec. 
You will be asked to meet Quebec's needs''. This is what your Mr. 
Trudeau came to tell us in Montreal, at the Paul-Sauvé arena. Since 
then, they have demolished the arena, so ashamed were they of Mr. 
Trudeau's unkept promises. Because of this, they demolished the 
Paul-Sauvé arena afterwards. The promises were not kept.
<P>
	Then another government came along. It said: ``The federal 
government had promised to do certain things. Look what it has 
done''. During the night of the long knives, they repatriated a 
Constitution we never signed and which might even be illegal 
because it has not been translated into French. That is what we just 
found out. This is a Constitution they wanted to impose on us.
<P>
	So, we said: ``Look, this does not work. Elect us-that is taking 
place in 1994-and we promise to hold a new referendum, given 
that the Liberals did not keep their word. They did not keep their 
word and, as a result, we are no further ahead as a people''. That is 
how Mr. Parizeau's government came to be voted in office, and this 
government kept its word and held a referendum within more or 
less the first year of its mandate.
<P>
	Moving to the events in Verdun now. Verdun-what a 
coincidence-you probably recall what happened in Verdun back 
in 1914. In Verdun, the Prime Minister made a number of promises. 
``Vote no and you can be sure things will change'', he said. More of 
the same hogwash. They still think we can be fooled. Do we look 
like fools? Think again. We will not be taken in again. We are not 
fools. This time again, we were promised the world, but the Prime 
Minister is proving unable to deliver the merchandise.
<P>
	It is quite obvious that there will be a third referendum. Three is 
a magic number, they say. Between the first and the second one, we 
gained only ten points. We are just four or five tenths short of a 
victory. You crow about winning the referendum with 50.4 per cent 
of the votes. This means that we would need as little as that to win a 
future referendum and our victory would be as valid as yours.
<P>
	We have given the Prime Minister two chances. This is the same 
Prime Minister. We have given him two chances and he failed both 
times. The reason why we respect democracy is that we live in 
Canada and we pay our taxes-we have not started boycotting our 
taxes; the day may come, but we are not there yet-we pay our 
taxes and we are still in Canada because even though 49.6 per cent 
of Quebecers want to leave, that was still not enough. Every day 
since we were elected to this House, we find more reasons to leave. 
They closed the Tokamak facility and gave the money to Triumph 
in British Columbia. They wash off their hands of what is 
happening at the Montreal airport, saying it is none of our business. 
Every day, we could look at more issues and find new reasons to 
leave. There are more than enough reasons.
<P>
	The most recent one is unemployment insurance. My colleague 
across the way who is always interrupting me should take a good 
look at his seat because it may be the last time he sees it. New 
Brunswick is fed up with your policies. They would have us believe 
that Canada is the greatest country in the world. The Prime 
Minister keeps bragging about it. But when he gives out our 
statistics, the Prime Minister is deceiving the UN. They forget to 
mention our illiteracy rate. If they gave the real number of illiterate 
Canadians-not functional illiterates, but real illiterates-we 
would come in fourth place. We would not be No. 1 but No. 4. Stop 
lying to the people. They are fed up with your tactics.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	Furthermore, the reason why Canada is prosperous is not 
because we have a federal system of government, but because 
Canadians and Quebecers work hard day after day. It is not the 
federal government's doing; that, too, is a lie.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harb:</B> Mr. Speaker, I note that the hon. member said that 
someone had lied in the House. I hope things will not deteriorate.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Chair did not hear any such 
comment. I might point out that the debate is pretty turbulent. 
There is a lot of noise on one side of the House, while someone 
from the other side has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> It is Canadians and Quebecers who are 
responsible for the country's prosperity. They are the ones who 
show creativity. They even have develop survival skills, given that 
the federal government keeps targeting the poor.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, think of this as a delicious chocolate cake. If you 
split a very good chocolate cake in two equal parts, it is still as 
good as it was before. It is not any less appetizing because it has 
been split. If Canada is such a great country, it will have no 
problem surviving a separation. Come on. There is nothing to it.
<P>
	There are countries, such as the former U.S.S.R., which are 
federations. However, the U.S.S.R. was not a prosperous country. 
Living in a federal system does not ensure the country's prosperity. 
It has nothing to do with it. There is no connection. None at all. 
However, a country can choose to go it alone, such as Norway, 
which refused, through a democratic referendum, to join the 
European community. Incidentally, the yes and no sides in that 
referendum were led by two women. Why did Norwegians make 
that decision? Because they did not think it would be a good thing 
for their country. It is possible for a small country to be open to the 
whole world and to survive. Of course there will be a next time.
<P>
	Last night, I was very impressed by an article that members 
opposite should definitely read. I will give them the exact 
reference, so they can learn something and finally understand. The 
article, entitled ``What does Quebec want?'', was published by the 
<I>Financial Post</I>, and  was written by Gord Sinclair. There is a 
column called ``Inside Quebec''. The title is ``Look at Canadian 
history through francophones' eyes''. The subtitle read: ``Would 
you feel cheated?'' The author then asks English Canadians to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2913"> 2913 </A></B>
<P>
pretend they are French Canadians and to reread the history of 
Canada.
<P>
	At the end, he says:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``As I have said before, what French Quebec needs to hear are 
the words ``keep Quebec in Canada''. It is respect. Francophone 
Quebecers need to feel that Quebec can be different but accepted as 
equal and never to be cheated again. If you can do that we are going 
to save Canada. If not-'' which means Canada is lost forever.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think that 
people who are following the debate on television must be 
wondering what is going on in this House. They must wonder 
whether there is a national crisis, or an international crisis. What is 
going on?
<P>
	They are listening and wondering what the opposition is up to, 
wasting its time on things we have already dealt with many times, 
over many years. We have been having the same debate for 16, 20, 
30 years.
<P>
	The opposition should be congratulating the government for 
doing a lot more than any other Canadian government has done to 
make federalism flexible. The Prime Minister should be 
congratulated for doing a lot more than any other Prime Minister 
for this country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Against Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harb:</B> This is flexible federalism. Instead, opposition 
members rise in their seats and start attacking the rest of Canada, 
talking about English Canada. There is no such thing as English 
Canada and French Canada, there is one Canada. There are 
Canadians who speak French, they are Canadian; there are 
Canadians who speak English, they are Canadian. Canada is for all 
Canadians, period.
<P>
	Stop rehashing the past, it will not work. There are in Canada 
over 12 million people who are neither French nor English. They 
are Canadian, period. Stop all this nonsense.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay: </B>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member talked about 
nonsense. He is the one who is talking nonsense; it is obvious he 
does not know what what he is talking about. He understands 
absolutely nothing. And on top of that, perhaps I have been talking 
loudly, which is in my nature, but I tried to be very clear on one 
fundamental thing. There are two peoples in this country: yours and 
mine. I will never be part of your people. I am not part of  your 
people. I have mine. It is not yours, you are not part of mine. To be 
part of my people, you have to be in Quebec. You are not in 
Quebec. Does he come from Quebec?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay: </B>No, he does not come from Quebec.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member: </B>He is not far away.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay: </B>There are two peoples in Canada, and the hon. 
member just said there is only one. That is why we are tired of 
fighting and we want to leave. It is very simple, we want to leave. 
That is not complicated.
<P>
	It did not work the first two times. It is not the first time the 
process does not work.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier: </B>Newfoundland voted twice.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay: </B>Newfoundland voted twice. And apparently, if 
we looked very very closely at the results-In any case, ours were 
clear: 94 per cent of the people voted, and we are waiting for the 
next time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened very carefully to the slanderous 
things and the misinformation that were mentioned about the 
referendum results this afternoon, as did, I am sure, a huge segment 
of the population.
<P>
	I want to point out to the opposition members, to the Bloc 
Quebecois, that they were elected with 48 per cent of the votes in 
Quebec. We know full well that the no side, the federalist side, won 
the last referendum. Since they call themselves true democrats, I 
would urge them to recognize our victory and the wish of 
Quebecers to remain in the Canadian federation.
<P>
	I know I do not have much time, however, I want to stress the 
fact that they do not speak on behalf of all Quebecers. Quebecers 
are proud Canadians and, believe me, they have no lesson to 
receive from the Bloc members and the opposition who maintain 
that we do not protect the interests of Quebecers within the 
Canadian federation.
<P>
	Canada without Quebec is unthinkable, which is why we, the 
Quebec members of the Liberal Party-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time allotted to the member has 
expired.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for 
his comments. Unfortunately, he did not hear me well. Maybe he 
was overseas when the referendum results came out. I do not know 
where his figures come from but he is a past master in the art of 
misinformation. It is 49.6 per cent, not 48 per cent, of Quebecers 
who voted yes. Let us get our facts straight.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	Since the elected representatives of provinces other than Quebec 
do not seem to understand at all, for the last  time I am asking the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2914"> 2914 </A></B>
<P>
people of Canada to try to understand what we want and to force 
the government to find a solution and to let us go.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Unfortunately, time is up. It is my duty to 
interrupt the proceedings and put forthwith every question 
necessary to dispose of the business of supply.
<P>
	The question is on the amendment to the amendment. Is it the 
pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment to the amendment?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those in favour of the amendment to 
the amendment will please say yea.

	The House resumed from March 19 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-201, an act to amend the Criminal Code (operation 
while impaired), be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was very pleased to second the private member's bill 
proposed by the member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley which 
would provide a sentence of seven years for the offence of drunk 
driving causing death.
<P>
	This is a very serious issue in Canada today. Let us look at what 
happened in Prince George recently. It was the scene of the murder 
of a young father from Prince Rupert and his two children. The 
murder weapon in this case was an automobile with an impaired 
driver at the wheel.
<P>
	When the offender was sentenced, the entire community, as well 
as virtually everyone who heard  about it in the province of British 
Columbia was shocked at the extremely light sentence of three and 
a half years to be paid for taking three lives.
<P>
	Judges in British Columbia commonly treat lightly the offence 
of using a motor vehicle as a deadly weapon. Impaired driving is a 
very preventable form of death. Sad to say, it is very often our 
young people who lose their lives for making the tragic mistake of 
drinking and driving.
<P>
	For example, in February three young women from the city of 
Vernon in my riding of Okanagan-Shuswap paid that price when 
they decided to drive home from an evening's entertainment at 
nearby Kelowna. They made it only a few miles north of Kelowna 
before they turned in front of a logging truck in the early hours of 
the morning. All three paid the price. They died. Their families and 
friends were devastated.
<P>
	It is our duty to structure the Criminal Code in such a way that 
such unnecessary deaths are prevented, along with the murder of 
innocent victims by drunk drivers. We should send a much stronger 
message in the sentences handed out for drunk driving offences.
<P>
<B>(1750 )</B>
<P>
	It is not only the young people who like to party. If we could 
convince them as soon as they start to drive that alcohol and 
gasoline are an extremely dangerous and deadly mixture, the good 
habit of not driving when they have been drinking would probably 
stay with them all their lives.
<P>
	A poster which hangs not far from the Parliament Buildings says 
that if you are old enough to drink, you are old enough to drive: 
Choose one. That is excellent advice. A very good way to 
emphasize that message would be to include a minimum sentence 
of seven years for drunk driving causing death.
<P>
	There are many sad figures available about drunk driving. For 
example, there were a total of 6,700 alcohol related accidents in 
British Columbia in 1994, including 3,231 personal injury claims 
and 138 fatalities. There were 3,331 accidents with property 
damage and 11,379 impaired driving offences.
<P>
	In my riding of Okanagan-Shuswap the total number of 
impaired offences for 1994 was 406. That number only represents 
the drivers who were caught by police. For every one caught, many 
more manage to get away with drinking and driving until that 
fateful day when a child rides his bike suddenly around the corner 
or a grandmother suddenly steps into a downtown crosswalk or 
another driver does something a little too fast for the delayed 
reflexes of that impaired driver.
<P>
	The cost of impaired driving is not limited to accidents. An 
estimated $200 million is spent on enforcement, court, medical and 
other costs in British Columbia as a direct result of drinking and 
driving. That  does not get into the terrible emotional costs to the 
families. Look at that $200 million and what it could do. It could 
pay nurses' salaries. It could help provide essential medical 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2916"> 2916 </A></B>
<P>
services like kidney dialysis, x-rays or CAT scans. It could be used 
to provide computers for British Columbia classrooms. That $200 
million thrown away because of drinking and driving represents a 
great loss to the people of B.C.
<P>
	The Insurance Corporation of British Columbia estimates that 21 
cents of every premium dollar is spent repairing damage done by 
drunk drivers. That is a very important point because most families 
in British Columbia are having a very difficult time making ends 
meet. Most B.C. families also own a motor vehicle. It is common 
for families to spend $3 a day or more just to insure their cars, and 
21 per cent of that goes to repair damage done by drunk drivers.
<P>
	We could say that drunk driving increases the cost of every 
family's premiums by at least 63 cents a day or $4.41 a week. That 
would buy every family a couple of litres of milk and a loaf of 
bread every week. Maybe that is not a big deal to the members of 
Parliament whose inflated egos make them think they deserve the 
gold plated pension plan they voted in for themselves. I can assure 
my colleagues that is a very big deal to the grocery budgets of most 
young mothers in particular.
<P>
	The dollar costs of drunk driving are not just the numbers on a 
sheet of paper. They represent a burden to the family income at a 
time when most families have far too little income as it is. In large 
measure this is due to the excessive spending and the resulting 
excessive taxes imposed by Liberal, Conservative and NDP 
governments, those advocates of big government.
<P>
	Let us look at drunk driving causing death in a different way. Are 
today's penalties doing the essential job of preventing drinking and 
driving? Those penalties include the following: The punishment for 
a first offence is loss of privileges and a fine of up to $2,000. The 
punishment for a second offence is a mandatory jail sentence of 14 
days to one year. The punishment for a charge of impaired driving 
causing bodily harm is a maximum 10-year sentence and 10 years 
of prohibition from driving, which means they can go into court 
and bargain it away.
<P>
<B>(1755 )</B>
<P>
	The punishment for a charge of impaired driving causing death 
carries a maximum penalty which includes a 14-year jail sentence 
and up to 10 years from driving. I do not know of one case that even 
touches that point. We just heard about a judge who gave three and 
half years for taking three lives and yet the opportunity was there 
for him to give up to 10 years.
<P>
	A recent tragedy involving the death of a 17-year-old youth in 
my riding has reopened the question of more severe sentences for 
impaired driving among the  residents of Vernon and area. Because 
the offender had a history of alcohol related offences, concerned 
citizens of the Vernon area collected 5,000 signatures on a petition 
calling for stiffer and longer sentences.
<P>
	In view of the tragic damage that driving while impaired can 
cause, I strongly support the requirement of much stronger 
sentences for drunk driving causing death.
<P>
	Some people may object, especially on the government side, 
saying that to impose these kinds of penalties is too harsh. Is it too 
harsh for taking the lives of a mother, father or children, because 
the excuse will be: ``I was drunk when it happened''.
<P>
	The truth is that most offenders who are guilty of driving while 
impaired have committed one or more previous alcohol related 
offences. In other words, for those on the other side who are having 
trouble with this, in most cases it is not the first time they have 
been charged. In most cases it is not the first time they had been in 
an accident. Of course, we have no idea of how many times they 
also drove while impaired and got away with it. We will never 
know.
<P>
	I have always believed that the first responsibility of any 
government is to protect the innocent and law-abiding citizens to 
the best of its ability. For far too long we have seen that 
governments have not lived up to that and it is time we started. I 
strongly urge that we take the first step by supporting this bill. 
Having a stiffer penalty may be just the kind of tough love we hear 
talked about all the time that could save lives. In fact, I strongly 
believe that if such a penalty had been in effect, maybe we could 
have saved those three women I talked about earlier.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to remind all hon. members in the 
House that when they stand to address this bill, they have to face 
the public. They have to go back and look their constituents in the 
eye. Believe me, there is not one in this House in our term that will 
not have a case of death caused by impaired driving before them in 
their own constituency. I hope they all remember that when the 
time comes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Wells (South Shore, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on Bill C-201, introduced by the hon. member for 
Prince George-Bulkley Valley. This bill would increase the 
minimum sentence for impaired driving causing death to seven 
years.
<P>
	I share the member's concern about the serious problem of 
impaired driving. Indeed, all Canadians share this concern. I would 
readily lend my support to any measures which would be truly 
effective in deterring impaired driving. The challenge is finding 
measures which are effective.
<P>
	A seven-year sentence can be a reasonable sentence in some 
circumstances. In some circumstances it may not be enough and in 
other circumstances it may be too much. I  cannot support the bill 
because I do not believe we should limit a trial judge's discretion in 
sentencing in this way. The sentence must be proportional to the

gravity of the crime. This longstanding principle of the criminal 
law is a fundamental principle of sentencing. The proposed 
amendment would be inconsistent with that principle and for that 
reason I cannot support it.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	The current law provides that the maximum punishment for 
impaired driving causing death is 14 years imprisonment. In some 
cases this may not be enough. Bill C-201 proposes a minimum 
sentence of seven years imprisonment be added to the section.
<P>
	I am aware that the public is often outraged by the sentences 
imposed in individual cases, sentences that often do not appear to 
reflect the severity of the crime, or do not come close to the 
maximum set out in the code. This is one of the primary reasons for 
including the principles and purposes of sentencing in the Criminal 
Code. I am confident that these measures will ensure greater 
consistency in sentencing for similar offences. The fundamental 
principle as expressed in section 718.1 of the Criminal Code is: ``A 
sentence must be proportional to the gravity of the offence and the 
degree of responsibility of the offender''.
<P>
	Imposing a minimum sentence for one particular offence in 
response to public outrage over particular cases where the sentence 
was considered inadequate is not a long term solution to any of the 
problems caused by impaired driving. It is not how our criminal 
justice system should be changed and is not in keeping with the 
fundamental principles of sentencing.
<P>
	The issue of minimum sentences was fully canvassed by the 
government in the mid-1980s before the Criminal Code 
amendments to the impaired driving provisions were passed in 
1985. The 1985 amendments added two new offences, impaired 
driving causing bodily harm and impaired driving causing death, 
with maximum penalties of 10 and 14 years respectively. No 
minimum sentences were provided because a conviction for such 
offences is based on fault.
<P>
	To prove the offence it must be proven beyond a reasonable 
doubt that the impaired driving resulted in the death or bodily 
harm. Similarly the sentence imposed must also take into account 
the degree of fault of the offender. For example, if a pedestrian runs 
between parked cars into the path of an impaired driver and is 
killed, should the impaired driver receive the most severe 
punishment permitted under the code? While his impaired driving 
may have contributed to the accident because a sober driver could 
perhaps have avoided the pedestrian, it may well be that even a 
sober driver would not have been able to avoid the accident.
<P>
	The impaired driver must of course be punished for driving 
while impaired. However, I would not agree with a minimum 
sentence approach that ignores the many other factors considered 
by a judge when drafting a sentence, including the offender's 
record which may not have included previous impaired driving 
charges.
<P>
	We must ask ourselves whether a minimum sentence would deter 
impaired driving behaviour. I do not believe it would. Our efforts to 
reduce and ideally to eliminate impaired driving have to focus on 
early prevention and perhaps even a zero tolerance for drinking and 
driving. Perhaps we should be considering a reduction of the .08 
standard that is now part of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	In addition to the law, there must be strict enforcement and 
greater public awareness and education. This is the approach we 
have been taking in Canada and throughout North America for the 
past 15 years. This approach has been successful. It has not reduced 
impaired driving to zero, but significant reduction in the number of 
charges of impaired driving and impaired driving behaviour have 
been experienced. We have to a large extent changed the public 
perception of drinking and driving. It is no longer socially 
acceptable as it once was. Through the combined efforts of federal 
and provincial governments and municipalities across Canada, this 
trend should continue.
<P>
	Impaired driving is a unique example of where both federal and 
provincial laws operate. The Criminal Code sets out a range of 
offences including impaired driving; driving with a blood alcohol 
content over .08; refusing to provide a breath sample; driving while 
disqualified; impaired driving causing bodily harm; and impaired 
driving causing death. Penalties vary with the seriousness of the 
offence.
<P>
<B>(1805 )</B>
<P>
	In addition to the federal criminal provisions, the highway safety 
legislation of all provinces imposes sanctions on impaired drivers 
in accordance with the provinces' responsibilities for driver and 
vehicle licensing and highway safety. Even before a driver is 
convicted of impaired driving, some provincial laws impose 
licence suspensions for up to three months. Upon conviction for 
impaired driving, a driver's licence will be suspended for a period 
of six months to five years, depending on the province and the 
driver's previous record.
<P>
	Some provinces have legislation to impound the vehicle driven 
by drivers while their licence is under suspension. The combined 
effect of these provincial and federal laws has had an impact on 
reducing the occurrence of impaired driving.
<P>
	As my colleague has pointed out, when tragedy occurs the 
inadequacy of the law is often singled out as the cause. Some 
members seem to believe that so long as a law is transgressed it is 
not efficient and the penalties are not high enough. I do not share 
this view and I believe it is a rather naive way of seeing things.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2918"> 2918 </A></B>
<P>
	It does not necessarily mean that our laws are to blame because 
they are infringed. However if our criminal law is in need of 
reform, I would fully support a comprehensive reform based on 
adequate research and consultation rather than on a speedy 
amendment. I know we would all readily support initiatives that 
could be shown to bring about further reductions in impaired 
driving.
<P>
	I should point out that Bill C-17, an omnibus piece of legislation 
which is awaiting second reading, proposes a range of amendments 
to improve the criminal law. Included in that package are a number 
of amendments to improve the impaired driving provisions, 
including clarification of the provisions regarding mandatory 
prohibition orders and the use of evidence in blood samples. Bill 
C-17 demonstrates that this government is prepared to make 
changes and effective amendments, amendments which follow 
from adequate research and consultation and which are consistent 
with the underlying principles of the criminal law.
<P>
	I do not wish to suggest that our laws are perfect. Indeed there is 
always room for improvement. The incident the member referred 
to in his speech during the first hour of the debate on this bill where 
an individual killed three members of the same family while 
driving impaired and was sentenced to three and one-half years is a 
sad one. The judge had the discretion in that case to impose a 
sentence of 14 years but he chose not to.
<P>
	All members of this House should work together to develop 
solutions that will lead to reducing impaired driving. This does not 
necessarily mean changing the law. It means speaking out against 
impaired driving at every opportunity, supporting community 
programs, supporting groups like MADD and PRIDE, spreading 
the message that Canada does not tolerate impaired drivers.
<P>
	However the solution is not to take away judicial discretion. If 
changes to the criminal law are needed, let us do it right and look at 
the advantages and disadvantages of various options and their 
effectiveness. I do not believe that Bill C-201 is the solution and I 
cannot support it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to stand in support of Bill C-201 which is sponsored by my 
colleague, the member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley.
<P>
	In doing so I am aware of an event which took place in this 
House just 12 years ago, an event which contributed to the death of 
thousands of Canadians. On April 5, 1984 Private Member's Bill 
C-229 was allowed to die. With its demise approximately 23,000 
Canadian lives were put at risk and many of them did die. Another 
tragedy is that many of those who died were innocent children.
<P>
	Why do I bring up a bill that failed to pass 12 years ago? Because 
Bill C-229 is very similar to the bill we are  debating this evening, 
Bill C-201. Like Bill C-201 the earlier bill sought to do something 
about the number of people who lay bleeding and dying on roads 
and highways in ridings all across Canada.
<P>
	We will hear plenty of statistics in support of this bill but we 
must never forget that behind each statistic is a story. They are 
stories such as that of 16-year old Crystal Nyhuis from my riding of 
Simcoe Centre. During the time that has elapsed since this House 
failed to pass Bill C-229 in 1984 Crystal and approximately 23,000 
others have died from the deadly mixture of alcohol and 
automobiles and with them have died their dreams.
<P>
<B>(1810 )</B>
<P>
	On June 10, 1994 Crystal's dreams were snuffed out. At 10 p.m. 
at the intersection of Innisfil Beach Road and the 10th Side Road a 
drunken driver slammed into the car driven by her boyfriend. 
Crystal's dreams died that night, her dream of marrying her high 
school sweetheart and of becoming a social worker. This innocent 
young teen who was such a good listener and who offered advice 
that belied her young age was now silenced.
<P>
	How many more Crystals must die before this House deals in a 
serious way with the crime of impaired driving? As we look at the 
statistics of the nearly 1,500 people who die every year in Canada 
because someone insists on drinking and driving, let us remember 
Crystal's needless death. Remember also the people left behind. 
John and Simone Nyhuis remember their beautiful young daughter 
who died too young.
<P>
	Following her death, Crystal's parents placed flowers and 
candles around the grade eight student's graduation picture. 
Crystal's mom told a reporter that every night she lights the 
candles: ``It is all I have left of her''. Summer dawned on that June 
day in 1994, just as it does for us in this House today, and the 
thoughts of Crystal's mom turn to her daughter. ``I miss the 
sounds'', she said. ``Our home used to be packed with teenagers. 
She would come through the door with five or ten of her friends. I 
miss her physical presence. There are still days when I cannot 
believe she is gone''.
<P>
	How many other John and Simones must suffer the agony of 
losing a child before this House acts to curb the needless slaughter 
that occurs on Canada's roads? Every six hours across this country 
a police officer knocks on a door to announce that a child, a mother 
or a father will not be coming home any more. They have died 
because the legislators have failed to act.
<P>
	Some wrongly charge that a law will not stop the needless 
slaughter on our roads and highways, but let us consider this 
argument. Partly because of harsher laws enacted in the 1980s, 
fewer people are dying today. In 1980 the typical sentence for 
killing someone while drunk was a $500 fine and a 90-day licence 
suspension. Changes to the law in 1985 which allowed blood 
sampling of drivers suspected of drinking and driving,  along with 
the addition of new sections to the Criminal Code have all 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2919"> 2919 </A></B>
<P>
contributed to a drop in the number of people being charged with 
impaired driving. But much more needs to be done.
<P>
	What about the fact that 63 per cent of all people charged with 
impaired driving are second time, third time and even fourth time 
offenders? They refuse to listen and about 1,500 people are still 
dying needlessly across this country every year. In Ontario alone, 
alcohol is involved in 43 per cent of all motor vehicle fatalities. 
Because of alcohol related crashes, 565 people died in the province 
of Ontario in 1993.
<P>
	It is true that those who murder by using vehicles face a 
maximum sentence of 14 years. However, every member in this 
House knows of people in their ridings who get off with sentences 
of six months. This bill would establish a minimum sentence of 
seven years so that those who up to now have faced a slap on the 
wrist for murdering with an automobile will think twice before 
drinking and driving.
<P>
	Bill C-201 will deter impaired drivers while suitably punishing 
those who will kill while impaired. Some will think that the use of 
the word murder in connection with someone who kills with an 
automobile is too harsh. I do not think so and neither do John and 
Simone Nyhuis. I will quote again from the Nyhuis family. ``To me 
drinking and driving is no different than taking a gun and shooting 
someone'', says Simone. Her husband John agrees. He says: 
``When you get behind the wheel of a car and you have been 
drinking, that car becomes a lethal weapon''.
<P>
	We as legislators must stop looking upon alcohol as something 
many of us, including myself, treat as a social drink. While it is a 
social drink to many of us, I would hope none of us would get so 
drunk that we cannot speak coherently or walk a straight line and 
then climb into 5,000 pounds of deadly metal. However, if we or 
anyone else does and we kill an innocent person then we are guilty 
of murder, just as if we had shot them with a gun.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	How many more people like Crystal will have to die before we 
realize the seriousness of the crime of drinking and driving?
<P>
	It is a sad reality that automobile crashes are the leading cause of 
death of those under 21 years of age. More die as a result of 
impaired driving related accidents than all other causes combined. 
What a senseless waste of young lives. What an unforgettable 
tragedy.
<P>
	These deaths do not tell the whole story. The Ontario Medical 
Association estimates that it costs our economy at least $100 
million annually to deal with the approximately 100,000 people 
injured because of impaired drivers.
<P>
	Behind those injured drivers there are 100,000 stories each year. 
One of those stories is about Colleen Blair. This 18-year old 
Ontario girl survived the November 11, 1994 crash that killed her 
18-year old friend Raeann McNeely, a victim of an impaired driver. 
The crash left survivor Colleen brain damaged and unable to walk 
on her own. She has difficulty controlling her emotions. She has 
limited memory. Although she is now 21, she is in many ways like 
a five-year-old. A family member talks about how Colleen's life 
has been changed by this senseless tragedy: ``She had a right to 
expect she would get married and have kids some day, but now 
she's 21 and has no life''.
<P>
	At the time of the accident Colleen was studying horticulture. 
She loved flowers and had a collection of her most artistic 
arrangements. Now she cannot even remember if she was a student. 
She needs constant care and is constantly apologizing to her family 
for being a burden. Because of the brain damage she does not 
understand that her injuries are in no way her fault.
<P>
	During the time that has elapsed since the House refused to act 
on Bill C-229 in 1984, approximately one million people like 
Colleen Blair have had to suffer needless pain. Approximately one 
person is injured every five minutes from alcohol related crashes. 
In the past 12 years since Bill C-229 was killed, our overburdened 
medical system has paid out over $1 billion to care for the victims 
of impaired drivers.
<P>
	How much longer will police officers like Sergeant Fitz Gaylord 
of the Madoc OPP have to respond to alcohol related accidents that 
claim so many young lives, such as a recent accident that killed two 
young men? Sergeant Gaylord described the scene: ``A twisted car 
wrapped around a tree, two bodies laid out on the ground and the 
ones left in the car screaming that they were going to die''.
<P>
	Coroner Andy Quinn, who pronounced the young men dead on 
the scene, said: ``For me, it is just immensely sad to see these 
young people dying. I just hate to pull kids out of cars. It is an 
incredibly hard thing to do and the whole time you are doing it, you 
are just thinking of the families and the terrible loss of young 
lives''.
<P>
	Before the House finally acts to send a message to people that 
impaired driving is unacceptable, how many more mothers and 
fathers will walk by their son's or daughter's bedroom at night 
knowing they will never again share the many things they had 
planned to do together? How many more fathers will never get the 
chance to walk their daughters down the aisle on their wedding 
day? How many more mothers will suffer the pain and agony of 
knowing their child will never come home again? How much 
longer will we as legislators stand by and watch people die 
needlessly? We need Bill C-201 to deter people from drinking and 
driving.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2920"> 2920 </A></B>
<P>
	I end my thoughts on Bill C-201 with the words of Arnold 
Malone, who drafted the bill that was defeated in the House 12 
years ago. Mr. Malone said that to stop the carnage on our 
highways we must start a war against people who drink and drive. 
Mr. Malone's war analogy still rings true today. Just as the second 
world war claimed 42,000 Canadians, approximately 23,000 
Canadians have died since the House refused to pass Bill C-229 
in 1984. Just as the second world war saw 54,000 soldiers 
wounded, over one million Canadians have been injured as a result 
of drunken drivers since 1984.
<P>
	These are the types of figures Mr. Malone also used when he 
said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We need another war. We need a war against drunken drivers. We need a war 
which will place a real deterrent against drunken driving.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>More importantly, we must recognize that we all have limits. We must realize 
that the laws are such that if we are inebriated, we had best seek alternative 
transportation. In communities all across Canada there are growing concerns 
that something must be done to curtail the extent of alcohol use while driving an 
automobile.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	Although the House refused to act 12 years ago when a similar 
bill was before it, we can now ensure that fewer lives are lost 
because of drunken drivers by supporting Bill C-201. I urge my 
fellow members to support the legislation.
<P>

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-201, 
an act to amend the Criminal Code (operation while impaired), be 
read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity speak on Bill C-201, 
which provides for a seven year minimum sentence for impaired 
driving causing death.
<P>
	I share the concerns of the hon. member who sponsored the bill 
with respect to the problem of impaired driving and I also share the 
concerns of my constituents of Windsor-St. Clair who see 
impaired driving as a serious problem.
<P>
	I see problems with this bill, one of which is its focus on 
punishment rather than on more efficient and productive forms of 
deterrence.
<P>
	The Criminal Code was amended with respect to impaired 
driving in 1985. At that time the charges of impaired driving 
causing bodily harm and impaired driving causing death were 
added to allow for more serious penalties in cases in which injuries 
or death resulted from impaired driving.
<P>
	In the case of impaired driving causing bodily harm the 
maximum is 10 years, and causing death the maximum is 14 years.
<P>
	At the same time other charges are available to the crown where 
there is a death involving the use of a motor vehicle and alcohol or 
drugs. The dangerous driving sections and the criminal negligence 
causing death sections of the code carry major maximum penalties. 
It is not uncommon for these sections to be used where alcohol or 
drugs have been involved in a motor vehicle accident.
<P>
	In the early and mid-1980s federal, provincial and territorial 
governments really turned their minds to impaired driving, 
acknowledging it was a serious social problem. They did this in 
response to concerns in their own communities. This was because 
of the cold, hard facts that people were not deterred by criminal 
penalties and that people and property were being destroyed by the 
activity of those who drink and drive.
<P>
	The question of how to deter people from pursuing this 
decidedly undesirable activity resulted in a concerted effort by 
governments, non-governmental organizations and even by the 
beverage alcohol industry to tackle the problem. In this case the 
beverage alcohol industry should commended because, unlike the 
tobacco industry which consistently denies there is any health 
problem in terms of using its products, the beverage alcohol 
industry recognizes there can be a downside to the use of its 
products when the use is excessive or when it is combined with 
other behaviours.
<P>
	The focus was in part on the Criminal Code at the time. The code 
was refined with increased penalties and with a range of additional 
offences to make it more flexible, but also with a range of devices 
to allow easier prosecution.
<P>
	The provinces also took steps within their justice administrative 
powers and in their highway traffic management jurisdictions to 
deal with the problems. For instance, mandatory licence 
suspensions are standard on conviction and in some provinces 
vehicles are impounded for the period of the suspension.
<P>
	Governments and non-government organizations and industrial 
groups entered into public education campaigns which research has 
shown had an effect on the way we view drinking and driving. 
Although I am sometimes critical of other parties for using 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2921"> 2921 </A></B>
<P>
anecdotal  evidence, I think it is useful here in this sense. I think we 
all know examples of anecdotal evidence which support the 
research I am talking about.
<P>
	We all know people who today without any embarrassment 
simply leave their cars at home and take a cab when they are out for 
a big night on the town or who engage in negotiations with their 
friends to ensure they have a designated driver.
<P>
<B>(1825 )</B>
<P>
	This change in the attitude toward drinking and driving has been 
a very effective deterrent, better than any changes in the Criminal 
Code. We know this from the research that has been done.
<P>
	I know, however, this has not abolished the problem and I dare 
say that in spite of some people's desire for a quick fix we will not 
solve the problem completely. Someone will always have an extra 
drink and always think they can still drive.
<P>
	I raise this point to corroborate my belief that punishment is not 
the only way, indeed not the best way, to deter people and that we 
are not necessarily in Canada on the wrong path. It is easy to seize 
on a fixed minimum penalty as a solution to our problem.
<P>
	Let us look at the other side of the coin. Does a fixed penalty 
cause any problems in the process? We already know it is not the 
most efficient deterrent. What we also have consider is that the 
minimum sentence removes judicial discretion which is necessary 
to allow courts to take into account the facts of each particular case. 
I suggest minimum penalties and removing a judge's discretion 
should not be handed out easily or glibly.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Nonsense.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Cohen:</B> For 11 years I, unlike the member who is heckling 
me, prosecuted criminal code offences for the crown attorney of the 
county of Essex. During that time I prosecuted an awful lot of 
impaired driving charges. I would venture a guess that in most 
jurisdictions crowns, particularly that operate in provincial court, 
do more impaired driving trials than almost anything else.
<P>
	Every once in a while cases arose which required flexibility in 
terms of sentencing. In the case of a simple impaired driving that 
flexibility is not there. There are prescribed minimums and those 
minimums have to be followed and in all cases of impaired driving 
there are some prescribed minimums. There are cases where there 
is an impairment but where there are other factors involved.
<P>
	I give an example which has been much heralded in the media 
which comes out of Windsor and Essex County. We recently had an 
example of quite creative sentencing. I say with some pride in my 
community that the criminal bench there deals in a creative way 
very often with problems. It is the case of Kevin Hollinsky. Mr. 
Hollinsky is a young man who was out drinking one  night with his 
friends. He drank, he drove and on the way home there was an 
accident and both of his friends were killed.
<P>
	The parents of both of these victims came to the court to support 
Kevin Hollinsky and during the sentencing process the judge 
decided to accede to a request by defence counsel for a long period 
of probation and a community service order.
<P>
	As a result, Kevin Hollinsky embarked on a remarkable 
community education campaign throughout Windsor and Essex 
County which members of the Windsor police force, probation 
officers and others who are very experienced in this area said 
resulted in a remarkable odyssey and remarkable result.
<P>
	Last summer in Windsor and Essex County there were no 
incidents of injury or death as a result of impaired driving among 
young people. Had there been a minimum penalty of seven years 
Kevin Hollinsky would have been in jail during that period of time 
and one wonders how the community would have benefited from 
that. Instead he has educated hundreds of young people and brought 
home to them in a very serious, personal and emotional way the 
disastrous results of the behaviour of drinking and driving.
<P>
	It is misleading to suggest, as some members have, that judges 
are flippant in their sentences, that faced with a conviction of 
impaired driving causing death they routinely slap people on the 
wrist; the suggestion I heard here today.
<P>
	The government takes these problems very seriously. We have 
taken steps to ensure sentences are more consistent across the 
country. We did this in Bill C-41, which members opposite 
including some who spoke today opposed on other grounds.
<P>
<B>(1830 )</B>
<P>
	We define principles of sentencing. Sentencing is there to 
denounce unlawful conduct, to deter the offender and other persons 
from committing offences, to separate offenders from society 
where necessary, to assist in rehabilitating offenders, to provide 
reparations for harm done to victims or to the community, and to 
promote a sense of responsibility in offenders and 
acknowledgement of the harm done to victims and the community.
<P>
	A seven-year mandatory minimum sentence does not meet those 
requirements of the law. A seven-year minimum mandatory 
sentence is a quick fix which is intended only to punish. I would 
suggest that with the principles entrenched in the Criminal Code, 
we do not need to spell out for judges the minimum that should be 
imposed in particular circumstances. Instead, we have given them 
the guidance to exercise their discretion.
<P>
	I also believe very strongly that we cannot support ad hoc 
amendments to the code. When the government proposes code 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2922"> 2922 </A></B>
<P>
amendments after comprehensive study  and consultations we are 
criticized for singling out certain provisions for amendment rather 
than undertaking more fundamental reform. These very same 
members have done that with us.
<P>
	This amendment seeks to impose a minimum on a single 
provision of the code, impaired driving causing death. However no 
similar amendments are proposed for other offences, for example 
impaired driving causing bodily harm, criminal negligence causing 
death or bodily harm, dangerous driving causing death or bodily 
harm. It is not a comprehensive approach. It is a quick fix. I cannot 
support the proposed amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to speak to this bill tonight. Bill C-201 is designed to 
bring some equity into the justice system. It is designed to bring 
some certainty of sentencing into the justice system. It is designed 
to make the justice system just, where someone cannot just shrug 
and say: ``I am sorry. I had too many and I drove over somebody 
you cared about. Please forgive me, I would like another shot at it, 
another time down the road''.
<P>
	This is not the only bill before the House which deals with 
drinking. Another bill brought forward by a Liberal member deals 
with warning labels on alcoholic beverages. It was brought forward 
because of the potential and real damage that is done by people 
who drink to excess, especially by people who drink and drive 
which we are discussing in this debate.
<P>
	When people say that this bill is a quick fix so they do not want 
to support it, I am not sure exactly what line of thinking that is. I 
believe at least it is a partial fix concerning what must happen, but 
if it is a quick fix then why do we not try it? It may be quick, it may 
be over before we know it tonight. We could pass this. If we were to 
go to people who have suffered a loss because of a drunk driver we 
would find agreement.
<P>
	We may wonder whether people are paying attention to what we 
are debating tonight. Are people in Canada listening? I have a letter 
which is hot off the fax. It arrived about an hour ago and is written 
to the sponsor of the bill:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am writing to you on behalf of the board of directors of MADD Canada to 
reaffirm to you our support for Bill C-201 requiring a mandatory minimum 
sentence of seven years for impaired driving causing death. MADD Canada and 
our volunteers and supporters are 100 per cent behind your initiative. We 
clearly understand the meaning of your bill and have as one of our MADD 
Canada policies that we will seek mandatory minimum sentencing.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is my understanding that during the last hour of debate Gordon Kirkby rose in 
the House of Commons and referred to a letter from MADD Canada indicating that 
MADD did not support this bill. This letter was written by a member of the board of 
MADD Canada and was the opinion of this person as an individual and not that of 
the board. This letter was not approved by the executive committee of the board of 
directors and was not approved to be sent on MADD Canada letterhead. This  
individual has been advised of this and has been requested to retract his statement.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I want to once again reaffirm MADD Canada is in support of Bill C-201. 
MADD Canada is fully aware and understands the content of Bill C-201.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Respectfully submitted, the President of MADD Canada, Jane Meldrum.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
	People are watching and listening to what we are talking about 
tonight. I would suggest they are not too happy with some of the 
arguments about not wanting to do it because it is a quick fix. They 
do not want to do it because they could what, offend somebody? 
What is wrong with the Liberals?
<P>
	I wonder what the reaction would be if 1,500 people a year were 
killed or were dying from something else. What if it were a new 
type of cancer? What if 1,500 people were dying every year of 
some new dreadful disease? What if it were one of the pet projects 
of the special interest groups who say they need more funding, 
millions of dollars, to do research into a problem or whatever? 
Sometimes they are legitimate causes, but what would be the 
reaction? The Liberals would say: ``Let us do it''.
<P>
	Is there a way to stop 1,500 unnecessary deaths and hundreds of 
thousands of ruined lives? Is there a way we can arrest that? There 
is, at least partially.
<P>
	We are not talking about people who have an extra drink on the 
way home from work. Listen to the statistics. All drivers who are 
involved in an accident are tested for the alcoholic content of their 
blood. In 1993 statistics show that 63 per cent of the people tested 
had not over .08 but over .15. These are not people who 
miscalculated and had two beers instead of just one. They are 
sloppy drunks who are driving the roads, causing accidents and 
running over innocent people.
<P>
	I wonder which family in Canada has not been affected by this. 
The very first tragedy I can ever remember as a child is when my 
two cousins were killed in a car accident. They were snuffed out by 
a drunk driver who had crossed the double line and hit dead on a 
carload of kids on their way home from graduation ceremonies. He 
killed four kids the same age as my older brother. Cousin Dennis 
and cousin Karen I never really got to know of course but I was 
there for their funeral. That guy is out on the street again. In those 
days the sentence was not that long, a year or so. He is still a drunk 
but I do not know whether or not he has caused other deaths.
<P>
	All of us have heard anecdotal stories. We have heard the 
statistics here tonight. It is not just about people who say they are 
sorry that they were drunk and they deserve a slap on the wrist. It is 
also about people who are driving while suspended. There was a 
case back home where a guy was suspended, went to court because 
he was caught drinking again and was suspended some more. How 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2923"> 2923 </A></B>
<P>
can  we suspend the guy some more? The guy is just waiting to 
drive over somebody and cause a death.
<P>
	The question is: What should we do with somebody like that? A 
guy causes a death while under suspension so we suspend him 
some more, tell him not to do it and give him a year in jail. It is 
absolutely certain he will do it again. That is why the minimum 
sentence is necessary.
<P>
	Do not tell me the minimum sentence will not send a message. If 
nothing else, it will keep those habitual drunks off the road. When 
they do it once it is not just: ``Oh well, you have killed one person 
and have ruined many, many lives''. It will be: ``You killed 
somebody. In this society we still value life highly. You took an 
innocent life and you are going to pay the price. If nothing else, we 
are going to stop you from killing somebody for the next seven 
years''.
<P>
	Right now it is a revolving door. People shrug their shoulders. 
They are already under suspension so what are we going to do to 
them? Statistically they have driven drunk dozens of times before 
they get caught. The only reason they are caught is that they are 
sitting on top of a bunch of twisted metal with a dead person in 
another car and finally we have the goods on them. They go to 
court, everything is plea bargained right down and they get a year 
in jail. It is not acceptable.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	The Mothers Against Drunk Driving who have felt the anguish, 
who know what it means to suffer a loss, know that this bill is 
necessary. They are not saying it is a quick fix. It is not the total 
answer. They are not saying that. This bill will save lives and that is 
why this bill should pass. I urge all members of the House to listen 
to the people in their ridings. If they are listening they will vote in 
favour of this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to rise and add my voice and 
remarks to those who have already spoken in favour of Bill C-201, 
a private member's bill put forward by my friend the hon. member 
for Prince George-Bulkley Valley.
<P>
	I am not going to get into statistics as a great many have already 
been cited by my hon. colleagues from Prince George-Bulkley 
Valley, Okanagan-Shuswap, Simcoe Centre and Fraser Valley 
East. We could go on all night citing tragic statistics in support of 
Bill C-201 which would see a mandatory minimum sentence of 
seven years for impaired driving which causes death. It is 
something that is certainly needed.
<P>
	As did the hon. member for Fraser Valley East, I too would 
question why the Liberals are speaking against this piece of 
legislation. The hon. member for Windsor-St. Clair said she 
cannot support this piece of legislation because it does not do this 
or that. What does it do? Certainly it is not the be all and end all. No 
one said it  was. I believe very strongly it is a step in the right 
direction and it is going to send a clear message.
<P>
	The hon. member for South Shore indicated that the problem 
runs so deep that this piece of legislation will not save lives. I 
dispute that. I think it will save lives. It will send a very strong 
message to people who get behind a wheel when they are drunk and 
go on our nation's highways and streets and kill people.
<P>
	It is a coincidence that in January I wrote a column for my local 
paper on this very topic. I will read part of that column into the 
record because it hits at exactly what we are talking about here.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Does anyone else have a problem with the light sentences constantly handed 
down to drunk drivers? A comparative rap on the knuckles or slap of the wrist, 
even when their offence leads to massive property damages, injuries or death of 
innocent people.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I went on to say that perhaps the system might provide some 
deterrence if the criminals-and these people are criminals; that is 
what we are talking about here-were sent to work in a bush camp 
instead of being granted a short stay in some five star hotel that we 
call jails or prisons in this country today. The article went on:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>You know the kind of camps: no running water or indoor toilets. You have to 
chop your own firewood or you freeze. As for work, there is no shortage. For 
example, with all the parkland being set aside, I am sure there is a need to clear 
hiking trails.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I went on to say that the particular individual I was referring to 
should have to pay back ICBC and the city for the damages 
resulting from his stupidity.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Does this sound too harsh? Well I do not think so. I for one am sick of our 
system mollycoddling the guilty. This is but one example of thousands 
occurring across the country. Drunk drivers who take little or no moral or 
financial responsibility for their actions. And most Canadians are also 
beginning to question a justice system that does not seem to hold drunk drivers 
accountable.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I am reminded of the recent case of David Johnson, 27, of Prince 
George. My hon. colleague for Prince George-Bulkley Valley also 
referred to this case. Last September while drunk, he caused an 
accident that claimed the lives of Jim Ciccone, his 12-year-old son 
and 3-year-old daughter. The prosecutor asked for a sentence of six 
to eight years. The maximum allowable is 14 years. Judge Ramsay 
decided three and one-half years would be sufficient punishment. Is 
that punishment enough for taking three lives?
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	Following public demonstrations, the sentence is now under 
appeal. I remember 42-year-old Herman Richards who ran down 
Amanda Bailey while she was flagging at mile 123 on the Alaska 
highway in July 1990. Richards had been drinking prior to hitting 
Amanda in the middle of the highway in the middle of the 
afternoon. The sentence for Richards was three years and a life 
sentence of nothing but memories for Amanda's family. The 
examples could go on and on.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2924"> 2924 </A></B>
<P>
	The member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley responded to 
this type of tragedy with Bill C-201. What is the attitude of the 
government across the way? Members opposite say the bill does 
not do this, it does not do that, so they will have to vote against 
it. Do those members offer something to replace it? Hardly. They 
offer criticism.
<P>
	Canadians are starting to realize that what we see here is a 
government gone soft on criminal behaviour. The member opposite 
from Prince Albert-Churchill River said in a speech at second 
reading which was mentioned in a news article in March: ``We 
cannot look at this from a narrow perspective. The objective of the 
law is that it ought to be reduced impaired driving and if you have 
stiff penalties but no enforcement, there will be no one obeying the 
laws''.
<P>
	I say hogwash. Stiff penalties will deter people. If people know 
they will have to face stiff penalties, as I suggested in my column, 
perhaps we should be looking at more than only a jail term where 
they shoot pool, lift some weights and maybe take a course at 
taxpayers' expense. Maybe if they had to do some work, we would 
see some real deterrence.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="EMPLOYMENTEQUITYACT">EMPLOYMENT EQUITY ACT</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on April 22 I asked the Minister of Labour when he 
intended to proclaim Bill C-64, the new Employment Equity Act.
<P>
	Although this bill was passed by Parliament on December 15, 
1995, it is still not in force. Worse still, according to the bill, it will 
only come into force one year after proclamation.
<P>
	I want to remind the House that in 1983, the Trudeau 
government appointed the Royal Commission on Equality in 
Employment under Judge Rosalie Abella. This royal commission 
reported in 1984 to the new Mulroney government.
<P>
	The Abella commission recommended mandatory employment 
equity legislation for both the federally regulated private sector and 
the federal public service sector. In response, the Conservative 
government brought in the existing Employment Equity Act but it 
did  not accept all of Abella's recommendations. That law did not 
cover the federal public service, and applied only to firms with 
more than 100 employees. Worse still, the employment equity 
requirements in the act were not enforceable.
<P>
	The Liberal opposition at that time strongly criticized the 
government on those grounds. As a result, once back in 
government in 1994, the new Liberal administration, to complete 
the work started 10 years before, introduced Bill C-64 to include 
the public sector and to set up a practical enforcement mechanism.
<P>
	After lengthy committee hearings and parliamentary debate, the 
bill was finally passed December 15, 1995. Almost six months later 
it is still not proclaimed.
<P>
	At a recent meeting of the human rights committee on April 18, 
the commissioner for human rights made a strong case for 
proclaiming this bill as soon as possible. He pointed out that there 
was still too much systemic discrimination and that, according to 
the provisions of the bill, it would only come into application one 
year after proclamation which would be at the earliest in 1997.
<P>
<B>(1850 )</B>
<P>
	Once again I urge the government to proclaim this bill, these 
important improvements to employment equity, as soon as 
possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member knows, Bill C-64, 
an act respecting employment equity, was adopted by this 
Parliament and given royal assent at the end of the last session. The 
new act clarifies existing employers' obligations and actually 
reduces their administrative burden.
<P>
	Employers under the act must identify and remove employment 
barriers that prevent women, aboriginal peoples, persons with 
disabilities and members of visible minorities from progressing in 
the workplace.
<P>
	I would like to assure the hon. member that the Minister of 
Labour and his officials have been working in close consultation 
with the Canadian Human Rights Commission, Treasury Board and 
the Public Service Commission to ensure that the Employment 
Equity Act can be put into force in the shortest timeframe possible.
<P>
	However, since the new act leaves a number of details to 
regulation, we want to ensure that employers under the act have a 
clear understanding of the regulatory requirements and have ample 
lead time to make any changes that may be required to comply with 
these regulations.
<P>
	In pursuit of this commitment, HRDC officials are holding 
consultations with employers, joint employer and labour 
organizations and designated group representatives and 
associations throughout the month of May.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2925"> 2925 </A></B>
<P>
	Given the requirements of the regulatory process, we expect that 
the Employment Equity Act will come into force in mid-fall of 
this year.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="PUBLICSERVICEOFCANADA">PUBLIC SERVICE OF CANADA</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to go into a little more detail 
about the question which I put to the minister responsible for the 
federal public service in mid-April.
<P>
	I asked a question regarding the downsizing of the public service 
because I believe that there is an area in this exercise where we as a 
government can address a situation that would benefit those 
involved. In short, I believe there are things that we can do.
<P>
	First, we must recognize that during the beginning of this 
three-year program the attraction to packages being offered was 
easy to manage. There were many individuals who were quite 
willingly accepting them. As we move closer to the end of the 
exercise it must be getting more and more difficult to find workers 
willing to accept the offer. I want to urge the department to invest 
as much discretion as possible in local managers so that they will 
have the opportunity and the flexibility which they need to treat 
people in as humane a fashion as possible.
<P>
	I am aware there are those who accepted packages in the initial 
stages. That was done in good faith. However, we must be prepared 
to reassess our own rules if we are going to continue to attract 
people at the same rate as we have in the past.
<P>
	We must be motivated to find the fairest possible solutions to the 
many problems that may arise and the local managers are in the 
best place to do that.
<P>
	Also we must realize that funding for non-governmental 
organizations as one possible employer has been reduced along 
with many other areas where federal public servants may have 
found alternate work. It is therefore incumbent on the government 
to be as open as possible to alternatives suggested by local 
managers on adjustments to the federal public service work week 
or any other ideas which would generate more jobs. They must be 
considered. I believe that is our contribution in this exercise.
<P>
	In conclusion, I want the government to recognize that the public 
service has participated quite graciously in this exercise and we 
must be willing, as a government, to listen to them and to give the 
local managers the flexibility they need to do the downsizing 
properly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can assure the hon. member that the 
government will be vigilant to minimize the effects of downsizing 
on the affected employees during the remainder of the program 
review implementation.
<P>
	The government stated at the very beginning of this process that 
it was its intention to be fair to its employees.
<P>
	It introduced the early retirement incentive and the early 
departure incentive programs in order to facilitate the transition of 
employees to retirement or to other employment outside the public 
service. These programs have been successful in achieving these 
ends.
<P>
	As can be seen in the quarterly reports on downsizing, 4,715 
employees had taken the ERI and 4,323 had taken either the EDI or 
its equivalent, the civilian reduction program in the Department of 
National Defence, up to the end of December of last year.
<P>
	The early retirement incentive program will be available until 
March 31, 1998. The EDI program will be available until June 22, 
1998.
<P>
	We also introduced a program which allows employees who 
wish to leave the public service to switch with employees who wish 
to stay. This program has been a big success in my view, since it 
has permitted almost 2,000 employees to participate in such 
exchanges between March 24 of last year when the program was 
first introduced.
<P>
	I am confident this tool will continue to be effective in 
accommodating departments, managers and employee needs and 
that management will strive to use this and other tools available to 
ease the transition of all those who will be affected.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> A motion to adjourn the House is now 
deemed to have been adopted. The House stands adjourned until 
tomorrow at 10 a.m.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.55 p.m.)
