<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="WITNESSPROTECTIONACT">WITNESS PROTECTION ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from May 26 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-206, an Act to provide for the relocation and 
protection of witnesses, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse):</B> Mr. Speaker, before I 
speak to Bill C-206, I would like to remind this House that this 
is the twenty-sixth anniversary of the death of Daniel Johnson 
senior, the premier of Quebec, whose politics transcended 
partisanship and who left a valuable legacy for the Quebec we 
know today.
<P>
	I have read Bill C-206, introduced by my colleague, the hon. 
member for Scarborough West, to whom I have listened 
attentively, both during his presentation before the 
Sub-Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, when he so 
eloquently argued to have his bill put to a vote in this House, and 
when he reached a stage not many reach, because many are 
called but few are chosen. The hon. member for Scarborough 
West may congratulate himself on having raised the awareness 
of the Sub-Committee on Procedure and House Affairs and that 
of this House regarding the protection and relocation of 
witnesses.
<P>
	The hon. member's concern for this particular issue is to his 
credit and will advance law in Canada, because, as we would 
have to agree, we have lagged behind our neighbours to the 
south, who have already, for close to 25 years now, had 
legislation in 50 states of the union with respect to witness 
protection that is known to the public and that sets out their 
rights.
<P>
	Here in Canada we have, of course, certain more or less 
well-known provisions for the protection and relocation of 
witnesses, which are applied in turn, piecemeal and sporadically 
by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Ontario Provincial 
Police or the Sûreté du Québec.
<P>
	However, I do not believe that in a democratic state we should 
be satisfied with piecemeal measures and decisions taken 
arbitrarily by those who are called upon to make such decisions, 
often behind closed doors. I think that the idea of having 
legislation that will apply throughout Canada is one that will 
improve the situation of witnesses, particularly in a criminal 
context and especially with respect to serious crimes. I therefore 
think that we can put an end to a sort of bona fide application of 
procedures, which could be sequential, without controls and 
without witnesses really being informed of the applicable 
policies.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	As I said earlier, a standard procedure must be established. 
The public must know what the future standards will be and how 
to have access to the protection and relocation program.
<P>
	How will it work? Should the judiciary be involved in the 
protection of witnesses? The hon. member for Scarborough 
West suggests it should not be involved, to prevent excessive 
media coverage, but perhaps a parliamentary committee could 
be an alternative. This is an excellent idea, to have a 
sub-committee such as the justice sub-committee look, as 
discreetly as possible, at how witnesses are being protected. I 
think this is a fine job for the justice sub-committee which is 
already looking into allegation concerning the Canadian 
Security Intelligence Service. This new responsibility could be 
added to the mandate of the sub-committee.
<P>
	In the case of serious crimes like drug trafficking or organized 
crime, the very survival of the witnesses is often at stake. But in 
our legal system, the entire case for the Crown usually rests 
much more on witnesses than on the admission of guilt on the 
part of the accused, which puts the Crown in a precarious 
position when introducing evidence. Crown attorneys never 
know, throughout the bail hearing, the preliminary investigation 
and finally the trial per se-a three-stage process that can 
stretch over several months-if their witnesses will see them 
through. They often wonder: can I be sure I will still have 
witnesses to call by the time we go to trial? And when I call them 
to the stand, will I be able to ask them the questions and, more 
importantly, get the honest answers I have every right to expect 
from them?
<P>
	At present, there certainly is no guarantee, because witnesses 
often have failing memories in such cases. The hon. members 
who were in legal practice or even watched movies about certain 
trials or television  broadcasts of trials have noticed witnesses 
who cannot recall anything at the time of the trial. Their 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6114"> 6114 </A></B>
<P>
memories fail them. I think we must provide assistance to these 
witnesses who need our help.
<P>
	Help is required both before the trial and, of course, after it. 
Before the trial, we must ensure their physical safety, which 
involves providing them with some form of protection. At 
times, this will mean literally hiding them for their own 
protection, and with their consent I hope, so that they can give 
adequate evidence to enable a court of law to appreciate the 
value of the evidence and determine whether the Crown has 
proven its case beyond any reasonable doubt. Bear in mind that, 
in our legal system, an enormous onus rests with the Crown and 
the slightest error in that area will automatically lead to an 
acquittal. With regard to foul crimes-I mentioned drug 
trafficking and organized crime-the simple fact that witnesses 
vanished could be enough to raise a reasonable doubt because 
the jury or the judge, if the accused has asked for a trial without 
jury, will not have the benefit of their testimonies.
<P>
	But there is also the aftermath, them time after the trial, after 
the sentencing. Sometimes, the presumption of 
innocence-which I in no way question-and its offshoot, the 
reasonable doubt principle, can also lead to an acquittal and a 
witness can be in grave danger. We must therefore provide for 
the social reintegration of a witness who had someone put way 
or may even have failed to do so on the assessment of the 
evidence.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	What this generally means is getting a new identity, new 
papers and often a new job for the witness. In extreme cases of 
course, the State must be able to provide replacement income to 
witnesses who have put their lives on the line for the law of the 
land to prevail.
<P>
	In that sense, I fully agree with the principle of the bill 
introduced by the hon. member for Scarborough West. In short, 
based on what was said in the comprehensive speeches made so 
far on the subject, let me just indicate that at the time of the vote, 
scheduled for later on, or in a deferred vote, I will gladly support 
the bill put forward by the hon. member.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to rise in support of this private member's bill and the 
initiative taken by the hon. member. One of the most amazing 
things to me is having had the opportunity now to take a look at 
this, I would suggest to all members that they probably have a 
number of people currently in their constituencies falling 
through the cracks relative to this issue.
<P>
	Most of us are involved with people in our society who are 
supposedly the law-abiding people, the upstanding citizens, the 
people we never hear about in the courts. Certainly we never 
read about them in the paper. As we are all aware with criminal 
justice there are situations in our constituencies that require the 
attention of the police  and the courts and of course all of us want 
to see justice done correctly.
<P>
	Part of the justice system are the witnesses who come before 
the courts. They are a very important part, at the risk of stating 
the obvious, to getting the convictions we would like to have in 
our criminal justice system for those who are guilty of a crime.
<P>
	The information these witnesses provide is absolutely 
invaluable to crack the case. Unfortunately, however, it is very 
obvious that we would end up in a situation of tremendous fear 
on the part of some individuals when they are confronted with a 
situation of facing the accused in a court or coming forward with 
information. They have tremendous fear and very 
understandable fear.
<P>
	I happened to notice in the Edmonton <I>Journal</I> this last 
weekend that there was a case of an individual who on 
September 6, 1988 got four months in custody for uttering 
threats, carrying a concealed weapon, failing to comply. On 
February 10, 1989 this person was sentenced for six months 
open custody for forcible confinement and assault with a 
weapon. On September 20, 1989 this person was sentenced for 
two months open custody for solicitation, and on and on. There 
are four more cases on top of the first three I have outlined. Then 
on September 9, 1992 this person was sentenced to 30 days in 
jail and fined $400 for uttering threats against a woman police 
believed might implicate this person in a murder.
<P>
	We have seen particularly in western Canada very successful 
so-called crime stopper programs in which crimes are brought 
forward on television. People are encouraged to come forward 
and act as witnesses but the difficulty is that even if they come 
forward in confidence, even if they come forward in secrecy, 
even if they provide the information in such a way that it will 
result in a conviction, it is not infrequent that mistakes will 
occur in the investigation or mistakes can occur in the court 
where the name of that person who has come forward as a good 
responsible Canadian citizen suddenly is applied in court. Then 
the accused person at that point, particularly if it leads to a 
conviction, is fully aware of where the information came from. 
Fear is an absolute factor in this equation.
<P>
<B>(1115 ) </B>
<P>
	Right at the moment this is a police responsibility, and as the 
member from Quebec stated, this leads to a patchwork, very 
spasmodic kind of a system. It leads to inconsistency from 
jurisdiction to jurisdiction because there will be different 
attitudes on the part of different police departments even 
throughout our constituencies. There will also be different 
budget constraints and respective police forces will have 
different attitudes toward the issue of budgets.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6115"> 6115 </A></B>
<P>
	Another problem that currently exists is what I call the 97 per 
cent factor. I have been led to believe on the basis of research I 
did before speaking to this issue that 97 per cent of the people 
who would be protected by the witness protection act are people 
who were involved in some kind of criminal activity with 
respect to the issue that would be before the court.
<P>
	It becomes part of the plea bargain or it becomes part of the 
``if you will give us this evidence in court to lead to this 
conviction, although you were involved'' and this bargaining 
goes back and forth.
<P>
	I suggest with police being human beings they would 
undoubtedly have an attitude problem from time to time with 
some of the people they would be using in an attempt to gain 
convictions because the people they are dealing with as far as 
they are concerned do not fall into the responsible citizen 
category.
<P>
	This legislation would lead to a specific protection 
department. I support it because it would be separate from the 
police force for the reasons I have just outlined. This protection 
department for witnesses would also, in my judgment, be best 
served by getting people who are trained in counselling.
<P>
	Can we imagine the stress on individuals of coming forward 
as a witness, particularly in very serious crimes or crimes where 
there are tremendous numbers of people involved? I see the 
witness protection department as having counsellors who are 
trained.
<P>
	By having a department separate from the police forces, we 
would not only gain uniformity of application across the 
country, but it would give us an opportunity to develop some 
kind of standard policy across Canada.
<P>
	The Reform Party, of course, is noted for always talking about 
how much it is going to cost. With the current incarceration and 
rehabilitation programs for people who are convicted of 
criminal offences we are currently looking at an expenditure of 
about $2 billion. In the area of enforcement under federal 
jurisdiction alone we are looking at a cost, I believe, of about 
$1.7 billion.
<P>
	What we should be doing with the $1.7 billion is looking at the 
cost effectiveness of using dollars where people would have 
confidence in a witness protection plan to be able to come 
forward. I cannot help but think that this would have a direct 
impact on being able to roll back the cost of some investigations, 
where the investigations would not have to go forward at 
continuing cost because people would feel comfortable in 
coming forward.
<P>
	The relocation of a witness is an issue. Again I suggest that 
within the $2 billion which we are currently spending on 
incarceration and rehabilitation, we should be able with some 
ease to find some dollars for the issue of relocation of witnesses.
<P>
	In conclusion, the sentence that a criminal receives for his or 
her criminal activity is measured in months and years. I suggest 
that the sentence that a witness gets is a life sentence, 
particularly in situations where the person who is convicted of a 
crime makes it very clear that he or she is going to continue to 
pursue the witness. We must set up retraining for these people to 
get them from the field that they are currently working into 
another field. This would help to isolate them from their 
previous situation. We must set up documents, set up protection 
for the people who we are asking to be witnesses in these 
criminal cases.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	I look forward to the thoughtful support of all members to 
move this bill forward to committee.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Under Standing Order 44, the hon. 
member for Scarborough West will close the debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very honoured to stand today to close the debate on my Bill 
C-206, the protection of witnesses in Canada.
<P>
	I want to begin by thanking the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Solicitor General of Canada who was kind enough to second my 
bill when debate began on April 20, 1994.
<P>
	Throughout the three hours that the bill has been debated, 
eight of my Liberal colleagues, two members of the Official 
Opposition and four members of the Reform Party have spoken. 
Each and every one of them has spoken in favour of the principle 
of the bill.
<P>
	Many good points have been raised. Many suggestions have 
been made. I am the first to acknowledge that the bill, since it 
was written by me, is certainly not perfect and that it can be 
improved. Should the House decide to pass the bill at second 
reading and send it to a committee, I look forward to discussing 
the suggestions that my colleagues have made to help make this 
a better bill so that witnesses can be protected and thereby 
strengthen the justice system.
<P>
	I am particularly thankful that the Official Opposition has so 
clearly and unequivocally come out both on April 20 and today 
and stated that it would support the bill, as have my friends in 
the Reform Party.
<P>
	I want to briefly remind everybody in the House and those 
watching that this is an area which has been left alone, which is 
quite unusual. In fact there is no legislative basis anywhere in 
Canada for the protection of witnesses. Although there is no law, 
there are approximately 21 individual witness protection plans 
across the country, as we heard from the hon. member for 
Kootenay East, all being run by various departments under 
different rules.
<P>
	The Royal Canadian Mounted Police plan, which has no 
legislative basis, has expanded. In 1986, for example, $569,000 
was spent by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police for witness 
protection programs. In 1993, a few years later, $3,800,000 was 
spent. What for? This is  under the rubric of drug enforcement. 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6116"> 6116 </A></B>
<P>
Under the rubric of drug enforcement it is clear that over the 
years it has become useful in the capturing and convicting of 
criminals to help witnesses who would otherwise fear for their 
lives to be relocated.
<P>
	This bill, the protection of witnesses, will help to convict 
criminals and get them off the street by encouraging people to 
come forward and testify, knowing that they will not be subject 
to further reprisal.
<P>
	There were 1,455 unsolved murders in this country between 
the years 1980 and 1992, almost 1,500 unsolved murders. I hope 
that this bill will help to solve some of those tragedies.
<P>
	I got a call from a number of people in hiding over the course 
of debate of this bill but one in particular struck me. It was a 
mother with a number of children who is currently in her third 
province of residence because of this hodge-podge of protection 
plans. She was a witness testifying against her husband in a 
murder trial. As a result of that her husband was convicted. Her 
husband is looking for her, as are her husband's associates. She 
was relocated to the province of Ontario with her children, 
living in fear and hiding.
<P>
	Unfortunately because of the fact that there is no legislative 
basis it is not that easy to get new passports. It is not that easy to 
get a new social insurance number. It is not that easy to invent a 
new identity. Her husband's associates, even though he is in 
prison, have been able to trace her in two provinces and now she 
is running to her third. We do not want to see that happen to 
families and to victims. I hope this bill will help to alleviate that.
<P>
	In closing, I want to remind the House that should members be 
of the view that this bill merits passage at this time, it means the 
principle of the bill is accepted and the matter proceeds to 
committee where it will be studied carefully. There we will be 
able to look at the experience in the United States. We know that 
our friends in Australia have just this year introduced a very 
similar bill to this one. They are struggling with that as well.
<P>
	I am sure the committee will be able to carefully examine the 
good points made in the debate and to examine the experiences 
in the United States and Australia. We should able to come up 
with a plan that will protect victims and their families, witnesses 
and their families, and will help to convict those who deserve to 
be convicted.
<P>
	I thank everybody in the House and I ask for thoughtful 
consideration in the passage of my bill at this time.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to, bill read the second time and referred to a 
committee.)
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Bakopanos:</B> I rise on a point of order. I would like to ask

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DEPARTMENTOFINDUSTRYACT">DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRY ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Alfonso Gagliano (for the Minister of Industry)</B> moved 
that Bill C-46, an act to establish the Department of Industry 
and to amend and repeal certain other acts, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Minister of Industry 
I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the occasion of second 
reading of the legislation that gives official recognition to the 
Department of Industry.
<P>
	I will begin by explaining to Canadians that this legislation 
provides a streamlined, organized and comprehensive approach 
to all those various instruments the government has had spread 
over several departments. It is an effort to bring them all under 
one ministerial roof.
<P>
	Under this bill the minister is responsible in Canada for 
industry and technology, trade and commerce, science, 
consumer affairs, corporations and securities, competition and 
restraint of trade including mergers and monopolies, bankruptcy 
and insolvency, patents, copyrights, trademarks, industrial 
designs, and integrated circuit topographies.
<P>
	Also included in the minister's responsibilities are standards 
of identity, packaging and performance in relation to consumer 
products and services, except in relation to the safety of 
consumer goods; legal metrology; telecommunications, except 
in relation to the planning and co-ordination of 
telecommunications services for departments, boards and 
agencies of the Government of Canada; and broadcasting, other 
than in relation to spectrum management and the technical 
aspects of broadcast-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6117"> 6117 </A></B>
<P>
ing; the development and utilization generally of 
communications undertakings, facilities, systems and services 
for Canada; investment; small business; and tourism.
<P>
	Never before has there been such a comprehensive 
revamping. As I mentioned earlier we have put four departments 
into one. The purpose is to allow the government and all 
members of the House of Commons to work at creating a very 
tight focus. This will create an environment for stimulating 
entrepreneurs and thus will get people back to work.
<P>
	In these times of a very tough fiscal framework, the debts and 
deficits at all levels of government are very high. It is therefore 
incumbent upon all members in this House and all public 
servants across Canada to do their very best to maximize the use 
of taxpayers' dollars. By undertaking this massive and 
comprehensive reorganization the Government of Canada is 
living up to a commitment made during the campaign and which 
is contained in the red book. Speaking on the red book for a 
minute, it has become our compass in the past 10 months as a 
government. I refer members and Canadians to page 47 where 
we stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A Liberal government will focus on small and medium-sized businesses 
because they can and must be the determining factor in turning around what has 
so far been a jobless recovery.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Small and medium-sized businesses are primarily Canadian owned. They are 
found in all sectors of the economy: manufacturing, services, retail, high 
technology, low technology, fishing, and farming. Supporting small and 
medium-sized businesses will benefit all Canadians, but particularly certain 
demographic groups.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1205 ) </B>
<P>
	This bill will allow us to put a very special focus on that sector 
of our economy we believe will ultimately pull this country out 
of its very difficult economic and fiscal framework.
<P>
	One thing members opposite have been talking constructively 
about over the last few months is that we have to reduce overlap 
and duplication. This bill addresses that point which opposition 
members have made.
<P>
	Another thing opposition members have put forward from 
time to time is that by having many departments sometimes the 
message becomes scattered and the focus is not as tight as it 
should be. This is a very large department. We are talking about 
a department with 6,000 employees all across Canada. Of those 
employees, 2,500 are beyond the national capital region. In 
terms of public service, we are talking about 140 access points.
<P>
	It is important that all our public servants be in tune with this 
new government thrust. It is important that all members get 
behind this bill because it essentially meets the request, some 
thoughts and ideas that opposition members have put forward.
<P>
	Another important point we have to deal with is that because 
of our very difficult fiscal framework, government no longer has 
the resources to put money into program support. Funding 
support is very tight right now.
<P>
	As a national institution Industry Canada must have a 
different presence in the community. It must have the type of 
presence where it will be like a facilitator. We will lever the 
government's resources and do many more joint ventures with 
the private sector. We will be funding less in terms of special 
projects.
<P>
	Of course the minister has made some very special exceptions 
in the last few months. Those special cases involve important 
issues relating to science and technology and research and 
development. There are a couple that the House and Canadians 
should be aware of.
<P>
	The minister made the commitment to the space station. That 
was a commitment in excess of $2 billion over time but it is an 
area where Canada has great brain power. By participating in 
this program with the United States not only will we be partners 
but we will be allowing the best and brightest in that sector to 
grow. We also continue to fund the very special centres of 
excellence, the 10 of them across the country.
<P>
	We can see that the minister has not in any way shape or form 
retreated from the government's commitment to research and 
development. Research and development is an integral 
component of any national industrial strategy.
<P>
	Another very important feature of this bill is clause 5(a):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The minister shall exercise the powers and perform the duties and functions 
assigned by section 4(1) in a manner that will</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) strengthen the national economy and promote sustainable development.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This particular clause is something the minister, when an 
opposition member, fought aggressively to be included in 
previous legislation but was unable to achieve it. This is a very 
special feature of the bill. We salute the minister, the drafters 
and the officials that this is now a part of our national industrial 
strategy, that this is all going to be done in the light of 
sustainable development.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	In order to make sure there is a discipline on the department 
we have incorporated the old Department of Consumer and 
Corporate Affairs. The interests and protection of Canadian 
consumers is within the same department. This means that as we 
are advancing and developing policy we are going to have 
consumer protection and interest right there in the room during 
the evolution and debate on this policy. That will go a long way 
in making sure that the objective of sustainable development is 
maintained.
<P>
	I would like to touch on a couple of other very important areas 
of responsibility within the Department of Industry. Throughout 
the day many of my colleagues will talk about this bill and how 
it impacts on their various regions and communities in Canada.
<P>
	I would like to highlight the commitment of this government 
to the tourism sector. Those who watched the Prime Minister's 
address to the Chamber of Commerce last Sunday will have 
noted that he  highlighted tourism as being a sector of our 
economy to which this government will make a very special 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6118"> 6118 </A></B>
<P>
commitment. As that sector is part of Industry Canada I can 
happily say we are excited that we are going to rebuild Tourism 
Canada.
<P>
	I cannot imagine a member of Parliament in this House not 
supporting that particular sector. In terms of job creation, after 
the automotive and forestry sectors tourism creates more jobs 
than any other sector in our economy. Right now there is close to 
a $7 billion deficit in that sector.
<P>
	I hope all members of Parliament will support the 
government's initiatives. The Minister of Industry will be 
making an announcement in about three weeks' time on how we 
can rebuild that sector of our economy.
<P>
	Another area of responsibility within the Department of 
Industry is the Federal Business Development Bank. We are 
happy that this particular government instrument is in the 
Department of Industry and we are especially happy with the 
support from the opposition parties on the whole issue of access 
to capital for small business.
<P>
	The presence of the Federal Business Development Bank will 
be reinforced. We will put a tighter focus on that institution and 
its responsibilities to complement existing financial institutions 
and target small business operators. By doing this we will fire up 
the Canadian entrepreneurial spirit, especially with businesses 
that have 50 or fewer employees. The access to capital problem 
all members of this House hear about from their constituents is 
something to which the Department of Industry is sensitive.
<P>
	As a member of the industry committee I can tell Canadians 
that probably in two or three weeks our all-party study will be 
tabled in the House. Most of the things we have been working on 
will address and support this current revamping and 
restructuring in Industry Canada.
<P>
<B>(1215 ) </B>
<P>
	We would like to think that the Department of Industry is not 
just listening to members of the opposition parties but that in 
this particular piece of legislation we are showing we are acting 
on some of those recommendations and following through on 
some of the commitments that we made in our red book.
<P>
	There are so many different aspects within the Department of 
Industry that I could go on all day. I would like to talk about a 
couple of other areas where the minister has given very special 
emphasis and energy during the last few months. It is important 
for Canadians to know about all the work that has been done on 
reducing interprovincial trade barriers. The interprovincial 
trade barriers that exist in this country cost industry close to $11 
billion a year.
<P>
	I am happy to report that the Minister of Industry at the end of 
June successfully reached an agreement that will reduce many 
of these tariff barriers in about 10 different sectors. This will go 
a long way in creating a more efficient economy in Canada. We 
are not saying at this point that the interprovincial trade barrier 
document is the end of the pathway, it is just the beginning of the 
pathway. It is a very tough issue which the minister started on 
early in this mandate and he was able to achieve a good round of 
successes in phase one. We state clearly that it is only phase one 
and we have a tremendous amount of work to do yet. We seek the 
co-operation and ideas of all members of Parliament in that 
area.
<P>
	Another area where the minister has given very special focus 
and attention is the information highway. The information 
highway will give Canadians an opportunity to re-establish 
ourselves as the communications country, the communications 
state par excellence of any country in the world.
<P>
	Along with the Secretary of State for Science, Research and 
Development we are working not just with the information 
highway advisory group but we are working in partnership with 
various community groups, with the private sector, and we are 
working very hard now in creating an environment in which we 
can pave the information highway.
<P>
	Last week I attended on behalf of the minister a 
demonstration. The Queen's masters of business program began 
the new master of business program which is on interactive 
television. Now you can be sitting in the Northwest Territories 
or some place in B.C., or Toronto or Newfoundland and through 
the technology that has been developed with various 
corporations you can now get your MBA without going to 
Queen's in Kingston. This is the first of its kind in Canada but it 
is a concrete example of how this information highway is 
turning from theory into real hard reality. This is the type of 
thing that will make us a more educated country, and a more 
educated country is a more competitive country.
<P>
	The other thing we are doing in the Department of Industry is 
working very hard to encourage our small and medium size 
operators to become more export oriented. We are doing this 
through our advice in policy development with the Federal 
Business Development Bank. We are doing this through 
Industry Canada officials who are dedicated to helping small 
and medium size entrepreneurs to shift their marketing 
strategies from the North American marketing thrust to the 
Asian thrust, and other parts of the world.
<P>
	We are doing our best to move this whole restructuring and 
streamlining of government forward in a way that we believe 
will show Canadians that we are serious in eliminating waste, 
that we are serious in developing a co-ordinated approach, a 
focused approach that will allow the business community of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6119"> 6119 </A></B>
<P>
Canada to  develop a renewed faith in dealing with the 
Government of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	One of the real frustrations entrepreneurs have in dealing with 
government is that they will go to a department asking for a 
particular type of advice. The official will say for this particular 
part of your program you come to Industry Canada but for this 
other part you have to go to consumer affairs, for this other part 
you go to the Federal Business Development Bank.
<P>
	By the time the entrepreneur is finished with the experience 
he feels that he would much rather avoid dealing with the 
government.
<P>
	We are hoping that through this bill, through this 
streamlining, by putting all of these services-emphasis on the 
word services-under one roof, we are not only going to become 
more streamlined but by eliminating duplication we are going to 
make the experience of business men and women in dealing with 
their government a much more productive one. That will 
ultimately rebuild confidence and trust in this institution.
<P>
	I want to once again say that we are moving quickly in the area 
of reorganization. We are hoping this bill will receive the 
support of all members of this House so we can get on with 
meeting the objective that all of us in this House want, putting 
Canadians back to work.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
great pleasure that I will comment on-not to say respond 
to-the speech by my colleague from Broadview-Greenwood, 
the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Industry, who 
rose today on behalf of the Minister of Industry to present Bill 
C-46, an Act to establish the Department of Industry, not to say 
the new Department of Industry, because it must be said that this 
bill simply confirms after the fact what was planned by the 
former government then led by Ms. Campbell. Under this bill, 
certain institutions such as Investment Canada, Consumer and 
Corporate Affairs, part of the Department of Communications 
and Science and Technology will now come under the same 
concept, the same minister and the same department, namely 
Industry Canada.
<P>
	Briefing sessions, to use the federal public service's new 
terminology, can be very enlightening in that we meet with 
public servants who can fill us in on the government's approach. 
That is how we learned, for example, the guidelines behind Bill 
C-46, which can be found in a government document prepared 
by the minister's officials. The guidelines are as follows: Bill 
C-46 is aimed at, among other things, maintaining the status 
quo between the mandates of the departments affected; 
preserving the provisions in the old laws as much as possible; 
and finally, making the minor amendments that are needed but 
not substantial.
<P>
	That is characteristic of how this government elected on 
October 25, 1993 has operated since the beginning of the session 
on January 19. It is there but not making any headway. It is 
simply marking time. It holds debates without making any real 
progress, without promoting advances in science-since we are 
talking about science and technology.
<P>
	It is simply marking time, and that is becoming more and 
more obvious as weeks and months go by without any real 
savings recorded as a result of their amendments. Three or four 
structures are combined under one head; they are now headed by 
one person instead of two or three, but nothing is really saved in 
the day-to-day running of things; we think it is purely a 
cosmetic operation, it is grandstanding, it is a way to say that 
instead of 30 or 32 ministers as before, there are now 20, but 
with the same responsibilities.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	I refer to a government document given out at another briefing 
session we had for people in the Official Opposition who are 
concerned with the Department of Industry; it is contrary to the 
action needed, in their words, to make the machinery of 
government simpler and more efficient and to provide better 
services to users. So nothing is being simplified and nothing is 
more efficient with this change in structure, which is purely 
cosmetic.
<P>
	These are not just words; this is the mandate of the minister of 
the newly structured Department of Industry. It is worth reading 
it.
<P>
	My colleague, the parliamentary secretary, read it in English; 
I shall read it in French: ``Powers, Duties and Functions of the 
Minister. The powers, duties and functions of the Minister 
extend to and include all matters over which Parliament has 
jurisdiction, not by law assigned to any other department, board 
or agency of the Government of Canada, relating to industry and 
technology in Canada; trade and commerce in Canada; science 
in Canada; consumer affairs; corporations and corporate 
securities; competition and restraint of trade, including mergers 
and monopolies; bankruptcy and insolvency; patents, 
copyrights, trade-marks, industrial designs and integrated 
circuit topographies; standards of identity, packaging and 
performance in relation to consumer products and services, 
except in relation to the safety of consumer goods; legal 
metrology; telecommunications, except in relation to the 
planning and coordination of telecommunication services for 
departments, boards and agencies of the Government of Canada, 
and broadcasting, other than in relation to spectrum 
management and the technical aspects of broadcasting; the 
development and utilization generally of communication 
undertakings, facilities, systems and services for Canada; 
investment; small businesses; and tourism.''
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6120"> 6120 </A></B>
<P>
	So, Mr. Speaker, 15 fields of action, 15 fields of 
responsibility, which make the Department of Industry today a 
huge giant. We may wonder how one individual, as well 
supported as he may be by the bureaucracy, can really do an 
effective job! I for one, anyway, am very sceptical that anyone 
can really govern with such a broad mandate, when you realize 
that the industry minister's responsibility, in addition to what I 
just read, extends from Statistics Canada, for example, to the 
Canadian Space Agency to the Competition Tribunal and 
includes the Federal Business Development Bank, to name only 
these.
<P>
	So I think that this excessively large field, which on the very 
face of it leaves us sceptical-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Superman.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B> Superman. Yes, the parliamentary secretary 
has taken the words out of my mouth. It takes a superman and the 
voters will have to decide in due course whether the minister is 
superman.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, one aspect of the bill that I read particularly 
interested me. With respect to the minister's powers, clause 5 
says, ``The Minister shall exercise the powers and perform the 
duties and functions assigned by clause 4'', as we saw before, 
``in a manner that will (<I>a</I>) strengthen the national economy and 
promote sustainable development; (<I>c</I>) increase''-and this is 
very important-``the international competitiveness of 
Canadian industry, goods and services and assist in the 
adjustment to changing domestic and international conditions.''
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	When I read this section, I immediately think of two Quebec 
industries affected by the defence industry conversion which 
show the government's negligence immediately-and there are 
certainly more in other parts of Canada. On paper, this 
government has every power to take action, but it lacks the 
political will to deal with the very harrowing issue of defence 
industry conversion, thus letting the situation get worse from 
week to week.
<P>
	Take the case of Expro where, in the last few weeks, the 
situation has become dramatic. Indeed, the workers, the union 
and the management are faced with the unbearable choice of 
having to decide who and how many, will be laid off. I can 
understand why union leaders opposed this measure since there 
is no alternative.
<P>
	There is no alternative of course because the global situation 
is difficult. As we know, now that the cold war is a thing of the 
past, everything that has to do with military production is being 
reevaluated. In fact, the military industry worldwide is 
conducting such an exercise. But what distinguishes Canada is 
the government's negligence compared, for example, to the 
American government's initiatives to concretely support that 
industry and make sure that it will improve. The situation of 
Expro is getting worse, while MIL Davie, in Lévis, has still not 
received any support from this totally  apathetic 
government-in spite of strong public and political pressure.
<P>
	Thankfully, we heard some good news for the Quebec City 
region when the leader of the Parti Quebecois, who is being 
sworn in today as the province's new premier, pledged-and we 
hope that he will have the means and the political will to fulfill 
that commitment-to find a solution in the case of MIL Davie, 
with or without the help of the federal government. Mr. Parizeau 
must be congratulated for displaying this kind of political 
courage to ensure that the problems of the number one private 
company in the Quebec City region are resolved-indeed, this is 
no small venture: it is the largest company in the region. The 
projects regarding the ferry to the Madgalen islands and the 
smart ship, which have been the subject of much discussion and 
which the federal government is very familiar with, should get 
the green light so as to at least give some time to MIL Davie.
<P>
	I want to take this opportunity to congratulate all our elected 
colleagues from the Parti Quebecois, and particularly Mr. 
Parizeau. I also want to congratulate the PQ members who were 
elected in my region, namely Mr. Guy Julien and Mr. Rémi 
Désilets, who will respectively represent Trois-Rivières and 
Maskinongé at the legislative assembly. Some may find those 
results strange but the fact is that, for the first time ever, 
Maskinongé voted for the Parti Quebecois, and so did the riding 
of Charlevoix if I am not mistaken. This is a sign of the times 
and it shows how coherent Quebecers have been in their thinking 
since the failure of Meech. Indeed, Quebecers first said ``no''to 
the Charlottetown accord, then ``yes'' to the Bloc Quebecois and 
the Parti Quebecois, and they will say ``yes'' to sovereignty in a 
few months.
<P>
	We are pleased that the Parti Quebecois is now in office and 
we were glad to see that Quebec's premier, Mr. Parizeau, wasted 
no time in announcing at his first press conference a policy 
which will better anything ever done by the federal government 
regarding regional housing-even if those federal measures 
were not necessarily constitutional-by setting up a new 
structure whereby parliamentary assistants, who will be directly 
accountable to the premier, will each be responsible for one 
region of Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	I think Quebec has scored some major points as far as its 
future is concerned, and we can only commend the Government 
of Quebec, and encourage and support it in its new approach to 
regional development, which is entirely in line with the findings 
of the Bélanger-Campeau Commission on the concerns of the 
regions.
<P>
	Earlier, I read to the House what the department's 
responsibilities were, but there is more. That was only Part I. 
The powers, duties and functions of the minister also extend and 
include all matters over which Parliament has jurisdiction, not 
by law assigned to any other  department, board or agency of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6121"> 6121 </A></B>
<P>
Government of Canada, relating to regional economic 
development in Ontario and Quebec. This brings us to the 
Federal Office of Regional Development which comes under the 
Department of Industry but, politically, is the responsibility of 
the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Incidentally, the office, and this is perhaps something many 
people were unaware of, was established by order in council, 
while its counterparts the Department of Western Economic 
Diversification and ACOA, the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency-were legislated into existence. The fact that western 
Canada has a department, the Maritimes an agency and Quebec 
an office probably says much about the federal government's 
perception of Quebec's economic development. It may be 
symbolic that besides having an office that is the responsibility 
of the Minister of Finance, we have an order in council instead 
of legislation.
<P>
	If we take a closer look at all this, we should realize that the 
institution itself, which is called the Federal Office of Regional 
Development, merely duplicates what already exists, even at the 
federal level. I know what I am talking about. I live in a region 
where we have regional development, and I can tell you that 
federally, the office is competing with the NRC, which has its 
own regional branches staffed by one or two that get in touch 
with small businesses, inquire about their technological 
requirements and are then able to meet those requirements, 
which is not the case with the office. The Federal Office of 
Regional Development is therefore competing with at least one 
federal agency and, in Quebec, with the Quebec Department of 
Industry and Commerce, which promotes regional development 
for the benefit of small businesses, and with the entire network 
of industrial commissioners Quebec has established with 
municipal funding plus the support of the provincial 
government.
<P>
	The Federal Office of Regional Development merely creates a 
lot of overlap and duplication, and that is its sole mandate. 
When we take a good look at the section on regional economic 
development, we see in section 8<I>(c)</I>: ``focus on small and 
medium-sized enterprises and the development and 
enhancement of entrepreneurial talent''.
<P>
	There are already quite a few players in the field. In Quebec; 
they are talking quite openly about streamlining all this, and 
now the federal government gets involved, for historical 
reasons, as we all know. This Parliament has always wanted to 
do the right thing. It has always wanted to do what is best for 
Quebec, but Quebecers are pretty smart, and we can expect some 
action on this issue very shortly. Furthermore, the federal 
government has made cuts in the Federal Office of Regional 
Development, so that any potential it had for being effective is 
about to disappear altogether.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	From what I have heard recently throughout my riding and 
also from other sources, cuts amounting to $70 million over the 
next three years will make an empty shell out of the Federal 
Office of Regional Development. It is an empty shell which 
meets the needs of small and medium-sized businesses only 
when they are involved in high-tech projects. But unfortunately, 
this is not often the case-herein lies the problem-and one 
must remember that, by and large, the office is of very little 
assistance to small and medium-sized businesses.
<P>
	As for its involvement in tourism mentioned earlier by the 
parliamentary secretary, it seems to me that we are talking about 
provincial jurisdiction and, in this particular case, Quebec 
jurisdiction. The federal government must thread very carefully 
if it wants to get involved in this area. We have seen examples of 
such involvement in remote areas where the federal government 
stepped in to support projects sometimes turned down by 
Quebec resulting in a lot of confusion, duplication and 
overlapping, and a tremendous waste of money and efforts. 
Unfortunately, this lack of cohesion is too often the rule instead 
of jointly planned regional development.
<P>
	We believe that regional development is, first and foremost, a 
provincial matter and that Quebec should have exclusive 
authority in this area, especially now that we have the resources 
and the structure to do it. With the new government, we will be 
in an even better position to take matters into our own hands. We 
cannot allow the federal government to continue interfering in 
such a field of competence, especially since we know that the 
Quebec government is working in co-operation with the various 
stakeholders and elected representatives in every municipality 
and region of the province. Regional municipalities and unified 
regional municipalities provide Quebec with the appropriate 
structure to meet people's needs in an increasingly articulated 
manner.
<P>
	We cannot support such an empty bill. It is just 
window-dressing. It comes after the fact to sanction a decision 
made by this government hopefully with a view to streamlining 
its operation. It is only skin deep. As a consequence, we cannot 
support this bill and for this reason I move, seconded by the 
member for Charlesbourg, the following amendment:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That all the words following ``that'' be deleted and replaced by:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``this House refuse to give second reading to Bill C-46, an Act to establish the 
Department of Industry and to amend and repeal certain other Acts, because the 
principle of the bill does not put an end to duplication and overlapping by not 
recognizing that Quebec has exclusive authority over regional economic 
development''.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I will say that since this bill has 
already been reviewed, this motion which is similar to the 
previous one is acceptable.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
an honour for me this morning to enter the debate on Bill C-46. I 
am particularly pleased to see the minister's parliamentary 
secretary here but very disappointed the minister himself is not 
here to enter the debate on Bill C-46.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	I wish to enter into the debate by indicating that the bill which 
apparently is simply to streamline and to create jobs, as has been 
indicated by the parliamentary secretary, is nothing of the kind.
<P>
	There was an opportunity in presenting the bill to the House to 
show some leadership in this vast and extremely powerful 
economic arm of the government. Based on the content of the 
bill that leadership opportunity has been ignored. I hope to show 
that there is a need in Canada as never before for the portfolio of 
the minister of industry to provide the leadership and direction 
from which Canada could benefit so much.
<P>
	In so doing, I wish to draw attention very briefly to the 
development of the particular department. C. D. Howe ran much 
of the former department of trade and commerce during the 
fifties essentially as minister of defence production. Much of 
the development in the fifties and in his direction to that 
particular department was as a result of the contacts he had made 
with various industries during World War II.
<P>
	Walter Gordon followed C. D. Howe. He wanted to create a 
department of industry in the early sixties. Eventually he was 
successful in doing it. Mr. Gordon was an interventionist and a 
protectionist and he wanted the department of industry to further 
those goals. His proposal received a rough ride in cabinet at that 
time and from the existing department of trade and commerce. 
Eventually the department was established but had no clear 
direction or vision of what it was supposed to do partly because 
according to some observers Mr. Gordon really wanted to be the 
minister of finance and did not want any advice from the 
Economic Council of Canada which was trying to develop a 
strategy for the economic development of Canada.
<P>
	In 1968 industry, trade and commerce was established as a 
merger of industry and trade and commerce under Jean-Luc 
Pepin. It is also worthy to note that at that time a parallel 
development took place, the development of regional economic 
expansion. These were years of difficulty involved in 
integrating industry on the one hand, trade and commerce on the 
other, and DREE on the other side. Organizations and 
reorganizations occurred within industry over the following 
decade, always searching for a focus and cohesion that seemed 
to elude them.
<P>
	In 1978 the ministry of state for economic development was 
created, another new name. Out of the government's desire to 
co-ordinate economic and industrial strategy which had always 
been eluding it under the efforts of ITC it noticed the only thing 
that changed was the name. It was the ministry of state for 
economic development.
<P>
	In 1982 the industry, trade and commerce department was 
scrapped under the reorganization of government initiated by 
then Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. The trade commissioner 
service was moved to external affairs and the remainder of 
industry, trade and commerce was merged with DREE, the 
department of regional economic expansion. Out of that 
department the new name was generated, the department of 
regional industrial expansion. The ministry of state for 
economic development was renamed the ministry of state for 
regional economic development and was given responsibilities 
for that area.
<P>
	Almost all officials involved in the reorganization undertaken 
under a veil of great secrecy were from the privy council office. 
Even some of the ministers and deputy ministers directly 
involved in the reorganization were not involved in the 
discussions with privy council establishing a new department. 
Again, confusion and turf wars among the various component 
entities of DRIE prevailed.
<P>
	In 1987 the government announced the creation of the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency and soon after western 
economic diversification. The rest of DRIE became over the 
next three years the department of industry, science and 
technology. During that three-year period the privy council 
office provided no direction or very little direction for the 
creation of the mandate for the ISTC and the department was left 
to find its own direction. While the ministers did attend some of 
the meetings they did not provide any particular direction.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	The election of 1988 and the following free trade agreement 
negotiations interfered with the further development of the 
mandate so the department wandered for three years before it 
was officially created in 1990.
<P>
	In review, the core of the department of industry has been a 
long history or succession of organizational changes and name 
changes. Each has been without focus, lacking in vision or 
coherent strategy, and producing interior confusion and strife 
for the various entities. Attempts at meshing the different 
philosophies have produced a department which attempts to 
implement mutually exclusive mandates: that of national 
industrial development on the one hand and that of regional, 
economic and industrial strategy on the other.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6123"> 6123 </A></B>
<P>
	That history continues in the bill. The incompatible strategies 
of regional and national economic expansion continue without 
change.
<P>
	Shortly after the minister took on his portfolio he said that he 
had four goals he wanted to pursue while he carried out his 
mandate: small business, tourism, the information highway and 
the promotion of exports. In his first major piece of legislation 
the minister does not articulate a clear vision of the department 
in any of these areas. Neither does he solve the incompatibility 
between regional and national strategies.
<P>
	The minister had the opportunity to make a difference, to 
provide a direction, to determine and clearly set goals for his 
department, to re-establish confidence in government and 
politicians which the parliamentary secretary so ably said he 
was doing and he did not, to provide a fresh new voice for the 
people fiscally and democratically, and to set out a vision for the 
department of industry in Bill C-46, an act to establish the 
department of industry and to amend and repeal certain other 
acts.
<P>
	What did the minister do? The minister has missed the 
opportunity to act, accepted the Tory leadership in 
re-organization, essentially changed nothing major, accepted 
their direction, accepted their philosophy and accepted their 
goals. He changed nothing of consequence. The minister 
accepted the principles that guided the writing of the act. This 
represents more of the same. There will probably be no more 
confidence in the government than there was in the previous one 
if that is the kind of leadership we are to get.
<P>
	What are the two big themes the minister could have effected? 
The first is quality of treatment: treat all the regions the same 
way with no special considerations for any one part of Canada 
over another. The second is the intrusion of government: get 
government out of the economy as much as possible and let the 
market preside.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> That is what we are 
doing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> Let me quote clause 13 and members will know 
how much intervention there is. I am convinced the Liberal idea 
of leadership is to govern in the truest sense of the word, to make 
decisions on behalf of everyone but never face the people or 
listen to them. I want to illustrate clearly that the parliamentary 
secretary to the minister of state for science and technology is at 
least making an effort to listen to the public.
<P>
	How do I show this? Bill C-46 in subclause 13(1) referring to 
cabinet, the most central part of government, clearly states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Where the Governor in Council is of the opinion that it is in the national interest 
to do so, the Minister may, in exercising the powers and performing the duties and 
functions assigned by subsection 4(1)-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	These have been detailed by the parliamentary secretary and 
my colleague from the Bloc so I will not take time to read them. 
It continues:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-develop and implement programs and projects of special assistance to 
industries, particular industrial or commercial establishments, organizations, 
persons who are members of a particular category of persons defined by order of 
the Governor in Council or particular persons to aid economic development, 
whether through the restructuring, adjusting, rationalizing, establishing or 
re-establishing, modernizing, expanding or contracting of an industry or 
particular industrial or commercial establishment or organization in Canada, or 
otherwise.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	If that is not intervention in the sense of allowing cabinet 
rather than the enterprise system or the individuals to make 
decisions, what is it? As the government intervenes, government 
decides who wins and who loses. The marketplace is not 
permitted to function as it should. Of course there should be 
some guidelines but it is not allowed to function without undue 
restriction.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	The Tories did that. The Liberals before them did that and the 
Liberals of today say that they will do it too. It is not new. It is 
not more efficient. It is more of the same. I submit that nothing 
has changed. If anything, the government is likely to make a bad 
situation worse.
<P>
	The bill perpetuates the philosophy that has so debilitated 
Canada throughout successive governments. If we look at the 
deficit today we recognize only too clearly that is precisely what 
happened. Do we remember C. D. Howe's cavalier statement: 
``What's a million?'' That embodies what the department has 
done throughout its history.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> This saves $26 
million.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> Yes, $26 million out of a $3 billion budget. I 
submit it is a minuscule amount. I agree it is the right direction 
but it is not enough.
<P>
	There is no leadership. There is empowerment, though. There 
is entrenchment of bureaucracy through repositioning people 
and cost centres. They are in different places. There are new 
people with new titles who make the same decisions under the 
same philosophy, the same principles and the same policies of 
those who preceded them, in this case the Conservatives.
<P>
	To be able to distribute money without accountability or 
demanding accountability is to encourage dependence, 
irresponsibility, the possibility of misappropriation of funds, 
political patronage, the abuse of power and the corruption of 
officials and politicians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6124"> 6124 </A></B>
<P>
	It is no wonder the people of Canada say that governments 
come and go, politicians come and go and nothing changes. With 
the bill we see no plan for change. To administer change is 
difficult. It requires a goal. It requires a vision. It requires a plan 
to get there. It requires a strategy and tactics to achieve it. In 
short it requires leadership. The bill does not provide that.
<P>
	The bill concentrates on centralized planning, an 
interventionist strategy and the preference of one region over 
another. It denies the equality of persons, entrepreneurs and 
provinces. It is deceptive in its presentation. It purports to be a 
housekeeping piece of legislation but it displays no leadership 
or change in direction which the department so desperately 
needs and which was promised to Canadians in the red book.
<P>
	Let me become a little more specific. The government is 
simply following the changes as instituted by the Tories. The 
Tories did nothing to fix some of the more glaring difficulties 
with the department as it existed in its previous form. The bill 
only perpetuates centralized power, more interventionism in the 
marketplace and in individual lives, and the government knows 
best attitude: the government will decide what is in the national 
interest. It divides and subjects.
<P>
	Regional development in the two largest provinces of the 
country, Ontario and Quebec, is lumped together and as a 
consequence separated from the rest of Canada. Under existing 
law an order in council gives the minister of finance 
responsibility for FORD-Q, the Federal Office of Regional 
Development, Quebec. We are told there is about to be the same 
kind of order in council under the new changes in the new act. 
Nevertheless the act empowers the minister of industry to be the 
special minister for the economic development of Ontario and 
Quebec.
<P>
	How can the minister of industry have a national overview 
and responsibility, or the minister of finance for that matter who 
has the same kind of overview? How can these people exercise 
their duties as minister for the whole of Canada and balance the 
special interest? It seems to me there is an obvious conflict of 
interest when he is responsible for all of Canada and then pays 
special attention to a particular region of a province. It 
maintains the inequalities that exist at the present time. There is 
no attempt at level and fair treatment for all whether 
individuals, industries or regions.
<P>
	I submit this is wimpy and kindergarten style tampering with 
government structure. Very far reaching effects are taking place. 
They have wasted a lot of time and what has it achieved? We 
have been told in our briefing sessions that they have reduced by 
230 people the staff of 6,000 and they have reduced the $3 
billion budget by $26 million. That is in the right direction. I 
commend the government for that but it is not good enough.
<P>
	There is no evidence of them realizing the efficiencies 
necessary in putting together these four government 
departments.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	If that is all that can be done to save $26 million and reduce 
staff by 230, is it worth the effort, the dislocation, the stresses 
that will be involved for the people who are going to be 
relocated?
<P>
	It was like getting a parcel beautifully wrapped in nice red 
paper, the colour of the red book. As we unwrapped it we found 
that this big box had four smaller boxes in it. On the big box one 
could still see the Tory label in spite of the fact that it had been 
changed to read Liberal. It is nothing new, just new packaging 
and a new label. Our hopes were dashed, our expectations 
frustrated and our anticipation ignored.
<P>
	Enough of criticism. Do we have any alternatives? Yes, we do. 
We believe that the Department of Industry like all of 
government needs a set of guiding principles and policies, a 
mission statement, if you will. Reform proposes to bring its 
philosophy and principles to this department as it would to all 
others. Here are some of those.
<P>
	We believe in the value of enterprise and initiative and that 
governments have a responsibility to foster and protect an 
environment in which initiative and enterprise can be exercised 
by individuals and groups.
<P>
	We believe that the creation of wealth and productive jobs for 
Canadians is best achieved through the operations of a 
responsible, broadly based free enterprise economy in which 
private property, freedom of contract and the operations of free 
markets are encouraged and respected.
<P>
	We believe that public money should be regarded by 
government as a sacred trust or of funds held in trust and that 
government should practice fiscal responsibility, in particular 
the responsibility to balance expenditures and revenues.
<P>
	I notice the parliamentary secretary is nodding his head. I 
certainly hope the Minister of Finance will see that and that the 
Prime Minister will agree to that and that they will change their 
goal which says 3 per cent of the GDP will be the deficit in 
perpetuity or that it will continue. It is time we recognized the 
principle that we need to balance our budget.
<P>
	Reform also supports the depoliticizing of economic decision 
making in Canada through the gradual elimination of grants, 
subsidies and the pricing policies and all federal taxes direct or 
indirect on the natural resources of the provinces other than 
income tax of general application.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6125"> 6125 </A></B>
<P>
	Reform also supports the gradual removal of all measures 
which are designed to insulate industries, businesses, financial 
institutions, professions and trade unions from domestic and 
foreign competition.
<P>
	We support a vigorous measure to ensure the successful 
operation of the marketplace through such means as promotion 
of competition and vigorous enforcement of competition and 
anti-combines legislation with severe penalties for collusion 
and price fixing.
<P>
	We support orienting federal government activities toward 
the maturing of human and physical infrastructure and to 
support giving greater priority to the development of skills, 
particularly those that provide future job flexibility.
<P>
	As well, such training should be made flexible in terms of the 
type of institutions providing the training. We would encourage 
co-operative training in industry. To that end my colleagues and 
I have developed a statement for this department we think we 
should all observe. The role of the Department of Industry 
should be to establish and maintain a culture which rewards 
entrepreneurship, innovation and research and ensures a level, 
competitive and honest marketplace.
<P>
	To that end there are many opportunities for improvement in 
this bill which we would seize on: to curtail the centralized 
control that is proposed in this bill; to emphasize reducing the 
ability to interfere in the marketplace; to emphasize improving 
the ability of the marketplace to self-regulate. Serious 
intervention in the marketplace should be in emergency or 
extreme cases only.
<P>
	The national interest must be clearly defined by the people of 
Canada through Parliament, not by cabinet; in extraordinary 
circumstances by referendum. It should not be in the hands of 
cabinet where it can be made to mean anything it wants it to.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	With regard to regional development, some fundamental 
problems exist with this form of government intervention in the 
economy. Many scholars and former senior mandarins in this 
department and other departments of government have noted 
that a national industrial strategy and regional development 
strategy are mutually incompatible. They often work at cross 
purposes to one another and become self-defeating.
<P>
	We believe that the federal government should treat all 
regions of this country fairly and as a result should do away with 
all regional development programs. Fair treatment would 
eliminate the need for a minister to decide between the national 
interest on the one hand and the regional interest on the other.
<P>
	Regional political patronage and, just as important, the 
temptation to engage in it would be removed to a great extent if 
the instrument of regional development were done away with. 
Better efficiency within the department  should then be realized 
and other areas would benefit as well.
<P>
	I note with satisfaction, as I referred to earlier, the review that 
is taking place on science and technology policy by the 
Secretary of State for Science, Research and Development. I 
commend him for that and wish him well. I hope that he will 
question the presence of the many and varied scientific 
bureaucracies and funding agencies that fall under his purview. 
They need to be the subject of rigorous and continuing scrutiny. 
It appears that much of their work duplicates that being done by 
universities and various research enterprises. The fewer the 
hands that research funding passes through the better. I hope his 
review is complete and thorough.
<P>
	We need to expand private sector partnerships with direct 
profitable spinoffs which would strengthen the research and 
development establishment. We need research and development 
as never before. In that regard we need to be efficient, cost 
effective, profitable and domestically and internationally 
competitive.
<P>
	In conclusion, when we look at the history of the department 
and couple it with the proposed reorganization it is clear that the 
minister has chosen not to exercise the leadership that was his in 
this instance. He has only chosen to perpetuate the confusion 
and the lack of solid and visionary direction that have been the 
hallmark of the industry department throughout all of its history 
and all of its reincarnations and incarnations since the fifties.
<P>
	We hope that the minister would have taken this opportunity 
to enunciate a comprehensive national industrial economic 
strategy and reorganize his department accordingly. It is clear 
that is not the case. What we have is a clear demonstration that 
this government has no vision for Canada's economy, a vision 
from which it could so clearly benefit.
<P>
	The opportunity to regain public confidence has been 
squandered. The government could have done away with the 
pork barrel of regional development and the odious spectre of its 
centralized economic planning. It did not. This bill perpetuates 
the status quo. The system needs to be changed to let the market 
function freely within a framework and direction that reflect the 
democratic will of the people.
<P>
	Because this bill is elitist, centralist and interventionist I 
cannot support it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> On a point of order, 
Mr. Speaker. Would it be possible to have the opportunity on 
second reading for me to put a short question to the member of 
the Reform Party?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The parliamentary secretary may not 
be aware of the fact that the first three speakers for the three 
recognized parties have a 40-minute maximum and there is no 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6126"> 6126 </A></B>
<P>
period for questions or comments when each speaker has 
concluded the first three speeches.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport):</B> Mr. Speaker, the debate 
on this bill today is of historical importance for its significance 
and also because it coincides almost to the day with the seventh 
anniversary of the presentation of the Brundtland report, <I>Our 
Common Future</I>, to the United Nations General Assembly where 
it was extensively discussed and received unanimous support.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	The words sustainable development re-emerged as a result of 
that event. It is very heartening to see that the Minister of 
Industry has inserted the term sustainable development in clause 
5 of his bill. It is also heartening because when the minister was 
in opposition he urged the government of the day to use the term 
sustainable development when a bill was introduced at that time 
for the formation of the previous ministry. Unfortunately those 
pressures fell on deaf ears.
<P>
	In this respect the minister has shown that he has carried out 
in government what he had spoken about while in the 
opposition. That is very reassuring for anyone who believes that 
our political system is alive and kicking and in good health.
<P>
	What does the term sustainable development mean? It is the 
key phrase in clause 5 of this bill. Does it mean a growth in 
which the environment and the economy are seen in conflict? 
Does it mean a philosophy of imposing limits to growth? Does it 
mean returning the planet to a hypothetical natural state? 
Evidently the answer to these questions is no.
<P>
	Sustainable development means integrating the economy 
with the environment. This is not a relationship of conflict. The 
environment and the economy are mutually reinforcing. The 
terminology recognizes this fact.
<P>
	Sustainable development means learning to recognize and 
live within the limits of physical impact beyond which 
degradation of the ecosystems, of resources and of human 
condition becomes inevitable and progressive.
<P>
	Some limits are imposed by the impact of existing 
technologies and social organization and by the size of the 
planet but many limiting factors can be expanded through 
technological changes, modes of decision making, changes in 
domestic and international policies, and through investment in 
human capital.
<P>
	Since the 1987 Brundtland report there has been a lively 
debate over the specific conditions of sustainability. At this 
point we can say that sustainability is as much a social goal as it 
is an economic and environmental goal. It resembles other 
worldly, widely accepted and conceptually difficult social goals 
such as democracy, justice and public health.
<P>
	Since the 1992 earth summit in Rio the global community 
finds itself in a state of transition from unsustainable to the 
search for sustainable forms of development. With this bill we 
are now beginning to come around the corner, so to speak. The 
fact that the Minister of Industry decided to insert sustainable 
development as a main objective of his department is very 
heartening. He should be congratulated.
<P>
	What are the principles that the officials in this new 
department should adopt in order to reach the objective of 
sustainable development? One, as I mentioned briefly, it is the 
fact that the environment and the economy must be integrated in 
the decision making process. This is probably the most 
important condition for sustainable development and also the 
most challenging.
<P>
	Too often policies are directly against the requirements of 
sustainability.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	The environment is introduced into the decision making only 
after a problem has developed. At that late date options are 
usually limited to investments for end of pipe technologies to 
recapture emissions from waste streams and put them 
somewhere else.
<P>
	This leads to the still dominant mentality that a conflict exists 
between a healthy environment and a healthy economy. It is a 
false perception of course. We must make both mutually 
reinforcing, namely a healthy environment with a healthy 
economy. Integrated decisions have to be made at the front end 
of the development when goals and policies are being set, not at 
the end where costs are staggering, as in the case of acid rain 
abatement and as in the case of a number of other issues. 
However now is not the proper time or place to list these. 
Therefore, to conclude this point a fundamental reorganization 
of economic policies and priorities is needed.
<P>
	Second, energy. In North America and in most OECD 
countries conventional energy sources, namely coal, oil, 
nuclear, gas, attract large subsidies. Total energy subsidies in 
the United States alone have been estimated at more than $40 
billion annually. In Canada the last time we conducted an 
estimate on this item the figure came close to almost $5 billion 
in subsidies.
<P>
	End of pipe technologies to improve the safety and reduce 
emissions where available cannot even begin to compete with 
the opposite efforts of these huge and indirect subsidies. Energy 
is a key policy field in order to achieve sustainable 
development.
<P>
	Third, agriculture. Taxpayers and consumers of OECD 
countries spend well over $250 billion a year on agricultural 
subsidies. They not only encourage farmers to expend their 
basic farm capital; namely soil, water, trees, they also promote 
over production. This gives rise to demands for trade protection 
and export subsidies to enable those food products to be dumped 
in developing countries, thus in turn undermining their 
agriculture 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6127"> 6127 </A></B>
<P>
as well. Here again end of pipe measures for soil and water  
conservation programs are too weak to compete with these 
subsidies.
<P>
	Fourth, the nature of production. If high rates of growth are to 
be achieved and maintained a significant and rapid reduction in 
the energy and raw materials content of every unit of production 
is necessary. A healthy economy will no longer be one that uses 
increasing amounts of energy, materials, and resources to 
produce more goods, more jobs, more income.
<P>
	This assumption still dominates policies in energy, 
agriculture, and other resource sectors unfortunately. It is a 
leftover from the mass economy of the industrial age marked by 
a steady expansion in the production of energy, depletion of 
resources and degradation of the environment.
<P>
	The link between growth and its impact on the environment 
can be severed. The sustainable development economy, the new 
economy, is more efficient, uses less energy, less resources for 
every unit of production, uses more information, uses more 
intelligence.
<P>
	Industry, if driven by the principles of sustainable 
development, is discovering a number of things. For instance it 
can redesign industrial processes which require less and more 
flexible capital plant. It can recycle and reuse by-products. It 
can invent products that use lighter and more durable materials 
and that require less energy to produce.
<P>
	Industry is discovering that with reduced energy and material 
content, it can save an overall cost per unit of production and 
reduce environmental emissions and wastes. This is a far more 
effective way of reducing emissions than expensive end of pipe 
technologies that serve no other purpose. In addition resource 
reduction and recycling lead back to the beginning of the 
production cycle. They result in decreased mining and mining 
wastes, decreased water consumption and pollution, decreased 
deforestation and erosion.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	Moving from unsustainable to sustainable development 
requires a shift in the government's agenda, a shift not only in 
the Department of Industry but also in the Department of 
Natural Resources, of trade, transport, agriculture, public 
works, external affairs, in our procurement policies, in the 
production of energy.
<P>
	The Minister of Industry is leading in this respect but he 
cannot do it alone. A clear indication of whether a government is 
shifting its agenda to address sustainability seriously is its 
budget.
<P>
	A budget establishes economic and fiscal incentives, as we all 
know, and also the disincentives, including forms of taxes 
within which farmers, consumers and business make their 
decisions. A budget is the most important environmental policy 
statement because it determines how the nation's environment 
will be degraded or enhanced, how its stock of ecological capital 
will be  increased or reduced. Actually the budget should be 
regarded as an environmental statement.
<P>
	It was with these considerations in mind, with a clear intent of 
keeping an election promise, with a commitment to the need to 
shift to sustainability that in May of this year the committee on 
the environment and sustainable development recommended to 
the government the creation of a commissioner of the 
environment and sustainable development. This individual 
would report to Parliament. He would report on progress made 
in the shift from unsustainable to sustainable policies, on 
programs, on budgets. We did this drawing from chapter IV of 
the election campaign red book. We were motivated at the same 
time by the conclusions of the earth summit in Rio, namely the 
understanding and belief that Canada must move toward a 
sustainable development agenda for the 21st century.
<P>
	The minister and his department are off to a good start by 
making sustainable development the main goal of this new 
department in clause 5. The minister is saying that economic 
development is dependent and goes hand in hand with ecological 
capital; that the depletion of one leads to the weakening and 
depletion of the other.
<P>
	The wording in this bill is a milestone toward establishing in 
law the interdependence between two values of tremendous 
importance to humanity. Already the recognition of sustainable 
development has clearly emerged in the policies of the minister 
of fisheries through the conservation he has introduced. This 
was somehow imposed on us by circumstances that have 
developed over the last 20 years.
<P>
	Another positive development on this road toward sustainable 
development is the appointment in early July of a task force to 
study the baseline expenditures of government that may be in 
conflict with sustainability and environmental protection. This 
task force will report to the Minister of Finance next November 
and is keeping a promise made in the campaign red book.
<P>
	Another positive development came last Thursday when both 
the Minister of Industry and the Minister of the Environment 
announced a strategy for the Canadian environmental industry. 
It is the realization at the political level, the highest level, that 
there is an enormous potential, enormous scope for the 
development of a new industry that draws its strength from the 
realization that we are entering a new phase in growth, a new 
phase in development and the linking of the two concepts of the 
economy and the environment being integrated in a rational 
manner.

<P>
	Yet to come are the changes in other departments. We still 
have a long way to go but the beginning is good and promising. I 
want to applaud the minister for his initiative.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with attention to the hon. member for Davenport, who I 
see as a man full of fine qualities who spends a great deal of 
energy protecting the blue planet. I have no doubt that the hon. 
member for Davenport made his allegations in good faith, but I 
have serious reservations about his party.
<P>
	You know, when I look at a government that revels in big 
words such as sustainable development and plays on people's 
emotions by talking about global development and mortgaging 
the future of our children and grandchildren, I am puzzled.
<P>
	When I see, for example, a ship that has been lying at the 
bottom of the Gulf of St. Lawrence for 24 years and that is still 
leaking part of its cargo every day; when I see a government that 
leaves thousands of lights on 24 hours a day when the offices are 
empty; when I see overheated rooms; when I see the lawn in 
front of the Parliament Buildings being watered right after it 
rains or a few hours before heavy rains are forecast; when I see 
the quality of the water in the St. Lawrence River and the Great 
Lakes get increasingly worse; when I see that the $5.8 million 
that was to be spent on cleaning up the St. Lawrence in Phase I of 
the St. Lawrence Action Plan was actually invested in 
Miramichi, New Brunswick, several hundreds of kilometres 
away from the St. Lawrence River, these denunciations raise 
questions in my mind about the seriousness of the Liberal Party 
now governing Canada.
<P>
	The question I could ask the hon. member for Davenport is 
this: Can you, sir, who show very good judgment particularly on 
environmental matters, guarantee that the party of which you are 
an active member will be as serious as yourself in the years to 
come, when you know as well as I do that time flies and that we 
are falling behind with regard to sustainable development?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caccia:</B> Mr. Speaker, I can tell the hon. member for 
Frontenac that the best guarantee is the fact that the minister has 
included in Clause 5 of his bill, about his new department's 
objectives, two very important key words for the first time, and 
that is a good start, a good promise, if you will.
<P>
	Of course, the law must be enforced and the purpose of 
today's debate is, I think, to provide the minister and his 
department with the guidelines needed to promote the two key 
words ``sustainable development''. I hope that, as we are doing 
today in this House, the new government elected in Quebec City 
will also pass legislation aimed at promoting sustainable 
development. I am sure that the hon. member for Frontenac, 
given his influence with his colleagues in Quebec's National  
Assembly, will lobby, make representations to his provincial 
colleagues. The state of the St. Lawrence River is the result of 
past policies but today here in this House we are discussing the 
future. We are talking about the new behaviour for the industry 
of the future.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	I am sure that if the Government of Quebec does the same 
thing, sets the same goal for provincially-regulated industries, 
we will see considerable changes in the St. Lawrence River and 
in all other rivers in the country. But we must exert pressure, we 
must say that solutions exist and we must, of course, finds ways 
to demonstrate that the economy and the environment can be 
integrated.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 43(2),

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
being allowed to speak today on the government's Bill C-46. At 
first glance, this bill only confirms the organizational changes 
made by the previous government in the summer of 1993. 
Caution, however, teaches us to read between the lines, and it is 
precisely between the lines that we see the reasons for opposing 
this bill.
<P>
	In fact, the government should have put a stop to duplication 
and overlap by giving Quebec exclusive control over its 
economic development. Instead, the government is giving the 
Department of Industry authority over regional development in 
Quebec and in Ontario, contrary to what is happening in the 
West and in the Maritimes.
<P>
	The Federal Office of Regional Development for Quebec is a 
Quebec regional development agency and is not created under 
the specific legislation. It on took an order in council to transfer 
the regional development responsibilities of the Minister of 
Industry to the Minister of Finance. Nothing, however, 
guarantees that this order in council will be issued. It worries me 
that one day Quebec's regional development will fall into the 
hands of a minister from another province, as happened in 1991. 
Regional development could become lost in the administrative 
structure of the Department of Industry, and, I repeat, this 
worries me.
<P>
	Bill C-46, Mr. Speaker, is the result of the previous 
government's wish to rationalize the machinery of government. 
In going ahead and implementing it, the Liberal government 
must give proof that it will effectively reduce government 
waste. And this will be far from conclusive, when one looks at 
the unnecessary and costly expenditures resulting from 
duplication and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6129"> 6129 </A></B>
<P>
overlap within the federal government and between the 
Canadian and Quebec governments.
<P>
	Since the study by Germain Julien and Marcel Proulx, who 
made public the overlapping of federal programs with certain 
provincial programs, just from the point of view of 
co-ordination, civil servants must meet close to 1,000 times a 
year to see if they are not offering the same services, to 
harmonize program objectives and to ensure that they are not 
incompatible.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	The Bélanger-Campeau Commission was clear on this point. 
If Quebec took charge of existing federal programs and provided 
the same services, we would save $233 millions in 
transportation and communication expenditures, $250 million 
in labour expenditures and $289 million in expenses associated 
with the collection of duties and taxes.
<P>
	How efficient are measures implemented by two levels of 
government? More often than not, they cancel each other out 
because of competition and even conflict arising between the 
federal and provincial government. Program co-ordination is 
made difficult since neither government is prepared to make 
serious concessions on objectives or priorities. Even the famous 
infrastructure program had some hiccups. Did the former 
Minister of Municipal Affairs in Quebec not receive a letter of 
reprimand from the minister responsible for the program?
<P>
	Just to know what services and financial assistance programs 
are available and to comply with laws and regulations, our 
constituents are forced to make multiple inquiries to keep 
abreast of programs and services. This is quite a burden, even 
more so when the programs and services are overlapping. 
Businesses have to assign employees to gathering this 
information and eventually taxpayers and consumers are 
affected.
<P>
	In addition, there are people who do not use certain services 
because they do not know about them and program duplication 
does nothing to help. In fact, it even complicates the matter 
further. The people have little control over the way they are 
governed because of the confusion caused by overlapping. Such 
fragmentation of action makes it impossible for any one level of 
government to influence the course of things and, to make things 
even worse, they pass the puck to each other.
<P>
	The provinces do have the right to opt out of federal 
programs. They do get financial compensation, but only for 
joint programs, which account for only five per cent of all 
overlapping. For these reasons, I seriously question the capacity 
of the Department of Industry to prevent such squandering. The 
bill before us provides rather for the status quo with regards to 
the mandate of the amalgamated departments. Is this another 
instance of semblance of change? Divisions are indeed changing 
names, but are we merging and blending the players? Nothing in 
this bill points that way. Nevertheless, the people gave a 
mandate to reduce waste in the federal government.
<P>
	The Liberal government talks about ``one-stop shopping'' as 
a way to rationalize its internal operations. We all agree that this 
is a step in the right direction. But be careful: a mere merger that 
increases the size of an organization also reduces its 
productivity and efficiency. As a result, the bureaucracy is even 
more cumbersome. The Liberals have not yet shown that savings 
will be made with this ``single window'' concept.
<P>
	The one in Montreal for business people saves the 
government no money. Customer service is improved, but what 
about the promised streamlining? We are entitled to demand that 
the Liberal government carry out all the restructuring of the 
federal machinery presented in this House in various bills that 
were intended to save money. The Bloc Quebecois demands it on 
behalf of all Canadians and Quebecers.
<P>
	This bill also confirms existing overlap in regional 
development. Why let the Department of Industry meddle in our 
territory? For years Quebec has demanded control in this area. 
We have a very particular view of our requirements in this field. 
The decentralization of funding and authority begun by the new 
government in Quebec is the response which the regions were 
waiting for to take charge of their own communities.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	The federal government would be well advised to do away 
with its centralizing attitude and instead implement this 
democratic vision of regional development. To say that regional 
development is neglected in Quebec is stating the obvious. Let 
me just mention the much publicised federal-provincial 
agreements on regional development in 1987 and 1988. I will 
admit that these agreements work very well in the western 
provinces and in the Maritimes. Indeed, since these agreements 
were signed, $1.2 billion was spent in Atlantic Canada, $630 
million in the western provinces, and $165 million in Quebec.
<P>
	Our regions suffer from the multiple interventions in regional 
development and from a lack of consistency of government 
policies. Let me give you an example. Would you believe that 
the government subsidizes an industry through the Federal 
Office of Regional Development, the only Canadian industry in 
its sector, while also allowing one of its departments to buy 
equipment from a competing American company? Yet this is 
what is happening to an industry in my riding.
<P>
	This is unacceptable. If you believe in a product and subsidize 
the related research and development efforts, should you not 
also promote its marketing? Not so with this government, it 
seems. That situation should be corrected as soon as possible.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6130"> 6130 </A></B>
<P>
	In its report, the interdepartmental work group on regional 
development set up by the Quebec government in 1991 looked at 
the issue of multiple interventions in regional development and 
concluded that: ``In the present context, we can see the 
following negative results linked to the interventions of the two 
levels of government: confusion in terms of the regional sense 
of belonging, since the federal regions do not correspond to the 
administrative regions in Quebec; duplication of structures, 
regional consulting organizations and economic development 
agencies, as well as setting up of management committees and 
programs to reconcile various types of interventions; 
duplication of activities which results in high operation costs, 
given the actual budgets invested in regional development; too 
many government stakeholders, a situation which frequently 
results in confusion at the regional level''.
<P>
	May I remind hon. members that these comments were taken 
from the final report of the interdepartmental task force on 
regional development, published by the Government of Quebec 
in 1991. Quebecers are sick and tired of seeing their money used 
for the regional development of other provinces. This money 
should go to help small businesses and create small businesses 
and jobs in Quebec. Quebec does not want regional development 
that is based on the strictly industrial vision of the Minister of 
Industry in Ottawa. Quebec has had enough of the federal 
government's meddling and inconsistencies. Long ago, Quebec 
realized that only regional players understood the real needs of 
their environment. Enough of these projects, one-shot 
interventions and political decisions that siphon off funding 
from projects that are working perfectly well.
<P>
	This bill is unlikely to end the uncertainty that is rife within 
the regional development agency. The Federal Office of 
Regional Development-Quebec may be very anxious to 
harmonize its activities with Quebec's, but so far, it has not been 
successful. According to the Minister of Finance responsible for 
the office, it has not yet been able to harmonize its mandate with 
that of the Quebec government's business development centres, 
which means the centres are still at the mercy of unilateral 
decisions by Ottawa. For instance, the federal government is 
planning to merge the BDCs and CFCs, which are now the 
responsibility of the Department of Human Resources 
Development, and have a single agency that would come under 
the Federal Office of Regional Development. Representatives of 
these agencies in my region talked to me about their concerns. 
The very future of the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec is in jeopardy. Despite all the promises 
in the red book that regional development could be a high 
priority, the office's budget is shrinking.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	In 1993-94, the office's budget was $232 million, which is 
expected to drop by $70 million over the next three years. After 
these cuts, the budget for the Federal  Office of Regional 
Development will be down to $162 million, compared with $200 
million for the West and $214 million for the Maritimes.
<P>
	The concerns of the agencies responsible for regional 
development are quite understandable, considering the way the 
Federal Office of Regional Development operates. The office 
has failed to harmonize its activities with the comprehensive 
vision of local development established by the BDCs and the 
CFCs.
<P>
	Programs designed in Ottawa and implemented in our regions 
do not always respond to the real needs of the people. The money 
is spread around without any real input from the community. 
The federal government should consider the strategic planning 
priorities of Quebec's regional municipalities and regions, in 
order to maximize the impact of activities by regional agencies 
responsible for local development.
<P>
	As long as decision-making and budgeting remain 
centralized in Ottawa, the regions will not be able to establish 
the base they need for continuing development. Geographic 
isolation is one thing, but it is nothing compared with the 
remoteness of the decision-making process.
<P>
	The Bélanger-Campeau Commission realized that the future 
of regional development in Quebec depended on the regions 
controlling the levers of development. I wish the government 
would do something and admit it is not on the right track with 
regional development in Quebec. The fact is that the economic 
base is foundering, the social fabric is disintegrating, the rural 
exodus has not been stemmed and young people are still the first 
ones to leave.
<P>
	Remote areas are crying out for help and with good reason. 
Federal funding to Quebec regions has increased by 50 per cent 
since 1983, whereas during the same period it has increased by 
300 per cent in western Canada and by 250 per cent in the 
Maritimes.
<P>
	On a per capita basis, the results are even more catastrophic. 
In 1987, per capita federal spending was $431 in the Maritimes, 
$259 in western Canada and $64 in Quebec.
<P>
	How can we bring some balance back? The federal 
government must reduce expenditures, eliminate tax breaks for 
family trusts as well as waste resulting from overlapping and 
duplication due mainly to infringement upon provincial 
jurisdictions. The billions of dollars saved this way could be 
used to bring some fairness back into federal funding of Quebec 
regional development.
<P>
	In the last budget speech, the federal government announced 
that it would not renew subsidiary agreements respecting 
forestry and mining. And yet it is in these two areas that 
subsidiary agreements have been the most beneficial for 
Quebec. The Eastern Quebec Development Plan, which will no 
longer be funded, is a case in point. Close to 6,000 woodlot 
owners are extremely worried. In other areas, the government is 
reluctant to renew its agreements. Federal subsidies to farming 
amount to  $225 million, $25.5 million of which, only 10 per 
cent of the envelope, goes to Quebec. For transportation, 
Quebec gets only $165 million, or 13 per cent, out of a total of 
$1.1 billion, slim pickings indeed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6131"> 6131 </A></B>
<P>
	Let us settle the matter once and for all by repatriating this 
money-in the form of tax points-so that it can be managed by 
Quebec. Regional development will be a winner. This is what we 
are all hoping for.
<P>
	All kinds of small steps can help us get out of this mess. 
Nowhere in the red book is it suggested that investors be allowed 
to pump federally guaranteed venture capital into local 
businesses. And yet, this is the kind of solution people are 
offering to help their region.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	The new Quebec government has developed a real regional 
development policy. The Parti Quebecois wants to promote in 
that respect the assumption of responsibility by the 
stakeholders, in a context of freer trade which eliminates some 
trade barriers and opens the regional economy up to stiff 
competition.
<P>
	Let me quote some of the objectives of this positive policy 
which could serve as a model: high level of employment, 
competitive export-oriented economy based on sustainable 
development, continuity and high added value, better quality of 
life in large communities, viable land use and many more.
<P>
	No consensus can be achieved at the federal level regarding 
regional development because priorities vary from province to 
province and from region to region. That is why we are stressing 
the need to decentralize budgets and decision-making powers. 
The future calls for a decentralization of powers towards 
decision-making units, that is to say the regions, these being in a 
better position to assess their own situation. This bill should be 
rejected because it does not provide Quebec with exclusive 
control over regional development.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to my colleague's discourse 
regarding this bill.
<P>
	Of particular interest was the concern about overlap. It is a 
concern many members on all sides of the House share based on 
the concept that we should get as many efficiencies into 
government as we possibly can.
<P>
	My question for the hon. member would follow that if we 
were to simply remove the federal government from this debate, 
we would be left with the provincial governments which would 
then have an overlap problem with the municipalities. Would it 
not be better for us, as a national government, to set priorities 
nationally? Then to the best degree possible we could devolve 
responsibility for managing these programs to that order of 
government closest to the people being served.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Landry:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to answer this 
question because I know that, like us, our colleagues from the 
other party on this side are here to cut public spending and also 
to try and put some degree of order back in our fiscal house.
<P>
	To answer my hon. colleague's question, with respect to 
duplication and overlapping, let me tell you that when we look at 
the statistics, precise figures-not my own but rather extremely 
precise figures provided by economists-and see a government 
reducing its activities and hear people say: ``Look, we might as 
well let the federal government run it all'', I for one cannot 
believe my ears.
<P>
	When a problem arises in a community, a province or a 
country, I have a rule of thumb that goes like this: who is in the 
best position to resolve the problem? It may be the municipal, 
provincial or federal government. I think this is the basis for 
taking our problems in our own hands because we are the ones 
who are in the best position to assess the problem. Look, we 
know that savings would be achieved. We know that. It was 
established beyond any doubt.
<P>
	These savings could be used, as I said repeatedly, to create 
jobs and put Canada back to work. Then we would be truly 
entitled to tell the people watching us and listening to us: ``We 
have done something for the people of Canada and Quebec''. 
And that is what I strive to do in this House to work and plead so 
that something is really done for all Canadians and Quebecers.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to commend my colleague from Lotbinière for his speech on 
Bill C-46. I would also like to comment on the remarks of my 
Reform colleague whose question seems very relevant in the 
political and economic debate Quebecers and Canadians are 
now engaged in, because he presents the problem in appropriate 
terms.
<P>
	Regional development is one of the main reasons why there 
are sovereignists in Quebec. Some Quebecers want Quebec to 
take its destiny into its own hands because the federal 
government's priorities will never coincide with those of 
Quebecers and their government. That is not necessarily the 
case in the rest of Canada as such. Given Canadians' sense of 
belonging compared with that of Quebecers, we know that 
Canada can develop its own internal logic in terms of 
development because there seems to be a strong consensus.
<P>
	As my colleague just said, the federal government can set 
Canadian standards from the Pacific to some point in the East, 
but the Government of Quebec and Quebecers themselves will 
always be opposed to Canadian standards that would apply to 
Quebec.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6132"> 6132 </A></B>
<P>
	Therefore, I congratulate the hon. member for asking a 
relevant question that is at the heart of the constitutional debate 
that concerns us and keeps us busy, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Landry:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to add something. The 
relationship between the federal and provincial governments 
reminds me a little of a family where, one day, the son tells his 
father: ``Dad, I would like to start a business.'' So the father 
answers: ``No, son, stay with me, am I not taking good care of 
you?'' The father stands in the way of the son's development, 
prevents him from spreading his wings instead of saying, 
``Look, son, you are old enough to leave the nest.'' That is what 
we are asking for. We want to leave the nest so we can take 
control of our own destiny and continue to negotiate the same 
thing.
<P>
	We keep on explaining that we do not want borders and 
barriers. What we want is good communications but we must get 
back what we are entitled to. For example, when we were talking 
about manpower training earlier, they said they wanted to save 
$250 million. If you want to throw away that $250 million, go 
ahead, but I myself would like to save it because money is 
important to me and I would like to re-invest it in my province, 
in small businesses and all that.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being 2 p.m., the House will now proceed to 
Statements by Members, pursuant to Standing Order 31.

	On Sunday, September 25, thousands of local citizens 
gathered to commemorate this important occasion. It was my 
honour to present the certificate on behalf of the Prime Minister

Italianate in design, incorporates many unique features, 
including fresco paintings on the ceiling which are unrivalled in 
Canada, as well as many other beautiful original fixtures.

	Given the consensus on this issue in Quebec, I would like to 
remind the minister that if the (Quebec) National Assembly had

<P>
	I listened carefully during the weekend and in addition to the

with regard to how the Liberal government is responding to 
critical environmental issues.
<P>
	For example, the government has been in office almost 12

the Innu during this assessment process.

at the Elite Seed Farm on Fox Island, P.E.I.
<P>
	This newly renovated facility which is owned by the primary

environmentally safe services to producers and consumers.
<P>
	It will also play a significant role in marketing P.E.I. potatoes 
through the use of its conference facilities that will attract trade 
missions from around the world. This concept of attracting trade

compete in the international environment. This is the best way 
to deal with structural unemployment.
<P>
	Labour force adjustment boards are staffed by local 
stakeholders in the training process. Since many of these 
recipients are on unemployment insurance it is important there 
there be some form of co-operation between Canada 
Employment and the boards. This is the only sensible course 
since it will ensure proper program delivery.

	According to the council's report, social programs are 
working, but the labour market is very sluggish and is 
responsible for the problems of unemployment and poverty that 
we are experiencing. The Bloc Quebecois has been repeating 
this message since the minister launched his reform of social 
programs. The federal government should first and foremost 
concentrate its energy on an active employment policy.
<P>
	The Liberals, however, have identified social programs as the 
main disincentive to work and have decided to cut them as a way 
to encourage beneficiaries to return to work. The government is 
working on the consequences of the problem and not on its 
causes. The minister will find plenty in the council's report to 
redirect his approach and give hope to all those who are 
excluded from the labour market.

	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday a thousand law enforcement officers 
marched on Parliament Hill in the memorial for the 10 officers 
who were killed in the line of duty last year.
<P>
	Today 51 names of prison guards, conservation officers and 
customs officials killed since 1967 were added.
<P>
	Though all occupational deaths are tragic, the deaths of peace 
officers are even more so because they frequently come at the 
hands of someone else.
<P>
	Many of these deaths could be prevented but they will only be 
prevented if we do our job in this House and pass the legislation 
necessary to get dangerous criminals off the streets of Canada.
<P>
	We need an efficient removal system for our immigration 
department. We need gun control legislation that targets 
criminals and not the law-abiding Canadian public. We need to 
immediately revoke section 745 of the Criminal Code so that 
those individuals who murder police officers will have to serve 
the minimum 25 years that they were sentenced.
<P>
	I join with the Solicitor General in calling for a memorial 
service next year when no new names are added to that list. Let 
us not forget that the decisions we make in this House may make 
a difference in attaining that goal.

Winnipeg's future as an air transportation hub for all of North

Hemisphere Distribution Alliance Incorporated will receive up 
to $620,000 in federal government funding to research

<P>
	Local firms have come together with the Winnipeg airport to 
develop a multimodal transportation centre to act as a transfer 
point for cargo between the markets of the Pacific rim, Europe

<P>
	This initiative has strong potential to create 6,000 new jobs in 
Manitoba, generate $105 million in tax revenue for the three 
levels of government and hundreds of millions of dollars worth 
of economic activity. It shows the benefits of co-operation 
between the private sector and government to foster growth in 
Manitoba and all of Canada.

	Are these centres for excellence another empty shell, without 
authority or resources, stuck in a consultative role and remote

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="REFORMOFSOCIALPROGRAMS">REFORM OF SOCIAL PROGRAMS</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the CBC has obtained a copy of the proposed reform of 
our social programs that was submitted to cabinet last week by 
the Minister of Human Resources Development. The document 
says that the minister wants to centralize unemployment 
insurance, make enrolment in training courses compulsory for 
unemployment insurance recipients and make the spouse's 
income a factor in establishing eligibility for benefits.
<P>
<B>(1415) </B>
<P>
	My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Would he 
confirm that his government intends to centralize the 
administration of social programs, which today is a provincial 
responsibility under the Constitution?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the answer is no.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I realize that these documents, whose existence was 
alleged and reported by the CBC, are not official documents, but 
I think the public is starting to question the government's 
intentions, considering that the newspapers have documents 
which are said to have been submitted to cabinet.
<P>
	I want to ask the Prime Minister if, in its proposed reform, the 
government intends to oblige the unemployed to take training 
courses, in order to be eligible for benefits?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we will have an official document next week, and if the hon. 
member wishes to make the usual comments under the 
circumstances, he will have to wait until the document is 
released. A week from now he will get all the answers to the 
questions he is asking now.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this document, whose existence is alleged by the CBC, 
exists. It is not a forgery. It is a document from a government 
source. So this document is disturbing, on the face of it, and I 
want to ask the government to tell us whether, as the document 
indicates, it intends to come down hard on women by making the 
income of the spouse an obstacle to their being eligible for their 
own benefits?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we will have an officially authorized document, not one 
obtained by a third party, at the beginning of next week, and the 
Leader of the Opposition will be able to make the usual 
comments at that time.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, one week after the intervention of American forces in 
Port-au-Prince, U.S. President Bill Clinton announced this 
morning before the UN General Assembly the immediate lifting 
of American trade sanctions against Haiti. President Clinton 
also urged other nations to do the same.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Will he tell us if 
Canada intends to lift its trade sanctions against Haiti today, as 
requested by the U.S. President?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Christine Stewart (Secretary of State (Latin America 
and Africa)):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is correct that President Clinton 
announced this morning that he would lift commercial flight 
sanctions as well as financial transactions that were imposed 
against Haiti as long as it did not apply to the military in Haiti.
<P>
	Canada is willing to follow suit but first we want to see 
President Aristide's request for this which was made yesterday. 
It must be recognized that we cannot lift our own sanctions 
except by order in council.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a supplementary for the Prime Minister. Will he

resumed?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Christine Stewart (Secretary of State (Latin America 
and Africa)):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I just stated, Canada is willing to 
look at lifting this particular sanction against Haiti but it will 
have to be pursued through an order in council. I expect that will 
be pursued as soon as possible.

Speaker, the finance minister has refused to rule out new taxes 
on RRSPs. On Friday further alarm bells rang right across 
Canada when the Secretary of State for International Financial 
Institutions also refused to rule out taxes on private sector and 
public service pension plans.
<P>
	It is time to clear the air, so I ask the Minister of Finance for 
clarification. Has he ruled out new taxes on private sector and 
public service pension plans?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have made it very 
clear that the essence of the consultation process requires debate 
with 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6137"> 6137 </A></B>
<P>
Canadians as to the tradeoffs and as to the measures they 
eventually expect the government to take. It would be to 
preclude that process for me to  engage in individual comment 
on any suggestion at this time.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	We look forward to the contributions of the members of the 
Reform Party and the Bloc Quebecois throughout that process 
on the finance committee. Members of the Reform Party simply 
do not understand the importance of this initiative by the 
government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, certainly we understand consultation but we must have 
something to consult about. That is why we are asking the 
government some questions; we are asking questions because 
we need some answers.
<P>
	From the minister's reply we can only conclude-and it is the 
only conclusion we can draw-that the government is 
considering a tax rate not only on RRSPs but on company 
pension plans and public service pensions. Millions of 
Canadians count on them for their retirement.
<P>
	Why is the minister contemplating punishing Canadians for 
the irresponsible spending of his government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are not contemplating punishing 
Canadians. If there was irresponsible spending it was by the 
previous government. A great number of them were supported 
by members of the Reform Party.
<P>
	We are about to embark upon the most comprehensive 
consultation process in terms of prebudget discussion that has 
ever been held. I do not understand why the members of the 
Reform Party are so anti-democratic that they fail to understand 
Canadians deserve to have their voices heard.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, no party worked harder to remove the previous 
administration because of its fiscal mismanagement than the 
Reform Party. No party will work harder to remove the Liberal 
government if it continues to spend $100 billion more than it 
takes in revenue in its term.
<P>
	Canadians are concerned. They suspect the new pension plan 
taxes are somehow related to the long delayed social policy 
review.
<P>
	Why is the minister contemplating robbing Peter to pay Paul, 
or should I say robbing Lloyd to pay Paul? Why is the 
government making Canadians more dependent on underfunded 
programs such as the old age security or the Canada pension plan 
by taking away their personal retirement savings?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, during Wednesday's question period 
the member for Calgary West stated that it was in the interest of 
his party and should be in the interest of the government to get 
the views of all Canadians on the unity of the country. He then 
went on to say: ``I am surprised the Prime Minister does not 
want that''.
<P>
	I am surprised, indeed astonished, that the member does not 
want us to consult with Canadians on the economic future of our 
country.

Department of Fisheries and Oceans will cease immediately and

	<B>Mr. Tobin:</B> My colleague from the Reform Party doing 
politics a new way interrupts my attempt to give a complete 
answer.
<P>
	The fact of the matter is that DFO will be announcing a 
completely independent review of the circumstances regarding 
the situation with respect to sockeye on the Fraser River. The 
review will involve four individuals, none of whom is involved 
with DFO, all of whom are experts in their fields outside the

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	For the past year, the minister has been going after middle 
income earners and the poorest members of society to replenish 
the government's coffers. The odious cuts in the unemployment 
insurance program and age credit announced in the last budget 
are cases in point. The minister is relentless in his attacks and is 
now considering taxing pension plan contributions.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Finance confirm whether or not he intends 
to tax pension plan contributions?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, I have already answered 
this question. What we are really seeking is a consultation 
process that is as open as possible. It is not for me to talk about 
or comment on particular suggestions as long as the finance 
committee has not presented its report. I am certain that the hon. 
member does not want to interfere with the process we have set 
in motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I will rephrase my question: is the minister going to go on 
attacking middle income earners and ordinary taxpayers by 
taxing RRSPs and pension plans or is he going to go after the 
2,000 taxpayers who last year did not pay a cent in taxes, rich 
Canadian individuals and companies who, more often than not, 
are defrauding Revenue Canada? This is the real question, Mr. 
Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, clearly, in our last 
budget, we closed some of the loopholes which allowed some 
Canadians to not pay any taxes, namely by eliminating the 
$100,000 capital gain exemption which was by far the main 
reason for this.
<P>
	It is very clear that what the member really wants is to do 
away with the consultation process. I would like to quote what 
the Reform member for Lethbridge had to say about our 
consultation process. ``It is the most open budget process I ever 
was involved in. Efforts to open up the budget process and to 
take into account pre-budget consultations are a welcome 
innovation''.

and I ask the Prime Minister again, in light of this reply, how he 
can say that this bill has not been influenced by lobbyists, given 
the noticeable absence of provisions to force lobbyists to 
divulge their fees as well as provisions to eliminate the tax 
deduction for expenses incurred by businesses to engage the 
services of lobbyists, provisions they were demanding when 
they formed the opposition.

Liberal government's approach to dealing with hard working 
farmers who are trying to make a decent living?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food):</B> Mr. Speaker, it would not be appropriate for any 
member of the House of Commons to comment on an RCMP 
investigation. The question should be directed to the Solicitor 
General or to the Minister of National Revenue.
<P>
	On the policy issue that is involved there are obviously laws 
in place in Canada today dealing with the appropriate procedure 
by which grain may be exported. In a civilized and democratic 
society it is important that all of the laws be obeyed, not just 
those with which we may selectively agree or disagree.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville):</B> Mr. Speaker, one of the

advantage of the open borders guaranteed under the free trade

<P>
	Why is the Prime Minister and his cabinet treating these 
farmers like drug dealers with these heavy-handed tactics?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> They are breaking the law.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Why do they not instead do the right thing and 
allow farmers to elect a board of directors to give them control 
over their organization, the Canadian Wheat Board?

	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and

last week pertaining to marketing systems for Canadian wheat, I 
indicated that I would be providing a forum later on this fall at 
which the differing views on the subject can be expressed.
<P>
	It is true to say that there are farmers in western Canada who 
hold profoundly different opinions on the question of the 
appropriate marketing system to have in place for their grain. I 
think it is appropriate that they should be provided with a forum 
within which the different sides of that particular debate can be 
aired so that when any future decisions are made they are based 
on facts and solid information and not merely on innuendo.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Mr. Speaker, last July, the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans refused to grant Quebec 
fishermen turbot fishing quotas after having encouraged them in 
the spring to gear up for this type of operation.
<P>
	Considering that it was at his suggestion that they equipped 
themselves for turbot fishing, does the fisheries minister 
undertake today to fully compensate Gaspesian fishermen, who 
have invested one million dollars to be able to fish the quotas the 
minister subsequently refused them?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am extremely surprised at this question, given that on 
at least three or four occasions the member asked me for private 
discussions just outside that door about this matter. On each of 
those occasions I explained to the member that the scientific 
evidence with respect to turbot was very bad. He agreed. I told 
the member that it was extremely unlikely that there would be 
new licences.
<P>
	The member knows it is absolutely false to suggest that the 
federal government encouraged people either in Quebec or in 
Newfoundland, because this occurred in both places, to gear up 
for a fishery that was not going to take place.
<P>
	The member should also know that on Monday past the 
wisdom of the federal position in Ottawa in taking a 
conservationists stance was confirmed when the North Atlantic 
Fisheries Organization and all of the member states from around 
the world in that organization slashed international quotas by 
over 50 per cent and for the first time regulated the turbot catch 
because of the critical condition of these stocks.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is in 
the public domain. Informal discussions-I would also like to 
remind the hon. minister that, on July 25, he publicly stated that 
he had encouraged the fishermen to do so. I will give him 
another chance and phrase my question differently.
<P>
	How can the minister reconcile refusing turbot quotas to 
Gaspesian fishermen with offering the major part of the 
remaining turbot quota to a single company, namely Seafreez, a 
company located in his riding and one that used Russian 
trawlers?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what the member is not saying-and this is regrettable, 
and may I say to the member personally, surprising-is that the 
Seafreez operation he is talking about is up in the Davis Strait in 
area O. It is an area so far north that no Canadian vessel of any 
sort is operating there or has ever operated there, and no vessel 
in Quebec or Newfoundland or anywhere in Atlantic Canada has 
the technological ability to be up there.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6141"> 6141 </A></B>

	With the exception of the offshore shrimp fleet, what the hon. 
member is not saying is that Seafreez has been up there for the 
last five or six years and had developed this fishery in the day 
when the previous administration and a minister on the other 
side of the House made those decisions.
<P>
	To somehow give the impression as had been left, that this is a 
new decision and a new allocation by the current minister is 
false. Not a pound of the turbot is processed in Newfoundland, 
let alone my riding. It is processed in Canso, Nova Scotia.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney

this is an application under section 690 of the Criminal Code, I 
am personally responsible for dealing with the merits of Mr. 
Kelly's application for the crown's mercy.
<P>
	It is a responsibility I take very seriously. The process that has 
been in place since the day we received the application in early 
1994 has been monitored on a regular basis.

Representatives on my behalf attended at the police 
headquarters in Toronto to review the entire police file. We have 
taken the position with counsel for Mr. Kelly that we will 
disclose to him all of those records that are relevant to the issues 
raised in the application, and that will be done.

am monitoring this investigation. It is being conducted 
thoroughly and is entirely in accordance with reasonable time 
limits.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
interesting to note that there is not an independent inquiry in this 
case as suggested by the Marshall commission and, more 
important, that the key witness who said that she lied has never 
been interviewed.
<P>
	Where is the justice in this case?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney

objective analysis of the facts.
<P>
	It is easy to suggest, if one's only point of reference is reports 
in the media, that the witness who allegedly  recanted her 
testimony should by now have been interviewed. However, an 
acquaintance with the facts of this case would also lead one to 
conclude that before any such interview is carried out the

conference that she would set up an advisory committee of 
experts whose role would be, among other things, to determine 
whether some of the information on the blood supply system 
should be disclosed or not. She said that given the current level 
of interest in this matter, she had to decide whether not releasing 
some of the information was still in the public interest.
<P>

committee of experts to tell her what she should hide from the

<P>
	Could the minister tell this House today what the position of

<P>

in answer to the hon. member obviously this proposal submitted 
by CP is an unsolicited bid, as the hon. member would know. As 
I have indicated, we do not propose to respond to that bid in any 
hasty way. We are going to have it analysed very carefully.

	The whole question the hon. member raises with respect to the

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DEPARTMENTOFINDUSTRYACT">DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRY ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-46, an act to establish the Department of Industry and to 
amend and repeal certain other acts, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee; and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Beryl Gaffney (Nepean):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to stand in the House to speak to Bill C-46 respecting 
the Department of Industry Act.
<P>
	In the past few years the world economy has been undergoing 
tremendous change. This has resulted in tumultuous conditions 
for the Canadian economy and for Canadian workers. For too 
long Canadians have watched the industries that have 
underpinned our economy eroding while nothing has been 
growing in their place.
<P>
	Today 1.5 million Canadian workers are without jobs, 46 per 
cent of our citizens fear for the security of the jobs they hold, 
and for the first time in memory parents believe their children 
will have a lower standard of living than they themselves have 
enjoyed.
<P>
	Over the last six years I have met with far too many of my 
constituents from Nepean concerned about their future. They 
call me desperately seeking advice on where to find jobs and 
what to do to retrain themselves for the evolving information 
based economy.
<P>
	I have also received calls from entrepreneurs of small and 
medium sized businesses complaining about the lack of 
willingness on the part of banks to provide them with access to 
the capital they require to finance their enterprises. Let us not 
forget that small and medium sized businesses are the engines of 
growth in our economy.
<P>
	One key to success in the changing world economy will be our 
emphasis on research and development. The track records of 
previous governments in this regard have been dismal and we 
must reverse that trend.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6148"> 6148 </A></B>
<P>
	Nepean is the high tech capital of Canada. Research and 
development are particularly important to my Nepean riding 
which represents more than 100 high tech industries. Nepean is 
the home of Canada's largest research and development 
organization called Bell Northern Research. Others such as 
Northern Telecom, Computing Devices Canada and Gandalf are 
only four of a hundred companies working in the technological 
field and employing over 6,000 people.
<P>
	Co-operation and assistance from the federal government 
have been integral parts of their success. The continuation of 
their growth and the birth of innovative enterprises in the high 
tech field will hinge on the continuation and improvement of the 
assistance offered by the government.
<P>
	Canadians are looking to our government, not as a place to fall 
back on when they hit hard times but for leadership and 
direction, leadership predicated on development policies to lead 
Canadian workers, small and medium sized business and the 
high tech sector through these tough and changing times.
<P>
	This means getting our house in order and getting 
expenditures and deficits under control. It means seeking 
consensus from Canadians on our economic and social goals and 
aspirations. More important, it means the ability to encourage 
partnerships in a spirit of co-operation among industrialists, 
entrepreneurs, educators, scientists and all levels of government 
to meet those goals and aspirations.
<P>
	Bill C-46 is one of several steps taken by the government to 
chart a clear vision toward a renewed economy capable of 
providing wealth and prosperity for all Canadians into the 21st 
century. It recognizes that to achieve the goal of economic 
renewal the appropriate resources and energies of government 
must be marshalled in a coherent, efficient and effective way.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	The bill places in one organization under one minister the key 
functions necessary for economic renewal. The Department of 
Consumer and Corporate Affairs, the Department of 
Communications, Investment Canada and the Department of 
Industry, Science and Technology now become the Ministry of 
Industry.
<P>
	This will establish one minister, one deputy minister and one 
departmental team, all dedicated to the achievement of an 
innovative economy in Canada. At the same time it will provide 
a single forum, a single listening post and a single gathering 
place to collect all expressed interests and ideas from all parties 
concerned with creating a strong, vibrant economy.
<P>
	There is much greater opportunity under the organization 
provided by the bill to take the interests of various groups into 
account during the policy development stage. For example, by 
placing the responsibility for consumer and corporate affairs in 
the Department of Industry we have guaranteed that consumer 
voices will have a place around the table when  policies are 
established affecting the Canadian marketplace. This way 
consumer protection efforts can be focused on preventing 
problems rather than correcting them after the fact.
<P>
	As with consumer interests so it is with science and 
technology, with regional development and with small and 
medium sized business. All necessary voices will be heard as 
policies are being developed, as agreements are being 
negotiated and as decisions are being taken.
<P>
	This organization not only brings effectiveness and cohesion 
to government operations. It also seeks to bring about cost 
efficiency to government departments. In this era where every 
attempt must be made to reduce costs and maximize the 
efficiency of our resource utilization we cannot afford the waste 
that accompanies duplication and overlap in government 
functions.
<P>
	Bill C-46 reduces the numbers of teams from four to one. 
Overhead and support costs are reduced by eliminating the 
duplication involved in running four separate organizations. 
Internal communications are simplified. Direction and 
supervision are made more effective. Finally fewer committees 
are necessary.
<P>
	These kinds of streamlining and cost savings are what 
Canadians have been asking for. Under Bill C-46 small and 
medium sized business remain at the focal point of policy 
development. For example, with the Canadian Chamber of 
Commerce the government is exploring the feasibility of 
developing a business network strategy to set up some 30 
business networks to foster co-operation and collaboration 
among small and medium sized firms with common interests.
<P>
	This is good news for aspiring entrepreneurs in Canada and in 
my riding of Nepean. Underpinning our economic renewal 
efforts the government has recognized the importance of science 
and technology. This is good news for the city of Nepean and the 
high tech industry in Nepean.
<P>
	A major science and technology review is under way. This 
will ensure the $6 billion we spend in this area every year is 
producing maximum value in our efforts to institute an 
innovative economy.
<P>
	The government is listening to Canadians. It is prepared to 
take tough decisions to reduce or cut funding in programs that 
are not essential to economic renewal. We are interested in 
setting our house in order and reducing the burden of debt on 
Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	The government will not try to force economic growth by 
fertilizing it with massive sums of money we do not have. 
Instead Canadians can expect leadership and co-operation 
among the federal government and all interested groups 
necessary for the achievement of our reachable objective: the 
development of sustained growth and prosperity for all 
Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6149"> 6149 </A></B>
<P>
	Bill C-46 is merely one of many steps being proposed and 
followed by the government in achieving its number one goal of 
job creation. I commend the Minister of Industry for taking 
these steps. I support his steps. I wish him well and offer him my 
assistance in this and all future economic endeavours for this 
wonderful country of Canada.

<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for Nepean for her reasoned discourse 
this afternoon.
<P>
	I have a question concerning the program reviews currently 
under way. Why would we have the reorganization and the 
consolidation and then have a program review? Would it not 
make more sense to do the program review first and then 
consolidate on the basis of the review?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gaffney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question.
<P>
	That is probably a method that could be used, but I believe it 
was the government's and the Prime Minister's plan that when 
he formed the new Government of Canada it would be much 
easier for him to carry on with the reduction. It had already been 
put under way by the previous government and a lot of it was 
already in place. It was much easier for him to carry on with that 
reduction to the degree he has.
<P>
	Is it much easier for a government to continue on a plan of 
reduction if it starts out the term of its mandate not up here with 
40-some cabinet ministers but down here with 22 cabinet 
ministers and 22 government departments? Then if the need is 
there to build upon it, is it not a bit easier to build upon it if the 
need is there rather than start at the top and then have to start 
chopping back? The chopping back had already started before 
we ever took office as the Government of Canada.
<P>
	I believe it was the appropriate way to do it and I guess only 
time will tell.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to join in the debate on the reorganization of the 
department of industry, Bill C-46.
<P>
	I would like to take a moment to reflect on the nature of my 
riding of London-Middlesex and illustrate just how important 
the activities of the department are to my constituents.
<P>
	This area of small and medium sized business is a part of 
Ontario which is a leader in southwestern Ontario in that 
economic activity. Whether it is a business that is a spinoff of 
the automotive industry or whether it is the agri-food industry, 
London-Middlesex is one of the busiest areas of southwestern 
Ontario. It is a satellite of the agri-food industry in Middlesex 
county, one of the most productive agricultural counties in our 
part of Canada.
<P>
	There is a very wide variety of small and medium size 
business activities in the riding of London-Middlesex so the 
constituents are very interested in the proposed reorganization.
<P>
	As well I am pleased to represent a number of major 
corporations of national and international repute: General 
Motors Diesel of Canada, 3M Corporation and Cuddy Foods, to 
mention only three. In mentioning these three corporations one 
can easily recognize the scope of activities which take place in 
the riding of London-Middlesex. I say again it is with great 
interest my constituents hear of the proposed changes and await 
the reorganization of the department of industry.
<P>
	It is all too obvious that we have had an erosion of the 
Canadian economy. We know that on all sides of the House. We 
hear it daily. As well we should, because Canadians have a right 
to expect these important issues will be aired.
<P>
	The so-called corporate downsizing that has been taking 
place as part of global reorganization has caused a job crisis of 
major proportions in the country. Frankly my constituents feel 
the previous government was the government of the big 
corporations. It put all its eggs in that basket and now Canadians 
have paid the price in the last few years for that foolish approach 
to government.
<P>
	All too often small and medium sized businesses were 
ignored. This is simply the wrong way to go if we are going to 
pull out of this economic crisis.
<P>
	People well know the unemployment numbers and all too 
often we can disregard them as statistics. Day after day in my 
riding office like hon. members in all parts of the House I have 
seen the human face of unemployment, men and women young 
and old alike, highly educated and well trained, and those 
untrained and unskilled. Day after day the human face of 
unemployment has come into my riding office crying for some 
kind of help from the government. As a member of Parliament 
you wish you had a magic phone that you could pick up and 
instantly produce a job.
<P>

	This contact has served to reinforce the real need to 
concentrate on small and medium sized business. That is how we 
will get Canadians working again, not by following the agenda 
of the previous Tory government which all too often ignored 
these sectors of the economy and simply focused on corporate 
Canada.
<P>
	Canadians well know that we have been living beyond our 
means and that certainly includes government. Government has 
been part of the problem and it is high time we became part of 
the solution.
<P>
	No party in the House has a monopoly on knowing that the 
debt and deficit are major preoccupations of the citizens of 
Canada. If anyone listens even a little bit to the concerns of 
Canadians he or she knows it is right at the top of the list of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6150"> 6150 </A></B>
<P>
concerns. Indeed it dominated, as  well it should, much of the 
debate in the last federal election a year ago.
<P>
	One problem that needs to be addressed is the fact that so 
much of our debt is in the hands of foreigners. I was amazed in 
the campaign to not have this recognized by some of the 
opposition candidates. They simply felt debt was debt and that 
was all there was to it. Would that it were that simple, but it 
simply is not. It is a grave concern that so much of our 
indebtedness as a nation is to foreign nationals.
<P>
	The Liberal commitment in the red book and during the 
election campaign, endorsed from coast to coast to coast by 
Canadians, was a sensible, gradual approach to the reduction of 
the deficit to no more than 3 per cent of GDP by the end of our 
first term and then total elimination is the ultimate goal of the 
government.
<P>
	I heard a member opposite-I do not recall exactly who 
now-propose that somehow the government was going to lock 
in 3 per cent as its overall target and that simply is incorrect. My 
colleagues and I have heard time and again the hon. Minister of 
Finance speak to the fact that this is the interim goal of the 
Liberal government and that the ultimate goal would be to 
completely pull out of an indebtedness situation.
<P>
	How will we achieve such a goal? Obviously the first step is to 
reduce government spending. The right hon. Prime Minister has 
shown outstanding leadership in that regard in the few short 
months he has been the Prime Minister. He started with the size 
of the cabinet and scaled it away back from what was the 
situation previously. He also scaled back the size of ministerial 
offices.
<P>
	Perhaps huge amounts of money have not been saved but they 
are not insignificant millions either. However they set a tone 
that the government is prepared to lead by example in reducing 
spending.
<P>
	Concomitant with that is the need to encourage new jobs. If 
we are really going to pull out of the economic problems we face 
as a country we must get Canadians back to work. We must get 
them off the tax rolls and change them into taxpayers because 
they now have a meaningful and well-paying job.
<P>
	This two-pronged approach of the Liberal government was 
endorsed nationally in the last federal election campaign. I am 
proud to be a member who is helping to advance that agenda.
<P>
	It was no mean consideration recently when London, Ontario 
was awarded the Institute of Advanced Manufacturing 
Technology. This will be a very important organization to 
London and to southwestern Ontario. It will help co-ordinate 
the activities of the private sector, of the University of Western 
Ontario in London, of the city council and indeed of the 
surrounding areas of southwestern Ontario with the federal 
government. This is the kind of partnership that is necessary if 
we are to move forward into the new economy and start to get 
Canadians working again.
<P>
	The question needs to be posed: What is the proper role of 
government in this new economy? One only needs to reflect to 
know that there are several shades of opinion on this question. 
From some parts of the House we hear the socialist point of view 
that the government should do everything. The government 
should run the economy, it should own it, and there is no place 
for the private sector because all it will do is hoard the profits. I 
reject that view. Liberals reject that view.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	Equally we have the view at the far right which says that 
governments should do nothing, that there is no place for 
government. It is the other extreme. I equally and even more 
forcefully reject that view. One might say that in this House 
today we have perhaps the most conservative of the 
conservatives with the view that there really is no role to be 
played by government.
<P>
	I hope that no one party embraces that philosophy but I hear 
that view from certain members opposite so often I have become 
concerned. Surely they cannot feel there is no role for 
government in running the economy of this nation. To the 
contrary the Liberal view is that there must be a balanced 
approach.
<P>
	There must be and there is a role for government to play in 
partnership with the private sector. The private sector is the 
engine, as it must be, but there will be a positive role for 
government to play in creating the proper environment for the 
private sector to succeed. Only a balanced common sense 
approach best enunciated by the Liberal Party throughout the 
history of this country will ensure fair and equitable treatment in 
our economy.
<P>
	I see that my time is coming to an end. I would simply say that 
as a member of the Liberal Party it will be my pleasure to do 
everything possible to help advance a balanced approach to this 
economic situation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> Mr. Speaker, when I spoke 
last week on the criminal justice Bill C-41, I suggested that 
perhaps some of the Liberal members of the frontbench required 
some Q-tips because they were having a little difficulty hearing. 
I can see that the problem extends past the front bench.
<P>
	I would like to know when the member ever heard somebody 
from my party suggest that the government should do nothing? 
That is a very gross misunderstanding of what seemed to be a 
very clear way of expressing ourselves.
<P>
	Because social spending in Canada currently consumes $53 
billion a year which is over 50 per cent of our current 
expenditures, would he agree that the direction the Reform Party 
wants to go, which is to focus social spending on those who are 
most in need to make sure that those in our society who are the 
most 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6151"> 6151 </A></B>
<P>
dependent on that kind of support, are in fact expounding the 
correct way to go which is to focus social spending?
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to receive a 
question from the hon. member. I would say in response to his 
first comment that I am reminded of the statement that if the 
shoe fits, wear it. I challenge my friend to find in <I>Hansard</I> or 
even in the ``blues'' which will be out shortly that I named the 
Reform Party as saying that governments should do nothing.
<P>
	What I said was that some hon. members opposite-there are 
at least four political philosophies opposite-quite often 
espouse the idea that government must get out of the way, that it 
has no role to play. However, if my friend finds that my 
comments were appropriate to the philosophy of the Reform 
Party, I will not disagree with him.
<P>
	On his question of the focus of spending and social services, I 
agree that we need to focus spending on social services. Where I 
differ with my friend and his party, as I understand their 
philosophy, is we will never eliminate the universality of our 
programs. The minute you start to say that targeting means we 
will eliminate universality we will start to fool with the other 
underpinnings of our social security system and the whole thing 
is in risk of collapsing. We have to focus it and keep it fair and 
available to all Canadians who need it without going to the far 
extreme.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi):</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not hear 
the hon. member responsible for regional development in 
Ontario and Quebec. I would have liked to hear him, because 
this is a section where, in my opinion, we could have avoided 
some overlapping.
<P>
	Regarding subclause 8(a) in Part II, I would like to ask the 
hon. member why the government did not give exclusive 
authority, either in Quebec or in Ontario, over regional 
economic development to already existing structures such as the 
FORD?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was not elected to come to this 
House to speak exclusively for the views of Ontario, let alone 
the views of the province of Quebec. That may be the agenda of 
my friend and his colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois but it is not 
the agenda of the only truly national party in the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	While I understand my colleague's concerns for the people of 
Quebec and while I understand his preoccupation with 
manpower training, I can only assure him that the government is 
equally concerned in making sure that all Quebecers understand. 
We did not get to be the best country in the world by not 
addressing all the concerns of Canadians. We will continue to do 
that, including all the people of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Time is up. Resuming debate. It is one 
of the hon. member's own members who is going to speak on 
debate. I am sure he does not want to deprive him of that 
opportunity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak on this bill to create the Department of 
Industry.
<P>
	I would like to open with a brief outline of Reform's position 
on economic reform, industrial development and 
diversification, and how this bill measures up to our vision of 
the role to be played by the government as well as to comment on 
the potential for reducing government size and increasing 
efficiency.
<P>
	Dealing first with the objective of reduced cost in improved 
efficiency, if these were objectives, I do not see any significant 
measures to support any meaningful move in this direction.
<P>
	When one looks at the figures quoted to us at the briefing for 
this bill, from a budget of some $3 billion and a staff of some 
6,000, the government is only able to save some 230 jobs and 
$26 million. When one looks at these figures against the 
potential, it shows very clearly that efficiency and cost 
reduction were not achieved.
<P>
	With the bringing together of four departments with some 
overlap in duties and responsibilities, the potential was there to 
reduce the payroll by a greater number and certainly save 
considerably more tax dollars.
<P>
	When one compares this to what is going on in the private 
sector in the name of survival, nothing has been done. The 
message that the private sector heard three years ago about 
lowering costs and improving efficiency still apparently has not 
reached the federal government. I do not think that message will 
be lost on industry when this bill goes forward.
<P>
	Let us look at the Reform vision of economic reform using 
some bold brush strokes. We believe an environment to 
encourage enterprise and initiative should be created by 
government. There should be productive jobs and prosperity. It 
is best achieved by a responsible, broadly based, free enterprise 
economy in which private property, freedom of contract and the 
operating of free markets are encouraged and respected.
<P>
	We want to minimize politics in economic decision making by 
the phasing out of grants, subsidies and lending programs. Let 
us break down the barriers designed to insulate our businesses 
and industry from domestic and foreign competition. 
Competition is healthy and should be encouraged. Of course, we 
should 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6152"> 6152 </A></B>
<P>
come down hard on enforcement of competition and 
anti-combines legislation with severe penalties for price fixing, 
certainly the removal of interprovincial trade barriers so that we 
can maximize the benefits of free trade and NAFTA.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	In examining this bill I decided to look at the Liberal red book 
and determine whether or not the act meets red book promises. 
One of the first statements made in the red book section on the 
economy is that the former Conservative government ``failed to 
understand that government has an important role to play in 
setting the stage and enabling the private sector to adjust to 
changing circumstances. For this reason our competitive 
position and our standard of living have declined and jobs are 
lost''.
<P>
	Of course if this statement is true, then this Liberal 
government is doomed to fail as well because this act which sets 
the stage for the Liberal attempt at industrial central planning 
enshrines in law exactly the same department the Conservatives 
introduced under Kim Campbell. There is no excuse at this time 
for the government not to have come up with an act creating a 
smaller, leaner and more efficient department which would have 
set the economy on a new course. This government is almost a 
quarter of the way through its mandate, yet it is still relying on 
the failed Conservative policies of the past.
<P>
	What else did the Liberals say in their red book? They said: 
``Any strategy to foster the growth of a small and medium sized 
business sector will fail if it does not recognize the negative 
impacts of excessive government debt, interprovincial trade 
barriers, and taxation''. I agree 100 per cent, but I fail to see how 
this act to enshrine the industry department created by the 
former Conservative regime will help to achieve that goal.
<P>
	It is clear the rationalization of the four agencies and 
departments into one should have achieved some efficiencies 
but it appears this did not happen. Staff levels fell less than 4 per 
cent and spending was cut less than 3 per cent.
<P>
	As I said, I agree with the red book assertion that debt, trade 
barriers, and taxation are big negatives in our economy. The 
minister achieved some gains in his recent attempts to reduce 
interprovincial trade barriers but I would remind him that much 
work needs to be done to remove more barriers that are still 
remaining.
<P>
	In a widely quoted study done by the Canadian 
Manufacturers' Association, those interprovincial provincial 
trade barriers are costing us approximately $6.5 billion. The 
Macdonald commission of the mid-1980s estimated that 
Canadian incomes would rise some 1.5 per cent permanently if 
barriers were removed.
<P>
	In my own riding of Simcoe Centre there is a brewery which 
can freely export to 50 American states yet cannot send its 
products to the provinces next door.
<P>
	There is another major consideration that this government has 
failed to deal with. We have unprecedented deficit and debt 
levels yet this act, which reorganizes the department according 
to a Conservative plan, fails to achieve any meaningful saving of 
tax dollars.
<P>
	Certainly taxes are too high. They discourage new domestic 
and foreign investment and they drive Canadian businesses to 
more reasonable tax jurisdictions. I realize that tax relief for 
Canadian businesses is still a long way off because of a deficit 
based on excessive government spending but I believe that long 
term tax relief should be a stated goal of any federal government 
industrial strategy.
<P>
	Where could these efficiencies have been obtained? Are there 
areas of spending and staffing which are of no consequence in 
our new global economy?
<P>
	Investment Canada is an organization whose consequence I 
would question as its mandate seems to have been to protect 
Canadian businesses from foreign control. What that threat from 
foreign control was, nobody seems to know. Foreign investment 
is clearly not perceived as a threat any more because even 
Investment Canada seems to approve every investment made. I 
question whether we need to continue to rubber stamp this 
rubber stamping body any further.
<P>
	We need to encourage competition in our banking industry. 
Too much power is held by too few banks.
<P>
	The defence industry productivity program is another area of 
spending which we should question. In the government's bid to 
centrally plan the economy this is an obvious attempt to favour 
one industry over others. To be clearer on this point it must be 
recognized that the funding for DIPP came from taxes imposed 
on other businesses and industries. I question whether the $158 
million given away in 1994 under this program would have been 
better left in the pockets of the taxpayers who are currently 
financing this scheme.
<P>
	I question the consequence of spending tax dollars to improve 
the image of high technology firms. Surely we are misguided if 
we believe that image is what sells Canadian high technology to 
Asia-Pacific countries. I believe the quality of our products is 
our greatest selling point. This is based on such fundamentals as 
research and development.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	I also question why in 1994 the Department of Industry is still 
treating one group of Canadians as though it were different from 
all other Canadians. Why does this government continue to 
single out one group of Canadians for special treatment? This 
patronizing action should be reversed.
<P>
	I question the consequences of the complicated university 
research granting process. Why do we need so many different 
granting councils with their different regulations and the 
attendant bureaucracy behind each one? Surely this is an area 
where 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6153"> 6153 </A></B>
<P>
rationalization can  occur and efficiencies indeed can result. 
This is an obvious area for the government to find savings of tax 
dollars.
<P>
	We should examine the whole grants and contributions 
program. What real benefit does the Canadian economy derive 
from the $63,000 given to the Shoe Manufacturers Association? 
In favouring de Havilland by $10 million over McDonnell 
Douglas are we creating inequities in the aerospace industry? Is 
it not now time to embark on a new direction where we will treat 
all peoples, regions and industries equally?
<P>
	Our starting point in making changes should be to place our 
top priority on reducing government spending while increasing 
government efficiency. When industries are asked what 
government can do to help them the response I have heard most 
often is: ``Get off our backs and out of our pockets''.
<P>
	Bill C-46 is a small step, too small, on the road to reducing 
government spending so that taxes can be lowered, which will 
improve the ability of our industries to compete and grow in this 
global economy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> I listened carefully to the member for Simcoe 
Centre. I appreciate the member has recognized this bill as a step 
in the right direction. He has also recognized the work which had 
to be done to date on interprovincial trade barriers as being a 
step in the right direction. What puzzles me about the hon. 
member's remarks is his failure to recognize the very special 
emphasis the government has given to small business and the 
tourism sector.
<P>
	The member comes from one of the most beautiful 
communities in all of Canada. I know that riding depends 
heavily on a tourism thrust and attention to that sector. Is the 
member suggesting that area as one where we would further 
diminish our participation, or would he suggest that we 
reinvigorate that sector? I am trying to understand what the 
member is saying in the sense that we have gone in the right 
direction but not far enough. I happen to believe that we should 
reinvigorate an area like tourism because that is a way we can 
get people back to work right away.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
member for Broadview-Greenwood for his question. I applaud 
some of the steps taken by the government because they were 
steps in the right direction, but I make the point that they are 
small steps and the time is long past for small steps.
<P>
	This country is in serious difficulty today and it calls for big 
steps. It calls for action against the deficit and the debt. You 
cannot jump a huge crevasse in small steps; it takes one giant 
leap. That is what is lacking in what is coming forward from the 
other side.
<P>
	Small business is not looking for government intervention. 
The best thing government can do for small business is to get out 
of their way. Get off their backs as they said and out of their 
pockets and the pockets of their customers. Then there will be 
more disposable income which will generate the business which 
will create the jobs, but that is not happening.
<P>
	Small businessmen are being taxed to death. They are asking 
what is being done to get this tax load under control. The only 
way to do that is to get government spending under control. I 
was looking for some spending cuts in this bill but they are not 
there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Tourism?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Tourism is very important in 
my area. Anything that can be done in tourism is certainly going 
to be appreciated in Simcoe Centre. However the importance of 
doing something about reducing government spending and 
getting it under control is paramount to tourism, small business, 
large business. It is not being addressed in this bill, nor is it 
being addressed in many of the things the government is doing at 
this point.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I believe I understood the hon. member correctly when 
he indicated if he had undertaken this legislation it would have 
ended up much smaller, much leaner and much less costly than it 
is. He gave as examples Investment Canada and the defence 
industry productivity program which he thought should have 
been looked at.
<P>
	Is the member saying that Investment Canada and the defence 
industry productivity program would have been cut out along 
with the other examples he gave, or would he simply look at 
them? That is my first question.
<P>
	Second, because he did state initially that it would have been 
much neater, much smaller, much less costly, could he give 
specifics? How much leaner? How much smaller? How much 
less costly? Could we have specifics please?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, obviously 
government members do not have the answers and are coming to 
Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition for them.
<P>
	If I were running a corporation of 6,000 employees with a 
budget of $3 billion and my back was to the wall and I had to 
effect some cost savings-and I suggest our backs are to the wall 
right now-230 employees out of 6,000 is a drop in the bucket. 
That is not really an attack, if it was intended to be an attack, at 
getting the spending and efficiencies under control. I would cut 
jobs. We would have to cut back.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> What sector, small business, tourism?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6154"> 6154 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> No. It is called efficiency of 
operation. If that was the purpose of the exercise then it was not 
achieved. It is a long way from being achieved. The dollars and 
the jobs that are being saved will have no real impact on doing 
something about the deficit and the debt that everyone says they 
are concerned about but they do nothing about.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to speak on Bill C-46, the Department of Industry Act.
<P>
	Bill C-46 creates a remarkable organization with wide 
ranging responsibilities and a far reaching mandate. There are 
many tasks in the government's agenda for growth and job 
creation that it will perform. Not the least of these is the slate of 
initiatives the Prime Minister announced to the Canadian 
Chamber of Commerce in Quebec City on September 18, 
namely: to improve the climate for entrepreneurship; to help 
business profit from new technologies; to seek expanding 
markets; and to promote the tourism industry that is so 
important in Halifax West and throughout the maritimes.
<P>
	The successful pursuit of that agenda requires a concerted 
effort of all major players in the economic development game. 
The Department of Industry created by this bill is well designed 
to rally that kind of effort. Incorporating within one 
organization the very functions of industry, technology, science, 
communications, foreign investment, and consumer and 
corporate affairs permits a powerful focus of related interests in 
the formulation and implementation of our economic 
development strategies. Some may fear that this new 
department will not do as much in individual areas like 
communications, corporate affairs or consumer affairs as under 
the old setup. An impression of that sort is just that first and last, 
a mere impression.
<P>
	While titles are important symbolically, they must not be 
mistaken for substance. Bill C-46 could not possibly include the 
names of all the functions in its title. In substance we do have a 
department of industry, science, technology, communications, 
investment, and consumer and corporate affairs. To include all 
of its concerns we would have to add small and medium sized 
enterprises, tourism, sustainable development and many other 
areas. These are all key functions in the pursuit of an innovative 
economy and in the pursuit of growth and job creation.
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	However the essence of the this new department is not found 
in the title. We have a Department of Industry. What does that 
name symbolize? Industry is not merely heavy industry nor 
manufacturing. Industry is whatever provides wealth and 
well-being in our society. Teachers, accountants and fishers are 
as much an essential part of industry in this country as 
employers, for example Litton, Pratt and Whitney, Farmers 
Co-operative Dairy and Dynatek in my riding.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We have to consider the interests of consumers as well. We 
want to give Canadian consumers the assurance that although 
the word ``consumer'' does not appear in the department's new 
title, their interests are still central to the concerns of the 
Department of Industry.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Many of us will recall when the federal government in the 
seventies decided to create the Department of Consumer and 
Corporate Affairs. Many will recall there was much concern that 
putting the affairs of consumers under the same roof as 
corporations was a bit like putting the chickens in with the 
foxes. Those fears proved groundless, as we well know.
<P>
	In retrospect it was wise to incorporate the concern for 
consumer interests into policies and decisions affecting 
corporations. It is now recognized by governments and 
corporations more and more that attention to consumer interests 
must underpin sound corporate strategies. Increased consumer 
awareness, increasing competition and the relentless demand 
for ever higher quality of goods and services are leading 
businesses in the direction of more attention to consumer needs 
and consumer service.
<P>
	This bill on the Department of Industry is built on that 
principle of common interest. The bill extends the same logic to 
the consideration of all economic development strategies.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	By making the Department of Industry responsible for 
consumer policy, the government guarantees that the voice of 
consumers will be heard and considered when policies affecting 
the Canadian market are discussed in cabinet.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Minister of Industry has a clear mandate to act as the 
advocate for consumer issues at the cabinet table. To do that 
effectively he has to seek input of consumers and advocacy 
groups across the country on all issues affecting growth. The 
Consumers Association of Canada for example plays a strong 
leadership role in consumer education and in raising concerns 
about products.
<P>
	With advancing technology, consumer issues are becoming 
ever more complex. Issues like the access and cost for 
consumers to the information highway, the protection of 
privacy, electronic funds transfer, and biotechnology and 
genetic engineering are all new complex issues that require 
close examination from the point of view of consumer interest.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6155"> 6155 </A></B>
<P>
	In the light of these complex issues an integrated process is 
needed to ensure that consumer concerns are incorporated as 
early as possible in policy development. In this way consumer 
protection efforts can focus on preventing problems before they 
happen instead of exposing them after the fact.
<P>
	The government's priority is growth and job creation, but 
these goals must depend on efficiently functioning markets. Our 
consumers share with the business world a common interest in 
achieving that kind of efficiency. Both should welcome 
initiatives that help our businesses to be more efficient, 
effective and competitive.
<P>
	The recently announced internal trade agreement which will 
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of trade in goods and 
services and the movement of people among provinces and 
territories will save businesses and governments millions of 
dollars. It is good for consumers.
<P>
	All of us who take part in the economy have an interest in the 
actions of government directed toward consumer protection and 
promotion of competition. These actions not only right wrongs, 
they also enhance our overall economic performance.
<P>
	We should all be glad the twin pillars of consumer and 
corporate affairs are under the same roof at Industry Canada. 
This bill in my view is well designed to help guide the efforts of 
Team Canada. I recommend its speedy approval.
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
again commend the member for Halifax West for his comments.
<P>
	I recognize the hon. member for Halifax West did not make 
these comments, but being from the same party as the member 
who did earlier that member had difficulty finding the 
appropriate role of government in business. He did not like too 
little and of course did not like too much. What would the hon. 
member say is the appropriate role for government in the 
business affairs of the nation?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Regan:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a real challenge, as the hon. 
member knows, to define exactly in a few words or a few 
moments what the role of government is in our economy because 
it is a complex question. Certainly my view would probably be 
for a little bit more involvement than his view. My view would 
be that government has a very important role in terms of 
consumer protection. I do not know if he would put the same 
emphasis or as much effort in that regard as I would, but that is 
for him to answer I suppose. However, it seems to me that is an 
important consideration.
<P>
	In Atlantic Canada there is a need for government 
involvement. There is a need for investment capital. There is a 
great problem in Atlantic Canada with the lack of that kind of 
capital. Many business people come to me with the problem of 
getting capital to expand their businesses. Those businesses are 
doing well but they  cannot quite get to the next level and cannot 
find the capital in Atlantic Canada to expand.
<P>
	That is why agencies like ACOA which provides about 40 per 
cent of the business financing in Atlantic Canada are so 
important. In fact overall it has been very successful. We do hear 
about the failures which are sensationalized by the media, but 
the large majority of its programs and efforts in creating jobs 
and assisting businesses to expand and create more jobs have 
been very successful.
<P>
	I gather sometimes there is the impression in the rest of 
Canada that all we do in Atlantic Canada is fish or collect 
unemployment and that is a great myth. It certainly is untrue in 
my riding where there are many businesses and people are hard 
at work doing a variety of things. Things are being done for 
example in high technology at Dynatek which produces 
computer memory systems. Pratt and Whitney produces some of 
the best aircraft jet engines in the world. There are Litton 
Systems and Farmers Co-operative Dairy and many others. 
People are working hard.
<P>
	I agree that government cannot be the one to create the jobs. It 
is absolutely true that we have to rely on the private sector to do 
the main job creation. I also agree we have to make efforts and 
we have to reduce our debts so we can get off their backs, but we 
cannot do it overnight.
<P>
	At the same time there is still a role for government to assist 
those companies in areas like R and D and international 
information. We receive information from our embassies about 
what is happening overseas, what opportunities are available for 
our companies elsewhere. There are many roles government can 
play.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to ask 
the hon. member a question concerning the role of government. 
He mentioned Pratt and Whitney in his constituency. Pratt and 
Whitney is also in my constituency. It received a loan guarantee 
of $50 million to come into the city of Lethbridge.
<P>
	Would the member and the government support that kind of a 
government policy in terms of loan guarantees to encourage 
industries to locate in a variety of areas in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Regan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to tell the hon. member 
that I certainly prefer it to grants. I am concerned about that size 
of a guarantee. I think we should see companies locating where 
they think is best.
<P>
	Companies are coming to Nova Scotia. People like the quality 
of life we provide. They do not like having to sit in traffic for 
four hours on the 401 into Toronto, or what have you. 
Companies are coming for reasons other than government 
assistance. In fact we are seeing that governments at all levels 
are finding it harder to provide that kind of incentive.
<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria-Haliburton):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome the opportunity to speak on Bill  C-46. I commend the 
member for Broadview-Greenwood for sitting here all day and 
listening to some of the great doomsday scenarios that have 
fallen on him from the opposition and also some of the points 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6156"> 6156 </A></B>
<P>
which have been made from this side of the House and from 
Liberal members on the other side of the House.
<P>
	Bill C-46 is one I have looked forward to debating. Anything 
that will streamline the operation of a government department 
and make it more clear to carry out its mandate is welcomed.
<P>
	In particular I look at the improved business climate for 
entrepreneurs and the promotion of the tourism industry. The 
member for Broadview-Greenwood and I among other 
members have sat and talked in many long meetings about how 
to reinvent tourism in Canada. In the last 10 years the previous 
government almost eliminated tourism totally.
<P>
	As a private individual I watched the bottom fall out of the 
real estate industry in Ontario, where a person's cottage all of a 
sudden was not worth anything or there was no market for it. I 
saw that and hoped that somewhere, some way this government I 
was elected to would take some initiative and try to re-establish 
some of the important sectors of our society. That is done with 
bills such as Bill C-46 which include provisions of the old act 
and yet become something new.
<P>
	In the last 10 years there has certainly been a great decline in 
the initiative of entrepreneurs and people who are willing to 
come forward to finance small business, of which I was a part. I 
look at anything that will make that a clearer mandate or an 
easier path to follow, anything that will establish rules and say 
that yes, we do want to take a positive step in streamlining 
legislation. I speak to it for that reason and I look forward to the 
passage of the bill.
<P>
	Victoria-Haliburton region has lost a tremendous number of 
jobs. Victoria-Haliburton is in Ontario; it is not in Victoria and 
it is not on the east coast. I do not speak as a person who has had 
the advantage of the financing of the east coast entrepreneurs. 
Ontario, particularly the central part where I am from, relies 
more on people in private industry to provide initiative.
<P>
	In the last two years, for example, there has been almost 30 
per cent constant unemployment in Haliburton county. The 
county is almost devastated. It swells the rolls of the number of 
people needed to administer the social assistance plan. It does 
not help anyone's self worth. It does not help anyone try to do 
anything.
<P>
	I look at the tremendous loss since 1988 in Victoria county, 
the 2,400 jobs that were taken from there and I remember 
reading some of the articles by the member for 
Broadview-Greenwood at that time. He wrote about the things 
that could happen. He thought the branch plant economy was 
going to disappear, and it happened. Jobs were lost. This 
government has to take the initiative,  has to go ahead and make 
the changes we need and that we believe will turn around that 
loss of jobs.
<P>
	It will come through tourism in my riding. I hope it will come 
through other things and I will certainly work as hard as I can to 
bring industry and commerce to the most beautiful part of 
Ontario. I do not mean to speak disparagingly about any other 
part of Ontario; it just so happens that I do live in an area where 
the Kawartha Lakes depend on the rejuvenation of the tourism 
industry.
<P>
	People ask how you service a riding of 10,460 square 
kilometres, 35 municipalities which take in a lot of 
Peterborough county and a lot of areas which should be in other 
ridings. Redistribution has given me areas of Brock township 
where I deal with boaters on Lake Simcoe, all the way through 
the Trent canal system right to the side of the city of 
Peterborough where that riding is looked after by another 
Liberal member. If you are in Ontario and you guess that anyone 
is a Liberal you are probably right 99 per cent of the time.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	When we deal with the Haliburton County Lakes, the 
Kawartha Lakes and the Trent-Severn waterway, the Rideau 
system that connects to it, look at how that has been decimated. 
The Trent-Severn waterway and the Rideau waterway were even 
offered to the provincial governments to see if they would 
promote them and they turned it down. At one time the 
Government of Ontario did a large job in promoting tourism in 
Ontario and now its budget has gone the other way and it sees no 
benefits to tourism. It indicated that tourism is not something it 
wants to get involved in.
<P>
	The federal government has to step in and provide some 
leadership in promoting tourism, not only in Ontario but in all of 
Canada as Canada is obviously the best country in the world to 
live in. It has been written. People all over the world have 
commented that they would love to live in Canada, as we can tell 
by the number of people who apply.
<P>
	As I watch the vestiges of the last government being taken 
apart by this government in a slow orderly fashion to try to 
promote and better the lifestyle of people in Canada through the 
promotion of streamlining of government and changing the 
system, it is hard for me to listen to the opposition. I know it is 
paid well to oppose and I know its opposition sometimes is 
well-meaning and I know also that some of its members 
probably have some good ideas and I am very anxious to hear 
what they are.
<P>
	None of them has come forward yet with the changes to any of 
this legislation that has been proposed. I was looking forward to 
seeing if there was some concrete results that would come out of 
the opposition's chance to change and refine and turn this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6157"> 6157 </A></B>
<P>
legislation into something it feels is better than what is being 
offered.
<P>
	I feel what is being offered is once again a step in the right 
direction and will cause the rejuvenation of the department and 
in particular the slow and steady step of a government that is in 
control, that is going to turn the economy around. It is not going 
to do it by trying to jump over some huge gorge that has been 
mentioned. It is going to do it one step at a time, in an orderly 
fashion, looking at the various things affected by government 
change, taking into account all the municipalities that are 
involved, all of the various agencies affected by it and hopefully 
come out with a clear mandate for making this country the place 
we all want it to be, a better place to live.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to thank my colleague for his excellent remarks and I 
would like to add a little to them and perhaps get a comment 
from him.
<P>
	I wonder if he would agree that the incentives for tourism are 
something that apply to this country nationally and are as 
relevant and advantageous not only to the country at large but to 
the country in its parts, to the west, represented by the Reform 
Party opposite and also to Quebec, represented by the Bloc 
Quebecois.
<P>
	Does my colleague not agree that this kind of incentive for 
national tourism is something that is very good for Canada and 
for national unity?
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Reilly:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for the 
question.
<P>
	I find it hard to change from my thinking. Quebec is a 
province in my country and when I go to Quebec I try to speak 
French. I try to converse with the people there and I certainly 
hope that their culture will be maintained.
<P>
<B>(1620 ) </B>
<P>
	I see nothing wrong with that. That is commendable. I am of 
Irish Canadian heritage but I have to tell members that my 
mother was born in Birmingham, England. I also have an 
affection for the English. I have to be very careful with that, too.
<P>
	I have travelled across Canada many times. I have been on the 
east coast and I have been on the west coast. There are some 
beautiful mountain ranges on the west coast, the fishing 
industry. Who could find anything more beautiful than Long 
Beach on the island, the beautiful Tofino and some of the places 
over there? The member obviously is from there and knows what 
I am talking about. I keep getting accused of being from 
Victoria.
<P>
	As a government we have to promote all of Canada, Canada as 
a whole, as the best country in the world. When one goes into 
Quebec, one has to enjoy the cultural heritage and the beauty of 
Quebec as I do. There are no nicer regions to be in. There is 
skiing at beautiful Mont Ste. Anne, not to put down any other 
areas of Quebec.
<P>
	One can go up the autoroute above Montreal and find some 
beautiful country. Even La Prairie as my friend has pointed out 
is also a beautiful area of the country.
<P>
	When one promotes the prairies and shows tourists what is in 
the prairies, what is in the Northwest Territories, when one 
offers train packages from sea to sea to sea, when one takes this 
country as a whole and tries to sell it, being a salesman would be 
the easiest job in the world.
<P>
	It is such an area, such a culture, such a diversity that I could 
expand upon that part and talk about our great country. I 
consider Quebec part of my country. I consider New Brunswick 
as part of my country along with Manitoba and the Northwest 
Territories. All that beautiful country is what makes Canada 
such a great place.
<P>
	I am very proud to stand up and say that I am a Canadian. I am 
from Ontario but you cannot be perfect. It is as close as you can 
get.
<P>
	As the Speaker has indicated, my time is almost up. I have 
complimented everyone in the House and that is what I meant to 
do. I want to fight for a promotion of tourism in Canada as a 
whole and each individual component has its own strength that 
draws from the promotion of Canada as a country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome the opportunity to take part in this debate as the 
member for Richmond-Wolfe and official critic for regional 
development. As such, it is my privilege to second the motion by 
my colleague from Trois-Rivières that we refrain from 
supporting second reading of the bill because it does not stop 
program duplication and overlap and fails to recognize that 
Quebec alone is responsible for its regional development.
<P>
	Bill C-46, an act to establish the Department of Industry, 
does, I must admit, reflect some desire on the part of the 
government to rationalize its operations. It is also interesting to 
see that the Department of Industry is given a legislative 
mandate and that the legislation defining the former Department 
of Industry, Science and Technology and Investment Canada has 
been amalgamated with the legislation to establish the 
Department of Industry.
<P>
	However, I was astonished to see that in Part II of the bill, the 
minister's powers also extend to regional development in 
Ontario and Quebec. The Bloc Quebecois is strenuously 
opposed to this centralizing action by the federal government. 
We emphatically disagree with the new powers and 
responsibility of the Department of Industry to formulate and 
implement policies, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6158"> 6158 </A></B>
<P>
plans and integrated federal approaches with respect to regional 
development in Quebec, as indicated in section 9<I>(a)</I>.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	We also decry the powers enabling the minister to lead and 
co-ordinate the activities of the Government of Canada in the 
establishment of co-operative relationships with Ontario and 
Quebec and with business, labour and other public and private 
bodies as stipulated under clause 9(1)(c). By passing and 
implementing this bill respecting the Department of Industry, 
the Liberal government is flying in the face of Quebec's 
fundamental claim to manage its own development.
<P>
	I would remind the members of this House that regional 
economic development is a residual jurisdiction and therefore 
not enshrined in the Constitution. Because of its power 
respecting economic planning, Quebec is demanding exclusive 
authority in this area. Ever since the Quiet Revolution, we deem 
the federal government's infringement in this jurisdiction that is 
exclusive to Quebec to be totally unacceptable and 
inadmissible.
<P>
	The Liberal government must withdraw from this sphere of 
action and transfer to Quebec regional development funding in a 
fair and equitable manner. The sterile competition between 
Quebec and Ottawa regarding regional development and the 
policies of the Federal Office of Regional Development are 
costly, as you know, and result in overlapping due to the 
duplication of decision-making centres.
<P>
	This maze of jurisdictions consumes so much energy that 
none is left to deal with the real problems. In the meantime, the 
money does not go where it should. There is an obvious 
contradiction in the claim by the Liberal government to the 
effect that it wants to eliminate overlapping while it makes sure 
with this bill that overlapping will continue to exist.
<P>
	Regional economic development is an area which the federal 
government has taken over through its spending power, without 
taking into account Quebec's desire to take full responsibility 
for it. To conclude, I will say that I support and second the 
motion by my colleague from Trois-Rivières denouncing 
federal involvement in Quebec's regional development.
<P>
	I would like to take advantage of the few minutes allotted to 
me in this debate to raise two basic points which are particularly 
relevant to the dynamics of regional development in Quebec. 
Let us first review briefly the federal involvement in regional 
development in that province. I will then deal in greater detail 
with the Quebec regional development policies which are 
clearly superior to any other policy developed elsewhere in 
Canada in that respect, this being said without false modesty.
<P>
	As the Bloc Quebecois critic for regional development, I ask 
this House the following question: what has the federal 
government accomplished in this respect? Between 1982 and 
1987, DRIE, the Department of Regional Industrial Expansion, 
the federal agency responsible for regional development in 
Quebec adopted a sterile centralizing policy.
<P>
	The regions were simply excluded from the financial 
assistance application development and evaluation process. 
Often, useless programs were subsidized, while initiatives 
having meaningful local value were not. The DREI 
decision-making process was dominated by sectorial concerns, 
with the result that more funds and energy were devoted to 
industrial development in central regions than to regional 
development.
<P>
	When this became obvious, the federal government claims it 
reoriented its policy through a new strategy based on master 
agreements. This course of action proved no better than the 
previous one. Our unemployment rates bear witness to that. 
According to the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, in 
1993, unemployment cost the Canadian economy over $109 
billion. That is what the federal government involvement in the 
area of regional development has accomplished.
<P>
	Let us take a look at what the master agreements do. Instead of 
giving the regional development resource envelopes directly to 
Quebec, allowing for income tax points to be repatriated, the 
federal government withdraws and cuts back budgets to such an 
extent that a structural vacuum is created with respect to 
regional development in Quebec. The Economic and Regional 
Development Agreement, or ERDA, for the 1994-2004 decade 
proves the point. It has not yet been signed and will apparently 
never be.
<P>
	Last summer, the Federal Office of Regional Development for 
Quebec refused to sign the agreement, arguing that the time was 
not right in view of the upcoming elections in Quebec and 
considering it had signed an agreement respecting the free 
movement of goods between provinces the same week. Too 
much work for the same people in one week. That is how serious 
FORD is in Quebec; it only brings confusion to Quebec regional 
development.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	The FORD structure has been impossible to define ever since 
it was founded. It is always being reorganized. In short, it is like 
Jell-O. Now that the ERDA is no longer in effect, we are facing a 
structural vacuum. It would be very effective and much more 
serious for the Liberal government to recognize Quebec's 
jurisdiction over regional development. Accordingly, the 
government should transfer all monies set aside for this purpose.
<P>
	It would be in the federal government's interest to admit that 
its involvement in regional development is unacceptable. The 
economic foundation of outlying regions-and they are 
different from major centres-is decaying, the social fabric is 
disintegrating, the rural exodus is continuing and young people 
are the first to leave their regions. The number of 
demographically shrinking municipalities has risen alarmingly 
in the last 25 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6159"> 6159 </A></B>
<P>
years so that it is now higher than the number of growing 
communities.
<P>
	The federal government's current involvement in regional 
development is therefore most unfair, as the figures from the 
FORDQ itself tell us. Atlantic provinces receive $920 in 
spending per resident, Western Canada, $240 and Quebec, $230. 
As far as umbrella agreements such as ERDA are concerned, the 
federal government's record of involvement in Quebec is 
disastrous. In 1987, the total was $431 per capita in the 
Maritimes, $259 in Western Canada and $64 in Quebec.
<P>
	I should also point out that in the remaining subsidiary 
agreements with good results, the federal government backed 
out of $75 million worth of financial commitments. I refer 
specifically to the withdrawal of funds for the Eastern Plan, 
which affects over 5,800 timber owners. However, since the 
federal government intervened in an area of provincial 
jurisdiction, we demand that the funds be repatriated in the form 
of tax points to be managed by Quebec.
<P>
	Let us look at reality: cuts worth $70 million are called for in 
the finance minister's February 1994 budget. Quebec regional 
development cutbacks will be spread over the next three years: 
$14 million in 1994-95, $32 million in 1995-96, and $24 
million in 1996-97. A FORD internal document issued at the 
same time as the budget states that the objective pursued is to cut 
financial commitments by half. Since the 1993-94 fiscal year, 
the financial commitment has averaged some $20 million a 
month. The same document says that as of March 1, 1994, 
FORD's funding level should be reduced to $10 million a year.
<P>
	The federal government is leaving the field of economic 
development in Quebec and I want to mention the cuts in 
transfers to companies. In 1994, Quebec will lose $70 million in 
funding; this situation is intolerable. We demand that funding be 
transferred to Quebec and that Quebec alone manage its 
development and its regional development organizations.
<P>
	From another perspective, we can say that the federal 
government's involvement in development is just a way to show 
its presence. It is a way of showing the Canadian flag with 
everything it is doing in all sectors of the economy and in all the 
present constitutional fields. With its involvement, the federal 
government increases its visibility but its action remains 
ineffective.
<P>
	FORD's action is not based on a comprehensive vision of 
local development. It more often takes a scattergun approach. 
From reading some FORD documents, we get the feeling that it 
is a federal propaganda agency in Quebec. Thus, in a document 
published in January on a new approach for programs 
concerning small and medium-sized businesses in Quebec, we 
read that FORD is well placed to represent the federal 
government to small and medium-sized businesses and, a little 
further, that these specific agreements are intended to establish 
a properly co-ordinated federal presence.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	So, the Federal Office for Regional Development becomes the 
co-ordinator of the federal activity in an area of provincial 
jurisdiction. This duplication is interesting in that it says much 
about the centralizing objectives of the federal government. 
From now on, it is clear that, under the cover of FORD, every 
federal department wants to extend the scope of its activities in 
Quebec.
<P>
	This is why Part II of Bill C-46 includes a set of specific 
objectives regarding FORD and regional development in 
Quebec. This is a case of shameless interference in a Quebec 
constitutional jurisdiction. The new mandate of FORD is clear: 
that office gives up any type of core agreement to concentrate 
instead on specific agreements. While freeing itself of financial 
commitments, FORD takes on the responsibility of an 
information broker for small and medium businesses, thus 
limiting its activities to searching for new markets, promoting 
research and development as well as export markets for regional 
businesses, thereby duplicating the role of already existing 
organizations.
<P>
	FORD is fulfilling the responsibilities of already existing 
organizations such as industrial commissioner offices and 
development corporations in several regions. This duplication is 
confirmed by an act. Why yet another duplication of institutions 
and structures? Why this waste of energy and human resources? 
The federal system is the initiator of a series of disastrous 
money-wasting schemes which are largely responsible for this 
country's excessive debt.
<P>
	In Quebec, the future of regional development is dependent 
on respecting Quebec's jurisdiction in that all-important sector. 
In our province, the future is contingent upon a decentralization 
of power. Does the word decentralization suggest anything to 
you? I am referring to a decentralization in favour of regional 
decision-making levels which are well aware of their situation, 
including regional county municipalities, which form the first 
level of government. The Quebec government recognized the 
primary decision-making role to be given to regional 
development councils to ensure that regions would have control 
over decisions which directly affect the socio-economic life of 
their communities.
<P>
	The federal government should pledge to withdraw from that 
sector and not interfere with the priorities of the strategic 
planning done by every regional county municipality and every 
region in Quebec. The creation of regional county 
municipalities by the Parti Quebecois in 1980 was one of the 
first elements of the current regional development structure in 
Quebec. The first socio-economic summits of 1985, as well as 
the reform undertaken by Liberal minister Yvon Picotte, are 
other important elements of this very particular structure which 
led Quebec to the creation of regional development councils. 
These councils have the mandate  of planning, co-ordinating 
and programming 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6160"> 6160 </A></B>
<P>
the development and to ensure joint accountability with local 
authorities and the provincial government.
<P>
	In short, these councils are regional consultative and 
decision-making assemblies. Because of its dynamic role, 
regional economic development in Quebec is at the centre of the 
issue of global development in that province. In 1988, the 
Government of Quebec developed and published its own 
regional development policy that, even before the Federal 
Office of Regional Development existed, concentrated on the 
development of regional enterprises. Its goal, to stimulate 
entrepreneurship and create jobs in the regions, was a distinct 
departure from the traditional approach that emphasized the 
construction of public utilities and infrastructures. There is 
nothing particularly new or innovative about the new focus of 
the Federal Office of Regional Development.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	Once again, the federal government is merely setting up the 
same kind of regional development infrastructures that already 
exist in Quebec, and it has clearly confirmed it has no intention 
and no desire to remove overlap and respect Quebec's wishes.
<P>
	In a world where free trade has lowered trade barriers and 
exposed regional economies to fiercer competition, the new 
government in Quebec wants to promote local responsibility for 
regional development. The policy of the Parti Quebecois now in 
power is clear and unambiguous. It provides for a new sharing of 
responsibilities by the Government of Quebec with regional 
governments represented by the l'Union des municipalités du 
Québec and l'Union des municipalités régionales de comté du 
Québec among others.
<P>
	From now on, regional development in Quebec is to be 
focused on the authority of the regions, a far cry from the 
endless hesitation of a federal government that does not know 
where it is going. The Parizeau government has made regional 
decentralization a priority, and the federal government should 
be aware of that.
<P>
	The policy of the new government in Quebec is clear: 
decentralization will be the responsibility of authorities who are 
accountable and must include autonomous resources and fiscal 
powers. The regional municipality will become the 
decision-making centre and, as such, the new basis for regional 
and social economic development in Quebec.
<P>
	To deal with the various aspects of regional issues, a planning 
and consultation instrument is absolutely necessary, and so we 
have the Conseil régional de développement, the Regional 
Development Council. If the federal government will not 
recognize what is being done in Quebec to give the 
government's decision-makers the responsibility, funding and 
power to make those decisions, it is not on the right track and 
merely confirms its decision to centralize all powers in the 
centre of the country and ignore what is being done in Quebec.
<P>
	Finally, we demand transfer of funding and full recognition of 
Quebec's exclusive responsibility for regional development.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General):</B> Mr. Speaker, I really wanted to hear the hon. member. 
Rather than a member serving his constituents, he seems to be 
representing bureaucrats. Frankly, the number one priority 
among Quebecers, and in particular those living in remote areas, 
is job creation. When he dares say-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Ask your question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> True, I should get to my question; I will have 
another opportunity to talk about this issue.
<P>
	Could the hon. member name the federal government failures 
in eastern Quebec, when we know that over the last 20 years 
major investments were made in all kinds of port, airport and 
tourism infrastructures, as well as in small businesses? Does he 
refuse to acknowledge that more than 1,000 small businesses 
took advantage of the liberalities-yes, ``liberalities''-of the 
federal government? Could he name some who might have been 
resounding failures? There may be some but I doubt it. I would 
like him to tell us who are these 500 eastern Quebec companies 
who were not well served by the federal government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all I 
would like to remind the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine that, as regional 
development critic for the Official Opposition, I am not without 
experience. I worked in that field. If the hon. member knows his 
area, he will acknowledge that tens, hundreds of people in his 
region, his RCM, took part in the development of strategic plans 
for their area, in the analysis of strengths and weaknesses in the 
riding and the region. The results were then discussed at the 
regional council level and prioritized before inclusion into a 
concrete regional development plan. This is what I call working 
with people, not bureaucrats.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	What I would like to stress to the hon. member, who is long on 
rhetoric, is that our main concern is to ensure that the proper 
regional development organizations in Quebec are recognized, 
region by region, and to ensure also that the central government, 
in Ottawa, recognizes Quebec's intention to decentralize its 
services towards the regions, bringing them closer to the people.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
very much enjoyed the impassioned address of my hon. 
colleague from Richmond-Wolfe. If Quebec were to have 
exclusive jurisdiction in regional development, should Quebec 
also have exclusive responsibility for raising funds in Quebec 
for disbursement in Quebec? If so, would Quebec be able to 
maintain spending at current levels?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, I did 
mention in my speech that this is not covered by the 
Constitution. The involvement of the federal government in 
regional development is only due to its spending power and is 
not enshrined in the Constitution.
<P>
	The regional development initiatives taken by the Quebec 
government in the last 10 years have resulted in more 
co-operation between all the major economic, social, health and 
education stakeholders and a learning process during 
socio-economic summits, followed by consultations, which 
ensure that the reform introduced by Liberal minister Picotte, in 
Quebec, really led to some money transfers to the regions.
<P>
	The current situation is best described as follows: the regions 
can decide and have real budgets. What we want now is to go 
beyond tax transfers and have the power to levy taxes through 
regional county municipalities. That would give us a real tax 
base and enable us to make real decisions and solve regional 
problems which would have been analyzed at once by people in 
the regions. So, as you see, tax points are important.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, since we only have a few seconds left, I will be brief. I 
just want to assure my hon. colleague that this government 
respects all provinces, including Quebec.
<P>
	I want to ask him a question about a very important issue he 
raised. It has to do with overlap and duplication. Given the 
changes undergone by the machinery of government during the 
last ten years, would he not agree that progress has been made? 
It seems to me that we have less problems than we used to have. I 
have been examining this whole situation for a while and I 
wonder if the hon. member has come to the same conclusion as I 
have and would agree that progress has been made and there are 
less overlap and duplication than before.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> As my hon. colleague just 
said, it is true, Mr. Speaker, that some progress has been made 
and that individuals have co-operated with federal agencies in 
that area, but the fact is that nothing really happened. I cannot 
answer yes to his question. Directives and standards applied 
within federal agencies are never quite in sync with standards 
applied elsewhere. So, civil servants are always on business 
trips, travelling throughout the country to meet their 
counterparts and say: Your standard does not meet mine. We will 
have to  meet again next week, because I have to go over this 
with my boss and see what can be done.
<P>
	This is not only duplication, but also a waste of human 
resources and money.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing 
Order 38, to inform the House that the question to be raised 
tonight at the time of adjournment is as follows: the hon. 
member for Bourassa-Immigration.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased 
to take a few minutes to speak on the subject of Bill C-46, the 
Department of Industry Act. This is very comprehensive 
legislation providing for a department with far-reaching 
responsibilities and a wide array of instruments to carry them 
out.
<P>
	The department it creates is a necessary tool in the agenda of 
the government to generate economic growth and job creation 
and to prepare for the innovative and, indeed, very different 
economy of the 21st century.
<P>
	Bill C-46 recognizes once again what are the real needs of the 
new economy, what is demanded of Canadians if we are to 
continue to enjoy the economic well-being that a resource rich 
past has made possible.
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	This bill provides the organizational structure to permit a 
consistent, coherent focus on those strategies which will assist 
Canadians in the transition from a resource based to an 
information based economy.
<P>
	This organization will have the lead role in generating the 
consensus and gathering the studied advice of the main players 
in the economic development game, whether they are business 
people, scientists, engineers, educators, consumers or other 
governments.
<P>
	The bill recognizes that at the heart of economic development 
and job creation are science and technology, research and 
development, technological and managerial innovation, areas 
that have for far too long been neglected in this country.
<P>
	Attention to these issues and approaches to the challenges 
they present are long overdue. Canada has been slow to 
recognize the importance of innovation and technology to 
competitiveness. Technology has transformed the economy 
dramatically with increasing growth in the knowledge and 
information based industries.
<P>
	Also technology is revolutionizing the way we do business in 
manufacturing, in resource industries, and the service sector. 
Thus innovation has become the key to growth in both the new 
and traditional sectors of the economy. Our performance in 
embracing innovation has not been spectacular.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6162"> 6162 </A></B>
<P>
	For example, the percentage of Canadian firms that carry out 
any research and development activities is less than one-half of 
1 per cent of Canadian enterprises. That is unacceptable.
<P>
	Further, not only do we have too few leading edge firms 
developing new technologies, we do not have enough Canadian 
firms searching the world marketplaces to find technology and 
bring it home, using it here to build our innovative capacity, in 
other words adapting it to the Canadian experience.
<P>
	Canadian businesses, scientists, and Canadian workers are 
becoming increasingly aware of these needs and yet they cannot 
meet such challenges by themselves individually and separately.
<P>
	Somehow the concerted, co-operative effort of all the 
participants must be brought to bear in addressing the problem. 
That is precisely what the government has recognized and is 
taking steps to bring about.
<P>
	The red book that first outlined the agenda that the 
government is following pointed out the need for an innovative 
economy. It also pointed out that innovation does not just 
happen. It thrives in countries that consciously understand the 
innovative process and take measures to create a national 
system of innovation.
<P>
	It stated that the role of the federal government is to work with 
the private sector, to identify strategic opportunities for the 
future, and then to redirect existing resources toward their 
fulfilment. Common sense, a hallmark of the government.
<P>
	That is the spirit in which the government has approached the 
science and technology sector as a key to development of an 
innovative economy. The February budget illustrates that spirit 
in action. Again, common sense.
<P>
	The federal government spends about $6 billion per year on 
science and technology. Tax expenditures account for about $1 
billion more. One of the measures announced in the budget is a 
true strategy to maximize the benefits of these expenditures, a 
strategy for research and development with priorities, direction 
and review of results.
<P>
	The Minister of Industry was charged with the task of 
preparing a paper on science and technology clearly stating the 
government's priorities, to set the stage for a national dialogue 
on a new national science and technology strategy. This paper 
was released on June 28. In the meantime a full review of 
science and technology programs is under way.
<P>
	The February budget also announced a number of initiatives 
to further the cause of an innovative economy. The Canadian 
technology network to help small businesses get access to new 
technology to compete in world markets was announced, as was 
a technology partnership program to help smaller firms gain 
access to research results done in government and university 
labs.
<P>
	An engineers and scientists program will help small 
businesses get the technological expertise they need. 
Development of a Canadian strategy for the information 
highway was announced. Again, common sense.
<P>
	Other decisions and initiatives have followed. Negotiations 
were completed with the United States for participation in the 
space station resulting in an excellent deal for both countries.
<P>
	A new long-term space plan was announced. The National 
Centres of Excellence funding was extended, 10 networks 
renewed and the second round of competitions for new networks 
launched.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	A new president of the National Research Council was 
appointed and the council's declining budget was stabilized, as 
were those of the granting councils.
<P>
	Initiatives aimed at helping young Canadians adapt to an 
innovation economy such as SchoolNet, Computers for Schools 
and Innovators in the Schools have met with great success.
<P>
	The evidence is clear to me that the government is on the right 
track and well-launched on the route to assisting in the creation 
of an innovative economy. The bill which officially establishes 
the chief instrument of the federal government's role in this task 
is yet another step along the route.
<P>
	The Department of Industry created by this bill will be 
uniquely equipped to become the workshop in which the major 
players in the innovative economy can forge their weapons. This 
is the organization that will be able to provide the listening post, 
host the consultations, lead the discussion and develop the 
resultant policies.
<P>
	It will be able to provide the consistent, continued attention 
required to develop and implement coherent strategies over the 
time required for them to be effective. Common sense once 
again.
<P>
	I have every confidence in the abilities and creative energies 
of Canadians. I do not find the idea of common sense funny. I 
find it, again, common sensible. I am sure we have the capacity 
to create an innovative economy capable of competing in the 
global marketplace well into the 21st century, as long as we do 
not spend a lot of time laughing.
<P>
	What Canadians need to get the job done is the kind of 
common sense leadership that the government is providing; 
leadership with clear objectives and concrete measures to 
achieve them. Bill C-46 is one of these concrete measures. I 
firmly recommend its approval by the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo):</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague 
mentioned that we have a new president at NRC. The 
gentleman's name is Dr. Arthur Carty. He was vice-president in 
charge 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6163"> 6163 </A></B>
<P>
of research at the University of Waterloo. That is most 
significant because the University of Waterloo has very much 
been an innovator in the new technology.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member would like a comment on the 
following. So often we hear the laissez-faire approach from the 
Reform Party but when we look at successful economies 
presently able to compete internationally they are economies 
with a national strategy.
<P>
	Would the hon. member agree this puts us in a position of 
being able to have a national strategy with a Team Canada 
concept as we go out and compete in the international 
marketplace, exporting, bringing business to this country, 
putting people to work?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for 
Waterloo for his question. Indeed I would agree most 
particularly. As the hon. member is aware, my riding of Halifax 
as well has universities that have been part of the kind of 
development that his well respected University of Waterloo has 
been.
<P>
	Without an industrial strategy such as the one proposed 
through the Department of Industry in concert with the 
Department of Finance and other departments, we will not be 
prepared for the next century. I know this perhaps better than 
some because I come from an area of the country that suffered a 
great deal when we agreed to choose Canada and become part of 
this great country in Confederation.
<P>
	We had a north-south bias. We had the days of wooden ships 
and iron persons as we now call them. Many things happened in 
the way of transportation, the passage of goods and other things 
that were not always to the financial benefit of Atlantic 
Canadians.
<P>
	However, being part of this great Confederation has always 
been to the benefit of Atlantic Canadians. We are perhaps not the 
proudest but among the proudest citizens of this country. We are 
glad we chose it and would do so again and again.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	We also know that to ensure our region is healthy, to ensure 
that Ontario, the engine that drives the country, is healthy and to 
ensure that the great Canadian west and north are healthy, an 
industrial strategy is an absolute necessity.
<P>
	I applaud the minister and the department for the work they 
are doing in this area.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Beaches-Woodbine):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to speak on the subject of second reading of Bill C-46, the 
Department of Industry Act.
<P>
	Like other members who have spoken on this topic, I am 
convinced that this bill is a sound strategic initiative by this 
government and an excellent piece of legislation. I like this bill 
for its comprehensive inclusion of the chief functions necessary 
to achieving the government's agenda for economic growth and 
job creation, for its incorporating under one organizational 
umbrella the many concerns related to growth.
<P>
	I take particular satisfaction from the recognition by the bill 
of the importance of small and medium size businesses and 
tourism. My riding has many small businesses and I believe 
firmly that this bill will be of great assistance to them.
<P>
	In recent months as I met and spoke with small and medium 
size businesses in the metro Toronto area one of the recurring 
things that came through consistently was that is was very 
difficult for them to access government programs. It meant 
going from department to department and most small and 
medium size businesses do not have the resources to research 
what government programs are available, how to access them, 
who to talk to and how to research them and whether or not their 
company is eligible for any of these aids or partnerships that we 
offer.
<P>
	It is important and critical that the four departments are now 
coming together, that there will be one stop shopping and that 
the businesses will be able to access these programs and work 
collectively.
<P>
	In order for Canada to succeed in the global economy and to 
create the jobs that we need it is important that there be one 
consistent vision and one cohesive approach to strategic 
planning. To me it is important that when we put together R and 
D, the manufacturing, marketing, the promotion of mobility 
across this country and all of the things that this department will 
be grouping within it, these things work together, that one 
augments the other and supplements the other, and that business 
can access all of it at the same time.
<P>
	Some of the examples that were given to me by business were 
things such as research and development is great but you can 
develop a product and not be able to bring it to market. One 
example was given where there was some research done by a 
university but where the product was in the end manufactured in 
the U.S. The jobs are in the manufacturing, not just in the 
research. That is where a large number of jobs are. It is critical 
that these kinds of things happen within our country and that 
kind of linkage exists.
<P>
	It is also very important to me and I am very pleased to see 
that sustainable development and the environment are included 
in clause 5 of this bill. Putting together the environment and 
industries in the same clause, dealing with it very aggressively 
in making it a partnership is very critical. We have to be leaders 
in this country. The environmental industry is job creation. It is 
a plus. It is not a detriment, as some people might think.
<P>
	To me it is extremely important that industry will be working 
together with the environment and that the environment is part 
of the planning of industry so that it is not something separate 
that one does as an adjunct to the industrial strategy of this 
country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6164"> 6164 </A></B>
<P>
	The red book which detailed this government's agenda before 
the last election foresaw this bill. It announced that the 
government would focus on small and medium size businesses 
as the determining factor in turning around the economy. The 
speech from the throne made good our electoral commitment by 
placing small and medium size businesses at the top of the 
agenda, focusing on them for long term job creation.
<P>
	The February budget followed through, announcing a long list 
of small business related initiatives. With the February budget 
papers the government published its action plan entitled 
growing small businesses. This publication was meant to 
stimulate discussion and get the business community actively 
engaged in helping to create an environment more conducive to 
small business and entrepreneurship. For example, Industry 
Canada is exploring with the Canadian Chamber of Commerce 
the feasibility of developing a business network strategy to set 
up some 30 business networks to foster co-operation and 
collaboration among small and medium size firms with common 
interests.
<P>
	Also, an array of initiatives has been announced as part of the 
small and medium size enterprise agenda.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	A pilot program will be launched under the technology 
partnership program, exploring the feasibility of incentives for 
universities to enter into partnerships, the small and medium 
size firms to develop emerging technologies for industrial 
application.
<P>
	As part of the science and technology review, the Secretary of 
State for Science, Research and Development will conduct 
consultations on a program to provide small and medium size 
firms with cost shared salary support for hiring scientists, 
engineers, technologists and industrial designers, as my 
colleague said previously.
<P>
	A new fund has been established to help expand existing 
business through the Federal Business Development Bank. The 
Canada community investment fund has been announced, one of 
the aims of which is to ensure availability of equity financing for 
small firms.
<P>
	Industry Canada is working with a private sector coalition to 
set up a national business network demonstration program. The 
program will help business create networks to foster 
co-operation and collaboration and better prepare Canadian 
small and medium size businesses to compete at home and 
internationally.
<P>
	Another example of our recognition is the hospitality 
industry. The key role of tourism in the economy is clear. Five 
per cent of the Canadian workforce is employed in some 
500,000 full time equivalent tourism jobs in more than 60,000 
enterprises.
<P>
	Employment in tourism is growing one and a half times faster 
than industries as a whole. Visitors to Canada last year 
contributed approximately $9 billion in foreign exchange and 
Canadians added about $18 billion while travelling within 
Canada.
<P>
	I want to point out that it is not simply in work within this 
ministry that co-operation is happening. We look at the HRD 
department and how it is going to be complimenting what we are 
doing in this department. Look at the hospitality industry. That 
department has recently signed an agreement with the National 
Tourism Human Resource Council. Its objective will be to 
co-ordinate and support research and analysis of the industry's 
training needs. It will formulate national occupational standards 
and certification programs. It will provide the means for the 
sharing of information initiatives and it will be a national 
advocate on behalf of the tourism industry for human resource 
issues.
<P>
	Human Resources Development Canada endorses the council 
and the goals that it has set for itself. The federal government is 
contributing over $977,000, the tourism industry is providing 
over $2.2 million or thereabouts. This is only one of 13 sectoral 
agreements that had been signed. Since the hospitality industry 
agreement was signed a great many more have been signed.
<P>
	This shows that we are not just looking at the industrial side 
which is absolutely necessary. Coupled with that we are also 
looking at the manpower required in order to create the jobs in 
these industries. There cannot be one without the other. We have 
a new bill and new department pulling together all of the 
industrial strategies necessary for the country.
<P>
	However, we also have another department that is looking at 
the manpower required and arranging sectoral agreements with 
various sectors of the economy to create the kinds of skills and 
manpower required for the jobs we are creating for the future.
<P>
	I am very much in support of this bill and I want to 
congratulate the minister for pulling this together. I hope the 
House will support it.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga West):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Bill C-46 is a balanced, streamlined and positive bill. The 
country is ready for a new industrial, scientific revolution.
<P>
	I would like to share briefly with members some of the signs 
that are occurring in Mississauga and I would like to ask for her 
comments at the end.
<P>
	Mississauga is the ninth largest city in the country and is a 
microcosm of Canadian society. The forecast for housing in 
Mississauga was $600 million. It was revised today to $850 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6165"> 6165 </A></B>
<P>
million in new starts. The industrial growth has been revised 
from 2.2 million square feet to 3.5 million square feet for next 
year.
<P>
	Does the member for Beaches-Woodbine believe that Bill 
C-46 and all this wonderful economic activity going on in 
Mississauga balance or co-ordinate at all with the election of a 
sensible, positive Liberal government?
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Minna:</B> Mr. Speaker, obviously it does compliment. I 
suppose that is a leading question if I ever had one but it is a 
great question.
<P>
	The member is quite right. We talk a great deal in this House 
about getting rid of duplication and cutbacks. There are all kinds 
of comments coming from the opposition about the overlap. In 
this case we are doing exactly what a great many people have 
been saying, let us get rid of the overlap of the duplication and 
let us pull together into one bill all of those aspects which are 
necessary to deal with the new strategies of the global economy 
and the new technologies of today. We are dealing with 
technology. We are dealing with all of the different aspects that 
involve these things.
<P>
	At the same time we are looking at the manpower needs for 
the future in the new strategies of industry. Small and medium 
size businesses need this kind of assistance and infrastructure. 
They are working with us. We are not coming up with these 
solutions or policies in isolation without consultations with 
small and medium size businesses and business in general in this 
country.
<P>
	As I said, the sectoral agreements which were signed by the 
Minister of Human Resources Development were signed in 
agreement. We are working together and sharing the 
responsibilities. That is how this country was built and where 
the future of this country lies, in a partnership with business.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on this bill.
<P>
	Bill C-46 provided the federal government a chance to do 
more to change the status quo. This bill will give the Minister of 
Industry powers relating to regional economic development 
programs in Ontario and Quebec. This is outlined in part I, 
subclause 4(2) of the bill.
<P>
	Will these powers actually extend to the Minister of Industry 
and will he retain these powers or will the Governor General 
continue to vest to the Minister of Finance control over the 
federal office of regional development Quebec? We will be 
watching these developments very closely.
<P>
	It is clear that present ways of administering government lack 
effectiveness and efficiency. I need only point to the federal debt 
which is well over the $500 billion mark and rising to illustrate 
that point.
<P>
	By the end of the next three years this government will have 
added approximately $97 billion to the federal debt. That is the 
highest increase in the history of Canada for any three year 
period. The so-called fiscal plan of the government 
shortchanges all Canadians. The plain fact is that fixing the 
deficit targeted at 3 per cent of GDP is not good enough when 
our federal debt is at 71 per cent  and the total public debt is 
nearly 100 per cent of GDP respectively.
<P>
	The government must change the way it operates now if it is 
going to bring the country's financial house in order. Bill C-46 
does little to achieve this goal which is the main reason we 
cannot support it.
<P>
	Bill C-46 is a statement of what the Department of Industry 
does. This bill gives the minister sweeping powers to create an 
environment where government is the central tool of economic 
development and deeply involved in the private sector. My 
colleague from Okanagan Centre went into great detail in that 
area.
<P>
	There were 52 Reform MPs elected for some very 
fundamental reasons. The Canadian electorate wants change to 
the system. Last year's election was the first wave to bring about 
that change. One of the reasons Reformers were elected has to 
do with our policy regarding private enterprise. Reformers 
believe that private enterprise must be the engine which drives 
the economy. A dollar left in the pocket of the businessman is 
more efficiently spent than a dollar spent by the government. 
This is common sense. Businesses are in the business of creating 
jobs, making and investing money and unfortunately 
governments are in the habit of spending it, very often 
frivolously.
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	Reformers value enterprise and initiative. We see the 
government's role as fostering and protecting an environment in 
which initiative and enterprise can be exercised by individuals 
and groups. Regional development programs have the potential 
to create waste and abuse. It is no surprise that a senior cabinet 
minister from Quebec is currently in charge of FORD-Q. Nor is 
it a surprise that a senior cabinet minister from the west is in 
charge of Western Economic Diversification. And the Atlantic 
Canada Opportunities Agency is administered by the Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services.
<P>
	These regional development programs, which account for 
well over $1 billion per year, do little for the long term benefit of 
the country. They are supposed to enhance employment 
opportunities, strengthen the national economy, stimulate 
investment and promote the interests and protection of Canadian 
consumers.
<P>
	These are not my musings, they come straight from Bill C-46. 
However I submit that these programs do very little to achieve 
their self-proclaimed goals. FORD-Q is an example of how a 
regional development program just does not stack up. The 
objective of FORD-Q, as outlined in the 1994-95 main 
estimates, part III, is to promote the economic development of 
the regions of Quebec with low incomes, slow economic growth 
or 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6166"> 6166 </A></B>
<P>
inadequate possibilities for productive employment, by 
emphasizing long term economic development and sustainable 
employment and income creation.
<P>
	In an address to the Standing Committee on Industry in May 
the finance minister waxed eloquent, as he usually does when he 
speaks, about the so-called merits of FORD-Q. He told the 
committee:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Over the last six years FORD-Q's activities in all the regions of Quebec have 
created remarkable spin-offs: $1.1 billion invested in more than 3,600 projects, a 
total investment of nearly $5.8 billion and 56,000 jobs. We have enjoyed 
outstanding success.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I find it very interesting that the finance minister considers 
spending over $103,000 for one job to be an efficient use of 
taxpayers' money. What is even more interesting is what the 
finance minister said to the committee in his next breath:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Quebec is nonetheless saddled with an unemployment rate that approaches 13 
per cent.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The evidence is there. In the last six years FORD-Q has done 
little to promote long term economic development and 
sustainable employment. Quebec has an unemployment rate 
higher than the national average, yet part of FORD-Q's mandate 
is to promote sustainable employment.
<P>
	Additionally, FORD-Q was to help convince Quebec to stay 
in Canada. It is a miserable failure in that area as well.
<P>
	It is important to point out that FORD-Q is not the only 
regional development program which falls short of its mandate. 
The Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency also merits 
comment. Since ACOA launched its co-operative program in 
1989, a program of federal-provincial economic development 
initiatives, two things have happened: first, the average 
unemployment rate in the Atlantic region has increased by 
nearly 2 per cent; second, the number of people on welfare has 
grown by nearly 3 per cent.
<P>
	I ask the question: Has ACOA really made the Atlantic 
economy more viable? The numbers would seem to indicate 
otherwise, as would the deplorable state of the fishing industry, 
especially in Newfoundland.
<P>
	Western Economic Diversification is another example of a 
regional development program engaging in huge expenditures 
of taxpayers' dollars. This year's budget for WED is over $452 
million. Its mandate is to promote the development and 
diversification of western Canada's economy. Since its 
inception in 1987 to the end of fiscal 1993 WED has doled out 
more than $1 billion to over 3,000 projects. That is over 
$330,000 per project, never mind the fact that only 40,000 jobs, 
many of them short term, have resulted from this huge 
expenditure.
<P>
	The average welfare rate in some of the western provinces has 
gone up by almost 2 per cent in the last three years, and the 
unemployment rate has followed a similar path. Again the 
numbers indicate that regional development programs are not 
very effective.
<P>
	As a critic for regional economic development, I would like to 
relate some information we obtained which shows why these 
programs are questionable expenditures of taxpayers' dollars.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	FORD-Q recently finished up its support program for fashion 
design. This program committed $2.9 million to raise the profile 
of fashion design from the Montreal region. Of that $2.9 
million, $2.6 million was in the form of grants, money which is 
not repaid. On researching this particular program we found that 
three companies went out of business shortly after receiving 
their grants. There were three additional companies for which 
FORD-Q officials could not account. Why would FORD-Q give 
money to these companies without keeping tabs on their 
progress?
<P>
	We looked into the whereabouts of these companies and found 
that only two of the companies were still in operation. 
Combined, the grants for these companies totalled over 
$234,000. That money has gone up in smoke. FORD-Q officials 
cannot even keep track of where the money is going. FORD-Q 
under the Montreal development fund program is now handing 
out another $1.5 million to the fashion design sector. How much 
of that money will go unaccounted?
<P>
	Taxpayers would rather manage their own money than have 
one branch of the government take it and pump it back into 
programs that just do not seem to work. There are examples this 
kind right across the country. Taxpayers deserve a better fate 
than having their money squandered on so-called regional 
development programs. It is no wonder division exists in the 
country when questionable programs for every region of Canada 
waste taxpayers' dollars.
<P>
	As a new government the Liberals have a chance to truly 
change the way things are done. These regional development 
programs were used by the Tories as pork-barrelling tools. I 
would encourage the Minister of Industry to do a thorough 
review of all the regional economic development programs, 
including western economic diversification.
<P>
	In fact I ask the minister to go even a step further and turn all 
economic development over to the provinces.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the suggestion of the hon. member in his speech dealing with 
western diversification is that there should be a review. That is 
presently taking place. The review is being conducted.
<P>
	During this review and while visiting communities in Alberta 
and British Columbia, the business people in those provinces 
have indicated that there is a need for western diversification 
funding during a certain time in the development of product. In 
Saskatchewan the biotech industry exists because of western 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6167"> 6167 </A></B>
<P>
diversification. It has become the envy of other science 
communities and has become one of the leading biotech centres 
in the world.
<P>
	Does the hon. member feel that all funding for all purposes in 
the development of industry in western Canada should be cut off 
by western diversification? If so, does he see any role 
whatsoever for western diversification in western Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yellowhead):</B> Mr. Speaker, in so far as the 
human resources review is concerned it has been so on and off 
that no one really knows where it is right now.
<P>
	Our policy is to cease funding to regional economic 
development. The reason why Alberta and to some extent B.C. 
have diversified their economies so well has not so much to do 
with federal funding, it has to do with the provinces providing 
the right kind of atmosphere and climate for these 
diversifications to occur.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leonard Hopkins </B><B>(Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this bill that is before the House today-
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
believe that my hon. colleague was splitting time with me so that 
I should probably be up at this time.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The lists change all the time. It was the 
Chair's understanding that the Reform Party was not splitting 
time and that the member for Edmonton Southwest was going to 
go for the full 20 minutes if he so wished after the two members 
on the other side.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will follow the Liberal 
speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hopkins:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Department of Industry Act in 
Bill C-46 that is before the House today combines many things 
into one department. There is not too much wrong with that 
because in the last Parliament-at least in 1984-we saw 40 
ministries represented in the House of Commons. It was the 
largest cabinet in Canadian history.
<P>
	Today we have 22 ministers in the House of Commons. The 
Department of Industry Act will provide a clear, comprehensive, 
legislative mandate and some co-ordination for many of those 
departments that were before separated and divided among 40 
people.
<P>
	Some people have the idea that everything the Department of 
Industry will be doing was listed by the parliamentary secretary 
today when he was speaking. Why should it be all listed? I 
believe we can safely say that such an impression is just that, it 
is an impression. While titles ideally should be symbolic, they 
should not be mistaken for substance.
<P>
	If a number of subjects are built into one department and the 
minister has some initiative, some vision and some leadership 
ability, as we have in the Department of Industry, all those 
things are going to be co-ordinated very well.
<P>
	The minister has many challenges in the proper co-ordination 
of all the various agendas that have been handed to him in one 
department. Let us take tourism for example. One of his jobs is 
to promote the tourism industry.
<P>
	I have seen a very good group of tourism people put together 
in former departments shoved from one department to another. 
In recent years, they have been chopped to pieces and now just a 
few of them are left.
<P>
	I sat in on a committee in the last Parliament where even 
representatives of big tourist industries were saying: ``We do not 
need Tourism Canada at all. We can look after ourselves. We 
would rather promote ourselves.'' That is fine if you are one of 
the big tourism industries. They can look after themselves at 
home and they can do their advertising abroad. The small and 
medium sized industries are not in the same favourable position.
<P>
	We should be promoting tourism in every nation of the world. 
Canadian citizens represent a lot of people from various 
countries. We should be zeroing in on those countries because 
there is a friendship base to go on. We should invite those people 
to come over here to visit their relatives and to travel. We also 
should go into the massive population areas of the world as well 
and advertise there.
<P>
	Seventy per cent of the world's population will be living on 
the Pacific rim in the year 2000. That is the area where 
Canadians should be zeroing in for tourist business as well as for 
international trade.
<P>
	In every phase of the Department of Industry that this bill is 
setting up today, we are going to require that vision, that breadth 
of mind, the determination that we mentioned in the red book 
during the election campaign. New initiatives are necessary. We 
cannot stay with the status quo. We cannot promote the status 
quo. We have to change with the demands of the international 
market. That should be no big problem.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	Under the new legislation we will have sections in the 
department of industry such as science, development of new 
technology, communications, investments, consumer and 
corporate affairs and industrial development generally. They are 
not the total department by any means. We need some 
co-ordination. In the Public Service of Canada and other sectors 
there have to be people with some imagination, and real life 
experience does not hurt once in a while.
<P>
	We talk about high technology. Many people think of it only 
in terms of industry, that is the old term industry. They forget 
that agriculture is an industry. We have large farms today that 
are industries in their own right. We  have the dairy industry. We 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6168"> 6168 </A></B>
<P>
have new technologies in the dairy industry, the beef industry 
and in cash crops. We could talk about any of them. There are 
new developments.
<P>
	If members want to see the change in the agricultural industry 
over the years they should go to a modern day ploughing match 
such as the one we had in Renfrew county this past week. They 
will see all kinds of changes. Even the faces of members of 
Parliament who go there change. I am proud to say that 17 
members of the House saw fit to plough. I congratulate the hon. 
member who came first, a member of the Reform Party from 
British Columbia. I compliment my colleague from 
Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington who came 
second. I congratulate the hon. member for Erie who came third. 
However it would do us a lot of good if we kept up with modern 
technology. Maybe we would make better ploughers.
<P>
	Nevertheless we have all this equipment and advertising, 42 
city blocks of it, and people talk about agriculture as if it is a 
way of life. It is a real industry in itself and that is what every 
parliamentarian has to realize.
<P>
	I notice investment is a very important part of the new 
Ministry of Industry we are setting up today. If there is anything 
that businesses need today, it is stable financial sources to work 
with. If there is anything we have to do in Parliament, it is to 
provide a source of money for industry to operate, to develop 
and to progress.
<P>
	The Federal Business Development Bank will have to change. 
There must be reforms. We have to move into a new era. In my 
view Parliament, the 35th Parliament of Canada, and the present 
government have the greatest opportunity. Yes, they have many 
challenges but along with the many challenges are the great 
opportunities. The Government of Canada, ministers and 
members of the House have a great opportunity to bring a new 
deal to our nation of Canada. We have to do it with some vision. 
We have to look forward. We cannot be antsy about changing our 
ways.
<P>
	Recently a Japanese homebuilder along with a Canadian 
entrepreneur visited my office. The Japanese want to buy houses 
from Canada, but they do not want to buy houses that will North 
Americanize the Japanese culture. They want Canadians to 
produce parts for their housing that will retain the Japanese 
culture. If that is what they want and if there is a big market 
there, it is up to Canadian entrepreneurs and the department of 
industry to work with them to develop new housing to suit the 
Japanese culture.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	China is opening up. There are all kinds of new ideas and new 
opportunities. The message the Minister of Industry has to send 
to industries and entrepreneurs in Canada is that it is for them to 
make their product fit the demand.
<P>
	The Minister for International Trade is going around the 
world. He has to find opportunities, bring them back to Canada 
and give them to our entrepreneurs. They should be flexible. 
With the expertise in the department of industry they should be 
able to meet that market, make a great success for Canada and 
provide jobs, great opportunities and growth right in Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Bill C-46, an Act to establish the Department of 
Industry, is yet another initiative, another attempt by this 
government to achieve the targets it had set itself in terms of 
economic growth, job creation and federal administration 
restructuring.
<P>
	Whether we like it or not, Canada is rapidly moving away 
from the widely resource-based and strongly labour-intensive 
economy we have had so far and towards an economy based on 
information, knowledge and innovation. The economic standard 
calls for the restructuring of not only our industry and trade, but 
also our society. It also calls for greater attention being paid to 
basic factors, that is to say the underlying sources of growth and 
competitiveness as well as to the establishment of a climate 
conducive to entrepreneurship and less reliance on government 
financial assistance.
<P>
	We must do better in the areas of education and training and 
emphasize research and development. Today more than ever 
before, we must face changes with an innovative and flexible 
attitude. We must take an international perspective which opens 
the door to both unforeseen opportunities and stiff competition 
on the globalized markets. The infrastructure will have to be 
capable of supporting tomorrow's economy, which 
pre-supposes making available to the Canadian public in 
general world-class communication and information 
technologies.
<P>
	We must also make all of our activities more effective, in the 
private and public sectors alike. Business and industry must 
eliminate waste, reduce costs and make the most of Canadians' 
skills and talents. More generally, in order to revive the 
economy, the government must give priority to fostering a 
climate in which businesses can create more jobs for Canadians, 
and that is just what the Prime Minister did on September 18 
when he announced the program to be developed by the 
Department of Industry by the end of October.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	This program is aimed among other things at improving the 
business climate for entrepreneurs, helping businesses take 
advantage of the new technology, searching for growing 
markets, and promoting the tourism industry in particular.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6169"> 6169 </A></B>
<P>
	It will not be easy to meet all these requirements. All 
participants will have to work together continuously. 
Furthermore, the government will have to adopt a consistent 
approach to the allocation of our resources and to the 
development and implementation of these same policies. That is 
why we have brought together in one department all the 
effective economic development tools that previously came 
under the Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs, the 
Department of Communications, Investment Canada and the 
Department of Industry, Science and Technology.
<P>
	First, this reorganization will increase efficiency by 
eliminating duplication and overlap. Second, it will lead to more 
coherent policy development and thus greater effectiveness. The 
mandate of the Department of Industry is to promote economic 
development in Canada and to continue to keep the commitment 
made in this regard. Instead of simply distributing money to 
solve problems, the Department of Industry will work in 
conjunction with industry, teachers, scientists, technologists, 
researchers, consumers as well as other governments to reach 
these objectives.
<P>
	By giving responsibility for the consumer affairs policy to the 
Department of Industry, we will ensure that consumers have a 
say in the development of policies influencing our marketplace. 
Efficient market operation is essential to economic renewal, and 
will benefit consumers as much as businesses. The Department 
of Industry Act sets up an integrated process in which 
consumers' concerns will be addressed as early as possible in 
the policy development process.
<P>
	Efforts to protect consumers can thus be focused on 
preventing problems, rather than on solving them after the fact. 
In areas of vital interest for all Canadians, such as 
biotechnology and genetic engineering, the Labelling Act, and 
the regulation reform, our action will be based on consumers' 
interests. The co-operation of the Consumers' Association of 
Canada in many initiatives reflects consumer representation in 
the policy development process.
<P>
	Let me mention, among others, the consultative committee on 
the information highway, the drafting of a new privacy 
protection code, the discussions between the federal 
government, the provinces and the industry on a code of practice 
for electronic funds transfer, as well as a pilot project to set up 
an alternative to dispute resolution, so as to allow consumers 
easier access to small claims court.
<P>
	Those departmental initiatives are well underway, as shown 
by recent announcements made. As you know, the action plan 
unveiled by the Prime Minister to create an innovative economy, 
is consistent with our guiding principle. The Minister of 
Industry will soon announce the details of that important 
initiative. You are also well aware that Industry Canada 
participates actively in various program and policy reviews 
which will help us fulfill our mandate under the law.
<P>
	Here are a few examples of our activities. We have finally 
made real progress regarding the domestic trade issue. Indeed, 
the Minister of Industry recently had the pleasure and the 
honour of contributing to the signing of an agreement between 
the provinces, the territories and the federal government on the 
first measures to eliminate the obstacles to domestic trade which 
have been created in our country over the last 127 years.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	The agreement on domestic trade signed by the first ministers 
on June 28 is a good thing for all Canadians. Obstacles to 
domestic trade cost Canadians up to $7 billion a year. Having the 
goal of allowing for freer movement of individuals, goods, 
services and capital, this agreement provides for the elimination 
of trade barriers by July 1995.
<P>
	The agreement sets general rules prohibiting the 
implementation of any new obstacles and abolishing existing 
barriers in ten areas, including transportation, government 
contracts, investment and workforce mobility. The agreement 
provides for another very important feature, a dispute 
settlement mechanism for these areas. Obviously, there is still 
much to be done. However, some of the provisions in this 
agreement will help us make more progress. The kind of 
co-operation we got in preparing the agreement allows us to 
hope for free movement of goods, services and workforce in 
Canada within a true economic union.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it has been a very interesting morning and afternoon in the 
House as this debate unfolded.
<P>
	I am moved to ask rhetorically one question. What is it about 
getting elected that makes politicians venture capitalists? Is 
there some magic laying on of hands or something that we go 
through that I missed, that all of a sudden somehow we have the 
right to extract tax dollars out of the hides of people who are 
barely getting by earning $8 or $10 a hour, take it into 
government and then regurgitate about 20 cents to give it to 
somebody to go into competition with the people who gave us 
the money in the first place?
<P>
	What is it about getting elected that gives us the wherewithal 
to start taking money from individuals and giving it to other 
individuals or giving it, worse, to corporations?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> How did you get 
elected?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> By saying that we are going to put a stop to 
this foolishness. We got elected by saying we have had enough 
of that. People in Alberta have learned that you cannot get 
yourself elected by continuing to spend other taxpayers' money 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6170"> 6170 </A></B>
<P>
like it was someone else's. We have to start treating this money 
like it is our own.
<P>
	I will give three reasons why we should not be in this 
business, MagCan, NovAtel and Gainers. We have no business 
being in business.
<P>
	How did we get here? It is 1994. Here we are sitting in the 
Parliament of Canada. Many of us are sitting here because the 
last government imploded upon itself-Kim Campbell. How did 
we get into this reorganization in the first place? I guess that is 
the first question we have to ask ourselves. How did we get here 
in the first place to do this reorganization?
<P>
	We got here because Kim Campbell noticed that there were a 
few bumps on the road ahead and she figured that perhaps one of 
the things that she could do is reduce the size of government, 
reduce the size of the cabinet which had grown to 40 or so 
members.
<P>
	It makes sense, right? It does not make sense if you do it for 
the wrong reasons. It should have been done for the policy 
reason, not because they wanted to get elected, not for political 
reasons, but because it was the right thing to do.
<P>
	Most people realize that before you make substantive 
organizational change you would do a review to make sure that 
you are making the change in the correct way and going at it 
carefully.
<P>
	What did we do? The Liberal government inherited Kim 
Campbell's last gasp to get herself elected. It then had the 
opportunity and, recognizing the wisdom of downsizing 
government which was definitely a step in the right direction, 
carried forward and added to it.
<P>
<B>(1750 ) </B>
<P>
	Let me quote from <I>Organizing to Govern</I>. This is a book 
written by Gordon Osbaldeston and most people in this House 
would certainly recognize that name. For the benefit of people 
watching, Gordon Osbaldeston had a distinguished career in the 
Canadian public service. He has held posts in the foreign trade 
commission service and was a deputy minister in the 
Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs and the 
Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce.
<P>
	He was secretary to the Treasury Board, Minister of State for 
Economic Development, under-secretary of state, Department 
of External Affairs, Clerk of the Privy Council, on and on-35 
years of distinguished service to our country.
<P>
	He wrote a book called <I>Organizing to Govern</I>.
<P>
	I heard him being interviewed on the news the other day and it 
was interesting because the radio interviewer said if he was a 
proponent of radically downsizing government and retracting 
the tentacles of government from the daily life of Canadian 
business, how is it that he for the best part of his life was 
involved in the expansion of the government's role in 
everybody's business.
<P>
	His response was that as we age we sometimes learn 
something and he hoped he had learned something over his long 
career in the public service.
<P>
	In any event, rule number one in organizing and governing, 
three rules to live by, is resist proposals to reorganize unless you 
are certain the benefits of the proposed change outweigh the 
costs. He goes on to say organizing is not as free lunch, adding 
new organizations or ministerial portfolios adds complexity and 
reorganizing existing ones causes disruption. Neither of these 
costs should be taken lightly. At minimum it can take three years 
to implement a major organizational change and in many cases 
five years.
<P>
	Our public servants, all 6,000 involved in this reorganization 
just in industry, and all of the public servants all over the 
country deserve some kind of a medal for the chaos they have 
had to live in and endure over these last 20 or so years.
<P>
	If we believe Mr. Osbaldeston to be accurate, and there is no 
reason to think we should not, look what has happened in the 
Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce since 1892 when 
the then Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce, Mackenzie 
Bowell, went to Australia and drummed up business for the 
CPR. We are still doing it. We started in 1892.
<P>
	In any event remember, according to Mr. Osbaldeston, it takes 
at least three to five years to be able to accommodate change and 
so here we have industry trade and commerce from 1892 to 
1969-virtually nothing. They probably ran the thing out of a 
reasonably small room. Then it started to grow.
<P>
	In 1963 it changed; 1965, 1968, 1969, 1971, 1978, 1983, 1983 
again, and then we started adding to it and adding to it. What 
happened was that all of a sudden after the war C.D. Howe really 
ran the whole government from his position in the Department 
of Defence Production. He became the Minister of Industry, 
Trade and Commerce and a very powerful figure in government.
<P>
	Through his seat of power it started to expand the department 
of industry. The department of industry did not become 
obtrusive and get its tentacles into everything. For those of you 
in business who have a daily relationship with Statistics Canada 
you know exactly what I am talking about when we talk about 
intrusive.
<P>
	Walter Gordon became the minister and I am going to quote 
again from the book <I>Organizing to Govern</I> by Gordon 
Osbaldeston: ``Since their defeat in 1957 the Liberal Party have 
been honing ideas for the next election campaign. One 
individual who played a key role in ensuring that a new 
department of industry was part of the Liberal platform was 
Walter Gordon''.
<P>
	If it sounds like déja vu, it is déja vu. Someone lifted the red 
book over there and there it was all over again-how are we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6171"> 6171 </A></B>
<P>
going to go about getting elected? We are going to hone the 
Department of Industry. We are  going to get more intrusive. We 
are going to make sure that we can say, let us get on with it.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	I am quoting again: ``Gordon lead a royal commission 
appointed in 1955 to look at the economy. Few of the 
commission's recommendations were adopted by the St. 
Laurent government. When Lester B. Pearson became the new 
party leader, Gordon's ideas came to the fore and in a party that 
was looking for new ideas and keen on economic reform he 
found fertile ground. He had long been a friend of Pearson and 
now he became a trusted adviser''.
<P>
	It is really interesting to see how we got to where we are today. 
Nobody really planned it. It just sort of happened. All of a 
sudden we have $3 billion a year going through the Department 
of Industry, with that department's civil servants, bureaucrats 
and politicians picking winners and losers in the marketplace.
<P>
	I will get back to my quotation: ``The reason the Department 
of Industry was created was because Walter Gordon wanted one 
and he had the personal influence with Pearson and those close 
to him to ensure that he got it. But why did he want it? What 
pushed Gordon's thinking to a new department? Undoubtedly 
Gordon's overriding motivation was his personal philosophy 
regarding government and industry. When his royal commission 
reported in 1957 it described severe problems with foreign 
investment in Canada and an associated weakness in the 
Canadian industrial sector.
<P>
	A senior official who worked closely with Gordon on the 
royal commission described Gordon's views as follows: ``The 
whole idea of a separate governmental entity to concern itself 
with Canadian secondary industry really was inspired by Walter 
Gordon. He was an interventionist, a bit of a nationalist with a 
protectionist kind of mentality''.
<P>
	Is this not the same Liberal government opposite that signed 
the NAFTA? I will quote again: ``His protectionism took the 
form of using-'' Listen to this. This will send chills down the 
back of everyone here. You people in television land may want 
to turn your TV sets off, folks. You are not going to like what you 
hear.
<P>
	``His protectionism took the form of using government power, 
government funds, government leverage and pushing these 
things in one direction rather than another. Almost all of it had 
protectionist overtones, albeit in the form of subsidies rather 
than higher tariffs''. Where has that put us today?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> That is where the debt came from.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> It is a clue. The question is, where did the 
debt come from? We have a clue here. We are narrowing in on 
how we got a debt of $500 billion and how we are going into the 
hole. This year alone the debate is $40 billion and $110 million 
every single day.
<P>
	It is debt we are putting on to our children, our grandchildren 
and their children. Their standard of living is not going to be 
nearly as good as ours because we have been living beyond our 
means. It is immoral. It is not right. Our generation has to take 
responsibility for that debt.
<P>
	One of the things we have to do is recognize the window of 
opportunity, change and get our economy back on track, get the 
government back on track doing what government should do.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> What should government do?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> That raises the question. What should 
government do and what should the real role of government be 
in a free economy? I would submit that it is a whole lot less than 
we are doing today.
<P>
	Let me give an example of the extension of what we started 
with all the good ideas of Walter Gordon. They were well 
meaning. He certainly did not get up the morning and say: ``How 
can I wreck the country? Do you know what I would really like 
to do? I would really like to make sure my great grandchildren 
cannot afford to buy a car''. C.D. Howe did not say: ``We beat 
the Germans but we are sure going to destroy our future 
generations''. It just sort of happened but look what it has led to. 
Transfer payments in the Department of Industry. Contributions 
under technology for environmental solutions initiative, $10 
million; contributions to defence industry productivity 
programs, $158 million; contributions to Bombardier de 
Havilland.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	It should not be called the department of industry; it should be 
called the department of grants to Bombardier, de Havilland and 
SNC-Lavalin.
<P>
	Here is another one. It is over a number of years. It is 
$143,682,285. It is a 1994-95 disbursement forecast for 
contracts signed with SNC-Lavalin and subsidiaries for 
geographic programs all over the world. The $143 million is 
subsidized by little people earning 8, 10 or 12 bucks an hour.
<P>
	David Lewis, a member of the New Democratic Party in this 
House, Stephen's father, coined the phrase corporate welfare 
bums. It is true there are corporate welfare bums. We have to 
wean corporations away from the public trough. If we are stupid 
enough to make it available they are going to be smart enough to 
take it because it is their tax money as well.
<P>
	What do we do? It is fairly simple, fairly straightforward. We 
pay attention to what is going on in Alberta. There is no point in 
going through the trials and tribulations of what is going on in 
Alberta and not learning from it. The very least we can do is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6172"> 6172 </A></B>
<P>
learn from what is going on in Alberta and carry that forward to 
the whole country.
<P>
	Government must reduce its intrusion into the marketplace 
and get back to basics. Our job is to look after the infrastructure 
of the country that cannot be looked after other than through the 
national government. Above all, we should have in the 
department of industry some kind of overriding mission 
statement so that we can look at it every day and ask whether 
what we intend to do or are trying to do fits with what our plan 
should be. Do we have a goal? Do we have even clue one about 
where we want to be at the end of the day? The first thing we 
need is a mission statement.
<P>
	I submit this might be a place to start to establish and maintain 
a culture which rewards entrepreneurship, innovation and 
research and which ensures a level, honest, competitive 
marketplace. Nothing more, nothing less.
<P>
	Business people in Canada do not want a free handout from 
the government, but if we are stupid enough to give it to them 
they are going to be smart enough to take it. It is up to us to say 
no.
<P>
	Therefore I would like to move a subamendment to the Bloc 
amendment. I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the amendment be amended by striking out the word ``Quebec's'' and 
substituting the following therefor ``each province's'' and by deleting the word 
``regional''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I understand the subamendment of the 
hon. member for Edmonton Southwest was seconded by the hon. 
member for Okanagan Centre.
<P>
	The subamendment has already been submitted to the Clerk 
and has been found to be acceptable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member for Edmonton 
Southwest talked specifically about the grants that were 
processed through the department of industry and mentioned a 
few names. Most Canadians would realize that even though 
three or four names were mentioned, thousands of small and 
medium sized businesses across the country benefit from 
support from Industry Canada.
<P>
	I have a question for the member. He seems to have the point 
of view that the notion of grants should be phased out or 
eliminated. In the tax act of Canada there are tax expenditures in 
the billions of dollars to the oil and gas sector of the country that 
are the same as tax grants. Is the member suggesting that all tax 
grants in the tax act of Canada be abolished?
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for 
his very salient question. We cannot have one rule for one and a 
different rule for everybody else. Then we would be hypocrites. 
We must have one rule for everyone.
<P>
	It is interesting we use the term grants which presupposes that 
it is our money. If I have $10 and I want to give it to one of my 
kids, that is a grant; but if I am taking somebody else's money 
and giving it to someone else, that is a loan.
<P>
	I will answer the member's question directly. I think we 
should have a flat tax, yes. Without question we cannot have one 
set of rules, for example, on depletion allowances and all the rest 
of it. Income earned is income earned and we pay tax on it. Tax 
points and tax credits are exactly the same as cash that does not 
come in.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> You would abolish all 
tax credits.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Every one of them.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Right after you gave back the $70 billion 
you took under the NEP.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières):</B> Mr. Speaker, since 
this amendment was proposed by the opposition, I would like to 
know, for the benefit of the Official Opposition, what the hon. 
member for Edmonton means by the terms ``each province'' and 
by the word ``regional''. What do these two terms mean to him?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, as I understand the principle 
of the amendment, what is good for the goose is good for the 
gander. We are talking about the country as a whole, not just 
about Quebec. If it makes sense for Quebec it makes sense for 
everyone.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member's speech was very eloquent and very 
interesting. He indicated the requirement that all grants be 
reduced or eliminated to all businesses, et cetera. If all such 
moneys are eliminated I take it there would be an elimination of 
moneys and benefits to everyone, not just corporations across 
the board.
<P>
	Could the hon. member indicate whether the elimination of 
benefits to corporations are any different from the elimination 
of tax benefits such as RRSPs to individuals?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Yes, of course they are. They are entirely 
different. When we talk about eliminating grants to businesses 
which artificially change the marketplace and allow the 
government in its wisdom or lack thereof to pick winners and 
losers, it is entirely different from our fiduciary responsibility 
as citizens to look after those who are not able to look after 
themselves. We are talking about individuals who need help, not 
corporations that want help.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a question for the hon. member for Edmonton 
Southwest. Given his proposal, how does he intend to reestab-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6173"> 6173 </A></B>
<P>
lish a balance between rich areas and underprivileged areas with 
high unemployment if the government does not do anything?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, if the solution implied in my 
hon. colleague's question is that regional economic expansion is 
key to preventing and eliminating regional disparity in the 
country or in any other country, for that matter, I would send the 
question back by saying that we have been sending scads of 
money to depressed areas of the country for years. Has it 
changed anything? I submit it has not.
<P>
	I would also submit there is a situation that parallels the one 
we are talking about between the northern and the southern 
states of the United States.
<P>
<B>(1810 ) </B>
<P>
	The fastest growing economic area in North America today is 
the southern states. For years they were depressed. Gradually 
over time their economies were such that their labour rates and 
the cost of housing were lower. They had a highly motivated 
workforce and businesses started to invest in that area. Now it is 
booming.
<P>
	If trying to eliminate disparities in Canada by taking money 
from a wealthier area and transmitting it through business to a 
less favoured area works, we would not have a problem today. 
However we do. The statistics quoted by my hon. colleague from 
Yellowhead indicated that nothing has changed after years of 
sending money to these various areas through ACOA, FORD-Q, 
DREE and all such things.
<P>
	We are in exactly the same situation except we are in the hole 
by $500 billion. Even if we wanted to, we cannot afford it any 
more. We are creating and perpetuating dependency. We have to 
look for new solutions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General):</B> Mr. Speaker, I join many of my colleagues on this 
side of the House in supporting the establishment of a 
Department of Industry and I hope that this support will be 
unanimous. This new department will give Canada and 
Canadians the new tools they need to help them create jobs and 
build a more secure future.
<P>
	However, before we go any further, I think that we have to 
take into consideration the history of our country. We can 
always think of the first settlers who were supported by the 
church or by people who were put there to help them develop an 
area-in my case it was the Gaspé Peninsula-and that is how 
Quebec and Canada were built.
<P>
	There is always some degree of co-operation between the 
various elements of our society in any area, whether it be 
industry, education or, of course, the public service. But since 
then, since the 17th and 18th centuries, there was Confederation 
in 1867 and the National Policy was established under Sir John 
A. Macdonald. It was a very ambitious plan. It all started with 
the construction of the  railway better known today as CN and 
VIA Rail. This great project to link our country from east to west 
did not go unnoticed in other parts of the world.
<P>
	It was undertaken to give some impetus to the Canadian 
economy, but it could not have been done without the support of 
governments, without money being spent on the construction of 
this trans-Canada railway. Indeed, if we look at the debates held 
in 1867 in this House, we will see that there have always been 
critics of this avant-garde vision of the federal government at 
that time. But by developing the railway, that government 
believed that it was giving itself the means to develop this 
country. The resources were developed afterwards; then, thanks 
to the railway, Western Canada was populated, as well as 
Ontario and part of Quebec. Links were made between these new 
provinces, and this marked the beginning of the Canadian 
federation.
<P>
	This is a primary example of a massive intervention by the 
federal government, but in consultation and co-operation with 
business interests and also with provincial governments.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	Then came the first world war. Once again we found some 
unanimity, a will to fight for our rights, for our country, but still 
in a spirit of generalized co-operation. The same thing 
happened at the time of the Second World War when, over a 
period of five or six years, our industry, with government 
support, went from a third-rate position to making Canada the 
third or fourth greatest economic power of the time.
<P>
	As you know, before 1945, before the war, over 45 per cent of 
the Canadian population was rural. After the war years, Canada 
became an industrial power. We went through an urbanization 
phase with people leaving rural areas to settle in the city. After 
the war and initiatives like the Victory Loan Bonds to raise 
money, the government took the same approach. After six years 
of substantial interest rates, Canadians were able to invest in 
their country's own economy because they had faith in it. They 
bought into Canada.
<P>
	In 1945, 1946, and 1947, we were in a position to implement a 
demilitarization policy to foster an economy based on consumer 
spending. We became a consumer society, but that did not 
happen without the help, involvement and commitment of the 
federal government.
<P>
	My colleague opposite mentioned C. D. Howe, who 
master-minded Canadian industrial development in those years, 
and Walter Gordon. They were men of vision who laid the 
foundation of the Canadian society as we know it. Those 
developments should be seen in their historical context so we 
can better 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6174"> 6174 </A></B>
<P>
explain the goal of the present government in revitalizing the 
Canadian industry as we enter the next century.
<P>
	The 1950s came. You know that those years are often called 
the dark ages in Quebec. The province was ruled by the Union 
nationale, under Duplessis. Quebec was undergoing changes, 
but changes similar to those outside Canada.
<P>
	We then had the Quiet Revolution which, obviously, met 
many Quebecers' aspirations. We should never forget that the 
Quiet Revolution took place under a Liberal government, within 
the Canadian context and the Canadian federation. We were able 
to show Quebecers that federalism is a flexible and generous 
system which fulfils the deep-rooted aspirations of all 
Canadians.
<P>
	During the 1960s, new schools were built. University 
education was popularized and made accessible to all 
Quebecers. Of course, we must not forget that education-as is 
the case today-was financed in large part by the federal 
government. Never did the federal government dare intervene in 
this quiet revolution, never did the federal government dare 
hinder the material progress, the economic progress of all 
Quebecers. This fact must be recognized.
<P>
	In the late 1960s, more specifically in 1966, the people 
elected another Union Nationale government which claimed 
that the premier of the day, Jean Lesage, went too fast for 
Quebec. We must not forget either that Jean Lesage served as a 
minister in the federal government in the 1950s. Surely, he must 
have borrowed some ideas and solutions from his colleagues 
from Ontario and the Maritimes. I believe we must 
recognize-and I think that many researchers and specialists 
interested in Jean Lesage do recognize-that Jean Lesage's 
tenure in Ottawa served him well in developing Quebec as we 
know it today.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	That being said, more progress was made in the 1970s. In 
those days, we believed more and more in the welfare state. It is 
not a concept exclusive to Quebec or Canada, but a concept also 
known in Germany, Scandinavia, France and even England. The 
purpose of the welfare state is to make sure that everybody's 
interests, not only the interests of financiers, or people from 
Montreal and Quebec City, are taken into account.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order please. We 
are supposed to be talking to Bill C-46, the Act to establish the 
Department of Industry, tabled pursuant to decisions made in 
91-92 by Mrs. Campbell, former Prime Minister of Canada.
<P>
	Instead we are being given a history lecture which goes back 
to the Jesuits, the Quiet Revolution and the Plains of Abraham. 
We will talk about that during the upcoming referendum 
campaign. Then we will give classes in Canadian history. But 
for now, we should be talking about this Department of Industry 
Act and the member for Bonaventure-îles-de-la-Madeleine is 
completely off the subject.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I want to thank the member. He is 
right, according to Standing Orders, comments should be related 
to the matter at hand. As the member, I fail to see the relevance 
of the comments. However, since my nomination here, I have 
noticed that few people abide by that rule.
<P>
	Therefore, the parliamentary secretary has the floor once 
again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> As a Quebecer, as a younger member, Mr. 
Speaker-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. If he wants 
to go on with the lecture, I hope the member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine will not forget the 
October Crisis.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to deal with that 
issue. I find it unfortunate that we often have weird-minded 
historians. In order to understand today's society-and I 
challenge the Bloc Quebecois on this-we must fully 
understand its history, we must be very clear on our intentions to 
explain history, because it is through history that we can explain 
to the people the situation as we know it today. Nobody can 
disagree with me on some historical issues that I have raised, 
and I want to say this to you: Ask Europeans, Asians, 
Americans, and they will all tell you that Canada is a resounding 
success.
<P>
	French Canadians were able to overcome their difficulties 
when they first arrived in New France and established their own 
community. These French Canadians became part of the larger 
Canadian family, thanks to newcomers, Eastern Europeans, 
English-speaking people, even people from the United States, 
from Europe, Asian people who are coming to this country, 
because they are well aware that Canada is a country of freedom, 
of progress, a good place to live.
<P>
	That is why I demand that we take into account the historical 
value of industry, but also the history of Canada, which 
somewhat explains this bill and the objective of this 
government.
<P>
	Of course, industry is important. We are entering the 21st 
century and I believe that we must prepare ourselves 
accordingly. But instead of telling you about history, I will tell 
you about global reality. I know that it is an issue which deeply 
concerns members of the opposition parties.
<P>
	The Prime Minister of Canada is setting up Team Canada. We 
had a hockey team called Team Canada and we were very 
successful. Now, we are going to have an industrial and 
economic Team Canada whose mandate will be to create new 
markets for all Canadians. Besides, as you know, we even asked 
the newly elected Premier of Quebec, Mr. Parizeau, to be part of 
the team, because what we are trying to do is make sure we get 
the contracts and ensure sustainable economic development for 
all Canadians. This is what we must kept in mind.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="6175"> 6175 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	Again, why China, why go to China, why are Canadians so 
welcome in China? I want to know. I bet that some of you never 
heard of Dr. Bethune, a Montrealer, a Quebecer who did a lot for 
China during the 1949 revolution. It is because we have built ties 
with that country as with others.
<P>
	By creating this department, we are saying that there are 
changes, that we are increasingly recognizing that 80 percent of 
the jobs today are created by small businesses. We know that we 
have invested in megaprojects in the past, at both the federal and 
provincial levels. This was a joint endeavour. Quebec invested 
in James Bay. In Montreal, there were substantial municipal 
investments in the Metro. There were also large investments in 
regional economic development, but I will come back to that.
<P>
	We must recognize that industrial development requires close 
co-operation between governments and companies in order to 
make Canadians more competitive on the eve of the 21st 
century. As you know, Canadians, Quebecers, the Western 
World in general, are faced with extremely strong, well 
organized competition. Look at the seven small tigers. Who had 
heard of Singapore ten years ago? Who would have thought 
twenty years ago that South Korea would rise to the point it is 
now? Who talked about Taiwan? Who would have imagined 
China as a competitor? Who could have predicted the fall of the 
Berlin wall?
<P>
	We have lived through tremendous changes these past few 
years. Free enterprise won over the tyrannic powers of the world 
without a fight. Changes are occurring and I believe that this 
reorganization of Industry Canada will take them into account. 
Although the opposition was saying that we were still in the 
1960s, I believe they are sticking to a nationalistic view which, 
in my opinion, does not represent the real aspirations of 
Quebecers and Canadians who want jobs.
<P>
	With the new Department of Industry and the help of new 
technologies, we will be able to steer small businesses towards 
new markets. Our advantage is that Canada is a well-known 
entity. When you go to your banker to ask for a loan, he wants to 
know your past history, he wants to know if you have a good 
credit rating. Do you have any business experience? Do you 
have any experience in your present field of endeavour? Do you 
have resources-In any case, I am grateful to the members of the 
opposition for talking a little bit about the natural resources of 
this country. It is important for investors, it is important to 
realize that Canada possesses not only natural resources but also 
a qualified population to meet challenges.
<P>
	The basic role of Industry Canada is to bring together those 
various participants of the federal government and to improve 
planning.
<P>
	As you know-I realize, Mr. Speaker, that I only have one 
minute left although I could have spoken for half an  
hour-history is important in order to better explain to the 
opposition and enlighten it on the real issues that all Canadians 
expect to come to the fore: job creation, close co-operation, and 
not the upheaval or modification of a well-known system.
<P>
	There will be a referendum in Quebec and I can assure you 
federalism will not be put on trial. It will be our task to explain 
to you, loud and clear, the essence of federalism as we all know 
it today.
<P>

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="IMMIGRATION">IMMIGRATION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have often 
mentioned in the House the dramatic situation in Rwanda. 
Among other things I asked the government to help the 
thousands of Rwandan refugees. On June 13, I asked the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration a question concerning the case of Léon Mugesera, 
a Rwandan national who came to Canada in 1993 and who some 
believe is responsible for slaughters that have taken place in 
Rwanda. The Quebec association of Rwandan immigrants has 
made very serious allegations to this effect.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary told me that Immigration Canada 
was conducting an investigation into this case. I hope the 
investigation results will be made public today.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The situation is still extremely difficult in Rwanda. The UN 
High Commissioner for Refugees has denounced the massacres 
perpetrated by the Rwandan Patriotic Army. These massacres 
have resulted in the deaths and maimings of thousands of 
Rwandans. The refugee camps in Ngara, Tanzania are full of 
Rwandans. Half a million Rwandans have been massacred. Over 
two million Rwandans are refugees in Zaire, Uganda and 
Burundi. Unfortunately the genocide of the Rwandan people is 
not yet over. Many relatives of the victims live in Canada.
<P>
	Through humanitarian action Canada has tried to do its part. 
However concerning the level of acceptance of Rwandan 
refugees into Canada, the actions of the Canadian government 
are still very insufficient. Only 96 refugee status claims have 
been referred between January 1 and June 30, 1994 of which the 
majority, 63, have been in Quebec. However the majority of the 
accepted cases were students who had already been in Canada.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6176"> 6176 </A></B>
<P>
	There is no special program to receive Rwandan refugees, as 
was the case for the former Yugoslavia and for other countries. 
Our country must be more generous with regard to the Rwandan 
victims and those being persecuted. A lot of criticism has been 
expressed regarding the embassy at Nairobi; many Rwandan 
refugees are not even able to put forward a visa application 
there.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I wish to thank the Canadian NGOs for their excellent job in 
helping the people of Rwanda, including the following 
organizations from Quebec: YMCA, Oxfam Québec, Catholic 
Organization for Development and Peace, as well as several 
religious communities, particularly the Jesuits. I also want to 
underline the great job done by the four 
organizations-Proveda, Oxfam, CECI and Amitié 
Rwanda-Canada-which created Urgence Canada-Rwanda and 
contributed generously to the more than four million dollars in 
humanitarian aid collected in Québec.
<P>
	Development and Peace alone already collected $1,800,000 to 
finance emergency relief programs. From now on, the 
government of Canada, particularly through CIDA, and the 
NGOs should direct their efforts to encouraging the safe return 
of the refugees who presently live in inhumane conditions in 
neighbouring countries. They should encourage national 
reconciliation programs in Rwanda and give strong support to 
the democratization process in that country devastated by civil 
war.
<P>
	I want to reiterate my solidarity with the people and the 
victims of the tragedy in Rwanda.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
thank the hon. member for his comments and give a very brief 
response, as the member's statement did not relate specifically 
to the question he had asked at the time.
<P>
	As we all know, the situation in Rwanda has been in turmoil 
for months. The world watched horrified as thousands were 
butchered, most of them Tutsis targeted by Hutu rivals. Now 
there are reports of Hutus being tracked down by vengeful 
Tutsis. In such a situation it is obviously very, very difficult to 
operate under the normal conditions of the immigration and 
refugee process. There is no question that Canada is deeply 
concerned.
<P>
	The hon. member asks us to see the peaceful relocation or 
return to their homes of those who are in neighbouring 
countries. That may or may not as yet be possible because of the 
turmoil and difficulties. As he says, a great many of the refugees 
or those who would be refugees to Canada are not able to get to 
the Canadian offices in Zaire or neighbouring countries. There 
is the problem that there are dangers for Canadian personnel as 
well.
<P>
	The situation is extremely tumultuous. The minister and the 
government are looking at it very closely. We are very aware of 
our humanitarian duties and will carry them out as best we can.

House stand adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. pursuant to
