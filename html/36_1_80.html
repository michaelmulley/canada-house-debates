</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
for Canadians of Hellenic decent March 25 signifies one of the 
most important days of the Hellenic heritage.  On March 25, 1821 
the revolutionary trend for national independence burst out in a 
massive revolution that swept away the Ottoman empire which had 
occupied Greece for well over 400 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the support of the allied forces of Europe, Great Britain, 
France and Russia, Greece was recognized as an independent state. 
For most people the struggle for independence represents a 
triumph of justice and liberal values against slavery and 
brutality.  For others the massive Greek revolution exemplified 
the values of classical Greece and Christianity against the 
darkness of occupation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, the contributions of people like Lord Byron of 
England, George Jarvis, Edward Everett and an array of scholars 
and ordinary people made the supreme sacrifice in the name of 
independence, liberalism, justice and, most of all, freedom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Knowing very well how we Canadians value our rights and 
freedoms, let us join together in celebrating Greek Independence 
Day, March 25, 1821.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Pierre Cote held hearings in Quebec City to limit referendum 
funding to discourage a repeat of the Montreal rally.  He is so 
very wrong.  Canada's unity spirit is not bought with cheap 
flights.  He cannot stop the Canadian will by limiting mere 
dollars.  He cannot abate our support for Canada by writing new 
laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians together celebrate our solidarity with Quebeckers. 
Canadians are there for floods, ice storms and for unity. 
Canadians will travel again and again when called.  No mere man, 
no sum of money, no written law will sever our Canadian bonds. We 
will come by plane, by bus, by train.  We will be there in 
thought.  We will not fail in our task to give support to our 
fellow citizens in Quebec, to give support to a Canada in need.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The B.C. salmon crisis is a recent problem.  It was not 
inherited from the Tories.  The Prime Minister might try to point 
fingers at others for the east coast fishery crisis, but who will

fisheries minister or himself? 
<P><A NAME="LINK33"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans,

west coast problem we are facing at the present time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First is the cyclical nature of salmon in any event and it was 
predicted that this would be a low cycle year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second is El Nino which has played hob with predictions on the 
west coast and indeed with salmon returns.  We have problems with 
prices which are now one-third of what they were nine years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the hon. member's question because this is an 
historic day.  For two days in a row in his first two questions 
he has asked about British Columbia salmon for the first time in

a regional problem.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
millennium fund project is losing its lustre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of Quebec is criticizing this project and feels that the 
federal government has no business in this sector.  Even Quebec 
Liberals are trying to help the federal government out of the 
mess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since even Quebec federalists are refusing to throw their support 
behind the millennium fund project, will the Prime Minister admit 
that, if he sticks to his guns on this one, he is going to start 
another fight with Quebec? 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
think that students in Quebec, as everywhere else, are very 
anxious to get their hands on these scholarships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the finance minister included in the last budget a system by 
which parents can set money aside to put their children through 
university, this is not interference in education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are doing is giving young people in Quebec the 
opportunity to benefit from the education system.  I think this 
is what we have been doing for a very long time and we have been 
doing it in many sectors, because this is not about disagreement, 
but about giving the youth of Quebec more opportunities. 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
seems that there is not even agreement within his Cabinet on this 
issue.  Those working directly with the Minister of Human 
Resources Development say that nobody wants to meet with the 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the Prime Minister aware that his Minister of Human Resources 
Development is not even capable of meeting with Quebec's 
education sector, including students, because the latter are 
demanding that the Government of Quebec be present at these 
meetings, and that the federal government has no other choice 
now but to rethink its decision? 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, any little snippet can be 
distorted when taken out of context.  It is absolutely 
ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already met with the Fédération des étudiants 
universitaires du Québec.  I have spoken with a number of 
stakeholders in the education sector in recent weeks because we 
want this project to be a success for Quebec's students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to see that this project benefits the students, who 
will decide which institutions they wish to attend, but they will 
have this access. We are going to implement the project in a 
manner entirely consistent with the existing systems in Quebec, 
which we are already funding through the Canada student loans 
program. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, part I of Bill C-36, which establishes the 
Canada Millennium Scholarship Foundation, confirms what we all 
knew, namely that the foundation will have an administrative 
structure, whose members will get paid for their services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has always said that the foundation would never 
duplicate existing loans and scholarships programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How then can he explain how the structures required to manage 
this scholarship fund do not amount to duplication? 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the foundation will operate at 
arm's length from the government and will work with the 
appropriate provincial authorities to avoid any duplication of 
existing services. It will complement what is already provided by 
provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The foundation will be in charge of the first selection and 
awarding of the fellowships and it could even sign contracts 
with the approriate provincial authorities. 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, should the minister not listen to reason and 
give the money that he intends to spend, if not waste, on his 
scholarships and on its administrative structure to the Quebec 
government, which would use it to restore funding to 
post-secondary education? 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this government has a vision. It 
wants to help young people gain the knowledge they will need in 
the economy of the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason we established a millennium scholarship fund instead 
of building new concrete structures or monuments is that we have 
a vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The foundation does have a structure, but it also has a 
responsibility to get money from the private sector. Indeed, we 
hope that the private sector will contribute to the millennium 
fund, so as to promote knowledge and prepare Canada for 
tomorrow's economy.

yesterday the federal human rights commission delivered a strong

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, with what we have done already, there is a bill in the 
House of Commons at this time to re-establish $1.5 billion to the 
health care system.  It is exactly the level of $12.5 billion 
that was recommended to the government by the national forum on 
health.  The budget has a series of initiatives for investment in 
medical research, AIDS research and other programs related to 
health to help people.  We have done it.  We want to do it in the 
years to come—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in the 
budget there is not one new cent in health care transfers. 
Yesterday the human rights commission stated: “Poverty is a 
serious breach of equality rights and has no place in a 
prosperous country like Canada”.  Unlike this government, the 
commission recognizes the dangers in the widening gap between the 
rich and everyone else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the Prime Minister is simple.  Will he make the 
commitment today to include poverty and homelessness as 
prohibited grounds for discrimination in Canada's human rights 
legislation?  Will he do that, yes or no? 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this government has indicated 
that it is going to undertake a major review of the Canadian 
Human Rights Act in the coming months.  I suggest that it is 
quite apparent to everyone that as part of that review, we will 
be looking at the possibility of including a ground of social 
disadvantage or poverty.  We look forward to hearing from 
Canadians on that issue before we prejudge the conclusion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
auditor general is the Canadian taxpayer's watchdog in Ottawa. 
The millennium scholarship fund is to be funded with $2.5 billion 
worth of Canadian taxpayer money, yet the budget implementation 
legislation does not give the auditor general any right of access 
to the books of the foundation. Could the Minister of Finance 
explain why the auditor general will not have access to the 
foundation's books? 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the auditor general will have access to the millennium 
fund's books. 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
budget implementation legislation does not guarantee access for 
the auditor general and it is well known that there has been a 
public dispute between the Minister of Finance and the auditor 
general.  Is the minister's fight with the auditor general the 
real reason the auditor general's access to the foundation's 
books has not been guaranteed? 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, there will be an independent board that will have the 
right to make its decisions and to make its nominations but, as 
with all things, if the auditor general would like to have access 
to those books, it will be arranged.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Connie Jacobs 
and her son Ty died tragically this week when the RCMP tribal 
police and a band social worker tried to seize six children from 
Mrs. Jacobs' home on the Tsuu T'ina reserve.  This is not a time 
for political finger pointing.  It is time to grieve for Connie 
and Ty and to pledge to solve the root problems that led to this 
tragic shooting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginal people are calling for a judicial inquiry.  Will the 
Indian affairs minister ensure that the root causes of this 
tragedy are thoroughly investigated and not just the shooting 
itself? 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as I informed the House yesterday, we are investigating 
this.  A criminal investigation has started.  The province of 
Alberta has jurisdiction in this case.  I understand that even as 
we speak, Phil Fontaine, representatives of the local first 
nation and the RCMP are meeting with the attorney general's 
office in Alberta.  I suspect there may be an announcement as 
early as today.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the wrong minister answered the last question.  This 
shooting on the Tsuu T'ina reserve raises many troubling 
questions that go way beyond legalities.  Why is it that Connie 
Jacobs and the six children who were living with her were living 
in such squalor when this band is not poor?   Why are so many 
reserves plagued with alcoholism, drug abuse and violence when 
Parliament gives this minister's department so much authority and 
so much money to deal with these problems?

issue.  It is a tragic event.  Many people are calling for calm

is for the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-36 indicates that the government intends to increase the 
period a student cannot include student loans in a bankruptcy 
from two to ten years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By increasing to ten years, the usual repayment period, the time 
that must elapse before a student loan may be included in a

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a look

my question is for the Secretary of State for Asia-Pacific. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbia has caught a case of the Asian flu which 
affected the economy of the Pacific rim in 1997. How is the 
Liberal government showing leadership in restoring the economy 
and helping B.C. in business and jobs? 
<P><A NAME="LINK91"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Raymond Chan (Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific), 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, our government is indeed very concerned 
about the Asian financial crisis and its impact on British 
Columbia.  That is why we are supporting international efforts to 
stabilize the troubled Asian countries.  At the same time we 
continue to promote job growth and exports by organizing Team 
Canada and other trade missions to the region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We continue also to invest in technologies in British Columbia. 
Just a couple of weeks ago the Minister of Industry announced a 
$300 million project with MDA in B.C. to build a new satellite.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has a rule that any companies 
unloading oil off ships in Canada have to pay a fee.  Fair 
enough. What is not fair is they are forced to pay a different 
amount depending on the province they are in.  Same oil, 
different price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec for example it costs 44 cents to unload a tonne of oil 
but in Ontario it is $1.85.  In the minister's own home province 
it is $1.52, almost four times as much as in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the minister from B.C. in charge of this fee 
discriminating against B.C. businesses and consumers?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans,

is simply inaccurate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a double system whereby the coast guard provides 
standard services across the country.  We in addition have 
response organizations organized by private industry.  They must 
have the capability of dealing with a spill of 10,000 tonnes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of different volumes which are moved in different areas 
and the different requirements for the equipment to be kept in 
stock, there are different costs.  In some areas, to get the same 
level of environmental protection one must pay more.

He is actually the minister from Ottawa to B.C. telling B.C. how

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>STANDING COMMITTEE ON JUSTICE AND HUMAN RIGHTS—SPEAKER'S RULING 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK132"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am now prepared to rule on the point 
of order raised on Tuesday, March 24, 1998 by the House leader of 
the official opposition.  I would like to thank the opposition 
House leader and the member for Windsor—St. Clair, who chairs 
the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, for their 
contributions on this matter. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House leader of the official opposition argued that the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights was not complying 
with the terms of an order of reference of the House contained in 
two motions adopted on October 30, 1997. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first motion was presented as part of the business of 
supply.  He called on the government to present a motion under 
Standing Order 68(4), instructing the committee to prepare and 
bring in a bill concerning penalties for impaired driving.  The 
motion further stipulated that once the committee was so 
instructed, it should report by May 15, 1998.  That motion was 
adopted by the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the adoption of that motion, a second motion, 
introduced by the Minister of Human Resources Development 
pursuant to Standing Order 68(4), instructed the committee to 
prepare and bring in such a bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Windsor—St. Clair, as chair of the justice 
committee, argued that there was no deadline contained in the 
motion supplied to the committee as its order of reference by 
Journals branch.  She further maintained that while the committee 
had every intention of complying with the order of reference, 
pressure of other business referred to the committee by this 
House would prevent it's dealing with it immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having looked into the matter, it appears that the basic 
confusion arises from an original misunderstanding about the 
order of reference given to the committee.  I understand that the 
text of orders of reference to committees are duly noted within 
the Committees and Legislative Services Directorate and that each 
committee is advised accordingly of any new order of reference it 
receives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reference is simply an extract from the actual <I>Journals</I> 
published by the House which are the official minutes of our 
proceedings and the record of our decisions.  Ordinarily an order 
of reference is contained within a single motion, and this may be 
where the confusion has arisen.  I understand that only the 
minister's motion was originally communicated to the committee 
through the usual channels within the directorate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have reviewed the two motions carefully.  It is clear to me 
that these motions must be read in conjunction one with the 
other.  The first motion presented as part of the business of 
supply contains two parts.  The first part calls on the 
government to move a motion of instruction to the committee 
pursuant to Standing Order 68(4).  The second part sets out a 
deadline to apply once such a motion of instruction has been 
adopted by the House.  The second of the two motions is of course 
the motion of instruction itself presented by the minister and 
unanimously adopted by the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once the motion of instruction presented by the minister was 
adopted, the deadline contained in the earlier motion adopted by 
the House became applicable, as this had already been agreed to 
by the House in adopting the supply motion as amended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore my decision that the instructions to the justice 
committee adopted by the House October 30, 1997 do include a 
reporting deadline of May 15, 1998. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, it appears that the committee has been operating in 
good faith on the understanding that its instructions did not 
contain a deadline for reporting back a draft bill on impaired 
driving. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that in a matter as serious and complex as the 
preparation of legislation, the time which remains for the 
committee to carry out this work is short, particularly given its 
other responsibilities on other fronts.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP)</B> moved for 
leave to introduce Bill C-385, an act to amend the Marriage 
(Prohibited Degrees) Act (marriage between persons of the same 
sex). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, the purpose of this enactment is to 
confirm that a marriage is not invalid by reason solely of the 
fact that the parties are of the same gender.  While federal 
statute law is silent on the capacity of gay and lesbian people 
to enter into marriage with their partners, a Liberal MP has 
tabled a bill that would deny gay and lesbian couples who wish to 
marry the right to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe our relationships should be celebrated and affirmed as

the definition of the term spouse in the Income Tax Act and the 
Canada pension plan to ensure that the same financial and fiscal 
benefits relating to pensions are available to both heterosexual 
and homosexual couples.  The current law which is being 
challenged in the courts denies equality to gay and lesbian 
people.  We pay income tax and make contributions to the Canada 
pension plan and our partners should be entitled to equal 
benefits and other equal responsibilities as heterosexual 
couples.

signed by several Albertans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They say that they want to draw the attention of the House to 
the following: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That as deeply concerned citizens they believe that the 
provocation defence, as it is currently used in femicide and wife 
slaughter cases, inappropriately and unjustly changes the focus 
of the criminal trial from the behaviour of the accused and his 
intention to murder to the behaviour of the victim who from then 
on is identified as the one responsible for the accused violence.

agreements which, in the name of liberalizing trade and

health care goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They see this agreement as being flawed in so far as it seeks to 
protect the rights of investors without seeking similar 
protection for workers through binding core labour standards.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Karygiannis (Scarborough—Agincourt, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise today to present a 
petition from several hundreds of constituents of 
Scarborough—Agincourt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners indicate that the Government of Ontario has 
already breached its own agreements with provincially funded 
housing co-operatives and has threatened to introduce legislation 
to cancel the contracts and operating agreements of housing 
co-operatives participating in federal programs once the federal 
government devolves its responsibility to the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners also indicate that the interests of the 
co-operative housing owners and members can be protected in these 
negotiations only if the Government of Canada insists that there 
be specific safeguards preventing the province of Ontario from 
using its legislative authority to cancel existing contracts and 
operating agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the petitioners call upon Parliament to ask the 
minister responsible for the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation to immediately suspend negotiations on social housing 
with the province of Ontario and to resume negotiations only if 
the minister proceeds under publicly declared principles 
established with the input of co-operative housing stakeholders.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.)</B> moved: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That in relation to Bill C-36, an act to implement certain 
provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on February 24, 
1998, not more than two further sitting days shall be allotted to 
the consideration of the second reading stage of the said bill 
and, fifteen minutes before the expiry of the time provided for 
government business on the second day allotted to the 
consideration of the second reading stage of the said bill, any 
proceedings before the House shall be interrupted, if required 
for the purpose of this Order, and in turn every question 
necessary for the disposal of the stage of the bill then under 
consideration shall be put forthwith and successively without 
further debate or amendment. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The net effect of the motion put forward by the House 
leader is to invoke closure, something that the hon. member 
opposed when he was a member of the opposition.  This is pure 
hypocrisy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I do not hear any point of order 
coming from the hon. member on that point.  I think he may wish 
to debate the merits of the motion but that is not for a point of 
order. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the 
motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those in favour of the motion will please 
say yea.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> In my opinion the yeas have it.

count.

outcome, I think we will leave the vote undisturbed.  Hon. 
members may have noticed that I was indicating that members did 
have to remain in the House at the end of the vote for the yeas 
and that I was administering appropriate chastisement. I think 
that in these circumstances hon. members will seek to remain in 
the House, in compliance with the rules, during a vote and we 
will leave it at that.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>SECOND READING 
</H4><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK199">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from March 24 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-36, an act to implement certain provisions of the budget 
tabled in Parliament on February 24, 1998, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee, and of the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Resuming debate.  When the debate was 
interrupted on this bill, the hon. member for Markham had the 
floor.  He has three minutes remaining in his speech. 
<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, one of the 
important issues that was not acknowledged in this budget by the 
federal government was the millennium bug, commonly known as the 
year 2000 problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The year 2000 is less than 20 months away and there was no 
mention of its repercussions by the Minister of Finance in his 
budget.  No attention was given to the significant cost and 
consequences this problem will have on Canadian businesses.  No 
mention was made as to the aspirations of this government in 
combating the huge implications of this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the report by the Task Force Year 2000 released in February 
this year, it was recommended that the federal government 
introduce revenue neutral tax incentives, measures that focus 
primarily on small and medium size enterprises.  It recommended 
that there be no delay in implementing this.  The Minister of 
Finance ignored this recommendation and did nothing for small 
business enterprises in his budget respecting the year 2000 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party feels that we urgently need to immediately 
implement formal action using the tax incentive levers available. 
The minister has missed his chance to make this incentive 
available to businesses at the earliest possible time. Now 
businesses may struggle on their own to attack this inevitable 
deadline of the next millennium with no monetary or tax relief 
from the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the 1998 budget may go down in history for being 
the first balanced budget in 28 years.  However it will not be a 
budget that is to be remembered by Canadians as the budget that 
helped Canadians get ahead in life.  The 1998 budget should have 
included initiatives to put money back into the pockets of the 
taxpayers. The 1998 budget should have introduced policy 
decisions that would have provided relief to small businesses, 
tax relief to Canadians, lowered the federal debt level and 
restored dollars to the provinces for health care, education and 
social assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have indicated, the 1998 federal budget does little in the 
way of providing for taxpaying Canadians.  We are not content to 
see the government spend away their sacrifices.  We want to see 
more money and more jobs for Canadians.  We must keep young 
Canadians in Canada and give them the opportunity their parents 
have had.  It is crucial that we solve the alarming trend that 
has come to be known as the Canadian brain drain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxes are still too high in this country.  They penalize 
initiative. Taxes slow investment, investment that creates jobs. 
The result is that investment is being driven outside Canada.  We 
also know that taxes encourage highly skilled entrepreneurial 
Canadians to seek their futures in other countries.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member was speaking 
about small business.  I would like the hon. member to recognize 
that small business benefits from balanced budgets, low interest 
rates and low inflation.  The tax relief which was provided in 
this last budget took 400,000 Canadians off the tax rolls.  It 
provided relief to 90% of Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talked about the debt level.  The hon. member 
only has to read the budget to understand that this budget 
contains measures that will actually decrease the value of the 
budget and keep the debt to GDP ratio on a continued downward 
track, which is really the measure that is used by countries 
around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to draw the member's attention back to the 1989 Wilson 
budget.  He only has to look at that budget to realize that his 
party added the surtax, raised corporate taxes and raised 
personal income taxes.  It did everything that he now stands up 
in this House and accuses this government of doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would only hope that the hon. member could stand in his place 
and recognize that this budget, for the first time in a long 
time, has started to give Canadians hope. As we have said, the 
tax cuts are modest.  We will continue on that track. I hope the 
hon. member would stand up so that constituents in his riding 
could hear him say that this budget is on the right track for the 
first time in decades.  It certainly is not as a result of what 
the Tories have done, and it certainly is not as a result of the 
Reform Party across the way which does nothing but heckle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind the 
hon. member that the way the Liberals got to this balanced budget 
was by one of the initiatives which was brought in by the 
Conservatives when they were in power, the free trade agreement. 
The free trade agreement has yielded incremental tax revenues of 
approximately $25 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member said that the government helped small business 
by taking 400,000 Canadians off the tax rolls.  How does that 
help small business?  I did not see any tax relief in here, like 
reducing the employment insurance premium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday we heard in the industry committee that as high as 30% 
of small and medium size businesses could be out of business by 
the year 2000.  I did not see any tax relief to help those 
businesses move into the next millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at the debt level, now that we have balanced the 
budget and the Liberals put in a contingency reserve of $3 
billion, I would have brought in a balanced budget or debt 
reduction law.  The way they are dealing with the $3 billion, it 
will take 200 years to pay it back.  They could have done a lot 
more to assure Canadians of the long term stability of this 
country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
wonder if the hon. member who just spoke would like to elaborate 
a little more on the possible implications and the possible 
results that could obtain for example with hospitals in their 
intensive care units not having some of the embedded chips in 
certain parts of their control switches for the monitoring 
systems.   What kind of an impact could that have on the 
intensive care units in some of our hospitals? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could he expand on that a little further as the hon. member is 
somewhat familiar with this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Kelowna for the question. He and I sit on the same committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are starting to realize the very seriousness of the year 2000 
problem.  It is probably the biggest disaster since the second 
world war that could affect the world.  We are talking about $6 
billion just to fix the problem.  Who knows what the legal 
ramifications will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday we had a presentation on the embedded chips.  It is 
not that easy to fix something.  They are embedded in 
instruments, equipment and technology, maybe 300 or 400 chips at 
a time.  It is the cost of replacing them. 
If critical equipment shuts down in a hospital, the impact on 
health care could be severe, lives could be lost or the 
information obtained or the diagnostics given could be wrong.  If 
the problem has not been addressed, it could also cause legal 
ramifications for hospitals or other agencies.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
gives me no great pleasure to stand today in the House to state 
the budget is not a very big winner back home in the province of 
Newfoundland and Labrador.  Yes, we are all very much aware the 
budget has been balanced, but we have to ask ourselves at what 
price to the people of Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a 35% cut in transfer payments to the various 
provinces to achieve that balance, a 35% cut in moneys dedicated 
to health and post-secondary education.  As a result, health and 
education services provided by the provinces have been cut 
severely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a poorer province like Newfoundland, the provincial 
government does not have the financial wherewithal or ability to 
make up for the reductions.  The effect of the cuts in 
Newfoundland has been more severe than it would be in most 
provinces in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out to the government that the minister of finance of 
Newfoundland was quite quick to condemn the budget a couple of 
weeks ago, and well he should have condemned it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the budget, the health care system, which 
incidentally has made Canada the envy of the world, is now a mere 
shadow of its former self.  In post-secondary education the 
federal cuts have driven up tuition rates and students, 
especially those in Atlantic Canada, can least afford these 
increases.  Our students, not only those in Newfoundland and 
Labrador but students all over Canada, are graduating from 
various universities and post-secondary education institutions 
with a debt load that is equal to a small mortgage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, while student debt relief measures might be welcome, 
they should be recognized as a federal bandage on a wound caused 
by federal cuts in the first place.  I do not think the 
government deserves a great amount of credit for the modest 
increases it has given to students across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget makes a great deal of the $7 billion increase in 
federal transfers to the provinces.  However, in the case of 
Newfoundland, that only slows down the rate of cuts announced in 
previous budgets, and there have been cuts in previous budgets. 
We still receive less and less money in each of the next several 
years.  This budget will cost the provincial government, as the 
provincial minister of finance has already indicated, in excess 
of $30 million.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to undo the damage that has already been done 
Newfoundland needs an increase, not a smaller decrease, in 
federal transfers for health and post-secondary education in 
particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real tragedy in the budget for Newfoundland is that it 
contains no real job creation effort.  The federal government 
seems to be quite happy with the fact that the national 
unemployment rate has gone down to 9%.  We rejoice and 
congratulate the government and everyone who is responsible for 
bringing the unemployment rate down to 9%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, that is cold comfort for Newfoundland and Labrador.  We 
have an unemployment rate that is double the national average. We 
have an unemployment rate that is officially up around 19.5%. 
There are many communities within the riding of St. John's East 
which has an unemployment rate of 60% or 70%.  For these people 
that is cold comfort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also had a net outmigration in Newfoundland last year of 
9,200 people.  If this number were added to the official 
unemployment of 19.5% in my province, our unemployment rate would 
be up around 22% or 23%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, there was news this week that possibly there would 
not be a follow up on the TAGS program.  Thousands of people in 
the fishery are about to come off the TAGS program who are not 
yet included in the statistics.  If the 20,000-odd people who 
will be coming off TAGS were added to the 19.5% unemployment rate 
for our province, the unemployment rate would probably be in 
excess of 22% or 23%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In balancing the budget the federal government has laid off as 
well roughly 15% of the nation's federal employees.  Newfoundland 
and Labrador, the poorest province in Canada, took the biggest 
hit in terms of federal employees being laid off with roughly 30% 
of them being laid off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An economic development fund has been set out in the budget for 
northern Ontario.  I do not begrudge the people of northern 
Ontario their economic development fund, but Newfoundland has the 
highest unemployment rate in the country and as yet we do not 
even have a commitment from the federal government that there 
will be a follow up program on TAGS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about the tax rates in our province and in Canada 
generally.  The tax rates are far too high.  They act as a 
disincentive to job creation.  Tax cuts announced in the budget 
are very modest indeed.  They are not large enough to kickstart 
the nation's domestic economy.  No matter how we look at it, this 
is not a jobs budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One more matter of importance to the people of Newfoundland and 
Labrador is the equalization program.  It keeps the province from 
starving and from moving ahead as well.  Revenues raised from 
major economic projects such as Voisey's Bay and Terra Nova are 
deducted dollar for dollar from our equalization payments. 
With equalization payments currently running at about $900 
million a year in Newfoundland, we need to raise a billion 
dollars in revenue to be $100 million better off.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes it very difficult for a have not province, a poorer 
province, to catch up under our current equalization formula.  We 
need a better formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Hibernia a special deal was negotiated that would 
see us losing only 70 cents on the equalization dollar.  We need 
a more generous arrangement for equalization entitlements. We 
need that arrangement extended to other resource developments if 
we are ever to catch up to the various provinces, especially 
those in central Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, the government is celebrating that the federal books 
are balanced.  It sees light at the end of the federal tunnel. 
However the health and education systems run by the various 
provinces are in a shambles.  They are in tatters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bad news for the unemployed people of the country and the 
people of Atlantic Canada in particular is that they will remain 
unemployed.  For many Canadian citizens, especially people in 
Atlantic Canada, there is no light at the end of their tunnel. As 
I said earlier, the books have been balanced, but at what price 
to some of the provinces and their people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having balanced the nation's books, it is now time to start 
balancing opportunities in the nation.  In Newfoundland and 
Labrador we want to be part of that Canadian dream without having 
to chase that dream all over Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the member covered a lot of ground.  I wanted to make a comment 
about the health aspects of the budget implications and ask him a 
question about his final comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He will well know that transfers to the provinces are comprised 
of two components:  the cash component and tax points that were 
seconded to the provinces, which are basically the taxing 
authority of the provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The net reduction in transfers to the province of Ontario under 
the Canada health and social transfer were some $850 million, 
whereas concurrently the Government of Ontario, the Mike Harris 
government, cut personal income taxes by $4.3 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Five provinces have balanced budgets and have not seen fit to 
invest more into health care.  Many of them are following the 
recommendations and the observations of the national forum on 
health which says that it is not a matter of money but of how 
wisely the money in the system is spent.  Each province will have 
to look at that carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the member results from his final comments.  He 
said to the people of Newfoundland that they would remain 
unemployed.  He also said that there was no light at the end of 
the tunnel for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think the government has given up on the people of 
Newfoundland.  I am sorry the member has.  A number of 
opportunities are facing us.  One of the reasons members of 
Parliament are here is to work on behalf of all Canadians, 
especially those in most need like those in the province of 
Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member like to rise and maybe withdraw his comments 
with regard to the position of the people of Newfoundland? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me say to the hon. 
member that I do not have to withdraw because I did not make the 
comment specifically about the people of Newfoundland and 
Labrador.  The comment I made applies to the people of Atlantic 
Canada generally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a bad news budget for the people of Atlantic Canada. 
There are no job creation efforts in the budget.  It is the same 
old song and dance routine with the Liberals.  They talk about 
the band-aid but they ignore the gaping cut they have created in 
the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talked about transfers to the various provinces. 
I am sorry I did not have a little more time to go into them. The 
budget and the CHST cash transfers to the various provinces are 
unfair.  Ontario, Alberta and B.C., the three richest provinces 
in Canada, are all getting an increase, albeit a modest increase, 
in their cash transfers. 
Yet provinces like Newfoundland, P.E.I., Quebec, New Brunswick, 
Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia are feeling the pinch from 
this budget.  These are the provinces that have been hit the 
hardest.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same song and dance routine from this government.  I 
did not make the statement that the people of Newfoundland and 
Labrador specifically have no future or that there is no light at 
the end of the tunnel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many good things are happening in Newfoundland. There is the 
Hibernia project.  The Terra Nova project will soon kick in. 
Voisey's Bay hopefully in the not too distant future will start 
up. These are things which will happen in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need jobs now in Newfoundland and Labrador. Nine thousand 
two-hundred people a year are leaving our province.  It may not 
be a significant number in Ontario but when there is a population 
of 500,000, 9,200 people a year is a very, very significant 
number. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year school enrolment in Newfoundland went down by 4,200 
students, 4.3%. That is very dangerous in a province with a small 
population base.  If that continues and if the federal government 
does not make some commitment to job creation, or at least give 
some indication of a post-TAGS program, then we are going to see 
the next outmigration from our province double what it is now.  I 
really fear for that little province.  Newfoundland should not 
have that kind of haemorrhaging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are young people coming out of university on a daily basis 
who cannot stop at the university door.  They go to the airport 
immediately and head to other provinces, like B.C. and Ontario. 
We are educating people, spending hundreds of thousands of 
dollars a year on education in Newfoundland, to have those people 
travel to B.C., Ontario and Alberta. We have a great deal of 
concern about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I should advise the House that the 
five hours allowed for speeches of 20 minutes with questions and 
comments have now expired.  We will now begin 10 minute speeches 
without questions and comments. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in considering Bill C-36, an act to implement certain 
provisions of the budget, it is important to remember that the 
1998 budget marks a milestone in Canadian history, thanks to the 
support of and indeed the sacrifices made by Canadians during the 
past five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year, for the first time in 30 years, a balanced budget was 
tabled. The crushing $42 billion deficit we inherited in 1993, 
the highest deficit in Canadian history, is now a thing of the 
past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the budget affirms our commitment to balanced 
budgets over the next two years; this will be the first time in 
nearly 50 years that balanced budgets will have been tabled three 
years in a row including this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With only a few minutes to comment on this budget, one has to 
focus on one particular aspect and it is somewhat difficult to 
select one out of the many interesting facets of the budget. One 
would have much to say, for instance, on this successful effort 
to achieve what is commonly called a zero deficit while slightly 
reducing the debt, providing some tax relief and making targeted 
social investments. This in itself would deserve extensive 
comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One could also comment on the good news for Canadian families, 
particularly with respect to the assistance provided for 
children and education. This budget could also be addressed from 
the perspective of recovery, of high tech research, in response 
to pressing demands in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It all boils down to this being a budget which reassures those 
who have to make investment decisions, the economic agents, as 
well as those who are looking for work or for a new job, even 
though the unemployment level is still too high.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address another angle in particular.  My choice 
of subject is inspired by the hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, who spoke yesterday on the budget.  As we 
know, he is the Bloc Quebecois finance critic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard him announce his intention to do everything possible to 
block the millennium scholarship program.  He said “This is a 
program we detest because it encroaches, and shamelessly to 
boot, into an area of Quebec jurisdiction.  It is a program 
totally unacceptable to us”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also said that he hated this millennium scholarship program so 
much that it would galvanize his energies, that he was full to 
overflowing with the energy to fight this budget, and this 
proposal in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very sad to see an MP, his party's official critic for 
Finance, and a man who has a certain influence in Quebec, or 
claims to, calling for people to join forces to do battle, 
calling for Quebec to fight this measure, which he detests, and 
stating that he will focus all of his energies on hating it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This finance critic also accused the government of having 
accumulated surpluses in the employment insurance account that 
are too large, in his opinion, while at the same time accusing it 
of putting $2.5 billion in this fiscal year, which are in a way 
part of that surplus, into the millennium fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand, he is unhappy because the government is 
accumulating surpluses in the employment insurance fund; on the 
other, he is unhappy because that money is being put into the 
millennium fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This critic needs to get real.  He must admit that there are very 
direct links, very important ones, between access to higher 
education, access to post-secondary education, and the ability 
for young people to find jobs, and it is they who will be the 
primary beneficiaries of the millennium fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This hon. member needs to admit that there is a direct link 
between the EI fund surplus and the immediate investment—not in 
two or three years—in the millennium scholarships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of rejoicing over this investment in young people, the 
Bloc Quebecois critic is pouring negative energy into blocking 
this measure. 
It seems to me that these people, he and others, who went on in 
school and obtained advanced post-secondary degrees, BAs, MAs, 
have forgotten that there are others in their footsteps, that 
there are young people today who also want to go on to higher 
education because they know that that is the key to landing an 
interesting job.  It is also the key to mobility throughout their 
career. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also know that these scholarships will enable them to obtain 
Canadian experience, to see what is going on in environments 
other than their own, and to be able to acquire international 
experience, to study abroad, to find out how other countries see 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would look like members of the Bloc Quebecois have forgotten 
about others, or that they do not want others to have access to 
these forms of education, which are important for the careers of 
young people wanting to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strategy at the heart of this budget is equality of 
opportunity.  I think this is what bothers certain critics most, 
particularly the Bloc Quebecois critics, because it is an 
approach that directly targets the needs of people, young people 
in particular.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In his speech, the Minister of Finance said “Canadians know that 
there is more to taking care of the nation than simply taking 
care of the books. Canada is not just a marketplace. It is a 
community. Our country is anchored in shared risk and shared 
benefits, in lending a hand knowing that, some day, we too may be 
in need”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These comments hurt people like the Bloc Quebecois critic, 
because they are about Canada-wide solidarity and exchanges. 
They are about sharing, supporting each other, and investing 
together a large amount—that will serve us for years to come, 
that will serve young Canadians, including Quebeckers—in a joint 
account in which there will then be money available to meet our 
needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The notion of a Canada-wide solidarity hurts Bloc Quebecois 
members, because they are always saying that everything must be 
repatriated to Quebec, that there is nothing good throughout 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equal opportunity is an important issue for us in the Liberal 
Party, in the government, because it is a matter of basic 
fairness and social justice. We strongly believe in it. We also 
know that learning must be the central part of any national jobs 
strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of elements to this strategy.  I have not got 
the time to list them all now, but there are seven important 
ones, the first of which is definitely the millennium fund.  We 
were told that $2.5 billion would be taken from this fiscal year 
and used starting in the year 2000 and for several years 
afterward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other measures worth a total of $3 billion will be spread across 
seven programs over the next three years, for a grand total of 
$5.5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think these are significant sums.  Canadians have the right to 
know the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The nine young people in the delegation of 18 that accompanied me 
to our convention last weekend in Ottawa said they were very 
happy.  They were not turning their noses up at the scholarship 
program and other measures. 
On the contrary, they were very happy, and I think they are 
representative of Quebec youth, which is happy to have the 
federal government providing them with a considerable amount of 
money for the next decade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, we are talking about opening the door to 
co-operation.  The federal government planned for negotiations 
with the provinces to avoid duplication and to reach an agreement 
on implementing this measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of taking offence, pouting and trying to block 
everything, the government in Quebec and one part of the 
opposition here should try to co-operate.  I think it would 
benefit young people in Canada and Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, before I 
talk about the budget implementation legislation, I must put on 
the record how upsetting it is to have the 38th time allocation 
motion moved by this government.  It has done this 38 times.  It 
used to be done once and literally a government would be gone at 
the next election because of it.  Thirty-eight times.  It is 
pretty hard to explain to our constituents that we were not given 
an opportunity to speak because this government used time 
allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot of deception in this budget.  Liberals are 
talking about the golden age, the financial problem being all 
taken care of and the great auditing that has been done.  Yet the 
auditor general deplores the methods used by the finance 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We seem to have conveniently forgotten about the debt. In 1969 
our debt was zero.  In just three years it quickly went to $18 
billion.  In 1993 our debt was $489 billion. Today it is $583 
billion. That is the thing we should be talking about. That is 
what the people say we should take care of.  That is what is 
threatening our social safety net. 
That is what is threatening our health, education and pensions. 
That is what is going to hurt our future generations more than 
anything else.  This government chooses to ignore that and begin 
more spending.

so cautious to take care of that potential rainy day that might 
be down the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at a country like Indonesia with 200 million people with a 
60% drop in its economy.  People are unemployed.  People are 
literally on the streets because they have lost their sources of

drop in taxation so they can plan to counter what those potential 
dark clouds might be.  What happens when cheap competitive 
products come on the market?  What happens when there is less 
purchasing power in some of those Asian economies?  That is going 
to effect the U.S. economy.  When it gets a cold we get 
pneumonia.  This government has totally abrogated its 
responsibilities in planning for that future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at the figures regarding our debt.  Our interest payment is 
$45 billion.  That interest payment is equivalent to other 
figures that should be considered, close to $12 billion of 
federal money for health care, $14 billion for education, $22 
billion for pensions.  Our interest adds up to more than all 
those payments put together and yet this government totally 
ignores that debt and that interest payment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 when a number of us came to this place the taxes brought 
in about $125 billion.  By the year 2000 that figure will be $173 
billion that this government is taking in.  Some of that is due 
to growth but a great deal of that is due to increased taxation. 
We are falling behind other places in this world.  All you have 
to do is go around to different places to realize that our 
economy is dropping.  Our expendable income is dropping.  We are 
not the same country we were 10 or 20 years ago. This government 
by its high taxes and spending and by the kind of budget that we 
just saw is doing nothing to deal with that problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at our dollar.  Just try to travel using the Canadian 
dollar and see where we are now in the world's economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government had choices.  It could deal with the debt and 
the problems it brings.  I could have dealt with the taxes and 
brought them down which would have meant jobs and a great 
increase in our well-being in this country.  Or it could have 
dealt with spending.  It chose the third option.  It chose to 
increase spending and to forget about the debt and let it take 
care of itself by this mythical dream that so many of these 
governments have about growth taking care of the problems.  It 
never has and it never will.  By raising taxes as this government 
has done it has done nothing to help improve the job situation 
for our young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals had a choice and they chose to ignore the debt. 
They chose to keep taxes the highest in the G-7 countries and 
they chose to start spending.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If we start to look at some of that spending it is shocking: 
Canadian opportunities strategies, $4.6 billion in increased 
spending; the millennium fund, which we hear about over and over 
again, a couple of billion dollars; Canadian culture, $440 
million.  That is pretty scary when we think of what has been 
spent on things like, dare I mention, the flag issue, $24 million 
to hand out flags and we know what happened in this place. Are 
there savings we could make? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The patronage appointments that constantly go on with this 
government, the waste that occurs here, the total desire to 
maintain the status quo and not change anything in this place are 
why we are in so much trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this mean to us as Canadians?  The saddest part is 
that all of this inactivity regarding the debt, regarding the 
taxes, is going to affect the next generation.  It is going to 
affect the kids and grand kids of most of the people in here, and 
even further than that.  Those are the people who are going to 
have to finally face up to $583 billion, to 30 cents plus of 
every dollar going to interest payments.  That is what a future 
government is going to have to face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government should be embarrassed by the budget that has 
been put forward and by all the bragging about the golden age, 
that we have our financial problems taken care of, that we have 
nothing more to worry about.  People out there are not stupid. 
People out there know that is not true.  Far and away the biggest 
number of people out there are saying take care of that debt.  In 
surveys which have been done, and it does not matter whether they 
are done in Quebec or Alberta or B.C., people have said that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government chose not to listen.  I believe that as 
Canadians digest what is in this budget there will be a reaction. 
That reaction will not be favourable to the finance minister or 
to this government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the bill we are debating today includes some very 
important elements of the Canadian opportunities strategy which 
was introduced in the 1998 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, the bill launches the Canada millennium 
scholarships foundation.  With an initial endowment of $2.5 
billion this foundation will provide more than 100,000 students 
full time and part time at colleges, vocational and technical 
institutes as well as universities with scholarships averaging 
$3,000 per student. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also includes some very important measures to help 
manage student debt.  It introduces a Canada education savings 
grant to help families save for their children's education.  It 
gives employers an employment insurance premium holiday for 
hiring additional young Canadians, reducing payroll costs for 
those employers by about $100 million over two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These measures are only part of the strategy that we set out in 
the 1998 budget, a strategy that will help Canadians by expanding 
their access to the knowledge and skills they will need for 
better jobs and higher standards of living in the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take a moment to outline the other elements of that 
strategy.  It is important to view these measures in the context 
of one another since they work together to provide a 
comprehensive set of tools to increase Canadians' access to 
knowledge and skills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of the Canadian opportunities strategy the government 
proposes to introduce new Canada study grants.  These grants 
recognize that many student needs are not fully met by 
scholarships and students loans.  Beginning in 1998-99, Canada 
study grants of up to $3,000 a year will go to over 25,000 needy 
students who have children or other dependants.  These grants 
will help both full time and part time students and will provide 
$100 million annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Assistance to students is only part of the information age 
equation.  We must also recognize that nothing is more critical 
to Canada's economic success in the 21st century than vigorous 
broad based research and development. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT31"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT31"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1710

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To support graduate students and researchers as they develop the 
leading edge skills needed in a knowledge based economy, the 
opportunities strategy will increase funding to the three federal 
granting councils, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research 
Council, the Medical Research Council and the Social Sciences and 
Humanities Research Council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These very important councils provide research grants, 
scholarships and fellowships. Over the next three years their 
combined budget of $766 million in 1997-98 will be increased by 
$400 million, and by the end of the year 2000-2001 the councils' 
budgets will be at the highest level in history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Minister of Finance said in his budget speech, Canadians 
do not need to be told that student debt is a problem. That is 
why the strategy includes a range of measures to help reduce the 
financial burden on students, measures included in Bill C-36. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, our strategy proposes that for the first time 
students will be given tax relief on interest payments on their 
student loans.  This will be provided through a tax credit and it 
will help one million Canadians who are repaying those student 
loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians in the workforce want to take time away from work 
to upgrade their skills through part time or especially full time 
study.  But they often lack the necessary resources, so the 
budget also proposes several new measures to improve their access 
to learning through their lives. Therefore beginning January 1, 
1999 Canadians will be able to make tax free withdrawals from 
their RRSPs for lifelong learning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The need to continually upgrade knowledge and skills can be 
particularly hard for the growing number of Canadians studying 
part time and trying to manage the difficult balance of work, 
family and study.  We are proposing therefore two new measures to 
help them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beginning in 1998 the education credit will be extended to part 
time students. This measure will benefit up to 250,000 Canadians. 
In addition, for the first time parents studying part time will 
also be able to deduct their child care expenses within certain 
limits.  Currently only full time students are eligible. This new 
measure will benefit some 50,000 part time students with 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, our strategy takes action to improve Canadians' access 
to the information highway.  Beginning in 1998-99 we will provide 
an additional $205 million over three years to expand and extend 
SchoolNet and the community access programs.  There will be an 
additional $55 million to the Canadian network for the 
advancement of research, industry and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian opportunities strategy provides a diverse and 
comprehensive set of tools.  These tools will help Canadians 
acquire the knowledge and skills they will need for better jobs 
and a better life in the 21st century. By expanding access to 
opportunity we are building a stronger economy and a more secure 
society. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has done its utmost to ensure that the 
Canadian economy continues to be built on solid foundations. 
The federal government will continue to offer programs which meet 
Canadians' needs and expectations. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I urge all members to support Bill C-36 in moving 
us forward to implement key elements of our strategy.  I know 
certainly that the people of Waterloo—Wellington support this 
bill and want it to proceed and I know that all Canadians indeed 
want this bill to proceed as well. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to 
participate in this debate on Bill C-36, the purpose of which is 
to implement certain provisions of the 1998 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill contains a number of elements, but I shall address two 
of them in particular.  First, the millennium scholarships.  A 
foundation is being created to provide new scholarships to 
Canadian students starting in the year 2000, but it is being 
created immediately through this bill, taking $2.5 billion from 
this budget to structure the foundation so that it will be able 
to start awarding the scholarships in the year 2000.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been a pet project of the Prime Minister for some time, 
it seems.  This is a project which the Minister of Human 
Resources Development is trying to defend, without much 
enthusiasm it seems, since it was obviously not his idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have examined the various clauses in this bill, as it is the 
duty of every member to do when a new bill is introduced.  I 
have noted a few details as I went along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 4 states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>4. The Foundation is not an agent of Her Majesty. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is, therefore, a foundation that is not a direct agent of the 
government. 
In principle, this would be a totally independent foundation.  I 
raise a question here, because it is nevertheless a foundation 
created by an act.  Both Canada and the provinces have 
legislation providing for the creation of not-for-profit agencies 
or organizations, so a special bill does not need to be 
introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one is, this means there is a specific mandate, or the 
government wants to retain some power.  Specifically, it retains 
power over the 15 foundation directors.  Six, that is the 
chairperson and five other members, will be appointed by 
cabinet.  These six will then appoint the others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This much control right from the start means the government can 
choose who will be a member.  Obviously, these will be friends of 
the regime, very probably people whom the Liberal government can 
trust. 
These people together will fill the positions on the board of 
directors with other people, who will likely enjoy the same 
Liberal confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some things are a bit odd.  If we look, for example, at clause 
13(5), we see when a member of the board ceases to be a member. 
The reasons given are fairly obvious, and it is rather odd that 
they take the trouble to identify them.  The first point is 
“when a member dies”.  This is rather self-evident.  Some things 
in this bill are unnecessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But that is not the problem, as we know.  The problem is that the 
foundation directly interferes in a provincial jurisdiction. The 
government is trying to say that the foundation interferes only 
indirectly.  However, since it controls the members of the board 
of directors and appoints the first six, it is the federal 
government that will be distributing the scholarships to 
students. Why in the year 2000?  Because it will look good and 
the government will have a high profile as it distributes cheques 
with maple leaves on them to thousands of students.  It is after 
visibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject, I would point out that this fits in well with the 
Liberal government's strategy of increasing its visibility 
through various means.  There is of course the flag flap and the 
more than $23 million in the program the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage set up after the 1995 referendum. 
There was also the promotion of Canadian unity in the primary 
schools.  This program cost $60 million including the flags. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the Canada Post Corporation, which changed its 
name. It cost $8 million to put “Canada Post” on the trucks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am the Bloc Quebecois critic on regional development.  On March 
4, the minister responsible for regional development in Quebec 
announced that the Federal Office of Regional Development—Quebec 
was changing its name.  To what?  To the Canada Economic 
Development for Quebec Regions Agency. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1720"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT33"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT33"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1720

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is all a visibility operation. The federal government is 
targeting Quebec in particular, because of the dreaded third 
referendum of course. It is seeking visibility any way it can, 
even if it means sending cheques directly to students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned regional development, and since we are talking about 
the budget, I would like to draw attention to figures quoted in 
recent budgets, which seem rather odd to me. The budget allocated 
to the minister responsible for regional development in Quebec 
for administration increased by 16.9%, or $33 million. This is 
for the federal office for regional development in Quebec, which 
employs more than 260 people and which now has a new name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government plans to spend $380 million in Quebec 
without taking into account the strategy adopted by the Quebec 
government, which is to rely on decentralized organizations such 
as the RDCs, Quebec's regional development councils, and more 
locally, the local development councils, a new type of 
organization whose purpose is to ensure development at the local 
level within each RCM. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, the budget was increased but, oddly enough, there is also a 
whole series of cuts. For example, there is $3,448,322 less for 
Quebec under the agreement on municipal infrastructures, 
$1,478,300 less for contributions for programs to improve 
manufacturing productivity, $1,256,943 less for the business 
development program, $959,890 less for the subsidiary agreement 
on tourism, $633,254 less for the innovations program, $845,362 
less for the salmon economic development program, and $910,690 
less for assistance programs in depressed areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will skip the small figures. There is also $2,640,045 less for 
Montreal's industrial recovery, $4,462,000 less for Montreal's 
development fund, $635,000 less for industrial recovery in 
Southwest Montreal, and $40,000 less—a small cut, but still—for 
organizations promoting regional development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, the government came up with new names and approaches to 
increase its visibility, The federal office of regional 
development also has a new name, but again this is to increase 
visibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, some cuts affect very specific programs. The overall 
increase is explained by the simple fact that Quebec had to deal 
with an ice storm. The amounts transferred by the President of 
the Treasury Board to the Federal Office of Regional Development 
have the effect of temporarily increasing the envelope for 
regional development, but if we look at each program 
individually, we realize that major cuts are being made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this leads me to say that the millennium scholarship fund, 
regional development and other issues which will be raised later 
on by some fellow Bloc members, are a smoke screen to hide the 
ever increasing interference by the federal government in areas 
of provincial jurisdiction. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, two years ago British Columbia introduced a scheme 
whereby welfare recipients were required to have lived in the 
province for at least three months before they were entitled to 
benefits.  This was directly aimed at the poorest sector of the 
economy, the people who were most in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it incredible that an NDP government should do something 
like that, something that would be more typical, shall we say, of 
California or the western United States. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1725"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT34"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT34"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1725

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless it was done and it led to quite a confrontation 
among the NDP government in British Columbia, various poverty 
organizations and the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the NDP action the federal government cut $47 
million in transfer payments to B.C. on the grounds that the 
Canada health and social transfer going to B.C. was aimed at all 
Canadians, not Canadians based on residency.  Indeed this 
principle is enshrined in the charter of rights, in the Canada 
Health Act and certainly in the Canada health and social transfer 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were some angry words on both sides, but in the end an 
arrangement was made whereby the British Columbia government 
backed down and permitted anyone to collect welfare in British 
Columbia regardless of their province of origin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where this has relevance to the debate today is that we have a 
situation now in Quebec where the Quebec government receives 
money under the Canada health and social transfer, uses it to 
provide operating costs and tuition support for students in 
Quebec and, as of a year and a bit ago, the Quebec government 
introduced a differential tuition requirement for students out of 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec today a student from elsewhere in Canada pays 41% more 
in tuition to go to a university in Quebec than a Quebec student. 
Tuition for Quebec universities is quite a bit lower than the 
rest of the country and this does reflect, indeed, some very wise 
spending decisions on the part of the Quebec government. 
However, just like all other forms of cash transfers from the 
federal government for social assistance, the very essential 
principle is that it should go to all Canadians regardless of 
where they are from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 6 of the charter of rights specifies that anything that 
is accorded Canadian citizens should not be accorded to them or 
withheld from them based on their province of origin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a Quebec government that is today discriminating against 
students from outside the province.  It keeps young people in 
Quebec who were born and raised there based on territory 
and makes attending university in Quebec very difficult for 
students outside Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes a lot of difference to students.  There are 20,000 of 
them in Quebec who have to pay the extra tuition because they 
want to go to a Quebec university.  It is a difference of $1,200. 
That is a very high and tough price for a student coming out of 
province, who may be a francophone, to pay to go to university in 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we do about it?  We have several choices.  One thing we 
could do is create a national university in Quebec where it is 
fully funded by the federal government and where everyone has 
equal opportunity to go to that university.  That is one 
possibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing we could do is what was done in British Columbia 
and threaten to withhold the transfers that are due Quebec until 
it allows all students equal opportunity, including those from 
out of province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we can make sure the money in the millennium fund is 
managed by an independent body outside Quebec and distributed 
equally to young people who want an education inside Quebec or 
outside Quebec.  In other words, a student going from Ontario to 
Quebec who is a francophone should be given money from the fund 
equivalent to what a Quebec student saves.  Any student in Quebec 
should have equal opportunity to travel anywhere in Canada to get 
an education.   That way we get away from the fortress mentality 
of Quebec separatism and we build a better Canada for tomorrow.

motion and of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak to Motion M-123, moved by our colleague, the hon. member 
for Burnaby—Douglas, whom I congratulate, by the way, on his 
courage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That a special committee be appointed, pursuant to Standing Order 
68(4)(b), to review the provisions of the Criminal Code dealing 
with euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide and that the 
Committee be instructed to prepare and bring in a bill, in 
accordance with Standing Order 68(5). 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond the differences of opinion that are normal and even 
desirable in a democracy such as ours, we have all, you, I and 
all members of the House, one thing in common:  we were elected 
by our constituents to study, debate and make laws on all sorts 
of issues.  We are lawmakers, and our actions therefore have a 
direct impact on the lives of all our fellow citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But rarely, almost never, are we called upon to deal with issues 
as important and sensitive as the one now before us. 
Motion M-123 is not about amending marketing standards, about 
increasing or reducing the budget, or about implementing 
international accords, although all these issues have their 
importance.  This motion touches on the very essence of who we 
are and what we believe, on the very essence of life and, since 
life would not be life without it, death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever the angle from which we approach the issue, we must keep 
in mind that our actions must be carefully weighed and 
considered, because there are some issues where a bad decision 
is not an option.  The only other possibility excluded from the 
outset is indifference, or acting as though the problem did not 
exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But despite the apparent scope of this debate, we can take 
comfort in knowing that we are not starting from zero.  Many 
discussions have taken place, many rulings have been handed 
down, and recommendations made at various levels, here in 
particular. 
After spending several months hearing witnesses and gathering 
briefs from everywhere in Canada, a special Senate committee on 
euthanasia and assisted suicide tabled a full report on this 
issue in June of 1995. Even though the committee did not reach a 
consensus on what ought to be done or not done, which was not 
part of its mandate, the outcome of its study will be very useful 
to us, as elected parliamentarians, during the forthcoming 
debates and discussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These last few years, besides this Senate committee, several 
cases were given wide coverage by the media. The most famous one 
is probably the story of Sue Rodriguez, a woman with amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis who, under the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms, challenged the ban on assisted suicide in the Criminal 
Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December 1992, the Supreme Court of British-Columbia turned 
down her request, stating that section 241 of the Criminal Code 
did not go against the charter. 
On March 8, 1993, the Court of Appeal of the same province 
rejected the appeal by Ms. Rodriguez. Lastly, on September 30, 
1993, the Supreme Court of Canada put an end to her crusade, with 
a close five to four decision that did not quash the debate, far 
from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this issue, the comments made by dissenting justice Peter 
Cory reflect the state of mind of several of his colleagues. He 
stated and I quote “The life of an individual must include dying. 
Dying is the final act in the drama of life. The right to die 
with dignity should be as well protected as is any other aspect 
of the right to life. State prohibitions that would force a 
dreadful, painful death on a rational but incapacitated 
terminally ill patient are an affront to human dignity”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite some dissension within the Supreme Court, there was 
unanimity on one issue, namely that the decision belongs to us, 
as elected representatives. Whether it be the British Columbia 
Supreme Court, the British Columbia Court of Appeal or even the 
Senate committee, all those who studied this issue have said that 
it is our responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 12, 1994, Sue Rodriguez, assisted by a physician, 
took her own life. I will let my colleague from Burnaby—Douglas 
speak of this case in further detail if he wishes to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, in 1992, the case of Nancy B. gave a lot of people 
food for thought. The 25-year-old woman was suffering from an 
incurable disease called Guillain-Barré syndrome. 
At a certain stage of the disease, she had to be hooked to a 
respirator. She asked for the right to stop supportive treatment. 
The Quebec Superior Court recognized that right, and Nancy B. 
left this world courageously, in silence, in sickness, but at the 
time of her choosing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two other cases are worth mentioning here. First, there is the 
case of Austin Bastable, a 52-year-old Ontarian suffering from 
chronic progressive multiple sclerosis. During the 35th 
Parliament, he wrote several times to members to ask, just as Sue 
Rodriguez had asked the courts, for the right to die at the time 
of his choosing, with the assistance of a physician. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like Sue Rodriguez, he realized that it is not easy to get an 
answer from a government that may be ill prepared to deal with 
such a request. 
Austin Bastable had to go to the United States, away from his 
family and friends, to die assisted by a physician whom he had 
probably never seen before. That is not dying with dignity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the case of Robert Latimer raises other questions. In 
this case, he was not the one who was sick. He and his wife 
decided to take the life of their daughter Tracy, who was 
suffering from cerebral palsy and from serious physical 
malformations causing incredible pain. She had no hope of getting 
any better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although we will have to deal with this issue, Mr. Latimer's 
case is outside the scope of this debate since it is murder for 
compassionate reasons, which means that someone decided to take 
someone else's life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be understood that we are talking here about the right 
of a competent adult who is terminally ill or who is suffering 
from an incurable disease to make that decision for himself or 
herself. 
The decision is not meant to be made for that adult by another 
person, a doctor, a relative or a parent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, these four examples of individuals who have fought 
to further the debate each in their own way clearly show how 
important it is that the matter be clarified once and for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far, the courts have had to decide the many difficult issues 
brought before them. Without minimizing the importance of their 
work, it seems clear to me that we will not always be able to 
leave this in their hands. Sooner or later Parliament will have 
to make a decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both the current Minister of Health—and former justice minister— 
and the Prime Minister promised a free vote in the House on this 
issue. Federal Liberal Party members have already passed a 
resolution along those lines at one of their conventions. 
The Bloc Quebecois too repeatedly asked that the House address 
this issue. More than ever, it is important that this serious and 
current issue be debated and debated now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion M-123 is a perfect opportunity to do just that, and I hope 
it will be supported by a majority of parliamentarians. Because 
there is no life without death, because death is part of life, as 
its hidden face, we have a duty to develop frameworks which are 
fair and which  respect human dignity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could we really imagine choosing for ourselves and all our loved 
ones anything but a gentle and humane death with dignity? 
Anything but the freedom of choice?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron—Bruce, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to oppose the motion proposed by my colleague the member of 
Parliament for Burnaby—Douglas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If adopted by this House, the motion before us would put into 
place a process that would see the development of a special 
committee designed to review certain provisions of the Criminal 
Code of Canada. The provisions of which I speak are those 
governing or outlawing the practice of euthanasia and physician 
assisted suicide. In addition to that, the special committee 
would also be required pursuant to Standing Order 68(5) to report 
its findings back to this House in the form of a bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, this motion is calling upon the Parliament of Canada 
to devise a mechanism of study with the budget, mandate and 
capacity to further explore this highly emotional and deeply 
personal issue. I would respectfully submit to all members of 
this House that we have concluded this debate. As such we should 
put it behind us once and for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue is not a new concept.  The practice of euthanasia has 
been around for as long as mankind has experienced disease.  It 
is however only in the last two centuries that this matter has 
entered the political arena. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of euthanasia, better known to many of us as mercy 
killing, is one of the most highly contentious matters ever 
examined by modern politicians. It has commanded the political 
spotlight for years.  However, despite the prominence of this 
divisive and emotional topic and regardless of the constant 
attention it has received, euthanasia defenders seem reluctant to 
allow the issue to fade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The subject itself is one that predates most other topics 
brought before this House of Commons.  The term euthanasia is in 
fact an ancient Greek word meaning good or easy death.  This was 
the original meaning.  However, today the Campaign Life Coalition 
defines euthanasia as a practice of acting or failing to act so 
as to cause the death of a human being for the purpose of 
relieving suffering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well as understanding the exact definition of the term, it is 
also important that for the purpose of debate we clearly 
differentiate between a sound medically based decision to end a 
life and the practice of euthanasia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Permitting an individual with a terminal illness to conclude 
their life in a natural fashion is simply not euthanasia.  Where 
the situation is medically hopeless, a decision not to provide or 
to halt the continuation of artificial or extraordinary measures 
is in my opinion ethical, legal and consistent with standard 
medical practice. This would also be consistent with thousands of 
years of established religious philosophy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In essence the textbook definition of euthanasia is the 
deliberate act of one human being designed to promote the death 
of another human being.  This could be accomplished through the 
use of several methods such as a lethal injection or the 
intentional and deliberate failure to provide the essentials of 
life to another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The practice of euthanasia can be further subdivided into two 
groupings, passive and active.  I believe however that the terms 
passive and active euthanasia are simply that, terms.  In all 
cases of this nature the intent is to kill; the method is simply 
a question of strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss if I did not mention the matter of assisted 
suicide.  Few would argue that assisted suicide has attracted the 
lion's share of public attention over the past several years. The 
argument of quality of life versus quantity of life is most 
commonly used which, if allowed to go unchallenged, could lead to 
countless abuses of basic human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In instances involving assisted suicide, the mind is willing to 
commit the fatal act but the body due to the individual's 
physical impairment is not able to perform the required action. 
As such the individual is forced to seek the assistance of 
another to perpetrate the fatal act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although assistance of this type is usually provided reluctantly 
for compassionate reasons, this is not always the case.  It 
should be noted that regardless of the method, classification or 
motive, Canadian law currently does not recognize compassion as 
an acceptable justification for killing another individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact the Canadian Medical Association has democratically 
determined that it is in the business of promoting health and 
recovery.  It does not want its members to engage in the practice 
of assisted suicide. The British Medical Association also took 
this stance as it believes that to permit doctors to kill or to 
assist in killing would seriously jeopardize the continuation of 
their traditional role as healers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel Dr. Christoph Hufeland summarized it best over 200 years 
ago when he stated “If a physician presumes to take into 
consideration in his work whether a life has value or not, the 
consequences are boundless and the physician becomes the most 
dangerous man in the state”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been a member of this House for only a few short years. 
However, I have been an avid participant in the political process 
for much longer than I would care to recall.  I can remember 
several instances in the very recent past when this matter 
sparked heated debate in this place.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1991 there was Bill C-203 and Bill C-261, both introduced 
with the intention of dealing with the mercy killing issue.  In 
1993, Motion No. 397 made its way to the floor, followed in 1994 
by Bill C-215 and Motions Nos. 218 and 277. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite constant attention the issue continues to be on our 
agenda.  I believe that we should get on with the business of 
running the country and should stop dwelling on the resolved 
issues of the passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national news headlines often glisten with names such as 
Jack Kevorkian, Sue Rodriguez, Nancy B and Robert Latimer.  While 
these individual cases can serve as tangible reference points, 
they also can distract from and act as a compelling hindrance to 
our grasping of the deeper moral and spiritual argument 
surrounding this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Due to the contentious nature of this issue, the public, the 
courts and many of our nation's legislators find themselves 
struggling with their own personal value system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As representatives of the people we must also consider the 
thoughts and opinions of our constituents.  In addition, we must 
be ever vigilant of the media and various special interest groups 
seeking to influence the outcome of this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, it is our duty to examine this issue based upon the 
facts, examples and testimonials at hand.  We must make our final 
decision with an unbiased frame of mind and not because of any 
political agenda or due to media based sensationalized 
propaganda.  We have already done that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My personal views with respect to euthanasia are quite simple. 
It would seem that we have now somehow confused the right to die 
with the subject of euthanasia, or the deliberate killing of 
those who are suffering.  They are not the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The right to die is defined as an individual's right to 
determine whether unusual or heroic measures should be taken. 
These measures would typically involve expensive, artificial 
and/or mechanical means of life support intended to prolong life 
in cases where death is almost certainly inevitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Supporters of euthanasia would claim that it is an exercise of a 
fundamental human freedom.  I would strongly disagree. Euthanasia 
is not an exercise of a basic human freedom but rather an 
abandonment of that freedom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the February 17, 1993 edition of <I>Hansard</I>, the member 
for Glengarry—Prescott—Russell summed up this entire debate 
when he said “what we are debating is whether we will give the 
right to any human being to kill another human being”.  I 
personally fear that society would devise an infinite number of 
uses for death once it has become a legal means for solving human 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During one of the world's darkest time periods, the Nazi party 
developed and promoted a set of proposals designed to weed out 
certain people who were considered to have no value to society. 
The idea was adopted by the general public and the medical 
community of the day.  As a result, the war machine euthanized 
more than 300,000 mentally handicapped children and adults in 
addition to the thousands of elderly people who were deemed to be 
useless by the Third Reich. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that this is an extreme example.  However, if 
members would like a more recent testimonial, they need look no 
further than the 1991 article written by Jack Kevorkian which 
suggested that the concept of a planned ending of a human life by 
the direct action of another human is only the tip of the 
iceberg.  In that same article he suggested that the moral 
reasoning could be extended to capital punishment, both voluntary 
and involuntary; obligatory suicide; or quasi-optional suicide 
for relief from illness, disability and old age.  This is 
absolutely unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my maiden speech in this place, I stated that it is by 
personal belief that life is a sacred gift from the moment of 
conception to the moment of natural death.  For that reason I 
believe that as legislators we must never condone or legalize the 
deliberate unnatural taking of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, when life can be only sustained through the 
use of extreme medical measures, allowing the natural and 
inevitable process of death to run its course is not necessarily 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again I reiterate my opposition to the motion before us. 
The Criminal Code of Canada currently regards euthanasia or mercy 
killing as culpable homicide or murder.  In fact, section 229 
provides for a 14 year jail term or penalty for assisting in the 
planned death of another person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been and continue to support the law as it stands.  I 
feel that striking another special committee represents an 
unnecessary revival of an already concluded matter.  The 1997 
year end edition of <I>Maclean's</I> magazine labelled Canada and 
Canadians as confident, united by bedrock values in a wide 
variety of ideas including spiritualism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are calling for their government to provide direction 
and guidance with respect to this bedrock value.  A special 
committee would be unnecessary, wasteful and counterproductive. 
The wishes of the majority of Canadians are already recognized 
and supported by the current law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for these reasons that I will not be supporting Motion No. 
123 this evening.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to split my time with the member for Calgary Southeast 
and would like unanimous consent of the House to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent that the 
hon. member split the 10 minutes allotted to him with the hon. 
member for Calgary Southeast? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in a 1997 poll of 
British Columbians 54% said they supported euthanasia.  I would 
like to probe that poll a bit more deeply to demonstrate that the 
slim majority would collapse if three simple steps were taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That slim majority would collapse if the public were better 
informed about what euthanasia is and is not and what the 
criminal code does and does not say about end of life issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada it is perfectly legal to refuse life sustaining 
treatment and allow oneself to die.  Such refusal is not 
considered euthanasia.  The poll in B.C. revealed that over 
two-thirds of supposed euthanasia supporters mistakenly believe 
that euthanasia includes refusing treatment.  Apparently a 
considerable number of people who appear to support euthanasia do 
not realize that what they would like to see legalized is already 
legal in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pollsters and their respondents have not been speaking the same 
language, which undermines the reliability of such polling 
results.  That slim majority support for euthanasia would 
collapse if steps were taken to better inform the public about 
palliative care.  I believe that would be the second reason that 
slim majority would collapse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The B.C. poll revealed that most supposed supporters of 
euthanasia have formed their opinion based on a concern about 
pain and suffering.  Only a minority, only 23% of all who were 
surveyed based their opinion on the belief that assisted suicide 
is a basic human right.  That means that most supposed euthanasia 
supporters see changing the criminal code as a means to alleviate 
suffering.  They incorrectly suppose that euthanasia is the only 
logical solution to pain, a false assumption which proponents of 
euthanasia work very hard to perpetuate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth of the matter is palliative care is a third option and 
a much better one.  It is a specialized field that has made great 
advances over the last several decades.  It has now made it 
possible to die without unbearable suffering.  Even in rare cases 
of extreme pain, controlled sedation can bring relief for those 
who request it and sedation is often required for only temporary 
periods completely in accordance with the patients' wishes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public needs to know that.  Only when people are aware of 
the effectiveness of palliative care will there be any validity 
to polling.  That slim majority support for euthanasia would 
collapse if governments were to step up their efforts to make 
palliative care widely available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 a special Senate committee on euthanasia recommended 
that palliative care become a top priority in the restructuring 
of the health care system.  Unfortunately palliative care 
services have not been promoted as vigorously as that special 
committee recommended.  The availability of these services varies 
from region to region.  It also varies depending on a patient's 
disease, with cancer patients usually having the best access. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the problem of inadequate funding for research and 
implementation.  In addition there is limited training in 
palliative care in medical schools.  These shortcomings are not 
something to be proud of, but they do suggest that a tremendous 
opportunity to meet the needs of Canadians lies before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a time when Canadians are expressing their sincere concern 
about pain at the end of life, it is exciting to think that 
palliative care has advanced enough that it can genuinely address 
those concerns.  All that remains to be done is to implement 
programs that will ensure the universal availability of 
palliative care services.  It is entirely within our grasp, which 
is one of a number of reasons euthanasia is such an unattractive 
solution to the problem of pain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canadians were to see governments moving strongly to fund and 
promote palliative care, we would see the supposed public support 
of euthanasia decline significantly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If these three steps were taken the only true supporters of 
euthanasia who would be left would be those who argue that 
euthanasia is a basic human right, an argument that was rejected 
by the supreme court.  It is crucial to realize that such people 
are in a decided minority and only 23% of those polled supported 
euthanasia on such a basis. 
As I pointed out, a good number of them did not really understand 
what euthanasia was.  That is hardly representative of the 
democratic will.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
some of the pertinent and important technical aspects of the 
debate that have been addressed by some of my hon. colleagues, 
questions such as the Senate committee hearings on these matters 
and the availability of palliative care, are all important issues 
and ought to have a bearing on the judgment we make here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, ultimately what is before us today is a question 
fundamental to the nature of liberal democracy, a question that 
drives to the heart of what it is to be a citizen, a question of 
how we exercise personal liberty, and a question of the 
fundamental rights vested in parliament to protect on behalf of 
its citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The preamble to the Constitution of Canada states that “whereas 
Canada is founded upon principles that recognize the supremacy of 
God and the rule of law”.  This was no accident.  Its placement 
in the charter reflects a long and central tradition in the 
theory of liberal democracy, the notion that we do not grant 
rights unto ourselves.  We do not create ourselves and we 
therefore do not create our own rights, but we are created and 
rights are bestowed upon us.  Fundamental human rights such as 
the right to life are inalienable.  Even individuals cannot 
through the exercise of some radical personal autonomy alienate 
rights which cleave to the human nature of individuals because 
they were granted to us by our Creator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what the preamble of our constitution suggests.  This is 
what the first section of our constitution suggests where it 
enumerates fundamental rights, the very first of which is the 
right to life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an echo of the foundational document of liberal 
democracy, the American Declaration of Independence which states 
that we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are 
created equal and are endowed by their Creator with certain 
inalienable rights, and that among these is the right to life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certain inalienable rights are rights that cannot be alienated 
by a legislature, rights that cannot be alienated by a doctor 
whose business is killing and rights that cannot be alienated 
even by ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this motion we are ultimately discussing whether or not 
parliament will grant to people the right to destroy themselves 
and the right to destroy the inviolable dignity stamped on them 
by the Creator of which our constitution speaks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that we must never, in this society animated by a profound 
understanding of the inviolable dignity of the human person, 
allow a radical notion of personal autonomy or a disordered 
understanding of human liberty to overcome our most profound 
obligation as people, as creatures and as legislators to protect 
human life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If parliament were to consider the motion and were consequently 
to pass legislation legalizing euthanasia and what is 
euphemistically referred to as physician assisted suicide, 
parliament would be entering the final taboo which would permit 
the wilful killing of the human person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This century, the 20th century, what Pope John Paul II referred 
to as the century of tears, is tragically filled with a history 
of political movements based on the disordered notion of the 
authority of the state or of the authority of the individual 
which has resulted in the deaths of thousands and millions of 
human persons and sometimes the death of those persons based on 
physician assisted suicide and on euthanasia.

become personally involved with this issue in a number of cases. 
It is not an easy matter to deal with.  The fact that he has 
brought this forward and called on the House to enter into an 
intelligent discussion is something that shows courage and 
strength which all members of this House should support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to deal with several points.  The first point I 
would like to make is that the status quo as it exists today is 
simply impossible and increasingly untenable.  That is why this 
issue will not go away.  It is increasingly untenable not just 
for Canadians as individuals in our society, but also for us as 
parliamentarians and under the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We only have to look at the tragedy of what happened to Sue 
Rodriguez.  We only have to look at what has happened to 
Canadians who have been forced to leave Canada in order to 
exercise personal choice about their health and circumstances in 
their lives.  We only have to look at the cases that have been 
spoken about in this House of people who are in desperate 
situations having to take desperate action because the law has 
been inadequate, the law has been archaic, the law has not been 
able to deal with the needs of people today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impossibility of the status quo exists in part because of 
our inaction.  I will be the first one to rise and 
acknowledge—and this is the first time I have debated this 
issue, but I have heard it debated by other members—that this is 
a complex and difficult issue to take on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do believe that Canadians expect and want to see debate and 
guidance from Parliament, from their member of Parliament and 
from the House as a whole, on this issue.  The reason I say that 
is that all of us know that Canadians today take more and more 
responsibility for the choices they make about their lives and 
particularly about their health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We only have to look at the debate that is going on in the 
standing committee on health around herbal remedies to know what 
an incredible industry has developed around alternative 
medicines.  More and more people are choosing to become educated 
and informed about their health.  In that context there has been 
a public debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are polls which indicate that Canadians want the issue of 
physician assisted suicide to be clarified and to be resolved, 
not just to be debated, but for the status quo to be examined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was interested to see a poll that was done in December 1997 by 
Pollara.  Astonishingly maybe to some members of this House, it 
found that 70% of Canadians would find it acceptable in some 
circumstances for a doctor to help a patient die. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The history of this issue in the House and in our local 
communities makes it very clear that Canadians believe the status 
quo is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point I would like to make is that the right to die 
with dignity is a most personal issue.  It has been very 
interesting to hear the debate of some Reform members and 
government members in this third hour who have talked about the 
intervention of the state.  I have heard Reform members on other 
issues talk about how the state should stay out of the lives of 
Canadians.

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have a most fundamental issue, and a personal issue, 
which is someone's right to die with dignity.  I believe very 
strongly that the purpose of the law should be to facilitate 
individual choice, not to facilitate the denial of choices.  But 
unfortunately today's status quo situation leaves individuals 
suffering a terminal illness or an incurable disease without 
legal choices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are debating in the House the basic right of a competent 
adult to make a decision about their own life when they are in 
circumstances of a terminal illness or an incurable disease.  I 
think it is fundamental in this motion, and in all the debate 
that has taken place, that what is key is that the decision can 
only come from the person involved, not from anyone else.  It 
cannot come from a doctor, not from a family member, a stranger 
or a health care provider.  The decision about what we do with 
our life is our decision alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some personal appreciation of how difficult and how 
intensely personal these matters can be.  I do know what it means 
to be with someone you love who is dying.  I do know what it 
means to care for someone in that situation.  What I have learned 
is that the needs and wishes of that person are the most 
important things on the mind of a care provider.  Nothing else 
matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In those circumstances I believe that for family members 
involved and for the person facing these kinds of choices there 
is actually a heightened sense of clarity about what choices 
there are and what it is that is personally ethical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question there are difficult decisions, even around 
issues of palliative care.  A number of members have spoken about 
palliative care and have suggested that it somehow is the answer 
to this issue, that if we could somehow make that work better we 
would not be dealing with physician assisted suicide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a very strong supporter of palliative care.  From personal 
experience I know what is involved and what it means.  Even in 
that situation there are very difficult decisions to be made by a 
patient or by family members.  But at least in that situation we 
do have a health care system that provides some support and 
guidance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But when it comes to other circumstances, when a person has made 
a fundamental decision that the time has come, that they need to 
have assistance to end their life because of their circumstances 
and what they are facing, then there is no question that families 
are often left alone with no help, no support to make those very 
painful decisions that they know to be right.  That is something 
we cannot take away from people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we have an obligation to resolve this issue.  We have 
an obligation to review the law.  We have an obligation to guide 
the law and we have an obligation to make the law fit our society 
today and the right to die with dignity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us, which we will vote on today, simply asks 
that a special committee be appointed to review the provisions of 
the Criminal Code.  That is something that should be supported by 
all members of this House in the acknowledgement and 
understanding that if we do not do this today we will likely be 
debating this matter in another few months or in another year 
because the issue will still be here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely it is the proper course of action that we pass this 
motion.  This is what we are here to do.  We are here to debate, 
to review and to decide on issues that affect our lives, the 
lives of Canadians, not just in terms of budgets and resources, 
but in terms of the quality of life itself and the right of a 
competent adult to make her or his own decision concerning their 
life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members of the House to support this motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie—Simcoe—Bradford, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the matter of euthanasia and assisted suicide has 
enormous ethical and legal ramifications. 
At the outset it is critical to note that the non-initiation and 
cessation of medical treatment is distinctly different from a 
deliberate action taken to bring about the death of a patient. A 
huge difference exists between allowing to die and killing. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1810"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT43"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT43"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1810

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are engaged in a discussion on whether we as legislators 
should change the Criminal Code of Canada to permit the killing 
of persons with permanent or terminal illness.  Let us be clear 
about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The right of a competent individual to refuse or cease medical 
treatment has long been accepted in law and in care giving, but 
for this country to permit euthanasia and assisted suicide, 
removing the penalties of criminal law, as has been done in 
Holland, will in effect redefine the values of the state. 
Further, it will gravely impinge on the traditional relationship 
between the patient and the physician and the role of palliative 
care within our health system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider the doctor-patient relationship.  The trust 
inherent here must be preserved.  The belief that the patient's 
self-interest is always the physician's priority is the most 
vital component of that relationship.  By creating a society in 
which the physician may participate in the active taking of life 
we cross a threshold and threaten the trust of beneficence that 
is the root of the physician-patient relationship.  Where there 
is already vulnerability we risk the creation of fear and 
mistrust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is imperative to consider what motives might be behind a 
person's request for euthanasia or assisted suicide.  Frequently 
the patient has begun to see himself as a burden on loved ones 
and feels obligated to cease being so.  Sometimes the seriously 
ill patient is fearful of unrelieved pain that might not be 
managed and looks to assisted suicide as a way out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it is diminished, our health care system is capable of 
correction and of providing the resources and priorities 
necessary to address these fears.  With appropriate support from 
hospitals, hospice and community care the concerns of the patient 
can be remedied.  When the efforts of the care givers shift from 
curative to creating a comfortable environment wherein the person 
receives pain control, psychological and spiritual support, the 
opportunity exists for great integrity in the final weeks or 
months of the ill person's life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a former hospice worker I have witnessed great intimacy and 
honesty between the terminally ill person and his or her family 
that would never have occurred should the road chosen have been 
euthanasia instead of palliative care.  Not only does resorting 
to euthanasia risk hijacking palliative care in this country and 
endangering the patient-physician relationship, it also leads our 
society on a trajectory we do not want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The example of Holland, the only western country to officially 
sanction euthanasia and assisted suicide, cannot be omitted from 
any debate.  Although the Dutch guidelines require that the 
patient be experiencing unbearable pain, that requirement is now 
read to include psychic suffering or the potential disfigurement 
of personality.  I ask my colleagues how far down the slippery 
slope this shows the Dutch have gone.  A further example is the 
landmark decision of 1993 in which a Dutch psychiatrist was ruled 
to be justified in helping his depressed but physically healthy 
patient to commit suicide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The trajectory becomes a downward spiral, one on which this 
country must not embark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1982 the Law Reform Commission of Canada raised the concern 
that there is a real danger that the procedure developed to allow 
the death of those who are a burden to themselves may be 
gradually diverted from its original purpose and eventually used 
to eliminate those who are a burden to others or to society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a world that does not try to give positive meaning to old age 
and suffering, it could become normal to ask to put an end to 
life and abnormal to want to live despite subtle pressures from 
all sides.  We will have to justify our own survival. 
The day that an individual must justify his or her own survival 
must never be allowed to dawn in this country.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legal framework must enhance the common good.  Removing the 
Criminal Code restrictions against euthanasia and assisted 
suicide will in the long run deny that common good and the 
principles that have so enriched this country's jurisprudence. As 
legislators it is our obligation to reaffirm, not deny, the 
common good we have been elected to safeguard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our denial of euthanasia and assisted suicide must be 
accompanied by a greater commitment to far greater resources 
being assigned to palliative care in this country. Death and 
dying receive the least amount of support from medical research 
funding agencies.  Palliative care is not fairly accessed nor in 
sufficient quality for all Canadians in all provinces and 
territories. Likewise greater priorities and resources must be 
assigned to palliative care in our medical schools than is 
currently provided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The distinction drawn in the United States Supreme Court 
decision in Quill must be seen as critical:  When a patient 
refuses life-sustaining medical treatment, he dies from the 
underlying fatal disease or pathology; but if a patient ingests 
lethal medication prescribed by a physician, he is killed by that 
medication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the first instance, the patient is allowed to die.  In the 
second instance, the patient is killed. The distinction is 
integral.  We would be debating the latter, the killing of 
patients by deliberate action taken to bring about their death. 
We have rightly accepted the concept of allowing to die.  We must 
not accept the concept of killing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This House will decide the timing of such a debate.  The essence 
of that debate is as I have described.  We must look to all the 
issues that are before us.  We do not have the option to engage 
in emotionalism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For us as legislators, there is a great onus to dissect and care 
for all the ingredients before us before we change a law like 
this that will have such enormous implications and ramifications 
for our society, for the continual downward spiral I have been 
describing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not able to take an easy course.  We are not able to 
participate further in a society that would allow for instant 
gratification on so many other fronts to be brought to bear on 
any issue as critical as this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There must be no fear among people entering hospitals in this 
country.  There must be no concern among seniors who already in 
many cases are coping as they are with other issues that do not 
remedy the worst things that come to them. They must feel that 
their care and their health is their physician's first concern. 
It is their legislator's first concern.

<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
last week I had an opportunity to ask a question of the Secretary 
of State for Children and Youth about the issue of fetal alcohol 
syndrome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol effects are permanent 
mental and physical damage done to the fetus caused by alcohol 
consumption during pregnancy.  This tragedy is 100% preventable 
and studies have concluded that most Canadians are not 
sufficiently informed of the risk of even modest consumption of 
alcohol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992 the Standing Committee on Health produced a report 
entitled “Fetal Alcohol Syndrome:  A Preventable Tragedy”.  In 
the report it was found that there was no question maternal 
alcohol consumption could have devastating impacts on the fetus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The basic fact is that when a pregnant woman drinks her unborn 
child also drinks, that is the alcohol in the mother's blood 
stream circulates through the placenta into the blood stream of 
the fetus.  It is possible that the blood alcohol level of the 
fetus will remain at elevated levels for a longer period than 
that of the mother because the immature fetal liver metabolizes 
the alcohol much more slowly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Research shows that 5% of all fetal defects are due to alcohol 
consumption during pregnancy.  According to Health Canada, FAS 
occurs in 1 out of every 500 live births.  This is more than for 
Down's syndrome which occurs in 1 in 600 live births. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>FAS children can reflect the following:  severe neurological 
disorders, social dysfunction, permanent behavioural problems, 
life span reduction, reduced brain development, learning 
disorders, hyperactivity, mental retardation, post and prenatal 
growth retardation, speech and vision impairment and other 
physical deformities.  Needless to say, it is a very serious 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>FAS is estimated to cost $1.5 million during the lifetime of an 
FAS child.  The annual cost to Canada is estimated at some $2.7 
billion in terms of increased health care, special education and 
other services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>FAE or fetal alcohol effects is very similar to FAS with the 
same range of problems in a less severe form and without the 
characteristic facial deformities.  However, it should be noted 
that FAE occurs two to three times more frequently than fetal 
alcohol syndrome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The medical profession concedes that the detection techniques 
are literally in their infancy in terms of their sophistication. 
As well, those with FAS or FAE generally have difficulties 
discerning the difference between right and wrong.  There is a 
substantial concern that a large number of inmates in our prisons 
are victims of this terrible situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October 1996 the Minister of Health and the Canadian 
Pediatric Society issued a joint statement in which they said 
that there was no safe level of alcohol consumption during 
pregnancy.  They also said very clearly that the best decision 
for pregnant women is to abstain from alcohol during pregnancy.

<A HREF="#LINKT50"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise this matter in the House because I believe it is time 
that awareness of this issue come before the House again so all 
members of Parliament, and indeed all Canadians, know more about 
the problem.  The fact is that even modest levels of alcohol 
consumption during pregnancy can have severe and devastating 
impacts on a fetus and for the remainder of their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise the question with the secretary of state in the hopes 
that there can be some action taken with regard to improving 
public awareness of fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol 
effects. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Children and 
Youth), Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the 
House to address the problem of fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal 
alcohol effects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fetal alcohol syndrome more commonly known as FAS is a medical 
diagnosis that refers to a set of alcohol disabilities associated 
with the use of alcohol during pregnancy.  Fetal alcohol effects, 
FAE, is used to describe children with prenatal exposure to 
alcohol resulting in learning disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although there are no statistics regarding the extent of FAS and 
FAE in Canada, it is estimated that one to three children in 
every 1,000 in the industrialized countries will be born with 
fetal alcohol syndrome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should qualify this statement by saying that work is being 
done in Canada.  Specifically the work I am familiar with is 
being done in B.C. by a working group of professionals.  Some of 
the notables in that professional group are Dr. Geoffrey 
Robinson, a former nurse by the name of Marilyn Van Bibber, 
originally from the Yukon Territories, and many others who are 
worthy of mention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the interest of time I have to say that no single group, 
organization, community, ministry or level of government can deal 
effectively with the problem on its own.  Broad based efforts are 
required, given that everyone has a stake in addressing this 
complex issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank my colleagues, not just the member for Mississauga South 
but also the member for Moncton who shares a great deal of 
commitment and interest in this critical issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make a couple of suggestions.  We need a 
national process.  Perhaps a few suggestions are in order.  There 
are many helpful recommendations in the standing committee report 
entitled “The Preventable National Tragedy”.  We might 
incorporate those into—

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>IMMIGRATION 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
there is still very strong concern in my riding of Vancouver East 
regarding the immigration legislative review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Vancouver East is one of the most multicultural ridings in 
Canada.  It is made up of people whose mother tongue is English, 
Chinese, Italian, Spanish, French, Tagolog, Vietnamese, as well 
as other languages.  Vancouver East has a strong historical 
multicultural root and has always welcomed immigrants from every 
continent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has the rich tradition of a working class immigrant 
settlement shaping such diverse neighbourhoods as Strathcona, 
Chinatown, Grandview-Woodlands, Little Italy, Oppenheimer Park 
and Japan Town. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Vancouver East is also home to many multicultural organizations 
and services.  I provide this brief snapshot of my community to 
illustrate why the recommendations of the legislative immigration 
review concern me deeply.  If implemented, the recommendations 
stand to fundamentally change Vancouver East as a living, vibrant 
example of multicultural diversity that enriches everyone in the 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to the hearings that began in Vancouver on February 27, I 
met with local organizations and organizations that served the 
immigrant communities and multicultural communities including 
organizations such as Success, the Chinese Benevolent 
Association, Mosaic, Immigrant Services Society, the Philippine 
Women's Centre and the Storefront Orientation Service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents and those organizations told me that they were 
deeply concerned about the recommendations contained in the 
report, particularly involving language, education and the fees 
imposed on prospective immigrants to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also heard very strong concerns about the process of the 
review itself.  Even before the report became public there was a 
very closed door process, by invitation only, in which many 
organizations not only in my riding but in other ridings were not 
allowed the opportunity to have input into the report before it 
became public.

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public hearings themselves that began in Vancouver were also 
something that caused a lot of concern in my riding.  Many groups 
wanting to speak to the hearing were not heard and even though 
the minister provided some extra days of hearings there was 
inadequate time for local organizations to be heard on what 
really is the most serious situation involving potential change 
to Canada's immigration and refugee policies during the last 25 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was also a lot of concern about the recommendation 
concerning language requirements.  Reading through the report and 
from what I heard from my constituents is that in Vancouver East 
we believe very strongly that the recommendations show a very 
deep bias toward non-anglophone and non-francophone people.  If 
those recommendations are implemented they would fundamentally 
change the kind of neighbourhood and the kind of riding that 
Vancouver East has been over the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to call on the government and the minister on behalf of 
my constituents to make it clear that this report will not be 
adopted.  There is a lot of concern this report will be rushed 
through by the end of the year or that some recommendations will 
be dropped and that other recommendations, which maybe do not 
have popular support in terms of policies around refugees and 
lack of security around an independent process, will be pushed 
through by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to get an assurance that the government is not 
going to rush through legislative changes, that there will be a 
full and open debate around our immigration and multicultural 
policies and that the government will assure us that there will 
not be punitive and biased recommendations— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> The Parliamentary 
Secretary to Minister of Citizenship and Immigration. 
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Maria Minna (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think it 
should be clarified that the report submitted for public 
consultation is not a government report.  It was written by an 
independent group of consultants.  It is not the minister's or 
department's report. The minister is not bound by any of the 172 
recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has made it clear a number of times that the 
recommendation with respect to the language issue is not on.  I 
think the hon. member is creating unnecessary anxiety where there 
is none because there is full consultation.  In preparing the 
report, for example, the legislative review advisory group 
consulted with hundreds of groups and individuals across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were consultations that also took place in 1994, as the 
hon. member will remember. They have done very thorough work. The 
minister has no intention of duplicating the work at this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister, however, has travelled across Canada and has 
consulted with various interested parties about these 
recommendations.  The public submissions to the minister that 
took place in seven different cities across Canada were only one 
part of the broader consultation effort.  The minister has also 
invited all interested Canadians to read the report, look at its 
recommendations and submit their comments in writing.  All 
opinions and comments will be taken into account in the 
development of new legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Initially the minister intended to conduct five days of 
consultation.  That number more than doubled to accommodate 
requests from a variety of groups, allowing for even more voices 
to be heard on more issues.  The fact that the minister extended 
the consultation days is a clear indication that the minister is 
listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the government's desire to develop legislation that will 
reflect the needs of Canadian society and prepare Citizenship and 
Immigration Canada for the 21st century while keeping in place 
Canadian values.

<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, my question for the parliamentary secretary of fisheries 
and oceans is quite clear.  He was on our west coast tour with 
the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans when we toured the 
west communities to find out exactly what is going on out there 
and why there is so much distrust between the communities that 
are involved in fishing activities and that of the DFO and of the 
current minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I asked a question on behalf of west coast fishers 
and I will repeat that question. 
I will give it a little preamble after that as well. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1935"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT53"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT53"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1935
<A HREF="#LINKT54"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question was quite straightforward.  The Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans has stated to our committee that there is no 
12 mile protection zone around Langara Island on B.C.'s west 
coast from commercial trawlers.  He definitely stated there was 
no protection zone around that island.  However, DFO documents 
clearly state otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister also stated that one should never give allocation 
of quota from one sector of the fishing industry to another.  You 
should never to do that.  This is exactly what has happened when 
DFO cut off the chinook salmon to B.C. trawlers and fishers and 
gave it to the Sport Fishing Institute.  Ms. Velma McColl, who 
once worked for the Sport Fishing Institute and lobbied very 
hard, is now the minister's assistance in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question was straightforward.  Why does this government allow 
DFO to have a policy that helps the minister's friends in British 
Columbia and not that of west coast fishers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a crisis in B.C. with our coho stocks and that many 
thousands of B.C. fishers are now going to be facing unemployment 
and tragedy in their coastal communities.  These people who are 
watching now have a right to an answer and I would like that 
answer as clear, concise and transparent as possible. 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I will try to be 
very concise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am disappointed that the member is trying to allege 
favouritism because of one individual who works for the minister. 
The minister is very fortunate to have individuals within his 
ranks who have experience in the fishery. That is what we need in 
the fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of Langara Island at the north end of the Queen 
Charlotte Islands, disputes between the recreational sector and 
the commercial seiners and trawlers have been an issue since the 
mid 1980s.  It began with the growth of the chinook recreational 
fishery in the area and more recently these gear conflicts 
intensified.  There is competition for the fishing area by the 
various groups, particularly for the relatively sheltered spots. 
Seine fishers because of the use of beach tie-offs and the size 
of the net interfere with or displace the significantly smaller 
recreational vessels.  Similarly, fishing patterns of trawlers 
also may conflict with recreational fishers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stress that the primary focus of the Langara Island issue is 
not about conservation.  It is about the desire of the different 
sectors to fish in the same area and the inherent incompatibility 
of these gears to co-exist in that same area.  A small area 
around Langara Island is closed to commercial salmon trawlers 
early in the season to slow the catch rate of the chinook salmon.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, on March 16, I asked the Minister of Industry about 
the links between his department and the pharmaceutical industry. 
This question came on the heels of a decision by the Minister of 
Industry to push through drug patent regulation changes.  This 
decision was made despite the fact that it added another two 
years to an already lengthy period of 20 year patent protection 
for brand name drug companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This decision was made despite the fact that it will continue to 
push up drug prices.  This decision was made contrary to the 
wishes of Canadians, health care consumers, health care activists 
and the generic drug industry.  This decision was made despite 
the fact that it will make it actually harder for the generic 
industry to compete in this important health care sector.  This 
decision was made despite the fact that the Minister of Health 
acknowledged that the notice of compliance regulations were 
problematic and that cabinet would be dealing with them 
seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that the draft regulations were released 
January 24. The public was given until only February 23 to 
respond.  The government then proceeded to revise those 
regulations and without any further chance for consultation 
pushed through the regulations and made the law on March 12.  It 
should also be noted that when the cabinet decision was announced 
Merck Frosst had all the paper work ready to block a new generic 
heart drug from entering the market.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it any wonder that Canadians believe the drug industry is 
running this government?  Is it any wonder that Canadians believe 
this government is always putting the needs of industry 
ahead of the common good, ahead of the public interest?  The hope 
they had for positive change from this government has been 
dashed.  They have been left with nothing but broken promises, 
disappointment and a feeling of helplessness in the face of this 
huge hold by the multinational drug industry over this 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us are asking the question:  Who is in charge?  Is it the 
industry or is it the Minister of Health?  Is the Minister of 
Health involved?  Where is the Minister of Health?  Is it the 
position of this government that the wishes of the big brand name 
drug industry should rule the day? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All that we are asking for is that the government reconsider 
this important issue to put some competition back into this 
industry and stop this monopoly hold by big brand name drug 
companies which is forcing up prices.  It is time for a national 
vision for pharmaceuticals, a vision that puts patients before 
profits, science before salesmanship and leadership before 
lobbying.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, as previously stated by the 
Minister of Industry, it is impossible to conclude that the 
changes to the patent drug regulations were rushed through.  The 
review of these regulations goes back to February 1997, in 
keeping with the legislative requirement to review Bill C-91. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over a six week period the industry committee examined all 
aspects of the Canada drug patent.  I should mention that her 
party seldom attended these meetings.  During this time the 
committee heard some 130 witnesses and received an additional 40 
submissions, many of which raised issues surrounding the 
regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Counsel from both the generic and brand name industries appeared 
before the committee to assess various proposals on how to deal 
with the regulations.  The committee recommended revisiting the 
regulatory regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Discussions with stakeholders have continued since that time.  As 
a result changes, were proposed to the regulations.  These changes 
were pre-published on January 24, 1998 with a full 30 day 
consultation period, as is the normal practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final regulations that were approved by this special 
committee of counsel, on March 11 and registered on March 12, 
should have come as no surprise to anyone.  It was business as 
usual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After five years of experience with the old regulations we knew 
there were problems with this scheme that needed to be 
addressed, such as unnecessary litigation that wasted court 
resources, an unworkable damages provision, evergreening of 
patents and difficulty in administering the patent lists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new regulations address these problems.  The regime we have 
put in place is a balanced one, recognizing the importance of all 
sectors of this industry, the generic, the brand name and newly 
emerging biopharmaceutical companies.  It is fully in keeping 
with the government's objectives of a fair, more efficient system 
with reduced litigation that provides effective patent protection 
while enabling generic drugs to enter the market immediately on 
patent expiry.

developed world.  We are the only country that has both a

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am glad to have the opportunity to 
raise my concerns regarding the answer I received to my question 
of December 3, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time I asked the justice minister how the next supreme 
court justice could be put through a more appropriate public 
examination for the appointment process.  The minister simply 
replied that she was willing to consult with Canadians who were 
interested.  But this statement clearly indicates that the 
minister was not willing to bring forward a defined process of 
choosing a supreme court judge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister stating that she is willing to consult simply 
means that the minister is not bound by any public input.  The 
minister's reply to my question was out of touch with Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask, in appointing the supreme court justice, what specific 
consultations did the minister do?  Did the minister travel from 
coast to coast asking Canadians what kind of judge they wanted? 
Exactly what kind of sociological advice did the minister receive 
in making the appointment?  If the minister consulted with the 
provincial attorneys general, the chief justice, law societies 
and the Canadian Bar Association, does the minister believe this 
was adequate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the system has supposedly worked fine for 130 years, then why 
would former supreme court Justice Gerard La Forest comment that 
the Canadian process needs reform and that his replacement should 
be appointed only after a public review process has taken place? 
Did the minister not consult with former Justice La Forest?

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United States the president nominates candidates to their 
supreme court.  However before any person is able to take a seat 
on the bench they must appear before a Senate committee where 
their experience is tested, anything from their personal life to 
political views.  In the United States they understand that these 
things are relevant for future quality decisions. To date, 12 
nominations have been rejected and 17 have been withdrawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public process has merit.  Should we not want the absolute 
best judges to make rulings in our highest court?  Do we not want 
to raise the public esteem of the court? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is evident that who does the deciding is just as important as 
what is being decided at the court.  The time is now for this 
government to open up the process to allow the public to have a 
say in who is to be chosen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The appropriate public examination needed includes a forum for 
all Canadians to participate.  I am suggesting that the process 
look similar to that of the United States.  For example, our 
Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights has the capability 
to review appointments of chairmen to the National Parole Board, 
the RCMP and CSIS just to name a few.  Why would it be so 
difficult to set up a process for supreme court judges? On the 
other hand the Senate could hold ratification hearings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I want to make it clear that Reformers are not 
implying that newly appointed supreme court judges are incapable 
or incompetent in any way.  What we are saying is that the 
process to find replacements must change and must be modernized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want change.  Provincial justice ministers want 
change.  Former supreme court justices want change.  Why is the 
minister ignoring these pleas? The government even says that it 
wants change and then nothing happens.  It is like the Young 
Offenders Act issue since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is widely expected that before the end of this year two more 
justices will step down.  A responsible minister would work on 
changing the process right now.  Will the next appointments be 
made the same old way, or will the minister give way to the 
public's wishes and do the right thing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among the varied screening processes there needs to be a 
vigorous public accountability threshold to maintain the 
integrity and public regard for our highest court. 
<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Maria Minna (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, as you 
know, appointments to the Supreme Court of Canada are made by the 
governor in council.  Puisne judges as well as the chief justice 
are appointed on the recommendation of the Prime Minister in 
consultation with the Minister of Justice. In the process leading 
to an appointment, senior members of the bench and the bar are 
consulted.  While there is no formal involvement of provinces in 
the selection of the judges, the province from which the 
appointment is made is consulted as well. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This selection process has produced excellent results in the 
last 122 years, by allowing for the appointment of highly 
qualified jurists. However, since the adoption of the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the bench, and particularly the 
supreme court justices, have become the interpreters and 
protectors of the values enshrined in the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians now show an increasing interest for the judicial 
function and for those who fulfil that function. Consequently, it 
is important to make sure that those appointed to the bench are 
receptive to the values reflected in the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As she said on the appointment of Mr. Justice Bastarache, the 
Minister of Justice is open to expanding the consultation 
process leading to the identification of qualified candidates for 
a position with the court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, because of the untimely death of the late Mr. 
Justice Sopinka, just a few weeks after the appointment of Mr. 
Justice Bastarache, the Department of Justice has not yet had the 
opportunity to closely examine all the possibilities. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case it is very clear to the Minister of Justice that 
Canada should avoid the adoption of a U.S. style confirmation 
hearings process which has too often become a sideshow in which 
reputations are routinely destroyed by opposing politicians' 
intent on scoring political points.

Order 24(1).
