</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage—Lisgar, Ref.)</B> moved that 
Bill C-223, an act to amend the Income Tax Act (deduction of 
interest on mortgage loans), be read the second time and referred 
to committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, it is a real pleasure to rise in the 
House today to address my private members' bill, C-223. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will be supported by a lot of industries right across 
Canada.  I have had contacts from the housing industry and the 
banking industry, saying that this bill or this type of Income 
Tax Act change is long overdue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will make it more feasible for young families to own a 
home.  When we look at the importance of families to a nation, we 
see that they are the basic building block of a strong nation. 
We want a good solid family, a family that has some encouragement 
and desire to put equity into a home or shelter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We often forget that these young families will be dealing with a 
taxation burden never before been seen in Canadian history.  Look 
at the $600 billion of debt which is going to be put on their 
shoulders in the next century, a debt which they will have to 
service.  The way the government has been going the last three 
and a half or four years will add another $100 billion to that. 
We know we have to do something for these young families so that 
they will have an incentive to continue to pay taxes. Otherwise I 
think they will feel like giving up and saying “why should I 
even try to get equity because it is all going to be taxed away 
from me before I have the interest or the ability to own a 
home”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I designed this bill so that it would not be an incentive for 
home owners to upgrade their dwelling or be favourable to the 
higher income families.  I felt it should address the lower 
income families, the people who have really been behind the eight 
ball, giving them a level playing field when it comes to home 
ownership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look back through history, no matter what happened in the 
thirties, the twenties and the fifties, home ownership was always 
something that set the tone for the economy of that decade.  When 
people could afford to buy homes, we had a stronger economy. 
This is something that was really devastating in the thirties 
when homes were being vacated and people were moving to lower 
cost abodes.  The country suffered for it. 
The number of homes built during the last decade was stagnant.  A 
year or two ago home ownership picked up. 
When I did some research it astounded me that in 1993 there were 
350,000 exchanges of home ownership. They were either people who 
were upgrading to better homes or people who could afford new 
homes.  Out of that 350,000 changes in home ownership 50,000 were 
new homes. We know there were 50,000 new home owners in 1993. 
That is when things started looking a little brighter because 
government was trying to get the deficit under control and people 
had a little more confidence in the economy.

what that does to an economy with 50,000 new homes, plus the 
furnishings that are put into them, plus the landscaping and 
whatever that goes with a new home which provides a lot of jobs. 
That is what this country needs:  jobs and the ability to afford 
to own a home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill also gives these new home owners an incentive to apply 
their equity which can be used in their retirement.  When they 
have a home to sell when they get to that age where they do not 
want to take care of it or they are forced into senior housing 
developments, they at least have some equity to back them up 
which today is a big problem for a lot of seniors who have never 
owned a home and have always lived in rental apartments. They 
find it hard to pay for accommodation later on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is another benefit in this bill.  It will give people the 
opportunity to acquire equity that they can in their senior years 
use as a retirement fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For people who have been buying homes lately, who took the 
gamble because they thought the economy was turning up, I have 
proposed that this bill, if passed, will be applicable to first 
time home owners who bought their homes after December 31, 1994. 
Therefore, there is the opportunity for people who took the 
chance and went out on a limb because they were allowed to use 5% 
of their RRSPs to invest in a home, to secure their investment by 
being able to deduct the interest from the time that the bill is 
passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a complaint from a number of people who asked why 
first time home owners should get this tax break when people who 
rent out their units do not get a tax break.  I was astounded 
when I researched the Income Tax Act to see what kind of tax 
breaks rental owners do get.  There is a lengthy list which I 
will not take the time to explain in full but for example, any 
rental investor who owns a rental unit can declare the property 
taxes as an expense.  They can include the insurance on their 
rental property, maintenance and repairs, heat, light and water, 
advertising, interest on the money borrowed, as I am proposing in 
this bill for first time home owners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see that it is really not a level playing field for the 
home owners at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who have rental units can even include automobile 
expenses that they use for servicing the property, advertizing 
and commissions paid to obtain tenants.  All these things are tax 
deductible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why home ownership does not always sound feasible 
because the rental units can be rented at a fair cost compared to 
servicing the costs of a home. 
One needs extra wealth and income to own one's home.  The bill, 
for the first time, would give lower income homeowners a more 
level playing field even if it is not totally level.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I looked at some legislation passed in the U.S. in the 1940s 
when all mortgage interest became a taxable expense.  We are 
about 50 years behind in our income tax compared to the U.S. 
There are certain changes in its program I would not want to have 
in the Income Tax Act, but the U.S. did not look at the issue of 
how much revenue government was losing.  It looked at the issue 
of how much more money was put into the economy.  When taxes are 
saved they are invested somewhere else, which was behind the idea 
of writing that into its income tax act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I found an article written by Hugh Segal.  I do not always like 
what he says.  A lot of people have heard him. We must give 
credit where credit is due.  I thought he made some good 
comments.  This is what he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should the tax system encourage one activity and discourage 
the other?  Why is the family home a target?  Why is it less 
important than an office, a warehouse or a piece of machinery? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was the way I looked at it.  The home is a basic place of 
shelter, the place where we raise our families with certain moral 
character, where we try to teach them what is good for the 
country, what will be ahead of them, what they will have to do 
and what their responsibilities will be when they become adults. 
I thought that was a pretty good argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1979 the Conservatives introduced a bill very similar to this 
one.  However the government of that day did not last very long, 
only six months, and the bill died on the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  That was too long anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:</B>  We can debate that argument when we 
are dealing with some other bill.  The government would probably 
agree with that statement so we will not get into that debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then he went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Middle income Canadians would also experience an increase in 
disposable and discretionary income.  There would be an easier 
transition from renting to owning and the family home would for 
once be the beneficiary of an enlightened tax policy as opposed 
to the victim. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the way I have looked at it.  Why should a home be 
taxed?  It is fundamental if one wants to raise a family as a 
unit.  It is a lot better to raise a family under those 
conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point struck me when I read the article by Mr. Segal. 
Many first time homeowners would also like to go into private 
business.  They may have the intelligence to be an entrepreneur 
or to develop things.  This tax break would let them either save 
money for some future rainy day, education purposes for their 
families or to start a small business.  If they had a small 
equity or some money they could put into a small business, that 
is probably the direction they would take.  It is pretty well 
ever family's desire to have a business in the home.  We know 
what that would do for job creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to see all the benefits.  The Toronto-Dominion 
Bank was referred to in an article in the Winnipeg <I>Free 
Press</I>. 
I even got some coverage in a paper that really does not want to 
give Reform too much coverage.  There was an article indicating 
that my bill would help first time home buyers.  It made me feel 
pretty good I got that attention.  This is what the article said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a typical 25 year mortgage at 6.35% first time home buyers 
could claim some $1,700 on their income tax, according to Diane 
Olivier of the Toronto-Dominion Bank.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some $1,700 of extra income is quite a bit to a young family 
starting up or to first time homeowners.  It is super.  I did not 
do the mathematics, but I think the bank has the ability and the 
research people to put those figures together.  The article 
continued: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Some people can be scared off by the costs of purchasing a 
first house” said Rischuk Park Realty owner Rusty Rischuk.  The 
proposed amendment would make Winnipegers more confident that 
they can afford a home.  I think it is wonderful. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is from another sector of the economy.  People can have 
confidence in a certain idea or in something that gives them an 
opportunity to invest.   Referring to last summer when the stock 
market was booming and interest rates were coming down, the 
article said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nearly 60% of the city's homes sold from January to September 
were bought by first time home buyers. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know what that does to the building trade, the furniture 
trade or any business tied to manufacturing these homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It is a job creation effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:</B>  It is job creation, very true.  In 
addition, it said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A record high 25,000 Winnipeg renters could afford to purchase a 
home. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was an added incentive.  It really surprised me this was an 
impact of the bill.  It would increase Winnipeg's job 
opportunities or the building trade by 25,000 homes. That is 
quite impressive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope my colleagues on both sides of the House will see the 
bill as something non-political that will encourage and give our 
young people the opportunity to invest, to have a home and to 
build up equity that in future years can be turned over for their 
retirement or for senior housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also refers to co-op housing.  If people buy a 
condominium or an apartment in a co-op housing project they will 
be eligible under the bill as living in individual dwellings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is very well designed.  It will not reduce government 
revenue.  Rather it will probably increase revenue and be 
positive for the economy, not negative as some people presume. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This opportunity has provided me with quite a bit of publicity 
in the papers.  My delight in this regard is that it shows Reform 
has good ideas.  People who have never voted Reform say this is a 
bill thought out by a Reformer that helps everybody, the whole 
country, not just Liberals, Conservatives, Bloc members or 
Reformers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the House cannot see the light of day on that and support the 
bill, it will be very discouraging to keep on working.  What are 
we working for?  We are working for the country.  We are trying 
to build the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are trying to set up an economy for the 21st century that 
will be positive, that will give our young people something to 
dream about, and that will tell our young people we in this 
generation look after them.  We will try to support them in 
carrying the huge tax burden because of the debt load and other 
mistakes made by past governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the past mistakes we cannot say it was just the 
government that made these mistakes.  We as individuals, as 
constituents, allowed it to happen.  It should have never 
happened.  We were complacent.  We did not pay attention so the 
problem is there.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, Bill C-223 proposes to 
introduce an income tax deduction with respect to the mortgage 
interest paid on the first $100,000 of a mortgage loan by 
individuals purchasing a first home after 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent and spirit of the bill is quite laudable, but I would 
like to make a couple of points with respect to the current 
Income Tax Act and then move on to some of the other issues this 
proposal brings forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Income Tax Act presently does not allow for the 
deductibility of mortgage interest on principal residences. 
However, capital gains on the sale of a principal residence are 
not taxable to the owner either.  If mortgage interest rates were 
deductible, capital gains should be made taxable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The measure, if limited to first time home buyers at maturity, 
would cost about $3 billion per year.  Limiting the interest 
deduction to first time home buyers may be somewhat difficult. 
The proposal would create some significant differences in the tax 
treatment of qualifying homeowners and would be quite difficult 
to defend.  If mortgage interest deductions were then extended to 
all homeowners the annual revenue cost would be approximately $6 
billion.  Admittedly, if the principal residence were subject to 
capital gains, the revenue decline would be somewhat less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A taxpayer's choice of accommodation, owning versus renting, is 
a personal choice.  The hon. member attempted to make the 
distinction between renters and owners and provided an example of 
those who own rental units rather than those who live in rental 
units.  He is quite correct.  Those who own rental units are 
entitled to write off property taxes, insurance, heat, light, et 
cetera.  It is a business activity.  Those who rent units do not 
carry on a business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go back to the point that a choice of accommodation is 
normally a personal decision and the costs associated with it are 
personal expenses.  The tax system does not allow deductions and 
credits for personal expenses.  Accordingly principal residences 
are not treated as investments for tax purposes.  The mortgage 
interest paid on a principal residence is not deductible.  The 
capital gains on the sale of a principal residence is also 
non-taxable to the homeowner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed deduction would also be inequitable to taxpayers 
without a mortgage.  Again it is unwarranted because capital 
gains in principal residences are non-taxable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the present case.  First time home buyers already 
receive tax assistance under the home buyers plan.  Under the 
plan, first time home buyers are allowed to borrow money from the 
RRSPs without having to include the amount as income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This proposal would see the deductibility resulting in a net 
transfer to homeowners with mortgages from other taxpayers who 
would have either to pay higher taxes or would receive reduced 
services to finance the deductibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the spirit of reallocation, to which I am sure the Reform 
Party is quite committed, if there is an expenditure the money 
has to come from somewhere.  It does not come from the sky. There 
would be an increase in income taxes or a reallocation from 
income taxes or reduced services.  The Reform Party often makes 
that point.  I would just like to make sure that it understands 
the point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, benefits would not be fairly distributed between 
groups of taxpayers.  Benefits would be earned disproportionately 
by higher income earners who are more likely to have larger 
mortgages.  Less than 15% of the benefits under the proposal 
would accrue to families with less than $50,000 in income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite clearly the proposal would create significant differences 
in the tax treatment of homeowners, identical in every respect 
except the timing of their home purchase. 
For example, a first time home buyer would be able to deduct up 
to $6,000 assuming an annual interest rate of 6% on a 
$100,000 mortgage annually, while the neighbour carrying an identical 
mortgage would be denied a deduction because either the residence 
was not his or her first home or the residence was purchased 
before the effective date.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The success of the government's work, its deficit reduction 
strategy which Canadians have been quite supportive, has meant 
lower interest rates which have reduced the costs of home 
ownership.  One year mortgage rates have declined by more than 
400 basis points since January 1995.  This has provided savings 
greater than $3,000 in terms of lower annual mortgage payments 
for a $100,000 mortgage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have respect for the hon. member, for his intent with this 
bill and for the hard work he put into drafting and researching 
it. All members of this House are quite clearly interested in 
strengthening the economy, in ensuring our economy continues to 
grow and that our young people are able to participate.  Quite 
frankly, the expenditure of $3 billion that is strictly targeted 
to first time home buyers or, as another hon. member mentioned, 
an expenditure of $6 billion annually across the board would 
result in some reallocation of services or an increase in taxes 
in order to maintain a balanced budget, in order to maintain the 
level of services Canadians expect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the spirit of this bill is one that every member of 
this House would clearly support, the technical challenges that 
this bill faces and the requirement— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It's too simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  It is not too simple.  It is quite 
difficult to defend the legislation when one neighbour is able to 
deduct $6,000 in interest payments and because the other 
neighbour's home was purchased prior to 1994 and was not a first 
time purchase, that neighbour would be unable to claim that 
deduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Are you going to pay back all the debt 
you have created? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  Madam Speaker, we hear heckling from the 
other side but I am trying to bring some context to the 
discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point the bill is not affordable when we are talking 
about $3 billion or $6 billion of expenditure.  It is not 
necessary from the perspective that the housing industry in this 
country has continued to soar over this last little while with 
interest rates being maintained in a certain range.  We foresee 
the housing industry continuing to grow.  In essence we feel the 
bill is unnecessary at this time.  A bigger reason is the equity 
of the bill.  We could not discriminate against those Canadians 
who because they purchased their homes prior to 1994 would be 
unable to deduct the interest.  If we were to extend this 
proposal to every homeowner it would be a $6 billion expenditure 
at a time when we have not yet balanced the budget.  Yet we are 
starting to see these types of proposal coming forward calling 
for all kinds of expenditure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a government we are committed to ensuring we bring forward 
and support the fiscal policies we have brought forward over the 
last number of years.  We want to ensure a balanced budget.  We 
will ensure that any expenditure of this government is done 
through a reallocation.  We will ensure fairness and equity for 
all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I urge every member of this House to agree that the intent 
of the bill is quite laudable, I must ask every member of this 
House not to support the measure.  It is not affordable, 
necessary or equitable.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, the bill 
tabled by the hon. member for Portage—Lisgar meets an urgent need 
to revitalize the construction sector. It also represents an 
interesting way of helping future first-time home buyers by giving 
them a tax break on the first $100,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, the interest on a mortgage costs the average 
homeowner a bundle, and this is true throughout the country, 
including in Quebec.  Often the interest on a mortgage prevents 
young families from buying a home. 
It is therefore time for the federal government to take concrete 
action to encourage the housing industry, an important lever in the 
Canadian, Quebec and regional economies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interest rates are now within the reach of most people.  It is 
therefore appropriate that the government bring in legislation to 
encourage young families to buy homes more suited to their needs. 
If the government were to go ahead with certain tax measures, it 
could thus lighten the financial burden on future homeowners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform member from Manitoba mentions that he would like to 
see tax deductions for future home buyers.  The Bloc Quebecois has 
some doubts about the Reform Party's intentions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This deduction, which would be based on individual income, 
would help the richer members of society, and once again put the 
less well off at a serious disadvantage. 
Here again, we recognize the Reform philosophy lurking behind this 
bill:  protect those with higher incomes and forget about the 
poorer members of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not surprise anyone that the Reform Party thinks along 
these lines, because this clearly right leaning party has 
frequently had its own contribution to make to the social nightmare 
created by the Liberals since they came to power in October 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will, if I may, refresh my colleagues' memory concerning the 
tax measures that have done great harm to our social climate: 
unemployment insurance reform, and cuts in provincial transfer 
payments that have created problems in health services, social 
programs and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What have Reformers done about these destructive Liberal 
policies?  I can think of nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recent Speech from the Throne and the economic statement by the 
Minister of Finance show no signs of relief for the less privileged in 
society, and there again Reform members remain silent. We can get an 
idea in fact of the Reform Party's social conscience when we look at 
their position in the current debate on the greenhouse effect throughout 
Canada. The Reform Party acts as if there were only one province 
involved in this matter and neglects to propose a comprehensive solution 
to this global problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us come back to the bill itself. Although its first objective 
is to improve the social climate, the Bloc Quebecois has serious 
concerns about the provisions proposed by the Reform Party to amend the 
Income Tax Act. We believe these proposals will do nothing to meet the 
real needs of future home buyers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its own income tax policy, the Bloc Quebecois is very clear on 
the issue of tax deductions versus tax credits. In its policy statement, 
it makes the following distinctions, which I would like now to examine 
with you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a difference between a tax credit and a tax deduction. Tax 
expenditures can take the form of tax deductions or tax credits. Tax 
deductions are taken into account in the calculation of the taxpayer's 
net income. They are factored in before the amount of tax payable is 
determined and they therefore reduce the taxpayer's taxable income. They 
allow him to benefit from tax savings. These can vary according to the 
tax rate for that income bracket. Tax deductions are regressive, because 
the higher the taxable revenue, the higher the savings. In the present 
system, the higher the tax rates, the greater the tax savings provided 
by tax deductions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, tax credits are subtracted from the amount of 
tax payable. They are used to determine the net amount of tax payable. 
Tax credits are neutral. Tax savings through tax credits are the same 
for every taxpayer, whatever his or her taxable income.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take the example of three incomes: one less than 
$29,590, one in the range between $29,590 and $59,180 and one more 
than $59,180.  For each $1000, a taxpayer with an income of less 
than $29,590 would benefit from an identical tax saving, whether in 
the form of a tax deduction or a tax credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A taxpayer with a taxable income in the $29,590 to $59,180 
range would save $260 in taxes if he takes advantage of a tax 
deduction, whereas he would receive only $170 in the form of a tax 
credit for each $1,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A taxpayer with an income in excess of $59,180 would save $290 
in tax if he was entitled to a tax deduction, whereas he would 
receive only $170 in the form of a tax credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It can be seen, then, that federal assistance to individuals 
via a tax deduction can vary enormously according to the 
individual's taxable income.  A person earning less than $30,000 
would receive $170 in assistance per $1,000 of tax deduction, while 
one earning $60,000 receives $290 in assistance for the same 
deduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The better off therefore receive $120 more in assistance per 
$1,000 in deduction, when their tax savings are compared to those 
of people with a taxable income of less than $29,590.  There is, 
therefore, a flagrant injustice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party therefore approves of the principle set out in Bill 
C-223, but we intend to call for a major amendment. 
We would like to see the proposed tax deductions changed to tax 
credits, which would, in our opinion, be fairer for all those 
affected by this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is how we go about doing this, in a fair, equitable 
and affordable way.  It is not surprising that the Reform Party 
would take an issue of some complexity and present a simplistic 
and unworkable solution to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party constantly sees complex things as simple. In 
fact, it consider everything to be simple. Some things are not 
quite as simple as they appear.  Some things require more 
sophisticated responses than that put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to ensure that families can find affordable and good 
quality homes.  The question is how to do that.  We know that 
over the years one of the main disincentives, especially to young 
families trying to afford homes, has been a high interest rate 
policy.  We now find this reduced.  Consequently one of the 
pressures on home ownership has been reduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about what this bill does or perhaps what it does 
not do.  First, it does not recognize regional disparities across 
the country.  A $100,000 home in one part of the country may be a 
mansion whereas in another part of the country may not be much of 
a house at all.  Why treat those who in one part of the country 
can buy a huge home for $100,000 the same as those who cannot 
find a very large place in a more expensive community? To treat 
different circumstances the same way is simplistic and simply 
will not work.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the way in which the bill works?  The Reform Party 
would like to suggest that this is not terribly expensive, that 
it will encourage growth in the home building market.  No doubt 
it will.  We need to cost these issues out.  As the parliamentary 
secretary indicated, this measure would cost $3 billion a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As he indicated, and even the Reform Party must know, that money 
has to come from somewhere.  It would come from taxes paid by 
those who are not covered by this benefit, and I suppose those 
who are covered by the benefit might have to pay taxes on other 
things in order to make up that $3 billion difference, or a 
reduction in services provided to society as a whole through 
government programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is money provided then by those who do not benefit from 
this particular provision.  I ask why is it fair, why is it 
acceptable, why is it desirable to have those who cannot afford 
to have a home subsidize those who can. When was that fair?  When 
was that acceptable?  It is clearly simplistic, but when was it 
acceptable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would happen if mortgage rates increased?  That is not 
beyond the realm of possibility.  Then the cost would increase 
even further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point has been made that there is no horizontal equity here. 
What about the person who bought a house some time before 1994 
who is struggling to keep that home together and provide a good 
family life for their children?  They will not benefit from this 
program, even though they may live right next door to somebody 
who will.  One family will benefit to the extent perhaps of 
$6,000, $7,000 or $8,000 a year in mortgage payment tax credits, 
tax reductions or tax expenses, whereas the family next door will 
not. That seems to me to be not only patently unfair but patently 
absurd as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a situation which is not fair across groups.  It is 
not fair across families in similar circumstances and it 
represents a significant tax break to some Canadians who are 
rather better off than others.  We have to ask where would that 
money come from and how much is involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member who proposed the bill mentioned the United States 
situation. Some mention has been made of capital gains on 
principal residences in the United States as a part of that total 
tax package.  I wonder whether the Reform Party through this bill 
is suggesting that indeed we should have capital gains taxes on 
principal residences because I am sure Canadians would be 
interested to learn that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to recognize the validity of encouraging home 
ownership.  We need to do that, but we need to do it in a fair, 
equitable and relatively inexpensive way.  This bill is an 
expensive and unfair way and as a result I think will not see the 
light of day.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise today in support of Bill C-223 and commend 
my colleague, the member for Portage—Lisgar, for his foresight 
in introducing such a bill.  I think it is worthy of debate and 
certainly worthy of the Liberal side to examine this whole issue 
of tax relief on mortgage interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I again would like to thank the member for Portage—Lisgar for 
introducing the bill.  It is certainly open for broader reference 
too, not only for first time home buyers but also for everyone 
who may own a home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since this is my first formal speech in the House, Madam 
Speaker, during this 36th Parliament, I would like to take this 
opportunity to congratulate you on your appointment and also the 
Speaker of the House on his election to the chair.  I have a 
great deal of regard for both the Speaker's position, the Chair, 
and the office.  I can assure you that you will have my full 
co-operation and respect throughout this Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank too my constituents for once again placing 
their faith in me.  I am extremely grateful for the trust they 
have given to me. 
I want to assure them publicly that I will represent their 
viewpoints and wishes as best I can.  I will certainly keep 
them uppermost in my mind as I carry out my duties here in the 
House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have recently suffered through what I would call a 
terrible recession when we look at the unemployment rates sitting 
around the double digits over the last little while and now just 
a little below 10%, 9% approximately.  However, the most 
devastating aspect of all is youth unemployment which is in the 
neighbourhood of 17%. That is not acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as parliamentarians should all be doing everything possible 
to change that and drive this economy with every means possible 
to make sure our young people, the future of our country, are 
working and feel positive about what this country has to offer 
them in the future. Unfortunately many of them do not feel that 
their future is all that bright. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides the unemployed there are the under employed.  Hundreds 
of thousands of working individuals are under employed.  They are 
barely getting by and most of the time on two incomes and still 
barely scraping by.  I think it is time for the government to 
take some urgent action to ensure that all Canadians enjoy the 
rich potential of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as I am concerned, this private member's bill 
is a step in the right direction.  Taken in a broad context, if 
everyone were to be given that relief, it would certainly be a 
real boon to the economy when one thinks about how many dollars 
are going to be thrown back into the economy.  A dollar in the 
hands of an employer, an employee or a consumer is much better 
handled than a dollar in the hands of any bureaucrat, any 
government official or any parliamentarian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the House knows, this bill would provide for the deduction of 
interest paid by a taxpayer on the first $100,000 of the mortgage 
on his or her first home.  This bill has several advantages which 
the government would be hard pressed to deny.  I would just like 
to list some of those advantages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First is a considerably lower tax burden on Canadian families. The 
member who introduced the bill certainly mentioned families a lot 
in his presentation.  It is very important to recognize the 
strengthening of the family, the desire that they not be subject 
to someone else's whims in a way like rental or leasing property 
but they would actually be able to own their own home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it would make home ownership accessible to more 
Canadians. I had a chance to speak to people in the United States 
who have the advantage of this deduction. It offers them more 
amenities.  One can actually buy a piece of property and be able 
to afford a few more items that they would not normally be able 
to afford because of that particular deduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, it would level the playing field between Canada and the 
United States.  It would make Canada's tax regime more 
competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in this country are crying out for tax relief and yet it 
is falling on deaf ears.  Those who are able to do something 
about it are not doing anything about it.  In fact, they are 
taxaholics on that side.  There is no question about that. 
Taxaholic is a term that our finance critic issued toward the 
finance minister and I think it is quite acceptable because every 
time there is a dollar loose somewhere it has to be grabbed. They 
have to grab as many dollars as they can from those hard working 
people out there across the country.  I do not think that is 
acceptable especially when it is clear that the people in this 
country are fed up with taxes.  They want relief.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going on to some of the advantages, again it would increase 
equity between home owners with mortgages who must pay interest 
charges with after tax money and those without mortgages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most important, here is where my colleague from the NDP falls 
short.  This money placed into the hands of the individual would 
actually stimulate the economy and create jobs.  There is the key 
to this whole affair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the tax dollars that have to be replaced.  Those tax 
dollars will not be replaced just by the mere fact that people 
out there have more money in their pockets and they will do 
something much more beneficial with it which will generate 
revenue into the coffers of any government.  That is a well known 
fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government spends precious little time doing anything that 
would support Canadian families in that regard.  This bill would 
allow the Liberals to have something concrete to demonstrate that 
their grandiose rhetoric has a bit of substance.  There is a 
dreadful lack of substance opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Owning a home is of great importance to families. Unfortunately 
it is becoming increasingly difficult for many Canadian families 
to realize their dreams and own their own homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-223 would give many lower income Canadians that extra bit 
of cash necessary to allow them to afford that dream.  It gives 
that extra little bit of room.  It would give first time home 
owners the breathing room necessary for them to pay down their 
other debts, to set aside moneys for saving or to spend more on 
their families and their needs in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the government possibly object to allowing Canadians the 
opportunity to spend more of their hard earned dollars on their 
families? I do not think when it comes right down to it that it 
can legitimately object, although I listened to the parliamentary 
secretary who made it very clear that it is not acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accessibility to home ownership is particularly important to our 
young Canadians.  They need a break and they have been hit 
especially hard by tough economic times.  They suffer from higher 
unemployment rates on average and they report a terrible rate 
of under employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I know the parliamentary secretary spoke about the 
shortfall in the tax system, but it is not acceptable.  I think 
many of these adjustments can be made incrementally but 
unfortunately the Liberal side is not even willing to entertain 
some of those very significant changes in the tax structure to 
offer some relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our generation of young people is the first in Canadian history 
who will likely not enjoy the economic benefits that this 
generation has, our parents have.  If we are not careful, home 
ownership will be another example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can relate what policies like this have done to other 
countries but I know I do not have enough time to really get into 
it.  It is unfortunate because I think this is a very key issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only urge the Liberals to recognize a good idea when they 
see it.  They have a habit of stealing good ideas and I think 
this is one they could steal.  I hope in the end they will 
support Bill C-223. 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie—Lincoln, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in 
the short time we have left I would like to make a few 
remarks on this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This private member's bill proposes to introduce an income tax 
deduction for interest payments for first time home buyers on the 
first $100,000 of a mortgage loan where the residence was 
purchased in 1995 or later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent behind this proposal is certainly laudable.  The 
intent is to make it easier for young Canadians to finance the 
purchase of their first home.  However, we should not allow our 
sympathy in this regard to interfere with what I consider a sound 
judgment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put it to you, Mr. Speaker, and to my friends opposite that it 
is possible to laud the intent of an idea without supporting the 
idea itself.  This proposal, despite its worthy aims, has flaws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me begin by noting that the Income Tax Act already provides 
generous incentives for the prospective home buyer.  The capital 
gains from the sale of a principal residence are not taxable to 
the home owner.  In addition, the home buyers plan allows first 
time home buyers to withdraw up to $20,000 from registered 
retirement savings plans to use toward the purchase of a 
principal residence. 
These withdrawals are not subject to tax as long as the money is 
returned to the plan within a period of 15 years.

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another consideration crucial to sound tax policy is that 
taxpayers be treated fairly.  This proposal would confer 
significant tax benefits upon Canadians purchasing a first home 
in 1995 or later.  This proposal, however, would confer nothing 
upon Canadians who are renting or who purchased a first home in 
an earlier year.  This proposal would also confer nothing upon 
young Canadians moving into another residence because their 
family is growing or because a change of employment requires them 
to move to another location. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would find it difficult explaining to these taxpayers why they 
are not as deserving of tax relief as others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The taxpayer's choice of accommodation is really a personal 
decision and the costs associated with it are personal expenses. 
The Canadian income tax system in general does not allow 
deductions or credits for personal expenses, and properly so. 
Personal expenses reflect to a great extent the pace and income 
levels of individuals.  It is not fair for taxpayers at large to 
subsidize the personal expenditures of others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should this proposal be adopted, non-homeowners would find 
themselves subsidizing the home purchasing decisions of others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The change proposed by the member of Parliament for 
Portage—Lisgar would primarily benefit higher income Canadians. 
Approximately 50% of families with over $80,000 of income have 
mortgages in Canada today.  Compare this with only 10% of 
families with incomes under $30,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The great majority of benefits under the proposal would 
naturally accrue to higher income earners who are more likely to 
have larger mortgages.  The result would be an increased taxation 
of all Canadians to pay for the accommodation of the more 
fortunate.  I do not find this prospect a pleasing one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also feel this proposal would be sending out the wrong message 
by providing an incentive to enter into debt and maintain 
indebtedness.  A rational homeowner benefiting from a tax 
deduction for mortgage interest would see little need to pay down 
the outstanding principal.  By encouraging Canadians to carry 
larger mortgages for longer periods of time, we would be 
discouraging saving and financial independence.  Surely, this is 
not the lesson we wish to pass on to young members of our 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we come to the issue of cost.  The Department of 
Finance estimates that the federal revenue loss associated with 
this proposal could reach $150 million in the year of 
introduction. Moreover, the cost would escalate in future years 
as more and more home buyers enter the market.  Under a mature 
system the cost to the federal government could exceed $3 billion 
annually.  If deductibility were extended to all homeowners, the 
cost would reach $6 billion annually.  The provinces would also 
experience a substantial reduction in revenues. This is a very 
hefty price tag by any standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wish to emphasize that the lower interest rates resulting 
from the government's deficit reduction strategy have 
significantly reduced the cost of home ownership.  One year 
mortgage rates today have declined by more than 400 basis points 
since January 1995, providing savings greater than $3,000 in 
terms of lower annual mortgage payments for a $100,000 mortgage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I am sure that those present here today would 
join me in improving the spirit of this proposal.  I would urge, 
however, that this spirit not sweep them along into supporting a 
measure that is not affordable, necessary or fair.

to clarify the issue and allow interested groups to be heard.  This 
is why we decided to task a joint Senate and House of Commons

</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee thus held public consultations during which about

adopt the resolution to amend section 93 of the Constitution Act,

in the Senate on October 9. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I go any further, I would like to congratulate the 
committee members on the exemplary work they have done.  Because of 
their efforts, it has been possible for many citizens and groups 
who so wished to express their points of view.  It has also been 
possible for parliamentarians to examine this highly complex issue 
from all angles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the House to follow the committee's recommendation and 
support the resolution to amend the constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since parliamentarians have had an opportunity to consult the 
committee's report, I will merely go over the main points, with 
particular emphasis on the concerns identified by committee members 
and possible responses to those concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there is the issue of the amending formula.  In its 
report, the committee began by looking at the applicable amendment 
procedure.  Backed by legal advice, the Government of Canada held 
that section 93 could be amended bilaterally, in accordance with 
section 43 of the Constitution Act, 1982. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the experts on constitutional law that the committee heard 
confirmed the government's position. As stated in the committee report, 
“these experts maintained that the amendment requested affects only the 
province of Quebec, and they therefore concluded that the procedure 
involved could only be bilateral and required only a resolution by the 
Quebec National Assembly, the province concerned, and a resolution by 
the two Houses of the Canadian Parliament”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The work of the committee will therefore have been useful in 
dispelling any doubts that some people may have had on the appropriate 
amending procedure. But what about the purpose of the resolution itself? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some witnesses wondered whether it was appropriate to do away at 
this time with the safeguards provided under section 93. 
Some people disagreed with the amendment on purely religious grounds. 
They claimed that the right to receive Catholic or Protestant religious 
education for those who want it should be maintained, without however 
imposing such education on those who do not want it. Others argued that 
the creation of linguistic school boards did not require the amendment 
of section 93. Based on Supreme Court decisions, they claimed that 
linguistic and denominational school boards could coexist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although that last statement is basically true, the committee 
concluded it was not very realistic to keep a system of denominational 
school boards together with a system of linguistic school boards. 
In fact, over the last 15 years, successive governments in Quebec have 
considered such an approach, and legislation to that effect was even 
adopted in 1988. All these governments ultimately backed down because of 
the tremendous difficulties that the implementation of such legislation 
would have created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, this would have created six school systems in Montreal and 
Quebec City, and greatly increased the number of religious schools, 
resulting in the scattering of resources. This is why the 
representatives of the Quebec federation of school boards stated, and I 
quote, “By stacking the linguistic and denominational structures, it 
would become much more complicated and burdensome to carry out yearly 
activities related to student enrolment, assignment of personnel, 
distribution of resources, establishing voting lists and sharing the tax 
base”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said however, we must admit that the non-application to 
Quebec of subsections (1) to (4) of section 93 will result in the 
withdrawal of constitutional safeguards presently provided to Catholics 
and Protestants in that province. There are however a number of 
considerations that soften the impact of this change.

<The committee's work first allowed a number of experts to explain 
the extent to which the scope of the protections under section 93 
had been reduced by successive judgments of the Supreme Court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears that, for all intents and purposes, the right of 
dissent is limited to the right to determine the religious 
dimensions of the curriculum.  Moreover, it is solely in the 
territory of the cities of Montreal and Quebec City that section 
93 guarantees Catholics and Protestants the right to school 
boards. In short, the rights and privileges enjoyed by Catholics 
and Protestants now are as much as, if not more, from legislation 
than from the constitution. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this connection, it must not be lost sight of either that 
the objective of the Government of Quebec is not to make the Quebec 
school system a lay system, but rather to make school structures 
non-denominational.  As Quebec's Minister of Education, Mrs. 
Marois, explained in her testimony before the joint committee, the 
constitutional amendment will have no immediate repercussions 
whatsoever on the place of religion in the schools.  That issue 
will be addressed in a separate public debate. 
In the immediate future, therefore, the schools will retain their 
denominational orientation, and parents or children can continue to 
request religious or moral education in keeping with their 
convictions in the public educational facilities, as guaranteed in 
section 41 of the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These considerations have certainly not convinced francophone 
protestants.  A number of members of that community came to the 
committee to state that protections of a legislative nature can 
never replace constitutional guarantees.  They indicated as well 
that, not only can the lawmakers modify the clauses currently 
authorizing religious teaching in the schools, they could also be 
forced to do so if the courts were to reach the conclusion that 
such teaching contravenes the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the 
charters as soon as section 93 ceases to be in effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without wishing to minimize the importance of this problem, we 
must place in its proper perspective. 
First of all, a court would have to reach the conclusion that the 
solutions opted for by Quebec lawmakers in this connection infringe 
upon religious freedom and equality rights, and would also have to 
conclude that these restrictions are not reasonable within a free 
and democratic society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In such a case, the supreme court could indicate the type of 
arrangement that was likely to meet the requirements of the 
Canadian and Quebec charters.  Quebec lawmakers might also want to 
consider various legislative arrangements in place in other 
provinces to deal with this thorny issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A hypothetical consideration arises. The highest court has 
often indicated that it did not intend to take the place of the 
lawmakers in arbitrating between the interests of the various 
groups in the community.  There are, therefore, grounds to believe 
that elected representatives retain a certain degree of flexibility 
in adjudicating between various individuals' rights.> 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a last resort, the Government of Quebec could invoke the 
notwithstanding clause. I was obviously very pleased to hear my 
counterpart, the Quebec minister of Canadian intergovernmental 
affairs, Jacques Brassard, say that “the notwithstanding clause 
would be invoked only as a last resort and with great care and 
diplomacy”.  He is perfectly right.  It is a band-aid solution and 
should be used only exceptionally. The joint committee shares our 
opinion on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fears expressed by the French speaking Protestants are 
understandable, but the rights and privileges in section 93 apply 
to all Protestants and not just to those who speak French. 
Attention must not be paid to a minority within a minority to a 
point where the growth of society as a whole is paralyzed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other groups told the committee that the guarantees accorded 
under section 93 to Catholics and Protestants are at odds with 
Quebec's modern pluralistic society.  Representatives of the Jewish 
and Arab communities in particular have pointed out that this 
section contains a form of discrimination.  This point too warrants 
consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By passing the amendment proposed by Quebec's National 
Assembly, Parliament will permit an open and full debate on the 
whole question, which is what the Quebec minister of education 
promised, in fact, when she appeared before the committee.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In quite another vein, members of Quebec's anglophone community 
appeared before the committee to call for section 23 to be 
applied in its entirety so that individuals, whose first language 
learned and still understood is English but who did not receive 
their primary education in English in Canada, can send their 
children to English schools.  That was fair enough but the 
committee concluded that was another debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that connection I reiterate that Quebec's anglophone 
minority, which has traditionally controlled and managed its own 
school system, thanks to protections granted to Protestants under 
section 93, can support amending that provision in all 
confidence.  That is because its rights have been better 
protected since the coming into force of the Constitution Act, 
1982, specifically section 23 of the Canadian charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike section 93, section 23 of the Canadian charter has the 
specific objective of providing francophone and anglophone 
minorities with linguistic guarantees with respect to education. 
It has been interpreted progressively and generously by the 
courts.  In effect, section 23 guarantees official language 
minorities the right to manage and control their own schools and 
even their own school boards.  A number of groups and experts 
confirmed that during their testimony to the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that respect the establishment of linguistic school board 
will enable the anglophone community to consolidate its school 
population of and gain the maximum benefit from the guarantees 
under section 23. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must also mention the concerns of the Native peoples living 
in Quebec.  Two aboriginal groups representing the Metis and 
Indians living off the reserve have expressed concern over the 
possible effects of the proposed constitutional amendment.  They 
claim that their rights could be affected to the extent that this 
section protects the pre-Confederation laws governing instruction 
for Native peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is sensitive to their claims and it 
is certainly a legitimate concern for Native peoples to want to 
ensure the development of their culture through education. 
However, we must recognize that this was not the intent given 
section 93.  On a number of occasions, the courts have determined 
that section 93 provides constitutional guarantees based solely on 
religious belief.  There is no provision for language or race. 
Section 93 offers no special guarantee to Native peoples, except if 
they are Protestant or Catholic.  The committee shares our opinion 
in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consensus. When I first raised the possibility of amending section 
93 with Quebec intergovernmental affairs minister Jacques Brassard, I 
clearly indicated that the Government of Canada would support an 
amendment proposal if a reasonable consensus existed in Quebec and if 
the affected minority agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This consensus was expressed in two unanimous votes in the National 
Assembly. Indeed, the Government of Quebec and official opposition 
members testified to this consensus during the joint committee hearings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless, the fact that no public consultations dealing 
specifically with the constitutional amendment took place in Quebec 
raised doubts as to this consensus. That is why the government insisted 
that interested groups and individuals be heard. In fact, the joint 
committee said this was one of its primary concerns. 
These groups and individuals came in large numbers and were given the 
opportunity to express their views. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee noted that the Assembly of Quebec Bishops is not 
opposed to the amendment.  The Quebec Federation of School Boards 
which represents all Catholic school boards in the province also 
supports the amendment.  The same is true for the Provincial 
Association of Catholic Teachers and the Centrale de 
l'enseignement du Québec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the whole there is every indication that the vast majority of 
Catholics are open to the proposed change.  That support is not 
unanimous, as evidenced by the opposition of the Coalition of 
Denominational Schools. 
However, it could not be expected that the challenging of the 
rights and privileges entrenched in the constitution for 130 
years would be supported by all.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless the government and the committee believe that a 
broad consensus exists among Catholics who are not in any case a 
minority in Quebec and will still be able to express their 
opinion through democratic means. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A substantial consensus seems to exist among Protestants too. Since 
this will be the most directly affected group, it is important to ensure 
that a majority of the members of this group support the amendment's 
objective. The Anglican Church came out in favour of the amendment, as 
did the Provincial Association of Protestant Teachers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Protestants are not speaking with a single voice. Objections raised 
by French speaking Protestants must be noted. 
Testimonies heard by the committee do show however that a reasonable 
consensus in favour of the amendment exists in this community and that 
is what the committee concluded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many other groups testified before the committee. The vast majority 
of these groups supported the constitutional amendment proposal. To name 
a few: the Fédération des comités de parents, which is the largest 
parents' group in the province, the Coalition pour la 
déconfessionnalisation scolaire, which is comprised of 40 organizations 
and claims to represent more than 2 million people, every central labour 
body in Quebec and representatives from the Jewish and Arab communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, based on the foregoing, there is no doubt that the 
consensus required to amend section 93 of the Constitution does exist. 
And that is what the joint committee concluded in its report following 
these consultations. 
It reads: “Based upon the evidence received by this committee, there 
appears to be a consensus amongst Quebec Protestants and amongst Quebec 
Roman Catholics in favour of the amendment. Overall, it appears that, 
although some witnesses expressed their concerns with respect to the 
proposed amendment, there is a consensus in Quebec society supporting 
this change”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is now up to us to act on the joint committee's recommendation 
and adopt the resolution to amend section 93 of the Constitution Act, 
1867, as proposed in the House of Commons on October 1, 1997.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will not be using my entire allotted time because I 
feel that the issue has been given a fair amount of attention and 
that many of the key issues have been explored in depth.  I would 
suggest that all members of the House read the majority and 
minority reports put forward by the joint committee addressing 
the issue.  In these reports my colleagues will find arguments 
both for and against the proposed amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the proposed amendment to section 93 created and 
passed unanimously by the Quebec National Assembly.  I will 
ultimately be voting in favour of the amendment as recommended by 
the Special Joint Committee on Quebec Schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform caucus believes in free votes when it comes to 
matters that involve certain moral considerations.  While I 
believe the issue is primarily a legal one, I appreciate the 
opportunity to be able to respectfully disagree with some of my 
colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I have not polled my constituents directly on the issue, 
it is my belief that our party's commitment to returning 
education to the exclusive domain of the provinces would move all 
of them to support the amendment as well.  Furthermore the 
amendment affects only the province of Quebec in any direct and 
meaningful way, which is why I believe the constituents of 
Edmonton—Strathcona have shown little interest in the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message I have heard is that what Quebec does with its 
schools should be its own business, provided fundamental rights 
are not violated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Putting aside the issue of provincial jurisdiction before making 
my decision on the matter, I asked myself three questions which I 
believe are fundamental to the proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first question I asked was of a legal nature.  Is section 43 
the right way to approach the amendment, or should the general 
amending formula be used in the matter? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second question I asked was political.  Is there some 
evidence that the elimination of section 93 as it applies to 
Quebec has broad based support? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also asked a related question.  Is there support for the 
establishment of linguistic school boards in Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final question I asked was a moral one.  Does section 93 
protect religious freedoms, and would these freedoms suffer in 
Quebec with the passing of the proposed amendment?

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address the use of the section 43 amending 
formula.  There is some concern it is inappropriate when applied 
to the proposed amendment to section 93.  Instead it is argued 
that a general amending formula, or the 7 and 50 formula, should 
be used to facilitate the changes to denominational schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not only argued that this would be more appropriate, but 
also that it is the only legal approach to the proposed 
constitutional change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ideally the question should have been put to the supreme court 
as was called for by the Leader of the Official Opposition. 
However it did not happen and we must now deal with the question 
in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the perspective of a constitutional layman it would seem 
that section 43 is appropriate in this matter.  The section 43 
amending formula is used for constitutional amendments that apply 
only to a single province.  In this case the single province is 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The counter argument has been made that the elimination of 
section 93 will lead to the elimination of denominational schools 
across Canada because section 2 of the Canadian Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms will prevent public funding for these schools. 
Because of this, it is argued that the general amending formula 
involving all provinces should be used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the amendment to section 93 is not the removal of 
section 93 from the Constitution.  It is an amendment that 
affects only Quebec in any direct and meaningful way.  It may 
admittedly create a precedent for other provinces, but whether or 
not the other provinces choose to act on this precedent is 
entirely their choice.  Therefore the specific proposed amendment 
cannot be said to affect religious educational freedom in the 
rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this reason I believe that section 43 is applicable in this 
case. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the matter of consensus, Quebec seems strongly in favour of 
setting up linguistic school boards.  Even if it seems less likely 
that it supports the proposed amendment to section 93, such support 
probably exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased consultations were held in Quebec on establishing 
linguistic school boards.  I was disappointed, however, that they 
were not held specifically on the proposal to eliminate section 93 
as it applies to Quebec. 
My question to my colleagues is as follows, however: Since it is 
clear that most Quebeckers are in favour of establishing linguistic 
school boards, why are they so concerned about how the end they 
also want is achieved?  In other words, I do not think it really 
matters to most Quebeckers just how the linguistic school boards 
are set up, as long as they are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To get back to the matter of consensus, many groups stated 
that section 93 protects minority rights.  They said, on the one 
hand, that most Quebeckers object to the proposed amendment and, on 
the other, that the amendment is an example of a majority 
oppressing a minority.  We could say that minority rights are an 
issue here, but this argument cannot be used in conjunction with 
the argument that there is no consensus on the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put the matter of consensus to rest, I would point out that 
the unanimous consent the National Assembly accorded the proposed 
resolution indicates that there is vast support for it.  It is 
unlikely that all politicians from all parties would ignore public 
opinion.  Every time parties agree on an issue, I think it is 
because the issue raises little controversy.  That may not always 
be true, but I think it is in the present case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us move on to another point.  If the proposed amendment is 
passed, I fear Quebec and the rest of Canada will lose the right to 
freedom of religion. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1230"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT18"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT18"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1230

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is really the crux of the matter. If freedom of religion were 
infringed on, a consensus among Quebeckers would not be justified at 
all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having heard the testimony received by the committee, I believe 
that section 93 is not essential to protect freedom of religion. In 
fact, it could run counter to this objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a pluralistic society like ours, should the government collect 
money from Muslims, for instance, in support of Catholic religious 
teaching? I think not. Under section 93, however, the government could 
continue to support Christian religious teaching at the expense of other 
faiths. 
Is that how we want to promote freedom of religion in our schools? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party is often cautioned against using hypothetical cases to 
make a point. I will make an exception today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us say that section 93 is designed to protect the freedom of 
speech instead of denominational education. If section 93 protected 
freedom of speech, but this right was granted only to Protestants and 
Catholics, one could argue that it recognizes a privilege, not a right, 
enjoyed only by these two groups. Rights must be universal, otherwise 
they cannot be considered as rights. Therefore, the exclusive right 
conferred by section 93 is prejudicial in that it actually impinges on 
the right to religious teaching. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, sections 21 and 36 of Bill 109 in Quebec provide for 
religious teaching where numbers warrant. 
It appears to be necessary to carry out reforms to ensure that the wish 
to receive religious teaching is duly recognized and taken into account. 
However, this seems to be another administrative problem that could 
easily be resolved at the public's request. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A provincial campaign to promote the right to choose among schools 
whose funding is prorated, or chartered schools, is the only way to help 
ensure that religious teaching remains an option and this can only be 
achieved by repealing section 93. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, I think that matters relating to education should be 
exclusively under provincial jurisdiction. I think that the amending 
formula used to expedite the adoption of this bill is a lawful one. I 
believe there is in Quebec a political will to establish linguistic 
school boards. And I know that religious freedom in Quebec will not be 
threatened if section 93 is repealed. 
I am therefore in favour of this amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly recommend that my colleagues, the hon. members of this 
House, respect the wish of the Quebec National Assembly and heed the 
advice of the joint committee. I urge them to vote for the proposed 
amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK15"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, first 
I want to thank the previous speaker and I hope his voice will be heard 
by his fellow party members, so as to create a movement which, 
hopefully, will reach the Reform Party's top level. Who knows, maybe the 
leader of the official opposition will surprise us by supporting the 
constitutional amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment was the subject of numerous debates. The issue 
before us is deeply rooted in Quebec—I believe the minister said it 
six times in his speech—since the Parent report was released. 
Indeed, since the mid-sixties, all Quebec governments, regardless of 
their political colours, have tried to modernize the province's 
education system, and this is what we are talking about.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am grateful to the minister for emphasizing—as he did 
throughout his speech—that the issue does not concern linguistic 
rights. Those interested in linguistic rights should read chapter 8 of 
Bill 101, which contains the information relating to the language of 
access for the majority and the minority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that a majority of Quebeckers feel that school boards 
should be structured along linguistic rather than religious lines. We 
could not overemphasize the fact that, unfortunately, some people tried 
to muddle the real issue, for example by comparing the situation of 
francophones outside Quebec with that of anglophones in Quebec. I 
believe that all committee members clearly realized that, as 
parliamentarians, our duty was to understand the objective sought by the 
National Assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is somewhat of a precedent since the National Assembly, which 
is the only authority that can speak on behalf of Quebeckers, was 
unanimous on this issue. And all of us here should understand the 
meaning of the term “unanimous”. 
It means that when Pauline Marois, the member for Taillon, rose in 
the National Assembly to vote in favour of the motion, so did the 
member for Marquette.  When parliamentarians vote this unanimously, 
you can be sure we are on solid ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were, it will be recalled, consultations in Quebec City, 
because the very purpose of the parliamentary committee on Bill 
109, which was also unanimously approved, was to look at the 
establishment of linguistic school boards.  If we were to go a step 
further, and compare all the witnesses who were heard in the Quebec 
National Assembly with those who appeared before the joint 
parliamentary committee, it would be seen that there were, to all 
intents and purposes, no witnesses who were not heard either in 
Quebec City or here in Ottawa. 
So those people who thought there had been no consultation must 
think again and acknowledge that there was extensive consultation 
in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, it is clear that there are two aspects to the 
motion now before us.  First, the preamble to section 93 says that 
education comes under provincial jurisdiction.  Everyone, of 
course, understands that Quebec does not want this preamble revoked 
since, as far back as 1953, the Tremblay Commission pointed out in 
no uncertain terms how essential it is for Quebec to have full and 
complete jurisdiction over the education sector, education being 
obviously linked, as we know, to identity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, paragraphs (1) to (4), which are based in history, 
will no longer apply to the territory of Quebec. 
What this therefore means is that Quebec will simply no longer have 
a constitutional obligation, particularly with respect to the 
cities of Montreal and Quebec, to maintain denominational 
structures based on numbers—I would remind members that, when we 
have denominational structures in Montreal and Quebec City, there 
is no numerical criterion, and the right to disagree exists outside 
these cities—if we as parliamentarians approve the resolution 
before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we think this is important? 
Why did a man like Claude Ryan, when he was Minister of Education and 
the MNA for Argenteuil, finally try to modernize the Quebec school 
system? Claude Ryan is a respected intellectual in Quebec society. Of 
course, he is no sovereignist, everyone knows that and I must say that, 
personally, I do not have much hope in that regard. Everyone knows that 
Claude Ryan is a respected and respectable individual. He even submitted 
the issue to the Supreme Court. He was constantly faced with this 
challenge, with the overbearing presence of section 93, especially 
subsections (1) to (4).

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this means is that when we vote today, and I think it is 
important to make this clear, it will be so that school boards can be 
organized along linguistic lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I insisted strongly in the joint committee on what this means for 
Montreal. We all know that Montreal is in a very particular situation. 
Montreal is where immigrants go; 80% of the immigrants that come to 
Quebec settle in Montreal. Every year Montreal welcomes close to 35,000 
immigrants, or 15% of Canada's total immigration. Close to 225,000 
immigrants come to Canada each year. Quebec has traditionally been open 
to immigrants, a tradition that is based of course on a low birth rate, 
but there is also a fundamental belief—and this is what the Bloc has 
been saying since it arrived in this House—that immigration is a force 
that contributes to the renewal of a society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About 80% of immigrants settle in Montreal. For both historical and 
contemporary reasons, the majority of these immigrants enrol their 
children in English and Protestant schools. What is good about the 
amendment on which we will be voting is that French schools will truly 
become public schools, especially in Montreal. This is an objective that 
must be clearly understood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again this will change nothing as far as admission requirements 
for the anglophone minority are concerned. Bill 101 provide for 
some very clear rules on which we did not always agree. In the 
early 1980s, the Supreme Court of Canada issued a ruling 
requiring the Quebec legislator—and I am sure the Minister for 
Intergovernmental Affairs will remember this—to replace the 
Quebec clause with the Canada clause. 
Recognizing this legal obligation, the Quebec legislator agreed to amend 
Bill 101, even though the National Assembly was not enthusiastic about 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So today it is the Canada clause that applies in Quebec. This means 
that children whose parents received their primary education in English 
in Canada can enrol their children in English schools in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important to understand why this amendment we will be 
adopting, I hope, will help not only to modernize Quebec schools but 
also to strike a better balance in the greater Montreal area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the arguments that was repeated again and again in our 
debate, but to which no one could reply adequately, concerned the 
principle under which the legislator could guarantee constitutional 
rights to two religious denominations. Why should Catholics and 
Protestants, in 1997-98 and in the year 2000, benefit from a form of 
favouritism? Both the Canadian and the Quebec charter mention the 
freedom to worship. In a law-abiding society with charters that are 
constitutional or quasi-constitutional obligations requiring Quebec to 
guarantee certain rights, one must ask under what principle Catholics 
and Protestants should be treated with favouritism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, some witnesses reminded us that there were close to 
80,000 Muslims in Montreal, and that they are required to enrol their 
children in a Catholic or a Protestant school, which is contrary to 
their religious beliefs and I think this is wrong.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must, of course, also be kept in mind—and it is important 
that this point be made perfectly clear—that what we are talking 
about is taking religion out of administrative structures, out of 
the school boards.  It is a good thing to debate the place of 
religion in the schools and I have some very definite ideas on the 
subject, but this Parliament is not the one to deal with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Education, Mrs. Marois, a most extraordinary 
woman, has mandated a task force headed by Professor Proulx to 
report to the National Assembly on the place of religion in Quebec 
in the year 2000.  When that report is tabled there will be public 
hearings, the holding of which is a tradition in Quebec, and the 
stakeholders will have an opportunity to be heard. 
At that time, there will be a debate within Quebec society on the 
place people want religion to have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are speaking of is the end of denominational school 
boards.  We are very optimistic on all sides that the amendment on 
which we will be voting in a couple of hours will be passed with a 
strong majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next stage will be that, next year, parents such as those 
with children in Sainte-Jeanne-d'Arc school in 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, will be given the opportunity at the 
beginning of the school year to choose between religion and 
ethics, and that will remain unchanged.  Where the place of 
religion in the schools is concerned, parents will fully retain 
their right to demand a Catholic education for their children. 
This is a right which is, as we know, also given in section 41 of 
the Quebec Charter of Rights, which has quasi-constitutional 
value. In due course, the issue will be debated in the National 
Assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also received all possible representations by eminent 
constitutional experts.  As you know, constitutionalists have done 
roaring business of late in Canada.  They came to us with the 
opinion that the vehicle was appropriate, for there had been some 
doubt on this.  I know that the official opposition had been 
assailed by doubts at a certain point, but no constitutional expert 
could be found to state that section 43 was not the right vehicle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the 1982 Constitution is complex, hair-splitting 
even, concerning amendment formulas, since there are five 
possibilities.  We have gone from one extreme to the other, because 
there was no amending formula for over 100 years.  Canada was one 
of the few countries that had a written Constitution but no 
amending formula. 
And now we have a complex and convoluted amending formula offering 
five options, but, in this case, I think we are making no mistake. 
We made no mistake as members of Parliament or as members of the 
committee in stating that, following the representations made 
before us, the amending formula was the right one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to stress the fact that a debate was held in 
Quebec society and that there is a coalition representing some two 
million people.  That is not insignificant in a democracy.  There 
are not too many issues in which a group may come before a 
committee and say “I am speaking on behalf of 43 organizations”, 
including school administrations, unions, the CEQ and parents' 
committees.  All of them share the same vision for things and want 
us to pass the amendment before us. 
These people are speaking for their individual organizations, and 
together represent two million people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is something pretty important and should move all those 
members who doubt a debate was held and think that the amendment 
has garnered little support in Quebec society.  I hope they will be 
convinced, because there is obviously a lot of public reaction on 
this issue in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing that must be taken into consideration is the 
anglophone community.  It represents first of all Quebec's national 
minority and that will be the case in a sovereign Quebec.  I am 
among those in my party who think that the constitution of Quebec 
must make more provision for the rights of the anglophone community 
than was made in 1995.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister was very eloquent and I was really pleased when he 
made the following statement before the parliamentary committee. Of 
course, political reality will prevail, but the minister was right when 
he said very eloquently that, from kindergarten to university, the 
speaking community has access to an integrated school system and 
control over its structures and institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It comes as no surprise—and it must be pointed out—that, 
generally speaking, the English speaking community strongly supports the 
amendment, for two reasons. First, because it provides increased access 
for that community and, from a management perspective, it means more 
control than the English speaking community currently has. 
This is very important. Moreover, it will put an end to the rivalry 
between the anglophones enrolled in Protestant schools and those 
enrolled in Catholic schools. It will allow them to consolidate their 
network and, of course, the teaching resources involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did Mrs. Chambers tell us? In case you do not know her, Mrs. 
Chambers is the sister of philosopher Charles Taylor. In 1992, the 
Quebec government approached Mrs. Chambers and asked her to head a 
working group on access to the school system for anglophones. Something 
stands out very clearly when you read the Chambers report. 
The report says that Quebec's school system is not integrated, that 
there are a number of English language schools, but that the coherence 
the amendment will provide if it is passed is lacking at present. The 
Chambers report also asks for the so-called universal clause, but this 
is a different issue which is outside the scope of this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, there was a debate on this issue, which has deep roots in 
Quebec. Senator Thérèse Lavoie-Roux, a woman who speaks her mind, as 
members of the parliamentary committee noted—some parliamentarians, 
though not I, even compared her to Tatie Danielle—told us that the 
issue of linguistic school boards had already been raised in the early 
sixties. She reminded us about the Pagé report and the unified school 
boards, which are related to the issue before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there are people in this House, particularly Reformers or 
members who were not here during the last Parliament, who think the 
issue was not debated in Quebec, they are mistaken, in my opinion. The 
amendment was adopted unanimously, which is somethingquite rare in 
politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to act quickly, since the measure will have a concrete 
impact on the Quebec school system. While there were 158 school boards 
before, there will now only be 75, which means that these school boards' 
boundaries will have to be redefined. The change also involves a 
different registration process and the redistribution of buildings 
between school boards. Therefore, it is important to act as quickly as 
possible, so that by July of next year the registration process and 
organizational restructuring can have been completed 
and that by next September linguistic school boards can be in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank all members of the House, beginning with the minister, for 
their real co-operation. I do hope the same spirit of co-operation will 
prevail when dealing with other issues.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the amendment to section 93 of the Constitution 
Act, 1867. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is particularly important because it proposes a 
constitutional amendment.  We must always proceed with great 
caution when amending provisions of our Constitution, for the 
impact will be felt for generations to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the pleasure of sitting on the committee responsible for 
studying the constitutional amendment.  It was my first experience 
on a parliamentary committee and I must say how much I appreciated 
the cordial atmosphere that characterized the committee's 
proceedings. As a rookie in the House of Commons, I found it an 
excellent opportunity to learn from senators and members with many 
years' experience. 
The committee's work was truly motivated by a desire to arrive at 
a solution that would best serve the interests of Quebeckers and of 
Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank my colleagues, who spent much time and 
effort during these three weeks in order to ensure that the groups 
affected by this amendment could be heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the three weeks the committee sat, we had a chance to 
meet with a broad range of groups both in support of and opposed to 
the proposed constitutional amendment.  There was not complete 
consensus, as the Quebec government had led us to believe. 
A number of religious communities and linguistic groups are opposed 
to the amendment to section 93 because they are afraid that the 
rights they have acquired will disappear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The special joint committee on the Quebec school system 
therefore had an important job:  to consult the people of Quebec 
and of Canada in order to ensure that all points of view were 
expressed and heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before looking at all those in favour of the constitutional 
amendment, I would first of all like to speak about those groups 
that are opposed.  Numerous religious and linguistic groups 
travelled to Ottawa in order to make their concerns known. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The groups opposed to the amendment to section 93 expressed 
serious concerns about the status of minority rights in our 
Canadian society if the amendment is passed. 
If these rights to education can be constantly revisited with very 
little public consultation, other minority rights are also vulnerable. 
They argue that there is a great danger that minority rights will be 
withdrawn based simply on the will of the majority. This is why it is 
important to hold public hearings where all sides of the issue can be 
heard. The Government of Quebec refused to hold public hearings on this 
issue and the minority concerned hardly had the opportunity to make its 
views known. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minorities in question are the Protestants. In Quebec, there 
are the Protestants and the Catholics. In Quebec, Protestants were the 
minority. Those groups I heard in committee were minorities of 
minorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As legislators, we often forget that we represent the people. 
We should never be afraid to consult the people. They put us here and 
they can take us out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that the Government of Quebec had a strict timetable to 
follow, but it has no excuse for not setting up public hearings where 
people could have expressed their views, especially when the issue is 
the amendment of our Constitution. Lack of consultation is harmful not 
only to those groups who cannot have a voice, but also to the health of 
democracy in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By consultation, I mean consultations through public meetings prior 
to the implementation of such changes or requests for change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite these difficulties, it is important to note that minority 
rights in Canada are not being compromised. Amending section 93 of the 
Constitution is a specific issue that affects Quebec only. 
It has no impact on the rights of other minority communities in Quebec 
or elsewhere in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Groups opposed to the amendment also told us of their concern about 
losing their denominational schools. It should be noted that the purpose 
of amending section 93 is the abolition of denominational school boards 
in the cities of Quebec and Montreal. The proposed changes do not 
prohibit Catholic or Protestant schools. Rather they affect how schools 
are managed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned that acquired rights are being withdrawn to please 
the majority. In my riding of Acadie—Bathurst, people fought long and 
hard to ensure that francophone schools in the communities of 
Saint-Sauveur, Saint-Simon et Sainte-Rose remain open. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that people took to the streets in protest when 
the government attempted to close the schools. 
This is why I say that I am very concerned whenever changes are proposed 
to the Constitution. 
We must keep in mind that the RCMP used dogs, tear gas and nightsticks 
against children and parents. This is why I feel so strongly about 
constitutional changes affecting schools.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our children's education is a very sensitive issue. When new 
strategies on the management of our school systems are put forward, we 
should make sure that all aspects have been examined, hence the 
importance of consulting the public through public hearings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the present situation in Quebec is one of the very 
few exceptions allowing us to question the privileges granted Protestant 
and Catholic communities. 
Let us not forget that section 93 protects only two denominational 
groups in two cities. This means that people in the Gaspé Peninsula, for 
example, enjoy no protection at all under section 93 as pertains to 
denominational education. Furthermore, all other denominational groups 
have no protection under section 93. The cultural context of 1867 may 
have justified the protection of only two denominational communities but 
the multicultural character of Quebec in 1997 could hardly justify 
protecting some communities and not the others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There may not be unanimity in Quebec about section 93 but there is 
nonetheless a large consensus. Even the denominational groups that are 
affected support the amendment of section 93 because an amended section 
would better reflect Quebec's cultural and linguistic reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Provincial Association of Catholic Teachers, which represents 
3,000 teachers from 25 school boards in Quebec, supports the 
constitutional amendment because, under the current system, the English 
community is divided between two school systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It argues that religious education and denominational schools are 
still possible if the parents request it. Amending section 93 and 
setting up linguistic school boards will meet the needs of both the 
and the French community. Most groups that came before us 
believed linguistic school boards were a must. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Protestants and Catholics who are affected are in favour of 
amending section 93, it would be irresponsible on our part to ignore 
such a consensus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of this fairly obvious consensus, our Reform friends would 
like a referendum. Do they not realize that a referendum cannot reflect 
the minority's interests? 
We are talking about minority rights here; the will of the majority is 
only part of what we have to consider. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be more concerned about supporting the amendment to section 
93 if all the political parties in Quebec were not in agreement. 
However, when the National Assembly debated this issue, it was passed 
not only by a majority vote, but unanimously: 103 to zero. We all know 
in this House how difficult it is to achieve unanimity on a particular 
issue. If the National Assembly succeeded in securing unanimous consent 
on such controversial issues as language and religion, it must be 
recognized that voters as a whole had to be in agreement too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had another concern during committee hearings. 
When we speak about denominational schools, we are speaking about the 
importance of communicating, through the school system, values that are 
fundamental to us.  However, we often forget that children are caught in 
difficult situations when religion is taught in schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a hard time admitting that Pierre will have to leave the 
classroom whenever the teacher speaks about Jesus because Pierre is a 
Jehovah's Witness.  We must think very carefully about what it means to 
teach religion in schools given our present cultural reality.  We must 
respect all the children attending our schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pondered carefully over what was said in committee.  I even spoke 
with several priests in my riding and they think that religious 
education should be the responsibility of parents and not that of the 
schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The school should definitely convey fundamental values, but the 
true transmission of values should be done by the family and the church.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most important roles we have as parents is to 
communicate to our children the beliefs and values that we consider as 
important. To abandon this responsibility by relying on school teachers 
to do this job will clearly harm our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment to section 93 shows how the federal government can 
serve Quebec's interests. This situation shows how our country can be 
flexible in certain circumstances to put forward policies that reflect 
the specific needs of a province. This co-operation between the 
provinces and the federal government is the foundation of the Canadian 
federation and, as a result, Canadians and Quebeckers come out of this 
as winners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though I support the proposed amendment, I still have concerns 
about the process that has led us to debate this issue. I have indicated 
earlier and I will repeat that the Quebec government should have 
consulted the people of Quebec through public hearings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The special joint committee, here in the federal Parliament, only 
had two weeks to hear witnesses. Because of the deadline that had been 
set, some groups had some difficulty coming to tell us about their 
concerns. Amending the Constitution should not be an exercise to be 
taken lightly and two weeks are not enough to go around such an issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite these problems, I put my trust in the people of Quebec. If 
there are concerns that have not been expressed through our committee, 
I hope the population of Quebec will be listened to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fundamentally, the New Democratic Party respects Quebec's autonomy 
to establish linguistic school boards. The amendment to section 93 will 
allow the Quebec school system to better respond to the needs of the 
population of Quebec. We now trust that the Quebec government will 
establish the new linguistic school boards with all due consideration of 
the electorate's concerns. 
<P><A NAME="LINK17"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to share my experience as a member of the special joint committee 
charged with examining the resolution to amend section 93 of the 
Constitution Act, 1867. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we have no choice but to pass the resolution as tabled in 
the House of Commons on October 1, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee heard over 60 groups and individuals and, in my 
opinion, the message was clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said in the House at the beginning of this debate, as a member 
of Parliament from the Eastern Townships, I have some experience of the 
issue before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Eastern Townships have been a lead region with regard to 
linguistic school boards in Quebec for more than 15 years and, I want to 
say it again, the experiment was a success. It is a good system that 
works well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has not always been the case, however. I remember, when I was 
young, the priests used to rule people's lives. When, as a young 
anglophone, I was going to school, I was not called an anglophone 
because it was understood that all anglophones were Protestants and all 
francophones were Catholics. I was simply called a Protestant. My French 
speaking friends were not allowed to enter a Protestant church, under 
penalty of eternal damnation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I used to go to the francophone church, the Catholic 
church, and I realized there were more similarities than differences 
between us. But the priests kept the anglophones and the francophones, 
the Protestants and the Catholics, apart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Catholic Church put religion into the hands of the schools, 
into the hands of the State. In my opinion, it has been a bad decision. 
Why? Because most of the teachers used to be brothers or nuns and 
Quebeckers were already beginning to move away from the Church, a big 
issue in terms of family values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately, things have progressed. Canadian history is a 
succession of negotiations and partnerships. These negotiations are 
still going on nowadays.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just like what made up the 18th century was taken into account when 
the Quebec Act was negotiated, what makes up the Canadian and the Quebec 
societies must be taken into consideration as Canada heads into the 21st 
century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the Quebec society is not made up only of French speaking 
Catholics and English speaking Protestants. The Quebec society is like 
the Canadian society, but with a little something extra. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bearing this reality in mind, the Quebec National Assembly 
overwhelmingly voted in favour of linguistic school boards. A lot was 
said about protecting the rights of English speaking Quebeckers. 
In fact, English will be better protected with linguistic school boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to come back to one of the most crucial issues I have 
addressed before, because it deals with what remains a major concern, 
which is the fact that the Quebec government is dedicating itself to the 
independence of Quebec. It is important that decisions made on this 
issue be based on reasonable grounds, and not made only to assuage the 
provincial government or because we feel threatened by this separatist 
government in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, we should not be making any decision only to frustrate the 
Government of Quebec. This is an important decision that will affect the 
children and their parents as much as schools and communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to have had the opportunity to sit on this 
committee and to learn a lot about the Constitution of my country. The 
House must vote in favour of amending section 93 to make all of this 
possible. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take some time now to address the dissenting opinion 
from the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When parliamentary debate began on this subject on October 1, I 
admitted quite candidly that I had much to learn about the 
constitutional nuances of my country. Today I can say that I 
learned quite a lot while I sat with the committee, both from my 
colleagues and about my colleagues on the opposition side and the 
government side and, of course, from the witnesses who appeared 
before the committee.  However, I will say again that I have much 
to learn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to say outright that the Reform Party has no feel 
for my country's history.  I do not relish telling the House that 
the Reform Party has no sense of what Canada is and how Canada 
came to be.  I have gone through the Reform Party's dissenting 
opinion and I feel that it is my obligation to the House and to 
my constituents to share my findings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the Reform Party writes “the proposed amendment will 
eliminate the right to denominational schools, a right that has 
been protected since 1867”.  I expect that Reform members will 
not know about how that great event in 1867 came to pass. 
Accommodation and recognition of the need for accommodation 
predates 1867.  In fact, the Quebec Act of 1774 provided 
accommodation between the partners of what we now call Canada. 
There has always been negotiation in Canada.  Indeed, that is 
what Canada is all about. Of course, I am no expert so I do not 
think it is my job to say that the Reform Party does not know 
what it is to be Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the Reform Party writes that changing the constitution 
should never be done lightly or in haste. This puzzles me.  Is 
this is the same party that when addressing the issue of changing 
the constitution to address Newfoundland schools in this House 
just over a year ago led the chorus of “dispense, dispense”? 
The Reform Party and, in all fairness, the government were in a 
rush to change the constitution then.   As an opposition party, 
the Reform Party did nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the Reform Party mentions the need for democratic consent 
to protect minority rights.  Does its version of democratic 
consent not mean majority rule?  Is it not the party of 
referenda? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Must I remind the Reform Party that there was democratic consent 
in the national assembly, and for this to pass there will be 
democratic consent in this House and in the other place. I was 
quite sure this must have slipped in there by mistake. Those 
things happen.  But then I started to think that maybe what the 
Reform was trying to say was assent of the minority.  This, of 
course, is not the same thing as its version of democratic 
consent at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, defending minority rights is not what the Reform Party 
is known for.  In fact, I do not think it is an exaggeration to 
say the Reform Party has a bad reputation with minority groups 
right across Canada. 
Of course, defending minority rights cannot be the message 
Reform wants to send out.  That leads me to number four.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform says that it would prefer a provincial referendum. Having 
just defended minority rights, this one is difficult to figure 
out.  In the same dissenting opinion it defends minority rights 
and then calls for a referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, I am no expert but does the majority not always win 
referendums?  Is this some sort of joke?  Of course, the leader of 
the Reform Party is not known for his rapier like wit but more 
his rapier like logic. 
I think his party has written an illogical dissenting opinion 
and I do not think it is very funny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To continue with number five, “It is incumbent on its 
proponents to show beyond a reasonable doubt that an informed 
majority of the people of Quebec approve the amendment”.  Until 
this point, the Reform Party's dissenting opinion was just a 
series of contradictions and a little sloppiness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sad to say that this is where the Reform Party becomes 
insulting.  Is the Reform Party suggesting that officials elected 
to the national assembly cannot represent informed opinion in 
Quebec?  If this is what the Reform Party is saying, I find it 
insulting and inappropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am no expert but I believe it is my job to represent the 
people of my riding in Quebec just as it is the Reform members' 
job to represent their constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents are informed.  They inform me.  I inform the 
House of their concerns.  During the last federal election, the 
Reform party insulted Quebeckers and politicians from Quebec.  Is 
that the pot it is trying to stir now? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number six, Reform says that those who oppose should be given a 
clear opportunity to express their view.  This is new for Reform. 
I am curious to know if the new Reform principle extends to 
aboriginal people, visible minorities and homosexuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new Reform principle allows minorities not only to express 
their point of view but to be heard in a proper forum.  Not being 
an expert but knowing the Reform Party as I do, I wonder if this 
too slipped in here by mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is meant to be there, I am happy to hear this and I will 
be watching to ensure the Reform Party upholds its new values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number seven, Reform says that the committee should not be 
expected to decide this matter in haste.  I am in complete 
agreement with that statement.  I am happy to see the Reform 
Party finally sees merit in considering important matters fully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if now it has changed its position on the necessity of 
the Senate of Canada and the sober second thought it brings to 
parliamentary matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other place has what is called a suspensive veto.  This 
provides for the opportunity for revisiting constitutional 
endeavours.  As long as there is a Senate there are no artificial 
deadlines.  Thank goodness for the Senate of Canada. I am 
thankful that the Reform Party sees eye to eye with me on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number eight, the Reform Party complains that there was not 
enough time to study this matter, that it was done lightly and in 
haste.  It suggests that a court decision would have settled the 
legal issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I am no expert but I do not want to unfairly criticize 
anybody.  It is becoming obvious that the Reform Party does not 
understand the role of Parliament.  Parliament makes law.  That 
is what it means to be a legislator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that the call for a court to decide on this issue 
is a complete abdication of governance and a complete abdication 
of leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number nine, in addition to number eight, Reform calls for the 
best legal advice available.  I am sorry to hear that the Reform 
Party leadership is not confident in its ability to obtain or 
produce good legal advice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our caucus we have good legal advice.  We have 
parliamentarians who meet their responsibilities head on.  I am 
personally grateful to Senator Gerald Beaudoin, a noted 
constitutional expert who has been most helpful on the committee, 
helping everyone better understand the issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party should have listened to him more closely. 
However, if the Reform Party is looking for the best legal advice 
available, I invite it to call on our House leader or even our 
party leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number 10, the Reform Party mentioned guarantees that were vital 
to the passage of the British North America Act.  Again, I do not 
want to point out Reform's complete misunderstanding of Canadian 
history, but as far as I know the passage of the BNA act took 
place at Westminster and quite frankly there were very few people 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps what the Reform Party means is that it was vital to the 
negotiation of the BNA act, but if that is what the Reform Party 
meant to say, then why did it not say that?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number eleven, I do not mean to tell the Reform Party what it 
surely already knows.  Although if the Reform Party was aware of 
this, I do not know how the following got in here.  Maybe just 
another error.  These things happen. Once again I quote 
“provincial statutes are clearly inferior to constitutional 
provisions protecting minority rights”.  It obviously should not 
be me informing the Reform Party of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Less than two weeks ago the Supreme Court of Canada listened to 
a case, Vriénd v Alberta.  In this case the province of Alberta, 
and if I am not mistaken the Reform Party draws much of its 
strength from there, stood before the Supreme Court of Canada to 
defend its refusal to extend protection against discrimination in 
its human rights legislation.  In short, the province of Alberta 
is arguing that its provincial statute is clearly superior to 
constitutional provisions protecting minority rights, prohibiting 
discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Either there is a blatant area in this dissenting opinion or the 
Reform Party is in direct opposition to the province of Alberta. 
In one two-page document the Reform Party insults Quebec and 
contradicts Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number twelve, the Reform Party says compelling reasons for 
amending the constitution have to be made and then adds no such 
case was made to committee.  Again, I am no expert but I do 
recognize when a two page document contracts itself over and 
over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier in the same document the Reform Party says “we do not 
question that an overwhelming consensus has been shown”.  I do 
not want to say that the Reform Party does not know what it is 
talking about, so I put the question forward. Which one is it, an 
overwhelming consensus has been shown or no such case was made? 
Surely the Reform Party understands that it cannot be both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not my place to say that Canadians are used to the Reform 
Party's contradicting itself, but in a two page document you 
would think that it could get it straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears its left hand—no, let me get this straight—its 
right hand has no idea of what the other right hand is doing. The 
committee heard from more than 60 organizations and individuals, 
anglophones, francophones, Protestants, Catholics, Jews and 
aboriginals.  There was a strong case made to amend section 93. I 
suppose the Reform Party was not watching.  Maybe it was not 
listening.  Maybe the translation was not working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am still learning in Ottawa.  It seems to me that Canada is 
not some box, all segmented, neat and tidy.  Canada is messy, 
Canada is confusing.  We are all here to better understand Canada 
and to make Canada better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to say the Reform Party does not understand 
Canada, but the Reform Party's dissenting opinion is 
contradictory, uninformed and without merit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope this helps the Reform Party reflect on its dissenting 
opinion.  I invite the Reform Party to reconsider its position 
and make the recommendations of the committee unanimous.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I was disappointed that the hon. member spent half the 
time of his speech on this important historic constitutional 
amendment making cheap, sarcastic, partisan remarks which were 
entirely out of place in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a time for that kind of thing in this House but this 
is not one of those times.  This hon. member stooped to pretty 
low levels in his comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of his first comments was that the Reform Party does not 
understand his Canada.  It is not just his country, it is mine as 
well.  It is our country.  I understand this history pretty darn 
well.  Before this debate started I read the Confederation 
debates from cover to cover.  I challenge the member or any one 
of his caucus to go up in a history test anytime with the hon. 
Leader of the Opposition who probably knows more about the 
history of this country in the compact of Confederation than 
virtually any member of this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sir Charles Tupper said in 1896 that without the guarantee of 
section 93 for the rights of minorities being embodied in the new 
constitution, we should have been unable to have obtained any 
confederation whatever.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the hon. member is seeking to remove from the constitution 
today in terms of its application to Quebec is the basic compact 
of Confederation in the words of the supreme court, in the words 
of Peter Hogg, our pre-eminent constitutional authority. Part of 
my objection to this amendment is predicated on our history, on 
our historical recognition of the rights of minorities and the 
confessional rights of parents to send their children to the 
educational institution of their choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talked about consensus.  He said that the 
members of the national assembly were acting responsibly and 
demonstrating democratic consent. What about the quarter of a 
million Quebeckers who signed a petition objecting to this 
amendment?  What about the coalition that represents 600,000 
Quebeckers that came before the committee objecting to this 
amendment?  What about half the witnesses, francophone witnesses, 
Catholic witnesses, Protestant witnesses, witnesses with many 
different backgrounds who are opposed to this amendment because 
it removes and extinguishes forever a basic constitutional right 
and a basic civil right, the right of parents to choose the 
education of their children?  What about those witnesses? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were not represented at the national assembly because it 
did not have hearings.  It would not know what they had to say 
about this.  There has been no debate about the confessionnalité 
implications of the removal of section 93. And this member preens 
on members of Parliament acting responsibly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sat as an associate on the committee and I recall this member 
hardly being at even half the hearings.  I do not recall him 
being at the clause by clause review where we wrote the majority 
report, where Reform made many positive and constructive 
amendments which found their way into the majority report.  I do 
not recall that member asking a single question of a witness 
before that committee, so I do not need to be lectured by that 
hon. member when it comes to the responsible exercise of our 
parliamentary responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will ask this member a question. With all partisan nonsense 
aside, does he not recognize that when we remove section 93, the 
full force of the charter will apply to the Quebec education 
system and that if we are to take the judicial precedents in 
Ontario as a guide we will see that the confessional education 
elements of the Quebec education act will be found 
unconstitutional?  Does he not recognize the almost unanimous 
legal opinions brought before the committee that the confessional 
elements of the Quebec school system will be threatened by the 
charter if section 93 is removed?  Forget the partisan stuff. 
Does he recognize that or not?  If he does recognize it, why is 
he prepared to undermine the confessionnalité of the Quebec 
schools that the vast majority of Quebeckers wants to maintain? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price:</B>  Madam Speaker, I will first answer a 
couple of quick questions to be clear.  I was there when the bill 
was drafted.  I think the member saw me there.  I do not 
understand— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  I never heard you, that's why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price:</B>  Do not forget I was last on the list. We 
had three senators there.  I was taking my information from them. 
The member does not really understand.  That is why I will go 
back to the basics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am looking for here is the best for our kids in Quebec. I 
am a Quebecker.  I go back seven generations in Quebec and I am 
looking for the best we can get for our kids.  Our school system 
right now in my area is linguistic.  It works well.  I know it is 
going to work.  It is giving the minorities a chance.  That is 
why the minorities were going there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did not see minorities coming out of areas like Montreal 
where they do not have it right now.  They do have it in our area 
and it works.  That is the bottom line as far as I am concerned. 
I want something that works that will be the best for the kids. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's stuff is in here.  I do not know why he is 
complaining about it.  He wrote it down.  This is dissenting 
opinion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK19"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I was not going to speak on this but I decided to when 
the hon. member got up.  This is very close to my work throughout 
my entire life.  He suggests we do not know anything about this 
problem we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to him that the word conservative in the histories of 
Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Alberta as it relates to the school 
system is a bad word.  It is a bad word.  So any time a 
Conservative stands up and tries to tell me that Reform does not 
know anything about this country I will tell him this. 
We know a whole lot about the country that he has forgotten or he 
never knew.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have in my possession petitions signed by constituents who 
know what their forefathers went through in the formation of the 
province of Saskatchewan.  There are some from Manitoba as well 
who say that we should take great care preserving that section. 
They do not want a repeat of history.  They do not want a repeat 
of Conservative governments in the provincial house in 
Saskatchewan ordering minorities to close their doors or to take 
out certain textbooks.  Alberta does not want it and certainly 
Manitoba does not want it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The three prairie provinces are satisfied with their school 
systems.  Even the slightest minorities are given an opportunity. 
I want to preserve that.  Saskatchewan in total wants to preserve 
it.  We do not want somebody messing around, providing a little 
break in the armour so that minorities could some day be 
challenged by another Conservative Party.  God forbid that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am saying clearly that I have looked at the matter and taken 
the advice of my people, the people whom I represent.  They are 
worried about the toe getting in the door once more.  The 
minority rights they have enjoyed for three generations could 
conceivably go out the window.  It is not just a one province 
debate.  It  covers all of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price:</B>  Madam Speaker, we are really talking 
about Quebec.  We are not talking about the other provinces. We 
are only speaking about section 93 and how it affects Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's party wrote the dissenting opinion.  It really does 
not make any sense.  We are protecting minority rights in Quebec. 
It is the only way we can do it.  We cannot do it with section 93 
in place.  We cannot do it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased 
to be able to speak to the resolution today.  I feel it 
represents a positive step for Canadians in many ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the joint committee that considered the 
resolution to amend section 93 of the Constitution I had the 
opportunity to listen first hand to the concerns of the Quebecois 
and Canadians.  I found this personal testimony on the realities 
of Quebec society at the end of the 20th century to be very 
instructive.  As a result of 30 years of discussion the amendment 
will reflect the pluralism of Quebec society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of my colleagues will be discussing the substantive and 
emotive elements of the proposed resolution.  I would like to 
speak on the procedural elements of the resolution as I feel they 
explain many of the questions surrounding the change. Finally I 
would like to add some personal reflections on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me begin my presentation with a discussion on the bilateral 
nature of the proposed amendment.  The Constitution Act, 1982, 
provides for amendments in section 43 “in relation to any 
provision that applies to one or more but not all provinces”. 
Procedurally such an amendment requires the resolution of three 
bodies:  the Senate, the House of Commons and the provincial 
legislative assembly requesting the amendment.  We are in the 
process of ensuring those basic procedural requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go beyond the basics of the procedural elements.  The 
joint committee heard that the political validity of the 
resolution of any of these three bodies depended on the evidence 
of consensus.  The Quebec legislative assembly passed its 
resolutions unanimously.  This may be evidence of some consensus, 
as the legislative assembly includes members of minority 
communities in Quebec. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1335"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT31"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT31"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1335

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I feel we must look further for evidence of consensus. 
Particularly when a legislature is considering changes to 
constitutional guarantees of rights, it is critical that the 
minority affected by the change be aware of the proposal. Further 
I believe it is critical that a majority of the minority affected 
be supportive of the proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of the amendment to section 93 of the Constitution 
Act I believe that a majority of the minority affected support 
the amendment.  This conclusion is based on evidence I heard 
during the committee hearings.  Anglophones, Catholics, 
Protestants and non-denominational groups were in support of the 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw the attention of the House particularly to the support of 
the Anglican bishops and the Canadian Jewish Congress for the 
amendment.  The Catholic bishops were not opposed.  The Right 
Reverend Andrew Hutchison, Bishop of Montreal for the Anglican 
Church of Canada, stated in his letter attached to the report 
tabled in the House: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our conviction is that the state must exemplify and uphold the 
principle of equality before the law in dealing with the major 
religious traditions that have long been part of our Quebec 
community. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore not only does the Anglican church support the 
resolution on the basis of religious education being a family 
matter, but it feels that all major religious traditions must be 
treated equally in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud the government decided to hold committee hearings and 
invite testimony about the resolution.  After having attended all 
the hearings I am personally satisfied there is a consensus on 
the amendment.  I am satisfied a majority of the minority 
affected by the change support it.  As a franco-Ontarian the 
support of the majority of the minority is what I expect from any 
province that intends to change its minority rights guarantees in 
any area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I move to the next section of my presentation I invite my 
Reform colleagues to consider the following.  The Right Reverend 
Andrew Hutchison of the Anglican church stated that its support 
of the amendment was based on its firm conviction that religious 
education of children was primarily a family responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the Reform stand on the importance of traditional families 
and family values, why is it not supporting the amendment?  The 
amendment is an opportunity to reinforce the role of the family 
in the moral and religious education of children. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to mention here the impact of this discussion on my 
own riding. Anybody familiar with Ontario history knows the 
Penetanguishene area has been troubled by school issues in the 1960s and 
1970s. To give you an idea of the situation in my own region, let me 
remind you we have seven schools in Penetanguishene. Just imagine. Seven 
schools for a population of 7,000. We have English and French public 
schools, English and French Catholic schools, and one English Protestant 
school and school board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am well aware of the divisions this plethora of school boards can 
create in a minority community. 
That is why I understand and support this initiative that will allow the 
minority community in Quebec to unite. I think this amendment will help 
minority communities in Quebec to consolidate and benefit from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members in several parties in the House are afraid that this will 
create a legal and political precedent for the abolition of the rights 
of official language and religious minorities. I would like to address 
this concern if I may. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that this will create a political precedent in amending 
official language and religious minority rights, but I think it will be 
a good precedent. Any other government—and I am thinking of Ontario 
premier Mike Harris who would like to somehow amend the rights of 
Franco-Ontarians and Catholics—would have to meet the same criteria. 
It will have to demonstrate that the proposed amendment is supported by 
a majority of the members of the minority affected.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, this support should be confirmed not only by a vote of 
the provincial legislature but also by witnesses before a Canadian 
parliamentary committee. This is another reason why I am proud of the 
decision by this government to conduct hearings. It created a precedent 
for any future government which could be less vigilant than this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, this constitutional amendment proves beyond any doubt that 
a people's needs and desires can be accommodated within the federal 
system. I am glad we can show Quebeckers how the Canadian Parliament has 
played a productive role in this amendment. 
After a 30-year-old debate in Quebec society, this amendment will soon 
be a reality. Can we learn from this in the debate on national unity? I 
hope so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After 30 years of debate on national unity we could perhaps solve 
the problem through a constitutional amendment or some other means. 
Federalists and Quebec separatists will perhaps finally opt for a 
unanimous vote on a resolution proposal. Perhaps the other provinces 
will see this amendment as the result of co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this could be a side effect of this amendment, we would have 
done a good job. For all these reasons, I urge my colleagues in this 
House to support this resolution. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK21"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I commend the hon. member for his remarks and diligent 
participation in committee.  He is undoubtedly sincere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a couple of questions for him.  He and his minister both 
mentioned a number of groups in favour of the amendment that 
appeared before the joint committee.  I notice, however, that 
neither he nor his minister mentioned the several groups against 
the amendment that appeared before the committee.  I am afraid 
this rather unbalanced presentation of the committee's hearings 
may mislead some members of the House with respect to the lack of 
consensus in committee.  Could he elucidate for his colleagues 
some of the groups against the amendment that appeared before the 
committee? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said there had been a 30 year debate about the question in 
Quebec society, an assertion repeated by several speakers this 
morning.  The hon. member knows that the debate over the past 
three decades in Quebec society has dealt with the establishment 
of linguistic school boards and not with the extinguishment of 
confessional school guarantees provided for in section 93. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He will know that this matter was not dealt with seriously in 
the report of the estates general a couple of years ago.  He will 
know that this is a relatively recent proposal, one which passed 
through the Quebec National Assembly without public hearings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will he admit that there has not in fact been 30 years of debate 
about the amendment to section 93 before us today but that the 
debate pertained to the establishment of linguistic school 
boards? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My final question relates to the position of the Quebec Catholic 
bishops.  The hon. member said, as did his minister, that the 
Quebec bishops were not opposed to the amendment.  Will the hon. 
member admit the bishops have made very clear that they oppose 
any changes that would remove provisions for confessional 
schooling in Quebec?  Will he not admit that is the actual 
position of the bishops?  Will he not put it in its full nuance 
on the record of this debate?

in my speech and in the minister's speech we did not list the

which was tabled in the House goes through that very, very 
clearly and in much detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one is suggesting that the consensus was unanimous.  The 
committee heard that it is pretty well unanimous on the question 
of moving to a linguistic school system.  But the consensus is 
far from unanimous on whether it should be accomplished by the 
proposed amendments to section 93.  There is no question and 
nobody was trying mislead any member or the House.  There were a 
lot of witnesses who gave testimony that they were not in favour 
of the amendment that we are debating here today proceeding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, from evidence I heard and from weighing the 
representations of the various witnesses, there is no question in 
my mind that there is a very strong consensus that the amendment 
proceed.  Members of the committee asked witnesses specifically, 
given the fact that we are removing entrenched rights, did they 
still favour it being proceeded with.  In my opinion and in the 
opinion of the majority of the committee, that consensus was very 
clearly demonstrated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member feels that I was misleading anyone, I certainly 
wish to assure him that is not the case.  There is no question of 
attempting to mislead anyone.  It is still my very strong opinion 
that there is a strong consensus in the Province of Quebec that 
we proceed with this amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member says that reference has been made to this being a 
30-year old debate.  He is partly correct.  We have not 
necessarily been talking about amending section 43 of the 
Constitutional Act of 1982 for 30 years.  The process is not 30 
years old, so we obviously were not talking about using section 
43 of the Constitution Act of 1982 for 30 years.  However, the 
whole question of managing the school system in Quebec is a 
debate that has been going on for approximately 30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue has been studied by commission after commission, all 
of which is referred to in the report dealing with going from a 
denominational to a linguistic school system.  In recent years 
the question of the process of using section 93 has been reviewed 
and proposed.  There were committee hearings and the Quebec 
legislature has dealt with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his final question the hon. member asked me about the 
position of the Catholic Bishops.  I think I quite correctly 
stated in my comment that the Catholic Bishops were not opposed 
to the amendment.  They did not appear before the committee but 
there was correspondence filed which set out their position which 
simply stated is that they are not opposed to the amendment.  The 
amendment removes denominational school boards.  However, they 
still favour denominational schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have tabled an excerpt from an interview with a Quebec Bishop 
saying that he was satisfied to leave it to the state to decide 
how to implement the required changes and he was satisfied that 
there were measures in Quebec law, the Quebec Charter of Rights 
and the Quebec Education Act that would ensure their conditions 
were met and that there would be denominational schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee heard evidence that it is a very strong position 
in Quebec society that people want to retain denominational 
schools.  I think the political realities will ensure that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, the 
hon. member on the government side said that the Catholic bishops 
were in favour of this change.  No.  I want to say to him that on 
March 6, 1996, 15 members of the permanent council of the 
Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops, of which six bishops were 
from Quebec, agreed to the following recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops asked the members of 
the House of Commons and the members of the Senate of Canada to 
weigh carefully the implications of this proposal and to indicate 
that they cannot associate themselves with the passage of 
legislation that would deprive minorities of religious and 
educational rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, when this was first discussed about linguistic school 
boards, the protection of section 93 was not even being 
considered at that time.  Therefore I have a major concern.  I 
want to ask the hon. member, abrogating the constitutional rights 
of a minority without their consent is a terrible precedent in 
our country, I cannot imagine that this government or this 
member would be part of that— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers:</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member says I 
indicated that the Catholic bishops were in favour.  I did not 
say that.  I said that they were not opposed and I am going from 
the evidence that was before the committee, letters that were 
filed before the committee.  I think I very accurately stated 
what their position was as it was presented to the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I am not saying that at any time did they say they were 
in favour of it.  They were saying that they were leaving that to 
the state to deal with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the member's final point dealing with minority 
rights, I very clearly stated in my presentation that I believe 
constitutionally entrenched minority rights can only be dealt 
with when there is a very clear demonstration that the majority 
of the minority who are affected are in favour of it.  I believe 
that is what we are dealing with in this case.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise 
on behalf of the official opposition to speak to the proposed changes to 
the Constitution Act, 1867, to amend paragraphs (1) to (4) of section 
93, which provide for the creation of denominational school boards in 
the provinces of Quebec and Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed change to the Constitution Act follows a resolution 
adopted by the National Assembly of Quebec, asking the federal 
government to amend section 93 of the act to facilitate the 
establishment of linguistic school boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to be clear: the official opposition supports the idea of 
linguistic school boards. 
We are not opposed to the creation of a better school system or a school 
system where groups are formed on the basis of language. However, this 
amendment is neither about linguistic school boards, nor about 
modernizing the school system in Quebec, nor about giving parents more 
power in choosing an education system for their children. This amendment 
is about taking away minority rights which are guaranteed in the 
Constitution and protected by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will repeat: the Reform Party is not opposed to the establishment 
of linguistic school boards. However, it cannot condone the abrogation 
of vested rights without the consent of those directly affected. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have outlined in our debate in the House three tests for 
amendments of this nature.  The first is a test of democratic 
consent and by this we mean not only the consent of the majority 
but as the parliamentary secretary says, the majority of the 
minority and the majority of the groups directly affected.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament must be satisfied that Quebec citizens were well 
informed about the proposed amendment and its implications 
radically consulted by the government and that a majority of 
those affected are in favour of the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second test that we have outlined is that the change must 
respect the rule of law and that it must not prejudicially affect 
minority rights.  In other words, the correct amending formula 
must be used and we must be certain that we are not offending the 
very right guaranteed in section 93, not to prejudicially affect 
the rights of professional groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec National Assembly suggests that section 43 of the 
Constitution Act specifies the applicable amending formula but we 
do not believe it has made a case that this does not 
prejudicially affect minority rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third test is that the amendment must be in the national 
interest.  Parliament must determine whether the actions of one 
province affecting education rights may create a significant 
precedent regarding the educational rights of Canadians in other 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the first test, the committee was informed that 
the national assembly and the public have addressed the issue of 
linguistic school boards for the past three decades.  We just 
heard from the parliamentary secretary that this is not the case. 
What has been debated in the past is the establishment of 
linguistic school boards.  There seems to be a unanimous 
consensus in favour in Quebec from all quarters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the proposed amendment before us today has not had that 
kind of rigorous discussion.  The parliamentary secretary just 
said that in the past few years it has had some public scrutiny. 
I suggest that what he really means to say is in the past year. 
The implications of this amendment have really not been seriously 
debated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem here is that we are talking about extinguishing a 
right which was central to the compact of Confederation.  The 
Supreme Court of Canada has said that section 93 represents a 
central part of that compact.  Peter Hogg, one of our leading 
constitutional experts, says that it is in itself a miniature 
bill of rights, that section 93 was that important to the heart 
of Confederation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are discussing here is not some administrative 
realignment of the Quebec school system.  As I have said, that is 
something that we support.  Education administration is a 
provincial responsibility and we do not object to that.  However, 
what the Constitution does is to vest in this Parliament the 
power to protect the rights of minority groups and groups 
empowered with educational rights at the time of Confederation. 
Those Fathers of Confederation put that amendment in place in 
1867 because they anticipated a debate like this might happen 
today in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many groups appeared before the committee.  As the government 
has said, some 60 witnesses.  By my count, roughly half of those 
witnesses opposed the proposed amendment.  Most interesting is 
that the only groups that I recall—ordinary parents, people who 
were the most directly affected and who came before the committee 
to ask that this Parliament not approve the amendment—were those 
opposed to the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the first days of the hearings we had a room full of parents 
opposed to the amendment.  These people were not lawyers, 
education bureaucrats or politicians.  They were parents 
concerned about how this would affect their educational rights. 
Many other groups appeared before the committee, including 
constitutional law experts, who indicated that this amendment 
would threaten and eventually extinguish confessional school 
rights in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see I am out of time.  I will continue my comments after 
question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Of course.  You still have approximately 13 
minutes and the floor will still be yours when we resume debate

upon Canada when it hosts the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation 
forum, the culmination of Canada's year of Asia-Pacific. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The forum is a golden opportunity for Canada to help APEC move 
in a direction which reflects the needs and values of Canadians 
and to expand its influence in the region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>APEC members have a combined gross national product of $16 
trillion U.S., which is about half the world's annual trade. Last 
year Canada's trade with APEC members, excluding the United 
States, reached $58.6 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has underlined the importance to Canada's 
economic future of bringing APEC to Canada for developments in 
Asia-Pacific touch the lives of Canadians more and more as a 
result of growing business, immigration and cultural ties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada must commit itself, in addition to continued economic 
engagement, to learning more about the cultures of our neighbours 
thereby reinforcing economic co-operation in the Asia-Pacific 
region on the basis of shared partnership, shared responsibility 
and common good.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
while our two great allies, Britain and the U.S., are mobilizing 
warships this Prime Minister is mobilizing cocktail receptions 
with Iraqi officials.  Last week our Prime Minister was actually 
defending Canadian business invitations to Saddam.  He said “If 
you want to sell you have to have contact first”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contact?  Who wants contact with a man who gassed thousands of 
Kurdish dissidents with chemical weapons?  What kind of contact 
with the butcher of Bagdhad would the government find acceptable? 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the government finds completely unacceptable the conduct 
of Saddam Hussein and his regime.  We insist that the Iraqi 
regime allow the UN inspectors back, including those of American 
origin, to carry out their job pursuant to the UN resolutions 
without reservation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In so far as there is any matter of exports to Iraq, the 
government's position, as is the Prime Minister's position, is 
that these must meet completely Canadian law and UN resolutions. 
How can the Reform Party object to that? 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the Reform Party objects to that because it completely sends the 
wrong signal to our allies.  That is what we are talking about 
right now.  Any business deal with Iraq, even under the name of 
so-called non-military business, undermines any allied action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The UN weapons inspectors must have full access in Iraq and 
Saddam's bullying must end, but our government is actually 
helping Saddam's image and harming our allied cause.  Again, why 
on earth is the Prime Minister supporting trade with the likes of 
Saddam Hussein? 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister is not supporting trade.  All he said 
was that our rules and the UN rules have to be respected.  I do 
not see why the Reform Party would oppose that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, if the Reform Party is saying that the UN 
inspectors must be allowed in, all it is doing is agreeing with 
what we have already said, and it is about time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this is unbelievable.  In defiance of UN sanctions, Saddam 
continues to develop chemical and biological weapons, nuclear 
weapons and missile technology.  Yet the government says that it 
is okay, that it does not have a problem with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our Prime Minister said that these acceptable trade items are 
okay because they are okay with the UN.  Let us talk about trucks 
and medical supplies.  They can be used for military purposes and 
military personnel as well.  Our government knows it; Saddam 
Hussein knows it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there no dictator too dirty for the government to do business 
with? 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member completely misstates the government's 
position.  The government has never said that it supports Iraq's 
development of biological weapons.  It totally rejects that.  It 
stands firm with the other countries of the UN in saying that 
Iraq must back down and accept UN inspection without reservation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the hon. member that type of misleading comment, 
perhaps not intentional, totally weakens the ability of this 
Parliament to send a strong signal to Saddam Hussein that his 
misdeeds are unacceptable.  It is about time that she supported 
our position against Saddam Hussein.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

Fiegenwald and the RCMP was, as far as I am aware, entered into 
voluntarily by Mr. Fiegenwald with the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is something involving the internal disciplinary process of

There is no cover-up.  If the hon. member had his way the

Because of our negotiations that claim was dropped and that money 
saved to the Canadian taxpayer.

to closely monitor the situation and first try to determine whether we 
have, in this country, individuals who could be suspected of relatively 
recent war crimes. We did that and, second, we have taken action against 
those individuals who were identified. Several cases were investigated. 
More than 70 claimants were returned to their country of origin and more

question is for the minister of agriculture.  The minister will 
know that B.C. farmers have been hurt by extremely poor harvest 
conditions about the Okanagan and the Peace River districts this 
year.  The B.C. government wants to help out the area farmers 
affected by this disaster by developing cost shared responses to 
these huge crop losses, losses which far exceed existing crop 
insurance and NISA programs.

B.C farmers?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food,

B.C. farmers.  I have had a discussion with the minister of 
agriculture from the province of British Columbia.  We have 
discussed the way in which the NISA program and the crop 
insurance programs, which are ongoing programs, available to 
farmers across Canada can assist.  I have also instructed staff 
members to work with the Government of British Columbia to do all 
we can within existing programs that are available in both the 
province of British Columbia and the rest of Canada to assist 
these farmers.

DFO closed the river to catch and release fishing and then 
proceeded to kill fish to give to the local aboriginal 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The local native communities never asked for those fish.  They 
are not surplus fish and they are not necessary for science.  Why 
did the DFO close the river for conservation reasons and then

the 22 fish that he is talking about were in fact male hatchery 
grilse that had been at sea for one winter only. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were turned over to the aboriginal community which is 
appropriate because the aboriginal community's quota for 
ceremonial and food purposes had not been met.  These were 
hatchery fish and it is important for genetic reasons, to protect 
genetic stocks of salmon to make sure that the number of hatchery 
fish are reduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, in that very river the number of male fish was 
double the number of female and that is an imbalance that we

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
probably out of sequence time wise on this, but during question 
period the Deputy Prime Minister referred to and read from a 
document.  I believe under the standing orders he is required to 
table that document.  We request that he do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  If the Deputy Prime Minister read 
from a document in the House, being an experienced member, I am 
sure he would know that there would be a requirement to table it. 
I am sure the request will be drawn to the attention of the 
Deputy Prime Minister and if a tabling is to follow I suspect 
that he will return to the House and table the document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the hour and the fact that question period has been over 
for a few minutes, perhaps it would be appropriate to deal with 
this at a later time if a tabling does not follow.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF CANADA (QUEBEC) 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK203">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Calgary Southeast 
had the floor and I should advise the hon. member that he has 14 
minutes remaining in his participation in this debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
before question period in addressing the proposed amendment to 
section 93 of the British North America Act I was discussing the 
lack of consensus that exists in Quebec, in particular among the 
groups most directly affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to reiterate for the record that prior to tabling this 
resolution in the national assembly the Quebec government held no 
hearings on the amendment.  Parents, school boards and others 
were not able to present their positions to the national assembly 
on the amendment.  The assembly voted on the matter under party 
discipline rather than under a free vote and had no clear 
evidence in favour of a consensus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec national assembly chose not to consult Quebec 
citizens by holding a referendum on the proposed amendment and 
finally the current Quebec government did not propose this 
amendment during the last provincial election and consequently, I 
submit, has no democratic mandate to make this application. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, the Government of Quebec passed a resolution 
stipulating that the federal government should amend the 
constitution with undue haste which was rushed through the joint 
committee in about two weeks time for an amendment that will 
forever extinguish minority rights.  I think undue haste is the 
operative term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet the parliamentary special joint committee heard from groups 
representing hundreds of thousands of Quebeckers objecting to the 
amendment over the course of our two weeks of hearings.  For 
example, la Coalition pour la confessionnalité scolaire collected 
235,000 signatures of Quebec citizens who opposed the amendment. 
These groups testified that the possibility of this 
constitutional amendment had never been discussed with them. They 
questioned why the Quebec government would abolish the rights of 
religious minorities when this was unnecessary to establish 
linguistic school boards, a point defined as such by the Supreme 
Court of Canada in a 1993 reference.

<A HREF="#LINKT50"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a longstanding convention not only in Canada but in other 
liberal democracies that acquired rights cannot be abrogated 
without the consent of those affected, and that consent does not 
demonstrably exist in this case.  Parliament therefore has a 
responsibility to ensure the democratic consent includes a 
demonstrated assent of the minority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As indicated by the Protestant communities in Quebec, for 
instance, who were most vocal in their opposition to the 
amendment, there is a demonstrated dissent or disagreement of the 
minority groups most directly affected.  As a minority within a 
minority, the French Protestant community will suffer the most 
from the negative effects of this amendment.  It will be 
amalgamated with the majority of francophone schools, but those 
wishing Protestant education may be lumped into the few 
Protestant schools permitted under the new system, most of which 
will be English speaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs justifies the proposed 
amendment by stating that it will improve the situation of 
Quebec's anglophone community.  He says essentially that the 
linguistic educational rights of that community will continue to 
be protected under section 23 of the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister knows that the Quebec government has failed to 
apply subsection 23(1)(a), which is the only real protection the 
charter affords linguistic education.  It is insufficient 
protection for the anglophone community and hardly justifies 
removing rights from the Protestant and Catholic communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me move on to the question of whether this is in the 
national interest and whether or not it prejudicially affects 
minority rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment will replace constitutional guarantees with 
inferior statutory guarantees.  Repeatedly witnesses testified to 
the effect that the repeal of section 93 will lead to the deep 
confessionalization of education in Quebec.  Numerous 
constitutional experts stated that sufficient precedents exist to 
nullify the right to religious instruction once the application 
of section 93 is removed from the province of Quebec.  Virtually 
every major constitutional expert who appeared as a witness 
before the committee confirmed that the charter of rights poses a 
threat to the continued access in Quebec to confessional 
education under the Quebec education act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is because precedents exist in law such as the Canadian 
Civil Liberties Association v Minister of Education decision 
where the Ontario Court of Appeal addressed the issue of 
indoctrinational education.  The case established that religious 
curricula denominational in nature could not be endorsed by the 
provincial ministry of education or be created by school boards 
because to do so would be to offend sections 2 and 15 of the 
charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Zylberberg v Sudbury Board of Education, a 1988 case, the 
supreme court ruled that opening or morning exercises in 
religious observances in public schools were not permitted under 
the charter for the same reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legal precedents these two rulings provide will impact on 
the decision making of Quebec courts.  They are bound to these 
precedents, as is the Supreme Court of Canada.  It is unlikely, 
in fact inconceivable, that a Quebec court would not find in a 
way consistent with the precedents which threaten confessional 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important point.  With all due respect I do not 
think some of the members who have spoken to the resolution and 
sat in committee fully appreciate the threat it poses. 
Essentially when we take away the protection afforded by section 
93 the charter in toto it applies to the Quebec education system. 
The judicial precedents are quite clear.  The charter does not 
tolerate sectarian confessional education in the school system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provisions for that kind of education allowed for in the Quebec 
education act and Bill 107 which is now Bill 109 will eventually 
be nullified as being inconsistent with the charter by the 
courts.  The Quebec government said this would not happen because 
the Quebec education act is protected from the secularizing 
effect of the charter by its invocation of the notwithstanding 
clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 33, the notwithstanding clause, has to be reinvoked 
every five years.  It is subject to the political will of the 
Quebec legislature at any given time.  Section 33 protection is 
not constitutional protection.  It is merely short term political 
protection.  When the public consensus in Quebec begins to change 
with respect to the right of confessional education, there is no 
doubt a future Quebec legislature will fail to invoke the 
coverage of section 33 and the confessional education provisions 
in the Quebec education act will be found null and void by the 
courts.  This is very troubling.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian constitutional history is premised on building minority 
rights and not on repealing them.  Peter Hogg, Canada's renowned 
constitutional scholar, has described section 93 as “a small 
bill of rights for the protection of minority religious groups”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its reference decision in 1993 on Bill 107 the Supreme Court 
of Canada declared that section 93 is the “basic compact of 
confederation”.  Never in Canadian constitutional history has an 
amendment to eliminate constitutionally protected minority rights 
been passed.  A newspaper's headline read today that it will be 
history if this legislature tomorrow passes this amendment.  For 
the first time we will have taken the very troubling step of 
extinguishing minority rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the passage of the amendment to section 93, freedom of 
religion will become freedom from religious education eventually 
in Quebec.  The concern is this will be a precedent that will be 
established for Ontario, Alberta, Saskatchewan and other 
provinces that rely on the protection of section 93 for minority 
sectarian education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an illusion that parents will have the opportunity to 
choose the religious education they desire for their children 
when a single decision by the courts will easily render the 
provision of public denominational schools unconstitutional. This 
seems to be the desire of the Quebec government which no longer 
wishes to fund religious education in public schools.  At least 
that is a position one can draw from some public comments of the 
Quebec minister of education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the first day of hearings two constitutional authorities from 
McGill University appeared before the joint committee.  In 
response to my questioning they agreed, according to an article 
in the Montreal <I>Gazette</I>, that Protestant and Catholic 
instruction have no place in the school system and that the 
charter through court cases will bring an end to religion being 
taught in the schools.  That is what the constitutional experts 
said before the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Minister Marois and Minister Brassard, the Quebec ministers of 
education and intergovernmental affairs, appeared before the 
committee.  On questioning they refused to provide any guarantee 
that the confessional elements of the Quebec education act would 
be preserved by invoking the section 33 notwithstanding 
protection.  They cannot provide that assurance because we do not 
know what future legislatures will do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not accept that legislative guarantees of access to 
religious instruction in secular schools are of comparable 
quality to the guarantees under the constitution.  Previously the 
Leader of the Opposition stated in debate: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—this interest in the religious orientation in the education of 
children is broader and deeper than the mere provision of 
non-denominational religious courses in secular schools and the 
permitting of religious observances supervised by a secular 
authority.  It includes the right to have those courses and 
observance provided in an environment that truly reflects 
spiritual values.  It is this broader right that many parents 
would like to see safeguarded. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That right was safeguarded at confederation which is imperilled 
by the amendment today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Confessional education teaches a way of life, not merely a 
history of a religion.  Religious instruction provided in secular 
schools cannot approximate the experience of religious education 
in confessional schools.  Abrogation of section 93 will prevent 
future generations of Catholic and Protestant citizens in Quebec, 
and potentially in other provinces, from studying and adopting 
that way of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This creates a worrisome precedent for other provinces such as 
Ontario.  It is a political precedent, not a legal one, for the 
extinguishment of minority rights which other provinces will no 
doubt take up.  We will be studying a similar application from 
Newfoundland this week at a joint committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate one very important point.  Some people have 
suggested that in a modern pluralistic society it is no longer 
appropriate to provide denominational publicly funded education 
to particular sectarian groups.  That is a sentiment I can 
understand, but we do not serve pluralism or minority rights by 
extinguishing rights that exist for some groups.  If we object to 
the exclusive coverage of section 93 to Catholics and 
Protestants, instead of extinguishing the section we ought to 
broaden it so that it includes all groups of all religious 
backgrounds. 
Then they would all have access to the same rights.   A modern, 
liberal, pluralistic democracy ought to stand for the expansion 
of rights, not their diminishment.  We do not equalize the 
playing field by levelling rights for some.  We build a real 
democracy respectful of human rights by expanding them for all.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament should return this application to the Quebec 
government and propose that it come back to this place with an 
amendment to section 93, which would broaden the confessional 
guarantees which the Fathers of Confederation in their wisdom 
decided to pass on to us through the generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some will say that the compact of confederation, the small bill 
of rights which is section 93, was merely a political arrangement 
designed for a particular time in the mid-19th century and no 
longer applicable.  It was just the result of horse trading 
between Catholics and Protestants in Ontario and Quebec 
respectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I disagree.  Section 93 does not state explicitly but implicitly 
speaks to a fundamental right recognized by all liberal 
democracies, the right to publicly funded and publicly supported 
education.  It is a critical social right that can only be 
exercised legitimately at the direction of parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Inevitably the amendment will lead to the removal of access to 
publicly funded education in Quebec.  That will undermine the 
basic rights implicit in section 93.  It was not a political 
compromise for one time in our history.  It was the recognition 
of a fundamental right which it is our duty today and forever to 
protect and maintain, not to diminish and extinguish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on my colleagues on both sides of the House to think very 
seriously and soberly about the issue.  We should not let the 
politics of separatism lead us to the diminishment of a 
fundamental right and the protection of a minority group in 
Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I sat on the committee 
with the hon. member for almost three weeks.  There is a premise 
that no consensus has been established in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened very intently to the member's speech.  He failed to 
mention that debate on the creation of linguistic school boards 
has been ongoing in Quebec upward of 30 years.  He also failed to 
mention there is a quasi-unanimity on the creation of linguistic 
school boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will grant him one thing.  There is no consensus on how to go 
about creating linguistic school boards.  The role our committee 
undertook was to determine the appropriateness of the Quebec 
request under section 93 and the bilateral amending formula for 
section 43. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It behoves me to hear the Reform Party time and time again 
refuse categorically to accept the fact that there is a 
consensus.  The consensus is large.  Other than, as the Reform 
has always called for, holding another referendum on the issue I 
do not see how Reformers can ignore it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a duty as a member of Parliament to make sure there is a 
consensus among the minority that is affected.  Let us be clear 
what we are talking about.  We are talking about removing the 
application of articles 1 through 4 in section 93 in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be even more specific.  Section 93 protects Catholic and 
Protestant education in the city of Montreal but not the island 
of Montreal and in the city of Quebec proper but not the region 
of Quebec.  That is the protection it gives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about consensus.  The provincial Protestant Association 
of Teachers represents approximately 6,500 teachers.  The 
non-denominationals came to us and said they were in favour.  La 
Fédération des comités des parents de la province de Québec is 
made up of over 40,000 parents, French and English speaking, 
Catholic and Protestant.  It represents 172 parents' committees.

</I></B></P><P align=left>La Centrale de l'enseignement du Québec, the largest group of 
130,000 members, and la Coalition pour la déconfessionalisation 
du système scolaire—I can cite survey after survey—all called 
on the government to acquiesce to Quebec's demands because that 
province in its infinite wisdom sought for almost 30 years to 
find a solution to modernizing the school system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member, is it appropriate in a modern society 
such as Canada today to provide for the constitutional protection 
of just two classes of religions, Protestants and Catholics, or 
should we not let each province decide what is best, in its own 
interests, in its own regions and in its own communities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, first of all I made it 
very clear at the outset of my remarks, as did the Reform Party, 
in its dissenting opinion that we recognize there is virtually 
unanimous consensus in Quebec for the creation of linguistic 
school boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said that half a dozen times in my speech.  I agreed to that 
statement being included in the majority report.  The evidence is 
clear.  There is virtually a unanimous consensus in favour of 
linguistic school boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, that has nothing to do with section 93.  This is, 
frankly, the unintentional duplicity of the proponents of this 
amendment failing to recognize that linguistic school boards is 
one question and section 93 is an entirely different question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member opposite not recognize that in 1993 the 
Supreme Court of Canada ruled in a reference from the Quebec 
government that then Bill 107, substantially the same as Bill 
109, the now Quebec education act which established linguistic 
school boards, was completely consistent with the protections 
afforded by section 93. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the Quebec government is already establishing these 
linguistic school boards.  Witnesses from Alliance Quebec, from 
Catholic groups, from Protestant groups who appeared before us 
said that they do not object to linguistic school boards.  The 
government is implementing them.  That is fine, but that has 
nothing to do with section 93. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why can we not maintain the protections afforded by section 93 
given to us by our ancestors and, at the same time, modernize the 
school system by consolidating linguistic groups into linguistic 
boards? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the challenge that this government has not answered.  It 
is possible to do both.  Given a choice, this Parliament ought to 
opt for protecting minority rights when other policy objectives 
like the establishment of linguistic school boards can be 
achieved at the same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to the member's last question, I said at the end of 
my remarks that I would strongly support, as virtually every 
group that appeared before the committee in opposition to the 
amendment would support, an amendment to section 93 which would 
broaden the constitutional rights guaranteed therein to all 
denominational and religious groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that no minority's interests are served, no one's 
rights are protected by removing rights from some people. 
Instead of crushing section 93 and the rights that exist for the 
large majority of Quebeckers to access confessional education, 
why not broaden it so that yes, people of other faiths have a 
constitutional guarantee to publicly funded religious education 
that does not depend on the political whim of the legislature at 
any given moment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
rise in this debate because I also was a member of the special joint 
committee on linguistic school boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Reform member seems to be saying is that the witnesses who 
appeared before the committee did not have a good understanding of the 
issue. Bill 109 on public education also had to do with the repeal of 
section 93. The people who came to testify knew that the creation of 
linguistic school boards also entailed debating the abrogation of 
section 93. So he should not be saying such things about the witnesses 
who came to testify in Quebec before the various committees. 
People have been talking about this issue for 30 years, and what is at 
the heart of this debate is the amendment to section 93. So I cannot 
understand why someone would rise and say that people are being tricked.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When Minister Marois came to testify in committee, I asked her the 
same question, because consensus and consultation were always concerns 
of the committee. It was important to ensure that people knew exactly 
where we were heading with this. Repeal of section 93 is an issue that 
people have been talking about for 30 years. A dozen consultations and 
legal procedures went nowhere or were declared unconstitutional. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So I have difficulty understanding how my colleague from the Reform 
Party who has just spoken can question all this process that was 
undertaken in Quebec. This is the only way to ensure that the Quebec 
school system is properly managed and can deal with the reality of an 
English- and a French-speaking people. Also, children should not be 
penalized by a cumbersome and complicated administrative system. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there seems to be this 
impenetrable refusal to listen to what I am saying.  I am not 
denying the consensus in favour of establishing linguistic school 
boards.  I literally said that six times in my main remarks.  We 
make that clear two or three times in our dissenting report. 
Every witness who opposed the amendment made that clear in their 
submissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, that debate which has gone on for 30 years is not what 
we are discussing today.  We do not have the authority to 
establish linguistic school boards in Quebec.  Fortunately, that 
is a right exercised by the national assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this Parliament has been given in section 93 is the 
responsibility to guarantee confessional education rights.  That 
is what this debate is about, a debate which has hardly even 
begun in the province of Quebec.  Nevertheless, it is a right 
that we seem prepared to take away, but that has not been 
discussed in the debate over the past 30 years in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me just make it clear for the member.  I said it in French 
twice and I will now say it in English.  I am in favour of the 
establishment of linguistic school boards in Quebec.  The Reform 
Party is in favour of the establishment of linguistic school 
boards in Quebec.  There is unanimous consensus in Quebec to this 
effect.  The Quebec bishops agree with it.  However, that does 
not mean we have to extinguish confessional school rights.  This 
is what the supreme court said in its 1993 reference on bill 107. 
It said we could have both.  We do not have to take away section 
93 confessional school rights in order to establish linguistic 
boards.  We can do both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The challenge to us again is to let the Quebec government do 
what it wants, establish those boards but do what the Fathers of 
Confederation expected us to do in 1867, and maintain that 
constitutional protection for those minorities.  We can do both 
at the same time.  At the same time, why not do it?

my maiden speech.  I would therefore like to take advantage of this 
opportunity to say a few words about my riding of Brossard—La

</I></B></P><P align=left>Come talk to them, and you will see the harmony that exists 
among us, and you will understand why I hold such affection for the 
people of this riding.  All of Canada can be proud of them. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding is located on the South Shore of Montreal.  In 
1965 English speaking parents, parents of the area with a tremendous 
vision and sense of future, brought the South Shore Protestant 
School Board to task.  They wanted their children to learn French 
using a pilot method developed by McGill University, a method 
that eventually gained world renown, a method used today by 
300,000 young Canadians to learn French. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1965, at the time when there were no language laws in Quebec, 
these tenacious and foresighted parents put French immersion on 
the world map. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was my honour and my pleasure to be a commissioner and the 
chairman of this local school board in our area.  It is said, and 
it gives me great pleasure, that I was the first francophone 
chairman of a Protestant school board in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of my duties, some 10 years ago I presented a brief to 
the National Assembly committee on education.  Claude Ryan was the 
minister at the time.  In the brief, I opposed the proposal for 
linguistic school boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, I announce my intention to vote in favour of the 
constitutional amendment before us, and I would like to explain why 
my position has changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of protecting official language minorities, we 
have long held that section 93 of the Constitution was a solid 
bulwark.  However, since that time, the end of the 1980s, many 
Supreme Court decisions have weakened the thrust of section 93, 
which concerns sectarian guarantees obviously, but strengthened the 
protection provided under section 23, which concerns linguistic 
guarantees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have three examples.  In 1990, the Supreme Court of Canada, 
in the matter of Mahé versus Alberta, confirmed the official 
language minority rights provided in section 23, as it did as well 
in 1993 in a reference in Manitoba.  Again in 1993, the Supreme 
Court of Canada confirmed that section 93 protected denominational 
school boards in Montreal and Quebec City only.  This protection 
does not apply in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, the safeguards provided in section 23 are much greater than 
those in section 93. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to deal with certain concerns expressed by Mr. Kamel, who 
represents the linguistic minority on the South Shore school board, 
which covers my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I want to say that I have a great deal of respect for Mr. 
Kamel and for the people whom he represents. I personally know a number 
of them and they are moderate people. Therefore, I take their concerns 
all the more seriously. These parents deplore the fact that minority 
rights other than those of anglophones or Protestants are not addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must point out that section 93 does not deal with these other 
minority rights. Whether section 93 is amended or not, nothing will 
change in this regard. Given the demographic evolution of the Quebec 
society, the provincial government will not always be able to avoid 
dealing with these rights. 
Therefore, the debate will have to take place in another forum. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this letter these parents state their fear that linguistic 
boards could become a tool in the hands of the separatists.  It 
is a fear that I want to encourage them not to have.  If this 
fear was founded it would mean that Claude Ryan and Robert 
Bourassa, the Canadian Jewish Congress, le Rassemblement arabe de 
Montreal, the Quebec Board of Black Educators, the Provincial 
Association of Protestant Teachers, the Provincial Association of 
Catholic Teachers, Alliance Quebec and the Gazette, among so many 
others, would be separatists simply having in common that they 
have endorsed the principle of linguistic school boards. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One can see the absurdity of the situation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our determined fight against the separation of Quebec, the 
problem is not section 93 or its amendment.  The problem is the 
separatist government in Quebec.  Therefore the solution is not 
to fight against the amendment before us.  The solution is to 
elect a federalist government in Quebec as soon as possible.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, a government with good intentions regarding Quebec's 
place in the Canadian federation could promote Quebec's situation within 
Canada by relying on school structures, whether denominational or 
linguistic. Similarly, a government with bad intentions can do just the 
opposite by using the same structures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One cannot prevent the modernization of Quebec's school system by 
imputing motives, particularly if Canada understands the need of 
Quebeckers to be recognized as different but equal members of the 
Canadian federation. I am confident that if this recognition takes 
place, then the separatist threat will truly be marginalized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern expressed by these parents is that the creation of 
linguistic school boards could adversely impact on an essential element 
of harmonious integration, namely the presence in the same schools of 
francophones, anglophones and allophones who, by living together, learn 
to know each other, which results in a better integration of these 
various groups. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sincerely believe that our diversity is a source of tremendous 
wealth and pride, the very foundation on which to build a 
remarkable future for our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the characteristics of this diversity is its attachment 
to its roots, traditions and identity so the people who make up 
this diversity understand even better the need and will for 
French Quebeckers to promote their roots and traditions and 
secure their language, culture and identity.  The people who make 
up this diversity can be tremendously credible ambassadors of 
Quebec's unique character in an effort of inclusion and respect. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that this harmony comes not from the denominational or 
linguistic features of our school structures, but from the political 
will that, with a very few exceptions that need to be marginalized, is 
characteristic of all our people and our authorities. The schools and 
the communities complement each other remarkably well. They have done 
and will continue to do a very good job within this diversity that we 
like so much, in order to promote dignity, respect and the sensible 
inclusion of each and every member of our community. I am putting all my 
faith in this and I know time will prove me right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides, if we were to vote against this amendment to section 93 
before us today, we would be keeping in place, especially in Montreal 
and Quebec City, such a burdensome school system that the administration 
costs would bring about a decrease in the budget for direct services to 
our children. Under these circumstances, I think it would be totally 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to some issues that, as far as I know, have yet to 
be addressed during this debate. As adults, we argue about the law, the 
management issues, the Constitution, the system's efficiency, and so on. 
But let us take the time to consider what our children are going 
through, especially but not only the younger ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They attend a school they identify with, in an environment they are 
familiar with, a reassuring environment that gives them a sense of 
stability. The name or the affiliation of their school board does not 
matter to them at all. 
What does matter to them is how nice their teacher is, a teacher 
they often idolize.  What does matter to them is their school 
friends, their classroom, which they have a hand in decorating, 
their principal, who is sometimes an authority figure when their 
behaviour leaves something to be desired, and sometimes a source of 
pride when they are able to come and sign the principal's book of 
honour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What matters to them is the school secretary, who also wears 
the hats of nurse and second mother, the custodian, who helps them 
share his respect and pride in their school, the crossing guard, 
who makes sure they are safe in fair weather or foul.  In short, 
this is such an essential human context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This human context can be preserved within the contemplated 
reform.  I do, however, see two conditions required: first, that 
school boards can share the same buildings, at least for a while, 
to avoid wholesale transfers of children from one school to 
another. 
This is perfectly feasible, provided there is a willingness to put 
the interest of the children first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second: to allow transitional periods that vary according to the 
circumstances.  A few days ago, the hon. member for 
Brome—Missisquoi gave us an example of successful integration in 
the eastern townships.  At the secondary school level at 
Châteauguay, linguistic integration is, to all intents and 
purposes, already a fait accompli, because English speaking 
Catholics and English speaking Protestants attend the same 
school.  In such cases, the transition period could therefore be 
shorter than in certain schools in my riding, for example, where 
the change to language-based schools might be translated into the 
transfer of hundreds of students, teachers, school administrators 
and so on, with all of the uncertainties and upheavals that go 
with this for all involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us try imagine the feelings of our administrators and 
teachers, for example, when they do not have the slightest idea 
what they will be doing tomorrow, with whom, where, or how.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Progress must not mean dehumanization.  The Quebec government 
has a golden opportunity to combine the restructuring of the school 
system with the humanism that implementing a project of such scope 
requires.  It is a real challenge, and I put it to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, with the overwhelming majority of Quebeckers, 
regardless of their language or their origin, I invite this House 
to confirm that the Constitution of Canada serves Quebec and that 
it gives Quebec every means to progress and to grow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As member for Brossard—La Prairie, I will vote in favour of 
the proposed constitutional amendment.  I know that all the 
representatives of the Du Goéland, Brossard and South Shore school 
boards will take up the challenge to ensure that no minority will 
feel like one. 
I know that the people of Brossard—La Prairie will rise to the 
challenge. 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, with the 
support of a strong majority of Quebeckers, the Government of 
Quebec plans to set up linguistic school systems to replace 
denominational systems, which were defensible in 1867, but are 
discriminatory at the dawn of the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to carry out such a reorganization of the Quebec 
school system, the National Assembly voted unanimously in favour of 
a resolution to amend the Constitution by eliminating the 
application of subsections (1) to (4) of section 93 of the 
Constitution Act, 1867. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to this change so long desired in Quebec—for 
over 30 years—the Government of Quebec has sought this amendment 
from Parliament.  Before making its request, Quebec received a 
commitment from the federal government that it would not oppose it. 
That is the context in which Quebec initiated the current process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Constitution Act of 1982 provides several possible amending 
formulas. Section 43 is almost unanimously recognized as the most 
appropriate with respect to Quebec's request. Selecting this method 
would not set a precedent, as three other provinces have done the same 
since 1987. Using section 43 was required to meet the challenges some 
provinces were facing. Some may argue that the issues were different, 
but, in each case, it was a matter of adjusting to new realities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec did not see anything threatening in requesting these 
constitutional changes, since they applied only to the affected 
provinces. It is in the same spirit of openmindedness and understanding 
that Quebec sought approval for the proposed amendment. 
More than 60 organizations and individuals testified before the 
committee and expressed their views on various aspects of the Quebec 
school system issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of the concerns raised by some witnesses, there appears to 
be a very clear consensus about the need to make such an amendment so 
that Quebec can set up a modern school system that is more open and in 
line with today's pluralistic society. In this context, the National 
Assembly's action is legitimate and is part of a long process that had 
started and stopped over the years as governments changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The will of the people of Quebec to replace the denominational 
system with a linguistic school system has nothing to do with the place 
religion should have in schools, but rather with how school boards 
should be organized in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the place of religion in schools, the debate on this issue 
has been ongoing for decades and is likely to continue into the future, 
given our tradition of tolerance. For the time being, like all players 
in the system, Minister Marois is aware of the major changes the school 
system is about to undergo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To fully grasp what Quebec's request entails, some clarification is 
required. Here are a few of the issues that were raised in committee. A 
number of questions dealt with the consensus issue, consensus often 
being confused with unanimity. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1555"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT59"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT59"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1555
<A HREF="#LINKT60"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT58"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, there is the issue of consultations: were they 
sufficient or not?  Third, there is the place of instruction in the 
schools: what guarantees are given?  Will they be adequate?  Will 
amending section 93 affect Quebec's anglophone minorities?  And, 
finally, there is the use of the Constitution Act, 1982, if I have 
time left, to which Quebec was not a signatory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the five points I felt it most important to raise 
here today.  But before doing so, I would first like to describe 
the historical context in which section 93 was passed and try to 
explain why this provision no longer corresponds to today's 
reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The preamble to section 93 gives full and complete 
jurisdiction to the provinces in matters of education. 
Paragraphs 1 and 2 of this section essentially give educational 
guarantees and privileges to Roman Catholic and Protestant 
minorities.  This went without saying in 1867.  Why?  Because in 
the 19th century, denomination and language were practically 
interchangeable.  The very great majority of francophones were 
Catholic and, generally speaking, the majority of anglophones were 
Protestant.  But this constitutional arrangement no longer 
corresponds to the reality in Quebec at the close of the 20th 
century.  There are no longer any sociological correlations between 
Quebec's anglophone and Protestant minorities.  The numbers speak 
for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of students whose mother tongue is English enrolled in public 
primary or secondary schools in Quebec as a whole, 34% are 
Catholic, 33% give another religion or none at all, and 32% are 
Protestant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we take Montreal Island, the situation is even more 
illuminating: 43% are Catholic, 46% give another religion or none 
at all, and only 10% are Protestant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The numbers speak for themselves.  Look at the situation in 
Montreal:  46% of students give another religion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing that should be known about paragraphs 1 and 2 of 
section 93 is that they represent a form of discrimination that is 
contrary to the Quebec and Canadian charters of rights and 
freedoms.  Sections 3 and 4 also allow the federal government to 
step in in order to remedy an action taken or not taken by 
provincial authorities. 
In fact, the first of these powers was used only once in 1896, and the 
second was never used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So these various points can illustrate how a situation where 
certain privileges are granted, in Montreal and in Quebec City in school 
boards because of denominational structures, how people who belong to a 
religion other than the Catholic or the Protestant religion are being 
assigned in a manner that makes them feel discriminated against in their 
choice to go to a denominational school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like now to deal with the issue of consensus. We will hear 
what four major stakeholders had to say and listen to what the people 
had to say through public hearings. The Coalition pour la 
déconfessionnalisation du système scolaire, a coalition for the support 
of a non-denominational school system representing 43 organizations and 
close to two million people, including students, teachers, managers, 
school principles, support personnel, popular, political and national 
interest associations and others, this is not an insignificant body. 
This coalition came forward to tell us that the constitutional amendment 
requested by Quebec reflects a very large consensus in Quebec society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This group goes even further and states that the constraints of 
Section 93 must stop applying to Quebec so that our school system can be 
reformed to adjust to the modern and pluralistic society we live in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In their brief presented to the Commission des états généraux sur 
l'éducation, on August 8, 1995, the bishops also supported Quebec's 
initiative. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1600"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT59"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the redesign of the Public Education Act and considering 
the judicial perspective provided by the supreme court in 
1993, we feel that this change is desirable throughout Quebec, 
including in the cities of Montreal and Quebec. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to add that the Right Reverend Andrew S. Hutchison, 
Bishop of Montreal, in a letter to Minister Dion, stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes to section 93 proposed by the Government of 
Quebec, by which it would no longer be required to maintain 
denominational school boards, appear reasonable and in 
compliance with the positions traditionally adopted by the 
Anglican Church. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the Jewish Congress for the Quebec City region stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the responsibility of the government to adjust the 
school system to the realities of Quebec society by applying 
the principle of equality of religions in its policies. To do 
so, it must have the necessary tools to implement such 
changes. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average citizen was also able to express his or her views on 
this issue. Several public hearings were held over the last ten years in 
Quebec. 
A recent poll has shown that slightly more than 58% of the people are in 
favour of substituting linguistic boards for the existing Catholic and 
Protestant school boards in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something even more eloquent is that 77.8% of respondents think 
that the school system should be the same throughout Quebec, instead of 
having something different in Montreal and Quebec City. These figures 
speak for themselves. Unanimity has not been achieved, but there is a 
clear consensus in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me turn to the consultation process. Some people claim that 
there has been little or no consultation in Quebec. As has been said 
several times in the House today, the discussion on linguistic school 
boards has been going on in Quebec for almost 40 years. A number of 
legal initiatives and consultations have been undertaken in order to 
deal with the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to review the main steps of the consultation process 
in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, we have had the royal commission of inquiry on 
education in 1961. The Parent report tabled in 1963 recommended that the 
legislation not recognize denominational school boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also had Bill 3, an act respecting public primary and secondary 
education, which was passed by the National Assembly in December 1984, 
but was in force only for a few months, because it was declared 
unconstitutional by Justice Brossard in June 1985 on the grounds that it 
was prejudicial to the religious rights protected under section 93 of 
the Canadian Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then came a period of fastidious and exhausting exercises that, 
despite feats of ingenuity, failed to deal effectively with the 
constraints of subsections 93(1) to (4). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most recent reform exercise took place in 1988, when the 
National Assembly passed Bill 107. 
If it had been put in force, we would have had something similar to what 
Reform is suggesting here, namely that we should accept linguistic 
school boards, but without repealing subsections 1 to 4. Here is what we 
would end up with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill 107 would have superimposed linguistic boards on top of the 
religious boards in Montreal and Quebec City for the sake of the 
religious rights protected under section 93. In the rest of the 
province, we would have had linguistic school boards only. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of the House, I will take a few moments to try 
to explain the concrete impact of the reform that was proposed. 
Under Bill 107, in Quebec City and in Montreal, there would have 
been six overlapping school boards: a French Catholic school 
board, a French Protestant school board, an English Catholic 
school board, an English Protestant school board, a French 
non-denominational school board and an English non-denominational 
school board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Elsewhere in Quebec, there would have been four overlapping school 
boards: a French Protestant school board, and so on. The same situation 
would have occurred. I cannot make head or tail of it. In the real 
world, people in their everyday lives do not want to subject their 
children to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can you imagine what would happen: children who play in the same 
parks, who live on the same street, would be separated and sent to 
different schools because their parents are not of the same 
denomination. 
That is what would happen. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1605"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT61"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT61"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1605

<A HREF="#LINKT60"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, the chairperson of the Centrale de l'enseignement du Québec, 
Lorraine Pagé, was very clear on this. She said that a true 
pluralistic society is a society where people of different 
denominations learn to live together, learn to respect each 
other, learn to understand each other by sending their children 
to the same school, whatever their religious denomination, but 
with separate administrative systems for the English minority and 
for the French majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is, once again, reaffirmed in the Sondagem poll: 88.3% of 
Quebeckers are in favour of sending all children to the same school, 
regardless of the religious faith of their parents. 
Quebecers had another opportunity to express their views through these 
polls, which clearly show that we should be more open to allow this type 
of integration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To finish the list of consultations, there was the Kenniff report 
and the Proulx-Woehrling proposal, the education summit in 1996 and a 
parliamentary committee on Bill 109. So to deny the request made by the 
National Assembly of Quebec would postpone indefinitely a true reform of 
the Quebec school system. I think we must agree to Quebec's request and 
respect the kind of reform it wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to address the issue of language rights because 
it came up in committee. In terms of language rights, a few witnesses 
claimed that the amendment to section 93 would affect anglophone 
minorities in Quebec. This is absolutely false. 
Section 93 has nothing to do with language rights in Quebec. Everybody 
knows that, since 1982, the anglophone community benefits from the 
guarantees provided for in section 23. As a matter of fact, the member 
for Brossard—La Prairie mentioned a few moments ago that it is not 
section 93 which guarantees the rights of the anglophone community, but 
it is section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms which 
guarantees the right of the francophone and anglophone minorities to 
receive instruction in their own language. It is not section 93. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The jurisprudence is clear and generous with regard to minority 
language educational rights under section 23 of the Canadian charter, 
contrary to what some people are trying to convey as a message from 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, people must not be overly suspicious of the way Quebec 
treats its anglophone minority. Anglophones in Quebec manage their own 
educational institutions and benefit from a complete school system from 
junior kindergarten to university. 
They also manage their health and social service networks, and they have 
numerous means of communication in their own language. This is a far cry 
from what is going on at Montfort hospital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proverbial generosity of Quebeckers is recognized all over the 
world. On April 10, the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe 
said that “the situation of Quebec's English speaking minority is an 
excellent example of the protection of a linguistic minority's 
rights”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that other issues were raised by various witnesses. Some 
thought schools would no longer provide religious instruction and 
wondered about what would happen to religion in schools. We listened 
with great respect and attention to those concerned about preserving 
religious instruction in schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We remind them that section 41 of the Canadian Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms guarantees parents the right to demand that their children 
receive a religious or moral education according to their beliefs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the Education Act clearly states that Catholics and 
Protestants can both exercise this right, regardless of their numbers. 
Second, the act creates duties and obligations for school organizations 
as regards denominational provisions. Third, the Education Act provides 
that a school board can organize moral or religious instruction for a 
denomination other than Catholic or Protestant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some said that these were not constitutional guarantees, but the 
safeguards provided in section 41 of the charter are 
quasi-constitutional. Quebeckers as a whole are very respectful 
of the choice parents would make as to whether or not they want 
to keep a denominational school, or want religious instruction in 
schools.

carried out democratically with all the tolerance that Quebeckers are 
known for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there are still members in this House who hesitate to support 
the unanimous request by the Quebec National Assembly, I ask them to 
listen to this call coming from all parts of Quebec, from the Magdalen 
Islands to Abitibi, from the Gaspé region to Ungava, from Quebec City, 
Lévis, Granby, Baie-Comeau, Saint-Henri and the greater Montreal area. 
Quebeckers are appealing to you and are asking you to support them in 
their efforts to provide their children with a modern school system that 
is responsive to the realities of modern Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With one voice, in a spirit of openness and pride, let us applaud 
the National Assembly's initiative and join with their institutions in 
providing Quebec with a modern school system that can provide a model 
for today's world.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the amendment we are being asked to 
support is the repeal of subsections 1 to 4 of Section 93 of the 
Constitution Act, 1867. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the beginning, in the National Assembly, the Government of 
Quebec and the Parti Quebecois have taken it upon themselves to include 
in the preamble to their request that they do not recognize the 
Constitution of 1982. It is odd that the Government of Quebec has taken 
such a decision. It is odder still that Bloc Quebecois members have 
taken the same position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is because of section 43 of the Constitution of 1982, which the 
Bloc Quebecois and the Parti Quebecois refuse to accept or to recognize 
as being relevant, that we can now discuss this amendment; in fact, it 
is Section 43 that provides for the right of the province of Quebec, 
with a simple resolution from the National Assembly, to request a 
bilateral constitutional amendment, without the consent of the other 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, subsection 33.1 of the 1982 Constitution, which, 
again, Quebec has not accepted, allows Bill 107 on public education and 
the amendment proposed in Bill 109 to override the unconstitutional 
aspect by using the notwithstanding clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was wondering if the member from Quebec could answer two 
questions. If the English community had not felt that its access to 
linguistic schools was protected under section 23, if the anglophone 
community was not convinced that the 1982 Constitution provided some 
protection, does the member really believe that we would have had such 
a consensus in Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can she admit in this House, just as the Quebec intergovernmental 
affairs minister himself admitted, that one would indeed have to be 
naive to think that the Constitution of 1982 does not apply everywhere 
in the country? Can the member answer these two questions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not think there is 
any justification for trying to use the action taken by the 
National Assembly to offer thinly veiled praise for the unilateral 
patriation in 1982, of which the Prime Minister was one of the main 
architects.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nick Discepola:</B> Thanks to him— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon:</B> You asked me to answer your question, 
sir.  I can tell you, on the subject of the resolution of Quebec's 
National Assembly to not recognize the Constitution of 1982, that 
there is a difference between “to not recognize” and “to be subject 
to”.  We are still part of Canada.  We may not recognize it, but we 
are subject to it.  Let us not mix debates.  I will stop here on 
that matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Your second question on guarantees on teaching in English 
under section 23 was not the one raised in committee.  That 
question concerned section 93. 
Here again, a number of debates are being mixed up.  The subject is 
the suspension of subsections 1 to 4 of section 93, which people do 
not want applied in Quebec.  Section 23 has nothing to do with the 
debate.  It will be debated at some other time, in Quebec and not 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 93 does not guarantee the protection of anglophone 
minorities in Quebec and francophone minorities elsewhere.  The 
member for Bourassa put it very well earlier, when he said that 
section 93 had nothing to do with protecting language rights in 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the sort of debate they wanted to get us involved in, 
but this debate and the committee's mandate concern the repeal of 
subsections 1 to 4 so that denominational school boards may be 
replaced by linguistic school boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope I have answered succinctly, because the member wanted 
to drag me into a much broader debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have some questions I would like the hon. member for 
Quebec to address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the course of her deliberation, and I must say she did a 
good job, she mentioned that all of Quebec, and she named the 
different geographical areas, were all very much in support of 
this resolution.  I do not doubt that it is the majority.  On my 
desk in my office are a number of letters from the Province of 
Quebec wishing that I should speak against this proposal for 
various reasons, so she does not have 100% support.  I have two 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, have you ever considered that, by deleting sections 1 to 
4— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member will please address 
the Chair rather than the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  I am sorry, Mr. Speaker.  If you delete 
sections 1 to 4 from section 93, has the hon. member given any 
consideration to what danger that may create in other provinces 
which are watching this debate extremely close? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know in my province there are three minority boards. They all 
have a petition.  They are all very much concerned about deleting 
sections 1 to 4 from section 93 in the hope that somehow the 
Charter of Rights will protect those things once they are 
extracted.  That is the concern in western Canada.  If the 
Charter of Rights will protect them after they have disappeared, 
why will the Charter of Rights not protect them when it is there? 
My constituents are extremely interested in this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I heard, and I would like the hon. member to address 
this, at least twice in the debate today that somehow there was 
something wrong about religion being taught in school.  I hope I 
am hearing that incorrectly.  In the history of our country we 
have had religion taught in the schools.  Those people who want 
religion in the school should have that right under our 
constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member to address those two questions. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind the 
hon. member of the Reform Party that I never spoke of unanimity; we are 
talking about consensus. In fact, that is the problem we encountered in 
committee, where consensus was sometimes understood to mean unanimous 
consent.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are certainly people who are not pleased with these 
decisions, but the vast majority, or 88% of those who participated in a 
public poll, and those who have young children in particular, said they 
were in favour of greater freedom, especially in Montreal. Such rights 
were granted on very different bases in Montreal and in Quebec City. For 
other regions, it was a matter of dissent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know full well that children from several denominations already 
study in this kind of system. Witnesses have explained the situation and 
how this would not be a problem. 
On the contrary, this is a proposal to open up structures, so that, in 
Montreal, where a sort of rigidity has been observed, the debate can 
focus on school structures, either denominational or linguistic, instead 
of on what place religion should occupy in schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all due respect, I never said, and far be it from me not to 
want religious education to continue in schools, quite the contrary, and 
this is a debate that we will be having in Quebec. I would point out 
that this matter will be debated in Quebec, and the proposed amendment 
is designed to satisfy Quebec's wishes. So, if the same kind of debate 
were held in other parts of Canada, in other provinces, perhaps you 
could examine a variety of possible amendments, that you would approve 
or dismiss as the case may be. In Quebec, however, there is consensus on 
this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry, but the time allowed for questions 
and comments has run out. The hon. parliamentary secretary on a point of 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nick Discepola:</B> I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In responding to two questions, the hon. member for Quebec 
mentioned the hon. member for Bourassa when in fact referring to the 
hon. member for Brossard—La Prairie. It was simply a point of 
clarification. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is in response to the 
widespread interest in this subject, in the constituent power, 
the constitutional amending power not only in Quebec but also in 
other parts of the country, that I rise to speak in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chapter 5 of the Constitution Act of 1982 established, as it was 
intended, an all Canadian base for constitutional amendment in 
place of the pre-existing made-in-Britain style of constitutional 
amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are still working out the precedents or the ground rules 
regarding how that should operate.  Our working out of the ground 
rules is influenced in considerable part by practice and there is 
already some practice, but also rules of good sense and good 
federalism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we are at the point where we can enunciate a principle 
that a request by a province for a constitutional amendment under 
section 43 of the Constitution Act of 1982 that such a request, 
if it does not run counter to the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms, and if it is not the product of a casual or factitious 
majority in a provincial legislature, should normally be honoured 
by the federal parliament as a matter of good federalism, what is 
known in technical terms as the principle of federal comity, la 
courtoisie fédérale, which is an inexact French language 
translation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Newfoundland, we have looked at this issue twice. 
The first time was when the House supported the proposal but it 
was held up in the Senate and the second time when it came again 
but this time after a 73% popular approval by the people of 
Newfoundland, by 47 out of 48 electoral districts, and with 
strong majorities in those sections of Newfoundland that have 
significant religious groups within them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Quebec, we have here a resolution passed by 
unanimous vote of the provincial legislature. 
This is not the first time that this issue has been raised in 
Quebec.  In fact, if I can take members back in history, I 
remember examining this issue professionally a quarter of a 
century ago when the issue was the language in Quebec; the issue 
of an official language, the language of work and the language of 
education.

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will recall that this issue was entrusted to a royal 
commission of the Quebec government, la commission sur la 
situation de la langue française et les droits linguistiques à 
Quebec, which reported in 1972, the Commission Gendron.  One of 
the proposals considered by the commission was simply how to 
apply the issue of language of education having regard in Quebec 
to the existence and operation of section 93 of the then British 
North America Act of 1867, the Constitution Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue raised then was whether it could be done because we 
did not have the 1982 Constitution Act nor these all-Canadian 
self-operating amending machineries.  The suggestion which was 
advanced, which I think is an interesting one, was that it could 
be achieved by ordinary legislation.  That is to say one could 
achieve a system of institutional language based schools in 
replacement of the old system of religious division, and this as 
a matter of ordinary interpretation in section 93. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key is of course in the words of section 93 which are rooted 
in 19th century history and, to some extent of course, in 18th 
century history because that is where these particular provisions 
flowed from, the capitulations of 1759, the Treaty of Paris of 
1763 and the Quebec Act of 1774. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The essence of these provisions, however, is that they do not in 
terms guarantee, or even necessarily in the spirit, the 
continuance for all time of a system of religiously based 
determination of allocation of children to the school system. 
This is a gloss which has emerged in some minds because of a lack 
of reading of the provisions of section 93 and also because of a 
static, mechanical and unimaginative approach to constitutions 
and constitutional interpretation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Constitutions are not fixed once and for all in time as frozen 
cakes of doctrine that cannot stand the test of progressive 
generic interpretation.  Constitutions, as the Privy Council 
reminded us, are living trees that grow with the times.  It was 
on this basis that the issue was examined, whether section 93 
could allow a replacement of a religious based classification and 
allocation of students by a language based one.  I think an 
interesting answer then was, yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this is a different situation now because we have the 
1982 Constitution Act in effect and the 1982 Constitution Act 
allows for amendment of the Constitution under various 
categories.  One of the interesting things here is that we are 
applying section 43 of the 1982 Constitution Act to the amendment 
of section 93 of the Constitution Act of 1867. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The essence of section 43 is that it allows for a bilateral 
process of amendment of the constitution on the initiative of a 
single province and with the concurrence of the federal 
government.  The effect of course of this as a matter of 
constitutional application is that a constitutional amendment so 
adopted is limited in its constitutional force to the particular, 
one might say, consenting province and no more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I think this is a very important point to raise for 
persons in provinces other than Quebec.  There is no consequence 
of the adoption of the proposed amendment here for the school 
situation such as it might be now or in the future in Ontario or 
in British Columbia or in other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Insofar as section 93 is amended by section 43, it is a 
Quebec-only amendment.

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One interesting point in the particular amendment, and why it 
achieves much of what was discussed as a theoretical concept by 
the Gendron commission in the late 1960s and early 1970s, is that 
it leaves open the effectuation of the principles of the 
capitulations of 1759, the Treaty of Paris, the Quebec Act and 
section 93.  It leaves open the issue of effectuation of those 
principles again by other legislative provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the debate on Newfoundland amendment term 17, which is a 
special case in that it is limited to term 17 of the Act of 
Union, 1949, between Newfoundland and Canada, there were some 
interesting exchanges across the House. We should stress that 
often the truth is found in these exchanges.  It is a dialectical 
give and take.  There were two interesting questions from the 
official opposition.  I will simply repeat what was said on that 
occasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike a number of other countries including Great Britain, 
there is no official state religion in Canada.  The system is 
neutral on that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, unlike the United States there is no constitutional 
separation of church and state.  Therefore it is perfectly open 
for any province in Canada to introduce its own system of 
religious instruction or provision of religious facilities in 
school education.  That is a matter for the ordinary political 
processes of each province.  It is limited by the Canadian 
charter of rights, but the Canadian charter is not pre-emptive 
here.  It may be limited by provincial charters of rights as to 
which we would remind ourselves that Quebec has certainly a most 
impressive Quebec provincial charter of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be open within the political processes of any province 
to provide a form of religious instruction.  As is proposed in 
Newfoundland parents may ask for religious instruction, but the 
children or parents may opt out of that religious instruction. 
There is nothing to prevent the introduction of what is called in 
Great Britain and some states in the United States a system of 
state or public aid to so-called charter schools, which could be 
purely private and non-denominational or could be denominational. 
That is a matter for the provincial political processes.  It is 
left open under both the Newfoundland amendment and the Quebec 
amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me come back to the particular issue.  If the approach to 
section 93 had been its removal altogether, it would have 
required clearly 7 out of 10 provincial legislatures to assent to 
it.  Since the Parliament of Canada is being approached under 
section 43 of the Constitution, not section 38(1) which is the 
larger provision I just mentioned, it requires the assent only of 
the Quebec legislature and the Parliament of Canada.  It is very 
clear that the constitutional amendment now proposed is limited 
by virtue of the constitutional amendment route chosen to Quebec 
and the Parliament of Canada so far as it operates in this 
respect in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an approach to constitutional amendment that is limited 
to Quebec, that follows upon the unanimous vote of the Quebec 
legislature and that does not according to ordinary rules of 
interpretation offend the Quebec charter of rights or our own 
constitutional charter of rights.  That is in accord with the 
expressed opinion of Quebec persons who testified before various 
parliamentary groups that it changes a burdensome system of 
administration which is excessively costly and no longer 
corresponds to widespread Quebec views as to classification and 
categorization of students and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Gendron commission had adopted a proposal in 1972 to 
replace the religious based categorization by language based 
categorization, there would have possibly been a situation 
somewhat like the present situation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, in developing French as the language of education in 
Quebec compatibly with rights of minorities, it superimposes a 
very cumbersome system of language approach to education on a 
church based system, an immense proliferation of administrative 
authorities.  The nearest analogy I can find is the Belgian 
approach to the solution of the linguistic problem, which is an 
administrative constitutional nightmare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the basis that this is a request, freely made by the 
legislature of Quebec with a unanimous vote preceding it, an 
issue considered for over more than a quarter of a century in 
Quebec on which a consensus has clearly emerged, there is no 
reason in principle why following good principles of federalism 
the federal Parliament can or should refuse the particular 
request. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view it could have been met by interpretation of section 
93 without an amendment, but since we have the Constitution Act, 
1982, it is proper that it should follow that particular route. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend this to those who have raised the question as to 
whether it will automatically determine solutions that we would 
like to educational problems in our own province.  The answer is 
that it has no implications for that at all.  It is open to the 
political processes within the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My expectation, since Canada is a plural country, is that 
individual provinces will answer differently.  There is 
widespread interest throughout Canada in new, more plural 
approaches to education.  It is very clear the financial burden 
of education is spread unevenly and in many respects unfairly 
over many taxpayers and the correction should come at the 
provincial level.  That is a legitimate issue of concern for 
provincial voters and each province will make its own decision. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, congratulations on your elevation to the chair.  I 
commend the learned and honourable member for his presentation. 
He is a distinguished constitutional authority and an asset to 
this place as such an authority.  I would however take issue with 
some of his conclusions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member suggested the amendment would not create a 
precedent for other provinces.  I agree this will not create a 
legal or constitutional precedent but it will create a political 
precedent.  It is for that reason organizations such as the 
Canadian Catholic School Trustees Association, the Ontario 
Catholic School Trustees Association and dissentient separate 
school boards across the country are opposed to the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What they see is not a legal precedent that affects them 
directly but a dangerous political precedent which they feel will 
affect them in the future, that precedent being the willingness 
of this place to give up its constitutional role to protect 
minority confessional educational rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have several questions for the hon. member in that respect. He 
said the matter had been considered for nearly 30 years in 
Quebec.  Given that virtually every witness before the committee 
agreed the amendment to section 93 is a relatively recent 
proposal, what evidence does he have to support the contention 
that it has been considered for 30 years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does he mean when he says there is now a movement toward 
“new, more plural approaches to education?”  Does he mean by 
that approaches to education which preclude confessional 
education?  Does he mean more secular approaches to education? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given his understanding of constitutional issues, will he admit 
that without the protection of section 93 the charter of rights 
and freedoms will apply in toto to the Quebec education system; 
that given the precedents in the Ontario courts, namely the 
Zylberberg and the Civil Liberties Association cases, the charter 
has been proven to be rather unfriendly to public funding of 
sectarian education; and that without the protection of section 
93 it is likely, as virtually every constitutional expert 
appearing before the joint committee suggested, that Quebec's 
confessional education system as guaranteed in various statutes 
the Quebec charter and the Quebec education act would be found to 
contravene the Canadian charter and would be snuffed out?

Quebeckers still support, by a very large margin? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his thoughtful series of questions.  I could say as to when 
and how this has been discussed I was a member of the commission 
Gendron.  I spent four years hearing representations throughout 
Quebec on the educational system, among other things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were very learned studies.  Since I also taught in Quebec 
over a period of five years including at one French language 
university, it was very much a subject of discussion. Although it 
may appear strange outside Quebec, as something new and 
different, it has been very much a part of Quebec thinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Section 93. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Section 93 has to be considered by any 
commission or any group considering language and education as the 
criterion for allocation of students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second issue the hon. member raised has implications 
essentially for other provinces.  He raised the issue of what I 
referred to as new plural trends in education.  Every province 
obviously is different from the other.  This is one of the nice 
things about Canada today.  I would think that there are more 
indications outside Quebec and outside Ontario of experimentation 
with religion and education and religious based schools.  The 
thing that is becoming interesting is the suggestion that it 
should be accompanied by at least partial funding from state, 
from public authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point was simply that there is nothing in the constitution 
that prevents that.  We do not have the absolute separation of 
church and state that they have in the United States which 
positively prevents that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I taught constitutional law in the United States and it was a 
constitutional absolute, the absolute separation.  It even chased 
out of the American school system voluntary religious classes 
given on the school premises outside school times.  There was a 
series of decisions in the fifties, sixties and seventies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is perhaps a correct judgment by the United States supreme 
court of the American ethos but it is not necessarily applicable 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One issue at the core of the third question of the hon. member 
was the issue of the courts and the constitution.  I would be the 
last to say I am always happy with the development of the 
jurisprudence of courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the charter of rights was adopted I suggested to the then 
prime minister that a logical concomitant of the change to a 
charter based system of constitutional jurisprudence was reform 
of the supreme court.  I and some others recommended 
unsuccessfully the establishment of a special constitutional 
court with the European system of election of judges for a term 
of years.  The European courts have a strong cross-section of 
political and general philosophical opinion on the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it is a necessary consequence of the role of the 
courts today, even under the system that now exists, that they 
apply American jurisprudence.  Mechanically applied, I think 
those would be wrong decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  They are precedents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Precedents can be changed because 
perhaps they have not been argued well enough.  You must not be 
too optimistic about the level of constitutional argument that 
we— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>   The hon. member should address the 
Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would be the last 
person to ignore the Chair consciously and the last person to 
ignore the Chair when it is occupied by its very distinguished 
present incumbent.  You fill the role admirably in a very real 
corporeal sense.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I would encourage the hon. member who has shown that he 
has a litigious attitude in areas other than what we are now 
discussing not to give up hope on the court.  He should try right 
reason, try his arguments and argue the new pluralism and he 
might find he can win.  But it is certainly an incorrect 
application of the Canadian charter to assume that American 
judgments in the area of the charter of freedoms are 
automatically the law of the land here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are a different society.  I would have thought the great 
charm of our society is that we are a plural society.  We have 
rejected the melting pot concept of total assimilation.  We 
encourage diversity.  We try to build co-operation based on those 
integral elements that each culture has and this demands a 
jurisprudence that reflects that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rest optimistic that with future education by this House 
including by the hon. member that the courts will move more in 
this direction.  I do not think they have shown the imagination 
they could have. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the recollections as he went 
historically through what has brought us up to where we are 
today.  I must commend him because I appreciated it.  It was like 
sitting at university again and scribbling down some notes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not here to quarrel with anything said by the hon. 
gentleman.  Historically I believe he is most accurate.  The 
question in my mind is not one of checking the dates but rather 
it is this.  Is there any other way Quebec could receive 
everything that has the obvious support of its majority?  Is 
there any other legal way this could take place without touching 
that part of section 93 of the BNA act?  If there were a way, if 
the charter could do it, for the sake of the rest of the 
provinces I would encourage the member with his wisdom, knowledge 
and background to lend more support to that.  Let us not tear 
away at something the rest of the provinces feel is valuable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned, it would 
have been possible in 1968 and 1970—before 1982—to try to reach 
the same result by interpretation to demonstrate that the 
particular measure proposed is compatible as legislation with 
section 93 as fairly read in its general intent and purpose.  But 
once you replace the old British style of constitution amending 
process by the charter of rights, the ordinary principles of 
federalism say that you follow that route. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can reassure the hon. member on this point.  I have made a 
point in my interventions on the Newfoundland school issue and on 
this issue today of stating that this is an amendment limited to 
Quebec and that in voting on this issue I do so on the basis that 
it is limited to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member may ask me what the relevance of that is.  A 
constitutional interpretation by courts, the decisions of 
Parliament, the travaux préparatoires, carry their own authority. 
If the member himself or other members would like to indicate 
that in voting on this issue their vote is given on the basis 
that this is an amendment that applies to Quebec and only Quebec, 
that itself carries heavy artillery with it.  It is something 
that in my view a court would be unwise to try to overrule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as other provinces are concerned, my recommendation to 
them is to fight it out within the new political processes.  There 
is no reason why British Columbia should have an identical rule 
to Quebec or Ontario, or Alberta to British Columbia.  It is a 
matter for the political processes.  There are no constitutional 
barriers other than the charter of rights which on this issue is 
not pre-emptive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interesting thing I cited for the last hon. member who 
questioned me is there is a mood for re-examination of education. 
There is a feeling that too much uniformity or a monolithic 
approach to education is not the best thing for suiting our 
children for the next century.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the new pluralism, the new ways, including the 
possibility of public aid, partial at least to new schools trying 
new approaches, would include religious schools.  This is very 
much a matter that individual provinces can and should be able to 
reach within ordinary political processes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the hon. member and others that if this is your view, 
indicate that you wish your vote on this to be an issue limited 
to a constitutional amendment affecting Quebec just, as more 
strictly, for the one in Newfoundland.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to have this opportunity to speak on this motion to 
amend section 93 of the Constitution Act, 1867 concerning the 
Quebec school system.  I feel, however, that amendment is 
understating the issue.  It is in fact an extinguishment of 
sections 93, 1 to 4, for Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a freshman member of Parliament, a member of the class of 
'97, I am particularly honoured to be speaking on such an 
important subject as amending the Canadian constitution.  Such 
weighty matters have a tendency to give members of Parliament an 
exaggerated sense of their own importance.  They can start to see 
themselves in terms of their own place in history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amending the constitution is a serious exercise, one that should 
not be done lightly or in haste.  In Canada it is something not 
done with ease.  It took Canada 115 years to bring home the 
British North America Act and create a Canadian constitution that 
could be amended at home.  Lest we forget, the clock is still 
running on its ratification by the province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are in 1997, 130 years since Confederation, and the 
process has still not been completed.  That is not such a bad 
thing.  There are countries in the world which have gone through 
a dozen constitutions in the same amount of time.  They tend to 
be places where such documents are often not worth the paper on 
which they are printed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada our constitutional process seems to move at a pace 
that we could describe as glacial.  We have a document of which 
we all can be proud, a statement of our individual and collective 
rights and responsibilities.  It represents a careful balancing 
of individual rights and collective responsibility to protect the 
rights of minorities.  As such it is an important part of our 
identity as a caring and compassionate people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have good reason to be concerned when the government of the 
day pulls out all the stops to accelerate the constitutional 
process.  I have good reason to be uncomfortable when the 
amendment in question is being proposed by a provincial 
government that has not ratified the constitution.  I have good 
reason to seek greater clarity on the process when there are 
legitimate questions being asked about the legality of the 
amending process being used.  I have good reason to listen 
carefully to thousands of Quebeckers who asked us not to ratify 
the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are times when the glacial pace of constitutional change 
makes sense.  I find it worrisome that the Liberal members of the 
special joint committee from the other place, who are required to 
provide sober second thought, would be in such a hurry.  As a 
member of the special joint committee, I have listened closely to 
the witnesses who have appeared before the committee.  I have 
considered carefully the opinions and views they have expressed 
and those expressed by the hundreds of people who have written 
letters and signed petitions on the subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not persuaded that this amendment must be ratified now. Let 
me give my reasons.  They stem from a simple test consisting of 
three questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, does the constitutional amendment have the democratic 
agreement of the people?  Second, does it conform to the rule of 
the law?  Third, are the rights of minorities protected? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the first the answer is quite clear.  There has been no 
public consultation in Quebec.  In contrast to Newfoundland, 
which is also pursuing constitutional reform with regard to its 
educational system, there has been no referendum.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unanimous consent to a request for the school board amendment by 
the Quebec national assembly does not in turn reflect unanimous 
consent by the people of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hundreds and thousands of Quebeckers who signed petitions 
opposing this amendment are proof of that.  I cite as an example 
the petition of the coalition for denominational schools, a 
petition signed by 235,000 people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is shameful that some members of the government have been 
questioning the validity of this petition.  The people of Quebec 
who signed this petition cannot be ignored because they 
demonstrate that there is no consensus in Quebec for an amendment 
to section 93 of the 1967 constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solution to this is reasonably straightforward.  The 
Government of Quebec must do a better job consulting with the 
people of Quebec.  It has a model to study in Newfoundland. 
It needs to present clearly the implications of the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not doubt that greater understanding would reduce the 
level of distrust and fear.  Among other avenues, the Government 
of Quebec could have had its ministers involved in the process 
earlier rather than relying on quiet passage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer to the second question of whether it conforms to the 
rule of law is less straightforward.  The committee should be 
certain that what is being proposed respects the rule of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we using the appropriate amending formula? The Government of 
Canada and some legal scholars say yes.  Other voices have 
challenged the bilateral process.  The committee should not be 
expected to decide this question in haste under an artificial 
deadline.  I would like to point out that the ink is not even dry 
on this motion and I have been made aware of a court challenge 
already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This court challenge asserts that the legislature of Quebec and 
the Parliament of Canada do not have the authority, acting 
pursuant to the bilateral amendment procedure foreseen by section 
43 of the Constitution Act, 1982, to proceed to amend section 93 
of the Constitution Act, 1867 by repealing subsections 93(1) to 
(4) as they apply to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners assert that they have persons directly concerned 
by the repeal of section 93 and invoke their individual right to 
and interest in the integrity of the process to amend section 93 
of the Constitution Act, 1867. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A court decision could settle the legal issue.  Without such a 
decision, the committee should at least have received a full 
legal brief on the issue so it could consider the matter in the 
light of the best legal advice available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer to the third question is crucial.  The question of 
minority rights has been at the soul of Canada for its entire 
history and the rights of minorities to control their own 
education have been established in province after province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How well a country protects its citizens from the tyranny of the 
majority is a measure of its democracy.  I think we all can be 
proud of how far we have progressed since the Manitoba schools 
debate of 100 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the dividing line is language, emotions tend to run high. 
This is one reason why the protections in the constitution are so 
clear about the education rights of linguistic minorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, this brings to mind one concern.  It is not clear 
that the Government of Quebec believes section 23 to be in force 
in that province, as that province has not ratified the 
constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This puts a much greater burden of proof on those who want to 
fast track this amendment but, to add to this burden, it is not 
just linguistic minority rights that are in question, it is 
religious minority rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Quebec wants an amendment to Canada's 
constitution so that Quebec can rearrange its school board system 
from one based on religious denomination to one based on 
language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although there does seem to be a consensus for linguistic school 
boards, there is equally a strong voice contending that rights to 
have religious schools would be violated with the abolition of 
the denominational school provisions in section 93.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec wants to change the school board structure next year once 
the existing guarantees for Protestant and Catholic boards in 
Montreal and Quebec City are removed.  Many people would agree 
that boards organized along denominational lines may not make a 
lot of sense.  They only need to look a little farther west to 
the province of Ontario to see a system where boards organized 
along both linguistic and denominational lines seem to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not strange how much more sense things make the farther 
west we go? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The guarantees provided are far from perfect, but unless they 
are replaced by some other form of constitutional protection 
removing them would erode the education rights of the English 
speaking minority.  The move to linguistic boards should not be 
used to weaken minority rights.  Does the amendment risk leaving 
Quebec's English minority with less protection than it has now? I 
think it does and I am not alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To sum up, I asked three questions.  I was hoping for three yes 
answers but I received two noes and a maybe.  It was hardly a 
passing grade.  Let me be more generous and propose an easier 
question.  What harm would be done if the amendment were not 
passed by the House today?  We all know the answer.  None.  The 
children of Quebec would still receive an education.  The 
circumstances that have prevailed for 130 years would prevail a 
few more and the sky would not fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About the worst thing that can be said about the clause in 
section 93 is that it is anachronistic and inconvenient.  It is 
unfortunate the constitutional chess game and the government's 
strategy of appeasement will continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be clear.  Returning the process of constitutional change 
to its normal pace does not mean that change is not possible. Let 
me make it clear that the Reform Party supports the appropriate 
use of the amending formula if it is supported by an expression 
of the will of the people.  The constitutional process has to 
come out of the back rooms and the realm of the power brokers and 
deal makers.  Surely we learned this from Meech and 
Charlottetown.  There is nothing stopping a reconsideration of 
the amendment in a few months time under only slightly different 
conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me suggest the following to the Government of Quebec to 
improve its chances next time around.  It can consult its 
citizens.  It can hold a referendum with a clearly worded 
question.  It can state clearly in writing that minority 
protections of section 23 are in place.  May I suggest that the 
easiest way of doing that would be to ratify the Constitution of 
Canada.

<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I have, as you can imagine, listened carefully to the speech by the 
hon. colleague from the Reform Party.  I can see, without any ill 
will, that our colleague is obviously very ignorant of the Quebec 
reality.  It would have been interesting if he had been able to 
come in person for a visit to Quebec, because the understanding he 
has could be compared to a Flintstone style of understanding, that 
is to say a pretty basic one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have three pieces of information I want to give him.  The 
first is that the hon. colleague should know that the debate in 
Quebec is a longstanding one, not a recent development but one that 
goes back to the early 1960s. 
In other words, when he was still quite young, the debate was 
already going on in Quebec on the necessity to reorganize the 
school system on a linguistic basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to refer to the parliamentary aspect, and I hope 
he will reply to me on this.  In Quebec there was a parliamentary 
committee similar to the one in which we MPs and senators have been 
involved on the joint committee, and it was focussed on the very 
subject of creating linguistic school boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member wants to count heads, he can look at the 
list I have already tabled at the parliamentary committee. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1705"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the groups that voiced their opinions on Bill 109 which, as you 
know, only dealt with the establishment of linguistic school boards, 
also came to Ottawa to be heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, my first comment is that the hon. member should be much 
more careful when he is suggesting that no consultations took place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I realize the hon. member is a new member here, but it 
takes some nerve to say he is worried about guarantees for the minority. 
So, the hon. member, whose party is the only one in this House with no 
members from Quebec—and this will not change in the foreseeable 
future—is worried about how Quebec's English-speaking minority is 
treated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should remind the hon. member that, in Quebec, it is possible 
for anglophones to go to English schools from kindergarten to 
university, to have access to education services in English, to have 
control over their own mass media—newspapers, radio, television—and 
to have access to health services in English. Myself and all Bloc 
Quebecois members would not have it any other way. The hon. member 
should be pleased to see how Quebec has so generously, and for so many 
years, been treating its English-speaking minority. 
And it will continue to do so. No Bloc Quebecois member thinks it should 
be otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that no one is in favour of the status quo. I ask the 
hon. member this: Why, as we are about to enter the new millennium, 
should we specifically provide preferential treatment for Catholics and 
Protestants? I agree that it is positive discrimination, but it is still 
discriminatory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the extent that we are a law-abiding society—and the hon. 
member alluded to this several times—we have two charters: the 
Canadian charter and the Quebec charter. Both of them include the right 
to freedom of religion. While in 1867 Quebec was a relatively monolithic 
society as regards religion, it is no longer the case now. 
There are 108 cultural communities in Montreal which profess 
religions other than Catholicism or Protestantism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By passing the resolution—and I hope it will be passed 
despite the Reform Party's opposition—we will pave the way for 
greater pluralism in the public forum that schools represent.  I 
therefore ask the member why this kind of discrimination he is 
urging us to perpetuate should be maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I ask him if he will agree that the treatment of the 
anglophone minority in Quebec is exemplary, that we are giving him 
every guarantee that as far as we are concerned, as members of the 
Bloc Quebecois, we wish this to continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge him to be extremely careful when he talks of the 
petition, because that is not what the majority of Quebeckers want. 
This is what the polls and consultations show and I would remind 
the member that we have been discussing this issue since 1963.  The 
member would do well to improve his knowledge of Quebec, and I 
would be pleased to serve as his guide, perhaps even his spiritual 
guide, whenever he would like to meet with concerned groups.  It 
would be my great pleasure to show him the situation in Quebec, 
because I regret to say that his understanding is based on 
stereotypes. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring:</B>  Madam Speaker, I will answer a couple 
of the hon. member's concerns.  Flintstone, maybe, but I believe 
one thing that has not been addressed quite properly is that the 
request to amend the constitution is really an extinguishment of 
sections 1 to 4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having been in the construction industry for years I always 
believed that we should build on to our constitution, moulding 
and improving it, not ripping it down. 
That is the direction that should be taken.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly sections 1 to 4 need some improvement to better 
represent today's society in Quebec and in other parts of Canada, 
but I do not believe the way to do that is by extinguishing it 
and removing it for all time.  I believe we can make those 
improvements to the constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me speak to the consensus reached at the meetings.  One 
group represented two million people and there were eight more 
groups represented in the two million people.  They are also 
individually represented in the group.  Out of 60 groups 
represented, eight of them were contained in the one group which 
represented two million people.  When I questioned one of the 
groups which represented some 180,000 members on whether it had 
polled its membership the answer was no.  Clearly some of these 
groups which were claiming to represent their members were 
representing themselves.  They had not polled their members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree the question of reform in the education system has been 
going on for 30 years, but there has not been a discussion about 
removing section 93 to do it.  There has been a discussion on 
reforming the education system along linguistic lines.  There has 
not been a discussion of extinguishing sections 1 to 4 of the 
constitution.  That has been a very recent phenomenon.  It is not 
well understood by a large number of Quebeckers that the intent 
of the motion is to remove these rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is consensus for reforming the school system along 
linguistic lines, but I do not believe there is consensus for the 
method proposed, which is to extinguish the constitution to get 
to that end.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, my 
question is for my colleague in the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They keep making comments and I simply cannot wait to rise and 
make certain comments and ask questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I take discussion of a matter such as this seriously. 
The Reform Party is suggesting that it is the separatists who want 
this.  I find this a bit offensive.  Does this mean the bishops of 
Quebec are separatists?  Does this mean that priests or Pentecostal 
pastors are separatists as well? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that there is consensus among religions, and it must 
not be forgotten that this was a minority of minorities.  The 
Anglican religion, or those religions, were in agreement.  So 
perhaps it was their minority that was against. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would just like to ask him this question: Is the Reform 
Party not afraid of a referendum when it comes to minorities?  What 
would happen if there were a referendum in Quebec on the school 
issue and 80% of people wanted a change, but a 20% minority did 
not?  Would they go along with the 20%? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring:</B>  Madam Speaker, in answer to the hon. 
member's question I want to raise another group named as somewhat 
supporting the motion, Alliance Quebec.  When Alliance Quebec was 
questioned about it, it was clearly against the extinguishment of 
the constitutional provisions.  It was in favour of reforming 
schools along linguistic lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the consensus in Quebec.  There is no doubt about it. 
There is no question that in Quebec there is a strong consensus 
to reform the educational system along linguistic school lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One group the committee heard from had a membership of 235,000 
French Catholics who were against it.  Some 50% of the number of 
applicants on the application were against school reform by 
extinguishing the constitution.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, there is strong feeling that there is not full 
consensus for proceeding in that manner.  When I see the 
signatures of 235,000 people I really have a feeling that 
perhaps the people of Quebec should be asked this question 
directly, not through their associations. 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
this is a debate on a complex issue for those of us who have not 
had the benefit of 30 years of debate in Quebec.  I must admit 
that for the first time since my election in 1993, I am at a 
point in the debate, this close to a vote, and I really do not 
know yet whether I am in the yea or nay position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would just like to clarify an impression that has been coming 
from the last few speakers, that the Reform Party is opposed to 
this. That is not actually correct.  The decision has been made 
by our caucus that we will be voting the way we determine to be 
the best option.  As a consequence, this has become one of the 
most interesting debates in the House in the last four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have paid a lot of attention to the speakers today and there 
are a lot of reasons for my indecision.  I would just like to go 
through them.  The first speaker today for Reform actually 
presented a very good argument in favour of the change and made 
it quite clear that he would be voting for this.  Later in the 
day there were some very good arguments against that from other 
colleagues in the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, for me there are several key issues here. The first one 
is the issue of provincial responsibility.  The text of section 
93 begins: “In and for each province the legislature may 
exclusively make laws in relation to education”.  When I look at 
Reform policy on this issue, it is very clear. Reform policy 
states clearly that we believe that the provinces should have 
more powers and we support very strongly the idea that education 
should be a domain of the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To me that is a point that is very much in favour of supporting 
this amendment because I have no business as a federal legislator 
interfering in the business of the province.  It is my feeling 
that if there are problems at the provincial level which need 
addressing, it is up to the people of the province to deal with 
that with their own government, to have marches in the streets, 
to have the protests, to take the court challenges.  As my 
colleague has mentioned, there is already a court challenge under 
way.  That is the responsibility of the people to challenge the 
government closest to them.  To me that is a very powerful 
argument in favour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second is one against. Reform policy says that for changes that 
affect the fabric of our society, things that are major changes, 
we truly believe they should be subjected to the democratic 
process of referendum.  Members may know that I am the direct 
democracy critic for the Reform Party and I therefore take a lot 
of interest in these issues and study the direct democracy 
questions.  I am a firm believer in this.  I would feel a lot 
more comfortable if the situation had been, indeed, submitted to 
a referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I spoke with the member for Portneuf for a short time 
and had an interesting discussion with him about this whole 
situation. He mentioned something that I had not realized.  It is 
that section 93 really applies only to Montreal and Quebec City. 
This answered a question that I had as to why I was not receiving 
any letters from people in Quebec.  If there was this tremendous 
objection to what was going on, why was I not being bombarded 
with letters such as I got from Newfoundland about the situation 
there?  I was really puzzled by this.  It was clarified for me by 
the member for Portneuf because he explained that the people 
outside of Montreal and Quebec City are covered under the 
provincial legislation and do very well, thank you.  In fact, in 
his riding which is predominantly Catholic, very close to 100%, 
there is still a Protestant school there which is protected by 
provincial legislation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even my colleague from Edmonton East conceded that perhaps the 
provincial legislation is a better model but his concern is that 
is not entrenched in a constitutional form and therefore is 
subject to possible change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Portneuf in my discussion with him says that 
this has been around since 1867, so we have to have some faith 
that it will be there.  Again, that brings us back full circle 
again to this argument about provincial involvement and whether 
or not the people of the province should have to deal with that 
issue with their own provincial government and that we should 
not be interfering in that aspect of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, I appreciated the eloquent arguments from 
members of my own side.  The member for Calgary Southeast made 
wonderfully eloquent arguments, but I have also appreciated the 
eloquence from some members of the Bloc on this issue.  I could 
hear the frustration also in their voices as they were frustrated 
to hear that some Reform members were speaking in opposition to 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that what I am saying is helping to clarify why some are 
against and some are for without getting too emotionally involved 
in this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, my colleague from Edmonton East revealed that 
there is a court challenge already under way for what is 
happening here and I am very supportive of that.  As I said, the 
people of the province should be involved in dealing with this if 
they feel they have been wronged.  At the moment the evidence to 
me as a member of Parliament is that the majority do not feel 
they have been wronged.  I have the confidence that if it were to 
go to a referendum it would pass handily based on the information 
I have gathered this afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A member from the NDP made the point that this change is 
affecting the minorities.  I think that seems to be what is 
happening here and the larger part of the minority if we can call 
it that is actually quite happy with the changes that are being 
proposed.  It is kind of ironic in a way, though, that we find 
ourselves in this position that the Reform Party is doing all the 
arguments in favour of minorities when we have always been 
labelled as this anti-minority party and we are the only ones who 
are arguing that way in this debate, which is quite interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding that fact I think that may be the wrong 
approach.  I have said over and over that at the provincial level 
that should be resolved, not in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My tendency is to lean toward voting for this amendment but I 
will listen to the remaining debates before we actually get to 
the vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only other point that I did want to mention here is that in 
the minister's speech in October on this issue he mentioned that 
he felt there was good consensus.  Actually I was a bit disturbed 
by his words because it was not very firm.  It was more that he 
feels that there is probably consensus.  I do not have his exact 
words in front of me.  That disturbed me a bit at the time.  But 
in light of other discussions that I have had today, as I 
mentioned, I think it probably would pass in a referendum.  I 
look forward to having that clarified perhaps by subsequent 
speakers who come from the Quebec area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess that is all I have to say on the issue.  I will listen 
with interest to the rest of the debate and hopefully will have 
made up my mind by tomorrow.  I certainly never abstained from a 
vote in this House and I hate to think that I would be put in 
that position by the time the vote comes tomorrow afternoon.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I was almost angered by what the hon. 
member for Edmonton East had to say despite the fact that he has been on 
the joint committee with us for two full weeks. I was surprised, because 
I finally understood why the Reform Party is not comfortable with the 
amendment. It still confuses minority language rights with the amendment 
to clause 93 of the Constitution on which we will vote tomorrow and 
which concerns only denominational rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers seem to give much weight to a petition signed by 235,000 
people. 
I even asked in committee how many persons on that petition were from 
Quebec. I could not get an answer. Nonetheless they exclude all 
alternative measures.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that there has been a debate going on for 30 years in 
Quebec does not strike them. The fact that Anglican and Catholic bishops 
supported the resolution has no effect on them. Even the fact that there 
was a unanimous vote at the National Assembly, where we find 
democratically elected members, does not trouble them. Since they seem 
so difficult to convince, I will try one last time to remind the Reform 
Party members what we will be asked to vote on tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They must know that clause 93 of the Constitution Act, 1867 does 
not in any way protect school board structures as such. Clause 93 does 
not protect language rights either. It protects access to denominational 
schools. Minority language rights are not protected under clause 93. 
They are protected by other sections in the Constitution, more 
particularly section 23. Section 93 does not protect the right of 
minorities to manage their schools and school boards, religion education 
in schools, or even Protestant and Catholic schools. Is that clear 
enough now? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The right to levy taxes through school boards on Montreal Island, 
for example, or to have a say on the curriculum is not protected either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 93 guarantees only two things: the right of dissent for the 
Catholic or Protestant minority and certain rights for Protestant and 
Catholic minorities, as the previous speaker clearly explained, not on 
Montreal Island, but in the city of Montreal and in Quebec City. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform members are suggesting that, if a referendum had been held, 
they may have been able to go along. But their support now depends on a 
petition signed by 235,000 people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the hon. member a question concerning the 
holding of a referendum on this issue. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How would that help him as a member of Parliament to better 
determine whether there is a consensus?  What would he use? 
Would it be like his leader during the 1995 referendum with 50% 
plus 1?  What factor is he going to use?  The debate here is not 
on trying to establish that 78% of the people are in favour.  The 
debate here is to ensure the majority of the minority affected is 
well represented and has given its consent.  I think that has 
been demonstrated time and time again.  How will the holding of a 
referendum notwithstanding its costs help to ensure the member's 
making his decision? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  Madam Speaker, I recognize the member 
would have preferred to have addressed his question to my 
colleague, and so I will make a suggestion in that regard in a 
moment. First I will address the question of referendums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Referendums cost money of course.  There is a cost to democracy. 
It is a matter of how much cost we are willing to accept in 
order to have democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the specific issue of what percentage should be accepted in a 
referendum, that is established before the question is put.  For 
me to give a broad brush answer that it should be 50% plus 1 
would not be fair.  It depends on the issue and the agreement 
beforehand as to what would be an appropriate percentage.  There 
are different rules depending on what is perceived by society to 
be the seriousness of the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I recognize that the majority of the content of the hon. 
member's question was really for my colleague, I would like to 
ask the unanimous consent of the House to allow my colleague to 
answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Does the member have 
the unanimous consent of the House to proceed in such a way? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NPD):</B> Madam Speaker, if my 
colleague from the Reform Party changes his vote only because I rose in 
this House, I will do so a lot more often. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I have been trying to say is that we have a problem with a 
referendum. Whatever the percentage in favour of a change, be it 51%, 
52% or even 60% or 80%, will they side with the 80% majority who want 
the change or with the 20% minority who are opposed? That is what I was 
driving at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were talking about minorities a minute ago. When the 
Constitution was adopted in 1867, Protestants were a minority. 
I was on the committee that studied school reform to make 
schools non-denominational. I did not receive any letters from 
the bishops of Quebec saying that they were concerned about 
changes to section 93. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not receive any letters from Protestant leaders either, even 
though, being on the committee, I was close to the situation. This issue 
did not arise only three weeks ago. It was debated in the National 
Assembly in April 1997 by the PQ government and the Liberal opposition. 
I think it was the best time for a party to score political points. But 
even the Liberal opposition was in favour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I was saying earlier that people must be careful when 
they say that it is the separatists who want this change. I think there 
is a consensus among Quebeckers on this issue. 
We are adding fuel to the fire if, every time Quebeckers make a request, 
we are unwilling to listen and unable to work with them only because 
they are separatists. We are suggesting to them that they do not need to 
stay in Canada since they cannot be heard anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I may have a problem with separatists, but it is my problem. Every 
time Quebeckers ask something of us, I think it is wrong to pin the 
separatist label on them, especially when we see that there is a 
consensus among bishops, parents, school boards and all the people of 
Quebec on this issue. There may not have been public hearings just 
before the change, but there was a consensus in most groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So I think we must be careful with this. This is a warning. We must 
also be careful with what we say in this House. 
If we want to keep Quebec in Canada, we must treat it with respect. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I must apologize to the hon. 
member because I did not realize I was still on questions and 
answers.  I was having a discussion about the petition with my 
colleague.  I caught the end of the comments and I will do my 
best to respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say first of all, although he is mentioning that 
it is being portrayed that the separatists want this, it is 
certainly not what I have felt or portrayed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very obvious that the opposition voted with the government 
in Quebec City unanimously.  It is obvious then that there is a 
very high level of consent and it certainly gives a high comfort 
level for the result there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly I would never say that it is something the separatists 
want, however I would just like to make the point here that I am 
sorry that members did not allow my colleague to answer the last 
question because I believe the quality of the debate would have 
been improved by allowing more of the interaction that was going 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member wishes to speak to me afterward, that is 
fine.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to bring forward some concerns I have about this 
resolution.  With this resolution Parliament has been asked to 
amend the constitution in order to eliminate rights that have 
been expressly guaranteed in the constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since this is a resolution that deals with denominational or 
confessional rights, Parliament has an even greater role to play 
because of the existing wording of the constitution.  Parliament 
has, according to sections 93(3) and 93(4), a guardian kind of 
role to play in the protection of minority denominational rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament is the guarantor of minority denominational rights 
and the guarantor of denominational education rights.  We have an 
awesome responsibility when we are asked to extinguish those 
rights.  Yet we are being asked to expropriate without 
compensation the rights enjoyed by certain Quebeckers.  I am 
concerned that we are not taking seriously our constitutionally 
mandated role as a guarantor of denominational education rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much of the debate surrounding this resolution has assumed that 
Parliament can pass a resolution because it complies with the 
requirements of the amending provisions of the constitution, in 
particular section 43 of the Constitution Act, 1982.  This is not 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must first ask ourselves, as guarantor of denominational 
education rights, if this resolution affects or diminishes a 
right that we are obligated to protect.  Furthermore, where  a 
legislature or Parliament seeks to amend the constitution to 
eliminate expressly guaranteed minority rights, I would submit 
that mere compliance with the formal requirements of the amending 
formula is insufficient.  Any such amendment must also satisfy a 
constitutional convention that prevents the alteration of 
expressly guaranteed constitutional minority rights without the 
consent of the affected minority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This House should recall the political and legal events which 
preceded the passage of the Constitution Act of 1982.  On October 
2, 1980 the federal government proposed presenting to Her Majesty 
the Queen in right of the United Kingdom a resolution to patriate 
the Canadian constitution.  Eight of the provinces opposed this 
unilateral action by Parliament on the basis that the patriation 
resolution would affect provincial powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several provinces submitted references to their courts of appeal 
on the question as to whether Parliament could seek the amendment 
of the constitution without the consent of the provinces.  The 
Supreme Court of Canada ultimately considered the provincial 
references and in 1981 released its decision.  The court held 
that although as a matter of law the agreement of the provinces 
was not required for amendments to the Constitution of Canada, 
the court decided there existed the constitutional convention 
that Parliament would not seek to amend the constitution 
affecting provincial powers without first obtaining the agreement 
of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of this decision the federal government commenced a 
series of constitutional consultations which culminated in the 
agreement of nine of the provinces to what we now know as the 
Constitution Act, 1982. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a constitutional convention exists in the case of amendments 
which affect provincial powers, it has been suggested to the 
joint committee by the Catholic Civil Rights League that a 
constitutional convention exists in the case of an amendment to 
the constitution which would eliminate expressly guaranteed 
minority rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the history of our constitution displays a commitment to 
the preservation and expansion of denominational minority rights, 
not their elimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Professor Peter Hogg, a renowned constitutional scholar, has 
described section 93 of the Constitution Act, 1987 as a small 
bill of rights for the protection of minority religious groups. 
When the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms was enacted in 
1982, a special section, section 92, was included to ensure that 
the charter did not derogate from constitutionally guaranteed 
denominational schools rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, Canadian constitutional history has not witnessed an 
amendment which eliminated constitutionally protected minority 
rights.  On the contrary, the enactment of the charter in 1982 
was thought to herald an era of increased protection of minority 
rights.  The government has acknowledged the existence of this 
constitutional convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In introducing this resolution, the government stressed that 
Parliament must satisfy itself that a consensus exists among the 
affected parties in Quebec in favour of repealing the protections 
contained in sections 93(1) to (4) of the Constitution Act of 
1867. In other words, those prejudicially affected by the 
resolution must consent to its passage.  It should be clear to 
this House that the persons who will be prejudicially affected by 
a repeal of the protections guaranteed in Quebec under section 93 
are the parents who send their children to denominational 
schools.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many months, associations of Quebec parents have voiced 
their rigorous opposition to the resolution.  The requirements of 
the constitutional convention that the consent of the affected 
minority be obtained has not been satisfied.  It is not enough to 
point to the support for the resolution from some unions, school 
board organizations or clerical groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rights guaranteed under section 93 are the rights of the 
parents and the parents have not been consulted by the Quebec or 
federal governments, nor has their consent been secured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind Parliament of the constitutional history of 
minority rights in Canada and to recommend that Parliament not 
pass the resolution.  To do so would run counter to our 
constitutional convention that minority rights cannot be 
restricted by amendment unless the proper governmental parties 
obtain the agreement of the affected minority groups and would 
run counter to our responsibility to protect denominational 
school rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Minority rights enshrined in the Constitution should not be 
subject to limitation or elimination by a majority, otherwise the 
constitution affords no meaningful protection for minority 
rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The preamble to our charter of rights and freedoms identifies 
one of the two fundamental principles of our country as the rule 
of law.  Where a majority can abrogate constitutional rights 
expressly granted to minority groups, the rule of law no longer 
operates but has been replaced by the simple naked rule of the 
will of the majority.  For this fundamental reason this House 
should not pass the resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the Government of Quebec has not demonstrated any 
legislative necessity for the proposed constitutional amendment. 
Section 1 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms stresses 
that a legislature cannot violate charter guaranteed rights 
unless it can demonstrate that the violation is reasonably 
justifiable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely where a legislature seeks a constitutional amendment to 
eliminate minority rights, the legislature must clearly show that 
it cannot achieve a pressing and substantial legislative 
objective without eliminating minority rights.  In this case, the 
province of Quebec has not demonstrated that the repeal of 
section 93 rights is necessary to achieve its objective of 
restructuring its school boards without eliminating confessional 
dissension guarantees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Parliament should not agree to repeal constitutionally 
guaranteed minority rights where the highest court in the land 
has shown how a provincial government can pursue its legislative 
objective without requiring any constitutional amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to establishing dangerous precedents regarding the 
erosion or elimination of rights expressly guaranteed in our 
constitution, I think that passage of the resolution will have 
serious, long term effects on the ability of parents to secure an 
education for their children in accordance with their religious 
beliefs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the Quebec government has given assurances that it will 
maintain some confessional schools in the province, prior court 
decisions under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
clearly show that such confessional schools will collapse under 
the first charter challenge brought against them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Decisions under the charter have made it clear that neither 
religious observances nor religious education are permitted in 
publicly funded schools unless those schools are protected by 
section 93 of the Constitution Act, 1867. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Supreme Court of Canada has recognized the right of parents 
to educate their children according to their beliefs as an 
integral element of the guarantee of freedom of religion 
contained in section 2(a) of the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Richard B. case, Mr. Justice LaForest, speaking for the 
majority, stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that the right of parents to rear their children 
according to their religious beliefs is an equally fundamental 
aspect of freedom of religion. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court went on to hold: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That constitutional freedom includes the right to educate and 
rear their child in the tenets of their faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In effect, until the child reaches an age where she can make an 
independent decision regarding her own religious beliefs, her 
parents may decide on her religion for her and raise her in 
accordance with that religion.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and 
Fundamental Freedoms, one of the sources of our charter of 
rights and freedoms, states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No person shall be denied the right of education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the exercise of any function which it assumes in relation to 
education and to teaching the State shall respect the right of 
parents to ensure that such education and teaching in conformity 
with their own religious and philosophical convictions. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many parents seek to educate their children in accordance with 
their religion by sending their children to private or 
independent schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1986 Jones case decision the Supreme Court of Canada 
strongly suggested that if a province's education legislation did 
not permit parents to send their children to religious private 
schools, then the legislation would infringe on the parents' 
freedom of religion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if a province can secure a constitutional amendment 
which eliminates expressly guaranteed denominational education 
rights, what obligation would a province have to parents of 
different faiths to allow them to educate their children in 
private religious schools? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer to this question is clear.  I therefore have grave 
concerns that the passage of this resolution would create a 
climate in which provinces can act more readily to restrict the 
ability of parents to raise and educate their children in 
accordance with their religious beliefs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This resolution marks the first time in Canadian history that 
Parliament has been asked to amend the constitution in order to 
eliminate rights which have been expressly guaranteed in the 
constitution.  Because of that it is very important that 
Parliament formulate a very clear test which it will apply to 
determine whether it should accept the resolution before it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since this is a resolution that deals with denominational 
rights, Parliament has an even greater role to play because of 
the existing wording of the constitution.  Sections 93(3) and 
93(4) indicate that Parliament has a guardian role to play in the 
protection of minority denominational rights.  Parliament is the 
guarantor of minority denominational rights.  As guarantor it has 
an awesome responsibility when asked to extinguish those rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that the consent or the consensus be from 
those whose rights are affected.  The people whose rights are 
affected when dealing with section 93(1) in Quebec are the 
parents who are part of that class of protected persons who have 
the opportunity under the current constitution to gain 
confessional education for their children.  That is the group to 
which I submit this House should look in determining whether a 
consensus exists. The parents are the holders of the right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would recommend to the House that any proposed constitutional 
amendment should impair the guaranteed constitutional rights only 
to the minimum extent required to achieve the legislative 
objective.  There is no novelty in this test.  The Supreme Court 
of Canada has formulated the minimal impairment test to use 
whenever it analyses whether legislation infringes on rights 
guaranteed under the charter.  This House should insist on a 
similar demonstration of minimal impairment where a resolution to 
amend the constitution will infringe on rights guaranteed by the 
constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point is what will the impact of the passage of this 
resolution be on denominational or confessional schools in 
Quebec.  Some have suggested that confessional schools legally 
can exist without the need for protection under section 93(1). 
With all due respect to those who advance that idea, it is my 
submission that this suggestion is without legal foundation for 
three reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the Supreme Court of Canada in the Ontario Bill 30 case 
back in 1988 clearly indicated that denominational or 
confessional rights are grounded solely in section 93(1) of the 
constitution.  There is no other place in the constitution that 
protects them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, if denominational schools lack constitutional protection 
and are then exposed to scrutiny under the charter they will be 
struck down.  They will fall within the next day.  I can say that 
with some assurance because of the evidence presented before the 
joint committee.  In an Ontario case, the Elgin County case, 
which is a leading case in the area, a religious education 
program was struck down as being in violation of the religious 
provisions of the charter.  The same thing will happen if Quebec 
denominational schools are exposed to charter scrutiny without 
the protection of section 93(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whenever a province submits a request for a constitutional 
resolution or a constitutional amendment, it is a very serious 
proposition and requires due consideration but it does not 
require Parliament to immediately accept or reject the 
resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hearings of the special joint committee have established 
that there are deep reservations among a number of groups in 
Quebec as to the loss of their rights and as to the status of 
their rights for confessional schools in the event section 93(1) 
is repealed. 
I would propose that the House not act on the resolution at the 
present time in light of those concerns.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I commend the hon. member for his very thoughtful remarks. 
Although he was not a member of the committee it seems he has 
paid very close attention to the evidence presented to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member comment on the argument that predicates 
this application to extinguish subsections 1 through 4 of section 
93. That argument is that in order to establish linguistic school 
boards in Quebec, in order to modernize the Quebec school system 
so that it more clearly reflects the pluralistic nature of Quebec 
society, it is necessary to repeal the application of section 93 
to Quebec.  The hon. member addressed this in his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On further reflection I will quote from the judgment rendered by 
the Supreme Court of Canada in 1993 on the reference regarding 
the Quebec education act to further elucidate the point he made. 
In that judgment the learned justices said that what section 93 
guarantees is the right to dissent per se, not the right to 
certain legal institutions through which it may be exercised, 
i.e. school boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They furthermore say that there is thus no objection to the 
principle of redistributing the patrimony of the existing school 
boards for Protestants and Catholics among the linguistic 
boards provided the new institutions and their establishment 
maintain the right to dissent and to denominational schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally they go on to say at page 39 of their judgment that the 
framers of the constitution were wise enough not to determine 
finally the form of institutions as it is those very institutions 
which must be capable of change in order to adapt to the varying 
social and economic conditions of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, our highest court said that we do not have to 
maintain denominational school boards in order to establish 
linguistic school boards.  We do not have to eliminate section 93 
to establish linguistic school boards.  We do not have to abolish 
these confessional rights in order to do what the Quebec 
government chooses to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member comment on this decision which was 
rendered at the request of the Quebec government.  Does it 
support his contention that it can make the administrative 
changes it hopes to without extinguishing the confessional rights 
guaranteed in the constitution? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my understanding is that 
the Quebec government has the ability to legislate whatever 
changes it wants in the administration of the schools to allow 
for linguistic guarantees and so on.  Section 93 of the 
Constitution Act would not impair that ability whatsoever.  In my 
view the key issue is who is going to be responsible for 
educating our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This whole debate reminds me so much of the debate on the 
Newfoundland schools act. The question there was again who is 
going to define the kinds of schools that I send my children to. 
It comes back down to my way of thinking as an attempt by the 
provincial governments in both cases to gain ultimate control 
over their school systems so they can define clearly what is 
taught and how it will be taught. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that those school boards have difficulty accepting 
the notion that some parents may want to educate their children 
based on certain religious principles.  I think that is wrong. 
Education of children ultimately lies with the parents.  It 
should be their choice on the types of schools their children 
attend.  We should be broadening the notion of access to 
different types of schools rather than restricting it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are much more of a multicultural nation than we were have 
been in years gone by.  Our school systems should reflect that. 
Our school systems should teach the fact that Canada is a great 
place to live, that we are a tolerant nation and that we can be 
that by still subscribing to the basic religious beliefs we have. 
Those religious beliefs should not be undermined at all by the 
school systems to which we send our children.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly to me the issue is who is going to control the education

have or that the people of Quebec in this instance are going to 
have to educate their children in the religious schools that they 
have been guaranteed since Confederation in 1867.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
outraged and embarrassed to hear people so closed to what is truly 
going on in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about consensus;  not unanimity, but consensus. 
All political parties have supported it through a unanimous 
resolution in the National Assembly, the bishops have approved it, 
and now the member wants to tell us how to run the school system in 
Quebec and elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is 1997.  There is a situation that must be corrected, an 
error that must be put right to end a debate that has gone on for 
30 years. 
These dinosaurs across the floor are no help to me in Quebec in 
selling the system I want to live in.  This is why I am happy to 
say in the House that this amendment will be passed because it is 
important that it be passed.  It will be passed because we are 
going to show, despite what the Reform members are saying—and that 
is why they will always be in the opposition—that this is a 
flexible system. There is accommodation, and a Constitution is a 
fundamental law of a country that must represent all its citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we see what is now happening with the Reform Party, we 
may again ask ourselves what planet they are living on.  I ask the 
member and all Reform Party members to listen to what Quebec has 
said and to take a stand once and for all in order to resolve this 
problem and to help a people improve its situation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we had unanimous consent 
from the political elites in this country on the Charlottetown 
accord and we all know what happened when that went to the vote 
of the people.  It was rejected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to my friend across the way that we have a similar 
situation.  If there was that kind of support that he talks about 
in the province of Quebec for this change, why is it that consent 
from the people was not sought by the legislature in Quebec?  Why 
is it that the legislature in Quebec cannot demonstrate quite 
clearly that there is broad based support for this issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time as it does that, why can the legislature of 
Quebec not guarantee that the minority which will be affected by 
the elimination of this right is in agreement with this 
principle?  If we do not protect the rights of the minority, if 
we cannot demonstrate that we have a clear consensus from the 
minority in favour of this legislation, then we should not move 
ahead.  If we do move ahead, what guarantee is there for any of 
us in our constitution?  There is simply none.  The constitution 
is not worth the paper it is written on if it will not protect 
the rights of the minority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not be flippantly changing the constitution just to 
meet the whim of the day.  The constitution certainly is a 
living, breathing document but it must guarantee rights for all 
times and not just when it meets with our pleasure.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
will be a very short one.  I would like, however, to remind my hon. 
colleague from the Reform Party that what is going on here is not 
a debate on the place of religion in the schools.  I can understand 
the concerns of those who want religious teaching to continue in 
the schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But in Bill 109 on public education, Minister Marois set out 
guarantees which protect the wishes of parents. My hon. colleague 
from the Reform Party seems to be concerned about parental desire 
to keep religious schools.  These rights are guaranteed by the bill 
on public education and by section 41 of the Charter. 
It is a matter of administration.
